1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,800
And, uh, oh, thank you much, George.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,820
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:12,740
George was actually the first radio hipster to interview any subgeniuses officially.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,860
But, but.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,940
But, and that's a big but.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,640
Yeah, I know.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,820
No ifs.

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,660
But, uh, see, before that, it was all right-wing people that interviewed us for some reason.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,680
And they ate it up.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,780
That audience loved it.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,480
Now, I dare the audience of George to keep listening.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,620
If, uh, you have never heard, uh, subgenius radio programming before, I don't know, you probably ought to switch over to a commercial station now.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,060
Because what you're about to hear is, I don't know, it's probably too experimental for you.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,580
Too intense.

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:56,680
You'll probably be offended by the political and moral messages which make the anarchists and the greens look like the moral majority.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,580
Right.

17
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,800
But if you do listen, please try to listen in headphones.

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,360
And, uh, preferably tape it also.

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,320
Uh, otherwise you won't be able to believe later that you even heard it.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,180
Dear friends, because the sounds of the church are such pretty sounds.

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,400
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sets adjusted.

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,460
We're having operating difficulties.

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,040
Oh, this is terrible.

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,360
Oh, uh.

25
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:49,740
What?

26
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,260
Ish!

27
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:53,220


28
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:53,460
It's not.

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:53,460


30
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:53,480
It's a...

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,480

35
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,560
This is a hopeless situation.

36
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,500
FM in Dallas, Texas.

37
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,260
And I feel good.

38
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,400
The subconscious will listen and absorb this message.

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,620
Exactly.

40
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,960
Hey, what's going on here?

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,540
The subgenius.

42
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,880
Hour of swag.

43
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,540
Welcome to the end times, boys and girls.

44
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,620
We're going to shock shock the house with your brain to whirl.

45
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,680
Bob is getting down with you here tonight.

46
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,020
Bob is getting down to help your plight.

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,280
Bob is coming here to ease your strife.

48
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,360
Karma suckers let Bob into your life.

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,660
Big Bad Bob.

50
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,760
P.O.

51
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,120
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that light releases,

52
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,420
but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

53
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,920
Hoping your time is all time and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,220
Here is your host.

55
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,820
Who sits on the right hand side of Bob?

56
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,720
None other than...

57
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,660
The Reverend Ivan Stang.

58
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,760
The sexiest man on earth.

59
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,880
A young Adonis who's irresistible to women.

60
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,100
No, I can't wait a moment longer.

61
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,700
I've got to have sex with you.

62
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,660
You shall have sex.

63
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,840
You shall be rich.

64
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,620
Rich in limitless sexhood.

65
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,860
You've got me all worked up.

66
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,220
Stuff again out of bananas.

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,180
Psss.

68
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,040
Pss.

69
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,900
Ohh.

70
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,180
Bob is...

71
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:00,560
Sex.

72
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,860

75
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,800
Mobb.

00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,180

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:19,560


80
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,820
Bob is sex.

81
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,920
That's your key phrase.

82
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,900
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

83
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,340
We are controlling transmission.

84
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,000
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

85
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,100
Three, two, and one.

86
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,380
Now to continue with the tape recording.

87
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,920
Now to continue with the tape recording.

88
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,540
Well, it once was a man.

89
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,340
The world's greatest salesman.

90
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,760
And he had devised a plan.

91
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,480
To get the shackles from my feet.

92
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,900
I am, oh now he's gone.

93
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,760
A martyr for the cause.

94
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,540
Bob is my own.

95
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,300
And he's coming again.

96
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,940
Who knew that the first shot.

97
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,480
Was gonna be the last shot.

98
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,700
But he's got a hard driving pipe.

99
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,100
The gas smoke all through the night.

100
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,660
And I don't hate to be hurt.

101
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,480
But you don't know.

102
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,800
He's gonna keep on squinting.

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,280
Bob is my own.

104
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,080
And he's coming again.

105
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,800
Oh, ho!

106
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,980
Oh, yes, yes, yes, dear friends.

107
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,900
This is our Slack number 79.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,720
Believe it or not, first time in this time slot.

109
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,960
Nine o'clock Sunday nights.

110
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,820
And like I said, dear friends, you've got to listen to him.

111
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:18,880


112
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,200
And I'm gonna get to this thing in headphones.

113
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,480
I am dead flat serious.

114
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,140
You must do it.

115
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,100
This is Reverend Cleve Duncan, who's also keyboardist for the Del Fuego's.

116
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,100
And you can see him here two weeks from now.

117
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,440
He can save us from the many and bad.

118
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,040
With just a shot from his mighty sack.

119
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,820
If only he could make it back.

120
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,740
From the land of the dead.

121
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,240
Far until that happy day.

122
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,020
We can only drink and say Bob is my own.

123
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,920
And he's coming again.

124
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,200
I know he can make it.

125
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,320
Without him, we can't take it.

126
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,400
We'll lose the pieces of our minds to the big boys and the wimps.

127
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,100
Until the day that he comes back.

128
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,380
It will be a world.

129
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,740
We can't stop.

130
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,820
Bob is my own.

131
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,660
And he's coming again.

132
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,320
Bob is my own.

133
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,280
Bob is my own.

134
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,280
Bob is my own.

135
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,560
Bob is my own.

136
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,080
And he's coming again.

137
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,080
Dear friends, you can call 823-3-4.

138
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,300
And talk to the Will of Dogs about what's going on here.

139
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,520
Oh, a couple of the George audience have already called.

140
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,780
And so they wanted to hear some Devo.

141
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,320
You already have.

142
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,940
You've heard Devo in three different pieces already.

143
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,920
Believe it or not.

144
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,720
Just ones you didn't know about before.

145
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,020
Oh, yes.

146
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,540
Help me, somebody.

147
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,560
Thank you, Brother Cleave.

148
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,360
Our guests tonight, Hal Robbins, Paul Mavridis.

149
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,780
Oh, yes, dear friends.

150
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:40,100
Welcome once again to the horror and the love of the word.

151
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,360
Bob!

152
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:42,780
Bob!

153
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,540
Bob!

154
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,300
Bob!

155
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,180
Bob!

156
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,040
Bob!

157
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,360
Bob!

158
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:48,900
Bob!

159
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,140
Look, I don't care what you reporters think.

160
00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:00,640
I wasn't doing anything in the parked car with Reverend Anne, except discussing church.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,400
Oh, do we need to do that again?

162
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:02,800
Okay.

163
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,400
But it would be wrong.

164
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,620
That's the Clapper Loader, the best boy in the Dolly Grip who'll just bear on strike.

165
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,340
I'm sorry to tell you that, Mr. Stang.

166
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,180
but they say that this production can't move on until their demands are satisfied.

167
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,900
Well, let's go on with the press conference.

168
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,540
We were just discussing church business.

169
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,500
What about monkey business, Mr. Stang?

170
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,260
What about that little blonde we know you've been squiring around?

171
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:36,440
Reverend Ann is a devoted student of Bob and Connie.

172
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,080
She's a Connie-ite.

173
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,400
Where was Connie while all this was going on?

174
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,960
Just because she's not part of the Orthodox Stangian People's Covenant denomination of Dobbs Yeti resurrected,

175
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,400
that doesn't mean I won't let her work for the church.

176
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,680
And that's all she was doing in the back seat of the car with me up by the barn.

177
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,040
No further questions.

178
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,220
Outside of the radio station.

179
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,060
And I ended...

180
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,660
I don't know.

181
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,120
Nobody knows.

182
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,600
Go ahead.

183
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,500
Let Jerry Falwell take over the church of the subgenius.

184
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,400
That's fine with me.

185
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:16,860
But you see, that would be rather difficult since they're now a mixture of Pentecostals and Baptists and we are...

186
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:24,700
Are a hideous amalgam of cultish, gibbledy-gook nonsense.

187
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,880
Here, here now.

188
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,380
Let's not backslide.

189
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,800
Fight the good fight.

190
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,820
Oh, I quit.

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,640
I've had enough.

192
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,640
If I'm not allowed to brag about my extramarital affairs,

193
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,920
what did I perform for the church?

194
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,560
Even though that wasn't actually...

195
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:40,720
What?

196
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,200
Six, six, six, six, six.

197
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,120
It's going, amen.

198
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,860
According, everything's going fine.

199
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,720
No trouble.

200
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,980
It's over, friends.

201
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,400
Everything's fine.

202
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,000
We've got to get some money.

203
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,360
That dirty, perky, shark-backed, black, wharton, filibuster, wharton, perky...

204
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,080
Wharton.

205
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,160


206
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:09,380


207
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:09,380


208
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:09,380


209
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:09,380


210
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:09,380


211
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:09,380


212
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:09,380


213
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:09,380


214
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,260
A woman like to escort Reverend Stang out and lock him out of this place.

215
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,140
No, no, no, no.

216
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,060
You've got to see this guy for what he is.

217
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,700
He's a maniac out to rule the world.

218
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,880
What can I do to make you understand him?

219
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,820
I love you.

220
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,340
Have I already said, ah, yes, dear friends?

221
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,300
The rewards are worth the effort.

222
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,000
Ah, yes, dear friends.

223
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,780
The harvest.

224
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,400
There, okay, now it's...

225
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,100
Q, night of black shooting tape.

226
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,500
45-minute hour of slack intro.

227
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:45,920
Q.

228
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,720
And then we'll only have to do 15 more minutes worth of this.

229
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,240
My friends.

230
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,360
And you are...

231
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,740
No!

232
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:54,520
Ah!

233
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,580
Ah!

234
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,120
Ah!

235
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,780
Ah!

236
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,260
Ah!

237
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:57,680
Ah!

238
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,460
Ah!

239
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:58,520
Ah!

240
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:58,620
Ah!

241
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:58,620


242
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,320
Ah!

243
00:11:59,420 --> 00:11:59,940
Ah!

244
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,580
Ah!

245
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,020
Ah!

246
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,240
Ah!

247
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:02,460


248
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,420
Ah!

249
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:03,420


250
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:03,420


251
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,080
Ah!

252
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,760
Ah!

253
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,080


254
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,080


255
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,100
Ah!

256
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,100


257
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,100


258
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,100


259
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,100


260
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,160
Ah!

261
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,340


262
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,340


263
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,340


264
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,340


265
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,340


266
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,340


267
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,340


268
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,340


269
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:06,640
Ah!

270
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:07,560


271
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,720
Ah!

272
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,100


273
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,660
Ah!

274
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,080
Ah!

275
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:13,840


276
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,060
Ah!

277
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,680
Ah!

278
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,320
Ah!

279
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,020
Ah!

280
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:25,300
For those of you who are listening to the hour of slack for the first time.

281
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,420
In other words, this is something we don't do very often.

282
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:36,280
Maybe every 10 shows we play things that will somewhat explain the church of the subgenius,

283
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,780
if that is indeed possible.

284
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,180
And if you are...

285
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,400
indeed listening in headphones

286
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,940
and listening quietly

287
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,220
it will make a lot more sense

288
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,840
keep in mind dear friends that this is not

289
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,040
an imitation subgenius

290
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,020
church radio show

291
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,880
this is not some spin off

292
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,740
denomination it's not the butt naked

293
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,700
denomination praise butt

294
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,220
but the original

295
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,760
orthodox stangian mega

296
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,800
fist temple lodge of covenant

297
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,860
people's church of Dobbs Yeti

298
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,520
resurrected

299
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,840
praise Bob

300
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,440
so do call the Will of Dobbs at

301
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,080
823-7490

302
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,900
or 828-9500

303
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,640
if you value your soul

304
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,520
superior mutants

305
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,820
repent quit your job

306
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,460
slack off

307
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,160
the world ends tomorrow

308
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,560
and you may die

309
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,000
well no probably not

310
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,020
but whatever you do just keep listening

311
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,640
the end times is here

312
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,940
at last the step by step process

313
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,660
is revealed this is it

314
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,380
the only faith that promises

315
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,620
action thrills success

316
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,460
in sex and business

317
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,300
having all the guilt

318
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,820
but none of the guilt

319
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,260
to really great

320
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:17,020
but we'reeli

321
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,760
you deserve so much

322
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,580
and other than

323
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,000
this

324
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,000


325
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,460
reckless

326
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:23,460


327
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:23,460


328
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:23,800
without

329
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:23,800


330
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:23,800


331
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:23,800


332
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:23,800


333
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,420
for

334
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,480
I

335
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:25,480


336
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:25,480


337
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:25,480


338
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:25,480


339
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,300
a

340
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,840
read

341
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,780
I

342
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:36,580
act

343
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:36,580


344
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,380
press

345
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,740
You gotta let my people go, go, go

346
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,920
Or they're destroyed

347
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,680
Are we controlled by secret forces?

348
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,180
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

349
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,720
Do people think you're strange?

350
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,300
Do you?

351
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,080
Then you may be on the right track

352
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,920
Are you abnormal?

353
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,060
Then you are probably better than most people

354
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,300
Yes, your time shall triumph

355
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,020
But you've tried everything

356
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,140
You ain't seen nothing yet

357
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,960
Learn to think big

358
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,040
Develop the tricks of length extension

359
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,480
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life

360
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,620
Stand direct for your own abnormality

361
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,360
Get sack and fall again

362
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,720
And

363
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:35,900
And

364
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,800
The student of Dobbs' training is practically forced

365
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,300
To bring his strangest desires into rampaging life

366
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,220
I used to get embarrassed of all my glass madness

367
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,140
Now I get paid

368
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,800
The pinks pay me fabulous sums of money

369
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,120
For what they used to put me in jail for

370
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,000
Thanks to Bob

371
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,380
Dobbs has seen to it that he exercises this abnormality

372
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,900
To do otherwise, he teaches, would be not to be

373
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,380
Nothing short of spiritual suicide

374
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,540
Oh, oh, oh

375
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,140
Bob is a way of life to millions

376
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,620
Now, the rest of them don't even know

377
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,760
He's the one true living slack master

378
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,760
With the spiritual know-how to help you bash through

379
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,300
The locked doorway to financial heaven

380
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,300
He is the one real shortcut to slack

381
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,780
He is the one real shortcut to slack

382
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,360
Now, see another dimension on your TV

383
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,000
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer

384
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,920
Become physically attractive overnight

385
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,580
Attain status, luck, prosperity

386
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,840
By blowing them off

387
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,200
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior

388
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,520
To explore new ways of going over the edge

389
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,880
And coming with you to the end of the world

390
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,440
Right back

391
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,920
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own

392
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,260
To help you create the highest possible earnings

393
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,420
From the psychodynamics of abnormality

394
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,580
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around

395
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:26,060
And channel them into an illusion of creativity

396
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,120
That will fool normals and get you sex

397
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,160
You've only got to find Yunus

398
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,380
So wanted to accompany the

399
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,540
I malign that

400
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:39,540


401
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:39,540


402
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:39,540


403
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,120
Talk about that amusement park

404
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,060
We'll never be able to raise the money for that amusement park

405
00:17:46,060 --> 00:18:05,860
Sure can go to Westward Park

406
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,880
Chilling in a cafe.

407
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,660
Yes, and...

408
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,860
Listen to that reaction.

409
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,880
You know, the shower of razors,

410
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,600
and a lot of fun in the funhouse.

411
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,440
Of course, my favorite, the distorto chamber.

412
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,260
It seems there are some people who have been locked in there since 1944, but...

413
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,720
A six-million-year cycle will end in 1998.

414
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,560
Dobbs sees the world entering a new aeon,

415
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,400
which, in a few years,

416
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,420
will bring more wondrous and miraculous change

417
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,920
and carnage, insanity, and destruction

418
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,420
than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.

419
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,120
Bob brings a new destiny for America,

420
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,340
a time of cataclysmic economic change

421
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,860
that will offer untold riches and power for those in the know,

422
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,300
while billions of deserving conspiracy dupes

423
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,020
fry in hell on Earth.

424
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,800
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled by Bob,

425
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,980
will usher in a spiritual rebirth

426
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,440
and a cascade of astounding mysteries,

427
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,740
supernatural riches,

428
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,460
and a restoration of lost psychic abilities

429
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:24,120
that will totally transform the lives of those who dare to seek them and pay for them.

430
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,200
That's right.

431
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,900
You're lucky to live in the end time.

432
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,520
Here's more money, Bob!

433
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,060
Here's six, six, six.

434
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,760
Anybody knows that.

435
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,000
Hello, you're on the air.

436
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,060
Oh, more money?

437
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,460
Hey, yeah.

438
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,380
Do you have a short question, please?

439
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,280
Hey, solid by solid.

440
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:45,640
Hey.

441
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,260
Repeat.

442
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,500
Repeat your question.

443
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,820
Um, I just had a few brief questions.

444
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,820
My name's Jesus.

445
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,380
And, um...

446
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,720
Hey, I've heard of you.

447
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,560
I've read your book.

448
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,780
Hey, Jesus, how you doing?

449
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,960
Yeah, my favorite part was where they...

450
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,420
It's autobiographical, right?

451
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,260
Where they kill you.

452
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:02,820
Yeah, ugly girl.

453
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,660
They handled you to the, uh...

454
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,040
That's my book.

455
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:05,820
Yeah.

456
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,080
Um, well, I just had a couple of questions, philosophical.

457
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,100
Number one.

458
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,020
Um, if you were traveling in a car at the speed of light,

459
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,220
and, um, you turn on the headlights, what would happen?

460
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,060
Let's get on with it.

461
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,360
You'll crash into your own headlights, so I would, uh...

462
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,180
As light solidifies, it becomes of a texture...

463
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,500
Wow, get on with it, then.

464
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,000
...blocks of matter, which will crash in your radiator and damage the front of your chest.

465
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,400
Headlights?

466
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,880
H-E-A-T-E.

467
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,320
Okay.

468
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,480
And, um...

469
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:34,840
One more.

470
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,240
I-I-I was looking through, um, A Guide to the Subgenius or something like that.

471
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,900
A Guide to the Subgenius?

472
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,780
Or it was, like, a subgenius book?

473
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,640
It's not the new edition from Science History.

474
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,900
No, that's a counterfeit, uh...

475
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,840
It said in there, one passage, that too much is better than not enough.

476
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,720
Always better than not enough.

477
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Is that true with hemorrhoids?

478
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,180
That is true with everything.

479
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,640
No, it's never true.

480
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,160
Bob Dobbs, uh, said it.

481
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,580
Uh, I believe it.

482
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,420
That settles it.

483
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,180
Yeah?

484
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,800
One must ask oneself, what is enough in the case you mention?

485
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,440
It's words to live by for every young teenager out there.

486
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:14,300
You should be concerned with, uh, other things, like the fact that this area is going to be barely inhabitable in 20 years,

487
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,480
and most places will be a lot worse off.

488
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,080
That's right.

489
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,920
What are you going to do?

490
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,480
Too much ultraviolet light is always better than not enough ultraviolet rays.

491
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,900
It's going to be hotter and wetter, and there's not going to be, uh, much water.

492
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,340
...walking organic mutants.

493
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,840
Yeah, too much poverty and horror is always better than not enough.

494
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,660
Poverty and horror.

495
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,720
Wise up!

496
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,160
They're out to get you.

497
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,520
The difference are being silenced by a global conspiracy.

498
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,400
Weird men arise!

499
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,460
Find out who they are and how to smash them!

500
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,060
You probably already knew that the U.S. government is a sham.

501
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,620
Something prompt up there for you to blame.

502
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,960
But did you know that the real powers that be are not even people?

503
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,340
That they are actually shambling?

504
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,340
Unbelievable?

505
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,840
Unmentionable?

506
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,840
Unthinkable?

507
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,620
Things?

508
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,740
For the first time in man's history, I, uh, I'm president.

509
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,520
Ooh.

510
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:21,280
And, and, and, and I can do this with dash and daring do.

511
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,240
No.

512
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,640
You're too old.

513
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,880
You're out of touch.

514
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,760
Huh.

515
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,020
I don't think I'm out of touch.

516
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,840
Asked for too old?

517
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,580
Well, I have a very good memory about...

518
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,680
all the things back in my life.

519
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,140
For example, I can remember...

520
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,600
Senator Benjamin Hill in 1878.

521
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,040
When we were less than 70 years old.

522
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:45,740
Heh.

523
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,040
Ooh.

524
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,040
Good times and bad.

525
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,900
Ronald Reagan.

526
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,640
You can see and understand the America of dirty streets and poor people.

527
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:03,020
The problem isn't being poor. The problem, the problem is, uh, uh, uh, money.

528
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,360
And...

529
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
So, poverty isn't, uh...

530
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:06,780
Uh...

531
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,560
Juh...

532
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,240
Sss...

533
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,000
Uh...

534
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,380
Juh...

535
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,160
Uh...

536
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,380
Uh...

537
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:10,380


538
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:10,440
Sss...

539
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,080
I...

540
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,060
Sss...

541
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,980
Uh...

542
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,060
Uh...

543
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,520
Okay.

544
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,860
I'm supposed to be the big reactionary.

545
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,740
Okay.

546
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,360
Alright.

547
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,580
What, what people do you think you represented?

548
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,000
The John Birch Society was praising you.

549
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,580
Oh, yes.

550
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,180
Alright.

551
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,740
The John Birch Society.

552
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,260
Sure.

553
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,240
Milton Friedman.

554
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,060
Certainly.

555
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,040
The far right.

556
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,760
Alright.

557
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,680
As a matter of fact...

558
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:33,780
Uh, uh...

559
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:33,780


560
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:39,580
Uh, a few Republican panaceas, myself, and people like myself, organized a task force.

561
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,100
People outside government and inside.

562
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:43,760
Uh...

563
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:50,660
Well, this little group gathered and we very carefully would open the car door with the

564
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:56,300
window rolled down, shove the man's arm across the window, and then break it.

565
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,560
The backbone of America.

566
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,120
And then break it over the window.

567
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,440
Uh...

568
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,960
And then the pressure came on.

569
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,700
That hidden longing came out and, uh...

570
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,120
Gunshot.

571
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,420
Gunshot.

572
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,060
Gunshot.

573
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,180
Gunshots.

574
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,800
And so forth.

575
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:22,480
Oh, oh, what a lovely piece of tape editing there by Douglas Kahn.

576
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,920
Isn't it incredible?

577
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:50,740
Uh...

578
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,440
I just...

579
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,240
You know, we both recommend Doug...

580
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,500
Thanks, Doug.

581
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,320
I was like, oh, careful, isn't this hell?

582
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:55,320


583
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,740
And now he the

584
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,280
씨

585
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:08,900
That's right, Bob t-shirts that you can get by mail from the Weeping Cyclops Insignia

586
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,240
Company serving the public since God knows when.

587
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,040
And their P.O.

588
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,960
Box number, you got that pencil ready?

589
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
This is their P.O.

590
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,400
Box number, not ours, but this is where you can order these shirts, is P.O.

591
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:31,500
Box 595-148 Dallas, Texas 75359-5148.

592
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,720
Thanks, Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company for supporting KNON.

593
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,000
And dear friends, you can actually win one of these shirts.

594
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,220
That's right, we're announcing a contest at this moment.

595
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:53,900
And the first three of you to call the Will of Dobbs here at 823-7490 or 828-9500 with

596
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,400
the answers to the following question will win a subgenius t-shirt.

597
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,140
Now, here's the question.

598
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:08,760
In what year, according to Dobbs' prophecy in the Book of the Subgenius, will the Omicron

599
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,220
Epsilon time intersection occur?

600
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,380
Eh?

601
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:22,000
Now get out your Book of the Subgenius, friends, and call 823-7490 or 828-9500 with that answer.

602
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,320
Or you can write to our box number, but it's first come, first serve.

603
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,120
So you know, we might only get one call tonight with the right answer.

604
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
In which case, you ought to write.

605
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,780
But write quick.

606
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,040
So we get it right quick, you know what I mean?

607
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,620
And the rest of you are saying now, Omicron Epsilon time intersection?

608
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,860
What is that anyway?

609
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,400
Well, geez, man, it's only the worst crisis this universe will ever face.

610
00:26:54,380 --> 00:27:00,340
Of course, many people think about X-Day, the arrival of the men from Planet X on X-Day,

611
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,820
1998.

612
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,480
Oh, that might be the end of this planet.

613
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:09,000
But what happens at the time intersection will determine whether the entire universe

614
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:15,840
ends then at that point, that year that you're supposed to call in with, or continue for

615
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,580
as long again as it has already existed.

616
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,700
So again, this is not X-Day.

617
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,360
The answer is not 1998.

618
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,580
Don't even bother with that.

619
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,620
No, no.

620
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,940
No, we're not talking about X-Day.

621
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,720
You didn't listen.

622
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,640
You've been calling in.

623
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,080
Or you can write to the Church of the Subgenius.

624
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,920
Also, you just write us for information if you want to get some free material.

625
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:49,580
At Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

626
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:54,200
That's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

627
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,620
And the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company, again, is Box 59514.

628
00:27:59,600 --> 00:27:59,600


629
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:05,160
8 in Dallas, Texas 75359.

630
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,620
So let's see who's going to win.

631
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,240
Let's go.

632
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,360
Let's go.

633
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,580
Let's go.

634
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:31,700
Let's go.

635
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:31,880
Let's go.

636
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,100
Let's go.

637
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,080
Let's go.

638
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:39,940
Let's go.

639
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,060
Let's go.

640
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:40,080
Let's go.

641
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,160
Let's go.

642
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,420
Now friends, we've already had ten calls that said 1998.

643
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,680
We've got one winner.

644
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,420
One winner.

645
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,320
Who is that one?

646
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,160
Brian Maddux.

647
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,400
Old praise Reverend Brian.

648
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,480
But you're going to have to get your book of the subgenius and look real close.

649
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,640
I'm not going to give you a hint what page it's on.

650
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,220
It's in there.

651
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,560
There it is.

652
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,120
Slack.

653
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,780
What is it?

654
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,540
Well, if you have to ask, you'll probably never know.

655
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:14,600
You were born with original slack and an infinite supply of it, but the conspiracy has most

656
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,200
of it now.

657
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:19,440
They don't even know what it is, but that hasn't stopped them from stealing it away.

658
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:25,180
How do you think you ended up a slave to their so-called work?

659
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,540
True slack is, by definition, insubstantial.

660
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:37,260
indefinable. It is a kind of direct perception unfettered by common sense. It is not merely

661
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:46,160
laziness. It is rather a kind of active sloth. Slack in its pure form makes happiness seem like

662
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:53,940
agony by comparison. Next to slack, the nirvana known to mystics and saints is like endless

663
00:29:53,940 --> 00:30:01,580
torment. Slack is different for each person, although for much of the world, slack is nothing

664
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:11,640
more than a good meal. One might call it something for nothing. But the normals, the mediocratons,

665
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:18,960
the somnambulacks, and pseudo-sub-slans have tried to make it something which we've been led

666
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,920
to believe we must work to buy. It is this yearning.

667
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:38,720
The normals have tried to make it something for slackness separates us from them. The human may live out his entire life in a grinding cycle of slacklessness, his hours consumed by meaningless toil, interspersed with meaningless leisure.

668
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:53,400
Yet he never feels cheated. He thinks it's natural. Perhaps we should pity them, but face it, most people are venal jerks, half-witted cattle racing each other to be

669
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:53,920
first.

670
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,600
The normals are the first of the slaughterhouse, stampeding you along with them.

671
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:10,600
And there's something else that a true subgenius knows, Joe. When we talk about the conspiracy, I know that you're all cultured, I know you're all literary, I know you're used to thinking in circles, but there's one thing you should know.

672
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,940
The conspiracy is no metaphor.

673
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:23,580
Joe, when we talk about the conspiracy, are we discussing some literary poetic monster?

674
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,040
Say no!

675
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:24,900
No!

676
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,680
Say no!

677
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:26,780
No!

678
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,140
Say no!

679
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,000
No!

680
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,920
No, we're not joking! We're talking about a living, breathing, firing, and giving a strength that wants to consume you!

681
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,960
That wants to take away your slack, children!

682
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,100
Are we going to let them take away your slack?

683
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:39,700
No!

684
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,620
Say no!

685
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,420
No!

686
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,360
Say no!

687
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,140
No!

688
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,220
Tell me something! Who stands in the way of the conspiracy?

689
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,140
I don't know!

690
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,800
Who?

691
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:48,860
Who?

692
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,860
I can't hear you joking!

693
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,140
Who?

694
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:51,560
Who?

695
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,680
Bob!

696
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,300
Bob!

697
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:53,600
Bob!

698
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,180
Bob!

699
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:54,540
Bob!

700
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,220
That was the Pope of all New York!

701
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,240
It's 1-4-0-3-0-6, so think about it!

702
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:05,520
When you cast your mojo patches, when you ride through Dallas, Texas, when you think about it!

703
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,960
Think about it!

704
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,100
Think about it!

705
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,880
$1!

706
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,640
$1!

707
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:12,820
$1!

708
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,060
$1!

709
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,000
$1!

710
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,400
$1!

711
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,000
$1!

712
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,020
$1!

713
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,500
This is Dr. Onan's Wotan Band!

714
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:20,500
$1!

715
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,220
Bob!

716
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:21,940
Bob!

717
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,260
Bob!

718
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:22,560
Bob!

719
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:22,740
Bob!

720
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,220
Bob!

721
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:23,260
Bob!

722
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:23,380
Bob!

723
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:23,640
Bob!

724
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:23,920


725
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:24,900
Bob!

726
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,660
Bob!

727
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:26,980


728
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,180
Bob!

729
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,300
Bob!

730
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:29,360
Bob!

731
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,420
Bob!

732
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,420


733
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,420


734
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,420


735
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,420


736
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,420


737
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,420


738
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,420


739
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,420


740
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,420


741
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,420


742
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,420


743
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,420


744
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,880
Bob!

745
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:30,880


746
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,580
Bob!

747
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:31,580


748
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:49,000
Did you get that?

749
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,120
Thank you!

750
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,440
Thank you!

751
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:53,920
Thank you!

752
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


753
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


754
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


755
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


756
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


757
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


758
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


759
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


760
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


761
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


762
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


763
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


764
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


765
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


766
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


767
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:53,920


768
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,640
What do you really think?

769
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,980
When you read that spin magazine to find out about those critical independent singles,

770
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,860
did you get that spin magazine from the priest?

771
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,220
Say no!

772
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,040
Absolutely not!

773
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,560
The next rule of the Church of the Sogenius is that the Church of the Sogenius will help

774
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,360
you pull wool over your own eyes.

775
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,280
You see, ladies and gentlemen, ever since you were a little bitty baby, you have been

776
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,980
sold other people's wool.

777
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,900
You've been sold your parents' wool, your church or synagogue's wool, your school's

778
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,720
wool, your college's wool, your girlfriend or boyfriend's wool, your husband's wife's

779
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:26,900
wool.

780
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:33,260
But here we want you to pull your own wool over your eyes and relax in the safety trove

781
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,100
around your own illusions.

782
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,460
The reason we want you to do this is that once you've got that wool over your eyes and

783
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,720
you're immersed in those illusions, in five minutes you'll be so bored, you'll start

784
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,980
to know what God wants you to do.

785
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,640
You'll start thinking for yourself.

786
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,820
Thank you.

787
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:03,220
Goodness gracious, what a simply horrible patchwork of noise that Church of the Sogenius

788
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:03,520
is.

789
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:10,720
I listen every week to gather evidence and ammunition for the citizens for normalcy.

790
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:15,100
Let me tell you, we're not going to get those Sogeniuses.

791
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,780
We're going to get them right in the gonads.

792
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

793
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,280
I didn't mean to say that.

794
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,880
I don't use words like that.

795
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:30,920
This tape, all about Satanism, drugs and rock and roll, is proof positive that this

796
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:36,120
so-called church is going to send the world to heck in a handbasket.

797
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:42,680
All those demented Beelzebub kissing hop heads make me want to toss my Nestle's dollhouse

798
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:49,040
cookies with their talk of buckets of pills from that low-life pusher J.R. Bob Dobbs.

799
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,540
Why, they're so high on drugs that they can't even keep any continuity.

800
00:34:53,820 --> 00:35:00,260
Too many children listen to these tapes and subscribe to the insane doctrines of the

801
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,300
Sogenius Foundation.

802
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:08,960
They're led down a deceptive road to what these weirdos call slack, like that heathenist

803
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,320
idea of Nirvana.

804
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:16,100
I say that slack should be taken up like the excess yarn in my knitting and pulled until

805
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,040
it sees the light of a normal day like the rest of us do.

806
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,520
So what should any decent-minded American do?

807
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:22,520


808
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,200
What can they do when faced with one of these zombies for Bob?

809
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,700
Well, first off, give them a bath in Pine Sol.

810
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,120
They usually stink to high heaven.

811
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,880
Then ship them off to the nearest normally accredited deprogrammer.

812
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:43,540
Well, they'll get bombarded with enough People magazines, arid extra-dry deodorant, and Regis

813
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:48,880
Philbin fan club material so they won't be able to think anymore the way it should be.

814
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,500
Then they'll feed them real dogma about the glory of the world.

815
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,940
The stories of the home shopping club, Wingo, Zingo, and the evils of Mandingo.

816
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:05,720
We cannot stand by while our standards and principles are made light of by these possessed

817
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,160
fools.

818
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,820
Normals of the world unite.

819
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,280
Oh, dear friends, and quit calling in with those contest answers.

820
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,700
We got all three winners.

821
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,640
I can't believe it.

822
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,380
Dave Bales.

823
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:16,840
Hey, guys.

824
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,320
Great.

825
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,660
Douglas Hooper and, yeah, Reverend Brian.

826
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,060
So...

827
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,680
And that was the Citizens for Normalcy tape you just heard.

828
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,280
Thank you.

829
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:37,440
Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocratons, these pink boys, these box-dwelling Barbies and Kens?

830
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:42,020
These normals who have made normality the norm?

831
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,700
Pinks.

832
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:52,400
Pinks are but living stereotypes, insensate meat puppets and mere food tubes who lack

833
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,840
and fear the spark of originality that ignites every fucking soul.

834
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:03,960
Within every person, there's some good and there's some bad.

835
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,560
And it's a choice.

836
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,860
You choose whether you want to love or hate that person.

837
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:17,340
And for myself, I just choose to hate most of them.

838
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,520
Whoo!

839
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,040


840
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,540
Whoo!

841
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:20,980
Whoo!

842
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:27,440
Now, when a subgenius says that he hates, what kind of a hate is he talking about, children?

843
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,720
Is he talking about your average run-of-the-mill hate?

844
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,240
Like, oh, I just hate Reagan.

845
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,900
That's pathetic!

846
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,840
Or even worse, the nampy-pampy pitiful little...

847
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,960
I just hate my...

848
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,580
I just hate myself.

849
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,280
No!

850
00:37:53,980 --> 00:38:01,220
What we talk about when we talk about hate is an all-consuming, an all-encompassing,

851
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,660
an all-pervasive hate!

852
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,600
An infinite hate!

853
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,220
A hate that knows no bounds!

854
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,120
A hate that extends to the very end of all known universes!

855
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,680
A hate!

856
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,540
A hate as black as outer space itself!

857
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,940
We're talking about the nampy-pampy pitiful little...

858
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:20,940


859
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,860
We're talking about an all-consuming hate!

860
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,760
And who is this hate directed at, children?

861
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:45,500
There are certain men whose repugnance and hideousness is so all-pervailing...

862
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,060
That's it!

863
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,520
That's it!

864
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,900
We call them...

865
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,940
We call them...

866
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:55,040
We have a special label for these men.

867
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,120
We call them...

868
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,580
Idols of hate!

869
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,260
Now, what is an example of what we call an idol of hate?

870
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,540
What is an example of what we call an idol of hate?

871
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,480
What is an example of what we call an idol of hate?

872
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,040
One such example of what we call an idol of hate...

873
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,500
Is?

874
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,920
Is old Mr. That's-Just-His-Royal-Hate.

875
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:19,920


876
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,260
We've got a lot of these in Arkansas.

877
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,380
The, that's just his way, redneck.

878
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,540
Oh, you mean he's totally obnoxious and sadistic?

879
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,020
Well, that's just his way.

880
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,740
Oh, you mean he's splitting your face open?

881
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,820
Well, that's just the way he is.

882
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,740
Oh, did he try to genocide an entire race and destroy half the world?

883
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,680
That's just his way.

884
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,360
Well, I think that's valid, I accept that.

885
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,680
But this is just...

886
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,320
This is just my way.

887
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:05,760
That I enjoy bathing in the blood of just-his-way people.

888
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:15,740
That's just the way I am, is that I just enjoy making lampshades of the flesh of just-his-way people.

889
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,120
That's just the way I am.

890
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,540
And if you can't dig that, I guess you're just on some kind of judgmental trip.

891
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,640
But it's, you just have to let the hate flow.

892
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,600
It's a very, very beautiful process.

893
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,520
You just, you just let it happen.

894
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,820
And what are some of the other, what we call idols of hate?

895
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,140
What are some of the other idols of hate?

896
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,540
What are you, idols of hate?

897
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,520
I think you know who we're talking about.

898
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,900
Mr. Pinkboy, sir.

899
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,840
Mr. Conspiracy, sir.

900
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,320
Mr. Closet Nazi Corporate Executive, sir.

901
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:01,520
Mr. Filthy Rich Mind Control TV Evangelist.

902
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,600
Hope you don't even know what we're talking about.

903
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,060
You were just clicking through the channels.

904
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,280
But by God, you gonna hear me now.

905
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,580
Sir.

906
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,680
Mr. Secular Trevenist.

907
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,680
Hey!

908
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,500
Treveno is launching Van Dobbs from public school system.

909
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:29,800
They won't even, they won't even teach Bob in the public schools anymore.

910
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,740
But I think we know who's gonna have the last lesson, don't we?

911
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:38,720
Yes!

912
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:45,140
Now, what kind of,

913
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:45,900
Oh!

914
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,900
But you can't compare yourself to any kind of human hate.

915
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,380
Well, you could say, oh!

916
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,700
Oh, I hate as much as John Smith does.

917
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,180
Or, or, well, I hate as much as, as Mary Jones hates.

918
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,540
You can't compare yourself to any human hate.

919
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:08,680
You've got to compare yourself to the divine hate of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

920
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,820
If you could realize for one femtosecond,

921
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,580
how much this man hates you.

922
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,240
Oh, that was J.R. Hyperkleets in Boston.

923
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,640
Why are you getting out of his head?

924
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,800
Just like a drive-in movie.

925
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,140
Out by the scenic pond.

926
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,640
Oh, great.

927
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,440
Tonight they're showing Terms of Endearment.

928
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,060
I need no conspiracy as much as it beats me.

929
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,640
But I mean, Bob will get them.

930
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,560
Just you wait and see.

931
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,800
They think they're all Frank Capra, but they're just a bunch of geeks.

932
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:54,760
Monday night is football, and Tuesday night is bridge.

933
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,000
Let's all go do the laundry and check what's in the fridge.

934
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,340
Christmas, Easter, Halloween, it's enough to drive you nuts.

935
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,600
But the long, senseless march into slacklessness may soon come to an end.

936
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,220
Oh, it won't be without a bitter struggle.

937
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,280
But at least there is hope.

938
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:18,980
For in this, the twentieth century, we have seen the coming of a savior.

939
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,100
A beacon of slack.

940
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,520
A banner behind which we may unite.

941
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:33,000
It is the coming of J.R. Bob Dobbs and his mighty Church of the Subgenius.

942
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,480
...do with it whatsoever.

943
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,480
...as to whether man will destroy himself...

944
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,840
Yes, the animal kingdom.

945
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,780
...from the face of this planet.

946
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,600
Now that's a very discerning comment.

947
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,340
...this is man's destiny or potential.

948
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:53,180
You've lost you enthusiasm for your job, and you think you're bored and you're willing to quit, and you're about ready to walk away.

949
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,320
Wait a minute!

950
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,260
Thank you.

951
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:45,880
Thank you.

952
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,060
Thank you.

953
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,280
Thank you.

954
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:55,880
Thank you.

955
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,920
Thank you.

956
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:56,700
Thank you.

957
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,540
Thank you.

958
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,180
Thank you.

959
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,100
What?

960
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,360
But, but, but,

961
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,380
but what's wrong with hate?

962
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,820
No, that wasn't actually,

963
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,100
what?

964
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,860
Anybody knows that?

965
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,520
Yes, the six, six, six club

966
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,820
had got a new host now.

967
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,900
Those six, uh,

968
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,520
six friends had better

969
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,040
come on.

970
00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:02,700
pull in their horns and, well, you know, they're just, they're out of control.

971
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,460
Are you serious?

972
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:10,360
The psychopaths of the church, they can't touch us in old-time hierarchical.

973
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:15,680
We're the original fishers of wallets for J.R. Bob Dobbs.

974
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:18,400
I actually have Bob's autograph.

975
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:24,460
Hello, I'm Floyd T. Reprothel, general manager of this radio station.

976
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:29,660
We've been getting lots of support for our programming from you listeners out there, and we're grateful.

977
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,520
We especially appreciate your comments on the subgenius show at 4.30 on Saturday mornings.

978
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,780
Believe me, we intend to do something about those comments.

979
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:42,700
As of now, the so-called subgenius show is on probation.

980
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,660
We'll be monitoring the show closely for irregularities and inaccuracies,

981
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:53,420
as well as for the allegedly offensive portions of the program that apparently were too intense for some of our listeners.

982
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,960
Because we care.

983
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,600
We care about your patronage.

984
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,880
What about the slosh fund?

985
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,580
What about the secret photos of Stang and My Little Pony?

986
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:10,560
What I do with my spare time and off hours?

987
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,500
I mean, a preacher is a human being, too.

988
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:18,680
I can't be expected to stand there at that pulpit 24 hours a day.

989
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:24,140
I'm sorry, you have to be expected to be in the public eye, constantly scrutinized.

990
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:24,760
That's fine.

991
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:30,140
I don't think I should be docked all that pay just because of one dream.

992
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,000
Now, Mr. Stang...

993
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:42,040
Mr. Stang, could you please turn to page 27 in your budget here?

994
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,340
That's the revised standard version.

995
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,500
Now, this is all in code, is it not?

996
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,660
Self-esteem.

997
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,160
Well, it depends on what you call code.

998
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,760
So, when it refers here to He-Man, that's actually...

999
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:55,620
That's actually you, correct?

1000
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:00,560
No, He-Man is the senator from West Virginia, as a matter of fact.

1001
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,100
Oh, I don't expect you to believe that.

1002
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,180
Are you sure you're on the same page here?

1003
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,160
Oh, okay, right, I've got it.

1004
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,280
Okay, 27, go ahead.

1005
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,140
The sum here is $63 million.

1006
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,440
Where was that supposed to be delivered to?

1007
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,300
Uh...

1008
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,040
Well, let me consider...

1009
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,520
Let me consult with my lawyer.

1010
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,980
You know, I can't expect to remember every tiny little detail.

1011
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:36,720
Mr. Stang, are you familiar with the Drummond Amendment, sir?

1012
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,300
Just a moment, your honor.

1013
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,320
Senator, my client wishes to read a statement into the record at this point.

1014
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,360
Very well.

1015
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,760
I did not and will not ever admit...

1016
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,140
Could you speak a little louder, Mr. Stang?

1017
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,240
...to the specific dream sequence...

1018
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:55,880
Go closer to the microphone.

1019
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,820
...that these Dream Monitor reporters have recorded of this alleged encounter,

1020
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,060
which I assure you is absolutely unsexual in nature,

1021
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,880
between Reverend Mandy, Reverend Ann, and myself.

1022
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,420
Just answer the question.

1023
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,400
Are you now or have you ever been a member of the human race?

1024
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:21,360
No, I can absolutely deny, categorically deny...

1025
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,400
...the human race.

1026
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,140
Mr. Stang...

1027
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:24,880
Mr. Stang...

1028
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:24,920
Mr. Stang...

1029
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:24,920


1030
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:24,920


1031
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:24,920


1032
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:24,920


1033
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:24,920


1034
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,040
He's got an extra tailbone back there,

1035
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,660
and my brother has a supernumerary nipple.

1036
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,480
I have proof...

1037
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,320
We have the nipple and the cockaxe on display as exhibit means.

1038
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,260
No one is completely informed of human genes,

1039
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:43,460
except perhaps our Yeti cousins in the Himalayas.

1040
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,680
In the Himalayas.

1041
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,180
And so you see, that's what Mr. Stang testified,

1042
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,460
and that's what made him America's sweetheart.

1043
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,360
We have a marvelous show today, folks.

1044
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,360
Our very special guest is loved and admired.

1045
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,040
He's been a great humanitarian.

1046
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,820
Please welcome one of America's oldest and most respected kids,

1047
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,060
Ivan Stang.

1048
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,860
Besides balancing with Michael...

1049
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:10,020
...is a man who many of you may have already seen on television shows,

1050
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,520
such as the Lou Gordon Show,

1051
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,440
Tom Snyder's Tomorrow Show,

1052
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,620
To Tell the Truth,

1053
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,900
and What's My Line?

1054
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,060
He's been the subject of articles in Motor Trend,

1055
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,940
Newsweek, Automotive News,

1056
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:21,920
Penthouse Magazine,

1057
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,340
and newspapers all over the world.

1058
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,640
He is the only man in all of the sales fields

1059
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,080
to have a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.

1060
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:34,280
He is, simply speaking, the world's greatest salesman,

1061
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:37,920
and has held that distinction every year for over a decade.

1062
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,380
He is the head of the Subgenius Foundation, Inc.,

1063
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:47,060
an organization that markets its own unique system of sales training aids.

1064
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,460
He has been nominated for the Horatio Alger Award

1065
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,340
for his outstanding rise from poverty to the top in the business world.

1066
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:54,340


1067
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:58,360
And Simon & Schuster Publishers will publish his new book entitled

1068
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,780
The Book of the Subgenius.

1069
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,600
If there is anybody who has created a more enviable reputation

1070
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,740
in person-to-person, one-at-a-time, belly-to-belly selling than

1071
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,660
J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1072
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,500
I defy you to name him.

1073
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:18,720
What you are about to hear is truly an experience with

1074
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,440
Bob.

1075
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,540
Thank you.

1076
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,340
Thank you.

1077
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:23,140


1078
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,540
All right.

1079
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,220
How are you?

1080
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:29,280
How are you?

1081
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,180
How are you?

1082
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,620
I like you.

1083
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,660
I like you.

1084
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:37,980
There's a balloon for you.

1085
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,100
I give balloons away, too.

1086
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,460
Thank you.

1087
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,400
Thanks for coming.

1088
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,980
Thanks for coming, baby.

1089
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,920
Pass a few of these on.

1090
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,000
These pins here that I'm giving out,

1091
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,120
I think are three of the strongest,

1092
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,860
strongest words you'll ever see in your life.

1093
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,540
I like you.

1094
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,900
I give them to everybody that's...

1095
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,840
Listen to those swinging love corpses.

1096
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:16,200
Oh, that rare, rare tape of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself

1097
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:21,020
is from Reverend Frank from the round table discussion

1098
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,040
Clench in Arizona.

1099
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,560
I'm sure you hope we still have our old audience

1100
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,340
now that we've moved to prime time.

1101
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,520
I'm assuming that we may pick up some of George's folks,

1102
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:42,960
his new wave experimental rock and roll audience.

1103
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,960
But on the other hand,

1104
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:51,520
we probably don't really want all of George DeMarc's audience

1105
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,100
because all of his friends are in the same room.

1106
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,100


1107
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,100


1108
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,100


1109
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:56,100
Although probably half of them are potential subgeniuses

1110
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,380
or at least potential undeclared closet subgeniuses at best,

1111
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,220
which are the ones we're interested in.

1112
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,120
Probably the other half are nothing but young pinks

1113
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,300
who sort of like to think they're punks,

1114
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:15,200
but who at any rate are really just conformist,

1115
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,240
nonconformists who really believe that if,

1116
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,460
as long as they're up on the latest underground,

1117
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,240
really happening music,

1118
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:27,800
that this'll make them cooler than everybody else.

1119
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,580
Oh, friends, if only it was that easy.

1120
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:36,640
I was there in that stupid position myself at one time, of course.

1121
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,540
Of course, in those days,

1122
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:42,720
that was when KNUS was the most avant-garde station in Dallas,

1123
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:43,720
believe it or not.

1124
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,480
That was when Frank Zappa and Jimi Hendrix

1125
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,340
were actually underground unknowns.

1126
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,780
Devo was 16 years old like me

1127
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,460
and Sid Vicious was still in diapers

1128
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,460
and whoever the heck is cool now

1129
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:59,260
was just a gleam in his daddy's eye.

1130
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,560
I know I'm afraid I don't have any higher hopes

1131
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,380
for the quote,

1132
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:08,160
new wave or new music unquote audience anymore

1133
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,460
than I did for my hippie compatriots

1134
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,540
back when I cut my hair to a burr,

1135
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,880
my once long hair to a burr haircut in 1972.

1136
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:19,260
That was when I saw the rednecks

1137
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,700
that used to try to beat me up suddenly growing long.

1138
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,780
I realized at that point that the youth movement was sold out.

1139
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,820
Well, what happened to the 60s?

1140
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,440
Same thing that's happening now.

1141
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,760
A few of George's audience are committed to the weirdness,

1142
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,800
to true freedom and originality and slack

1143
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,800
and will be so throughout their lives

1144
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,120
in many different disguises.

1145
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,660
The rest will just talk and talk about it,

1146
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,100
but they'll be stuck in some teenage time warp

1147
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,660
where from now on your idea of what's cool

1148
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,060
has already been cemented into place.

1149
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,240
You're destined, friend,

1150
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,600
to be nothing but another target audience.

1151
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,640
And you'll deserve nothing but that

1152
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,200
because you'll be nothing but a pink.

1153
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,700
At the age of 40,

1154
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,180
you'll still either be wearing your current hairdo

1155
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,980
or you'll be trying like hell to dress halfway between that

1156
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,220
and what's currently fashionable,

1157
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,460
just like all the sportscasters will be doing.

1158
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:12,320
Yes, you'll look like a sportscaster of 1998.

1159
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,200
Uh, and you won't find Bob

1160
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,400
because you won't understand him.

1161
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,800
Or you'll get it all wrong and think you need Bob

1162
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,220
and buy him for 20 bucks.

1163
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:25,400
Except it'll probably be $500 by then.

1164
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,800
Now last week when I was in San Francisco,

1165
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,800
we got a call from a poor wretched teenager

1166
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,400
who wanted to know what happened to the 60s.

1167
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,560
And I think you'll be touched by the pathos

1168
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,760
that you hear in this lad's voice.

1169
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,620
And when Lies and I give our response,

1170
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,020
you'll know that we're telling the truth.

1171
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,120
And everybody stay tuned after that

1172
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,840
for the American Music Party.

1173
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,040
Music that shall never die.

1174
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,960
The wisdom of Robert.

1175
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:02,620
Hehehehehehehehehehe.

1176
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,360
Oh, that pop is good.

1177
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,780
It's impossible to do everything tonight.

1178
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,940
What I know...

1179
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:11,900
What happened to you,

1180
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,180
you people who actually were able to experience it,

1181
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:14,500
I was...

1182
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,480
What do you mean?

1183
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,280
I'm 14.

1184
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,760
The Reverend Howe is 12.

1185
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,160
And staying here, I think, is 9.

1186
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,040
Timmy has to tinker.

1187
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:27,940
Hehehehehehehehehehe.

1188
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,060
Hehehehehehehehehehe.

1189
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,540
Oh, we sold it to the conspiracy.

1190
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:38,500
We hippies, represented by the 18 people in this room,

1191
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,280
sold the 60s to the conspiracy.

1192
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:41,800
Everything.

1193
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,680
And it was well worth it.

1194
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,760
They went and, of course, modified it into, uh,

1195
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,860
opunk, heavy metal...

1196
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,180
Oh, there's nothing wrong with it?

1197
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:52,340
But it's just a margarine commercial jingle these days.

1198
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,960
That's just a hollow imitation punk and all that.

1199
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,020
It's just like a hollow...

1200
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,100
They don't even understand what they're doing

1201
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,640
when they do most of the rituals they do.

1202
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,940
It's almost like a mythology or a tradition

1203
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,860
carried on by people who don't understand.

1204
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,280
They might understand, but they don't care.

1205
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,260
That's the thing to remember.

1206
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,420
I understand, but I don't care.

1207
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,360
I understand it, I don't care.

1208
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,740
I don't know what to tell you, son.

1209
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:13,600
I understand it, I don't care.

1210
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,260
I'm still waiting for the 1860s to come around again,

1211
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,740
and I've been bitterly disappointed.

1212
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:19,800
Point it up to the flam.

1213
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,760
Parallel flam. Parallel flam.

1214
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,460
We all like to think we're marching to the...

1215
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,600
to the cadence of a different drummer.

1216
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,700
Have any of you noticed the absence of Suicide Man?

1217
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,800
Did you know that he moved to...

1218
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,580
He moved to the worst...

1219
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:35,500
So he finally killed himself, huh?

1220
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:36,500
Suicide Man.

1221
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,000
Well, you don't care about Suicide Man.

1222
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,920
Friends, if you want to get some information

1223
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,980
about the Church of the Subgenius,

1224
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:43,780
just write...

1225
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,300
Just request some info about Bob

1226
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,700
from Bob at...

1227
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:52,840
P.O. Box 140306.

1228
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,540
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1229
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,040
I'm gonna let this new Zug's Rift...

1230
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,040
Man, Zug's Rift comes out with a new one every week now,

1231
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:03,640
it seems like.

1232
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,580
We can actually get them at record stores.

1233
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,560
This new one's called Water.

1234
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,460
Kraze Bomb!

1235
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,100
Who the hell is this?

1236
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:37,360
You think Graziella's pot

1237
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:37,360


1238
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,700
Speaker 2 shoes is, uh...

1239
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:44,620
No, it ain't.

1240
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,720
Are you crazy?

1241
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:55,460
guitar solo

1242
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,720
guitar solo
