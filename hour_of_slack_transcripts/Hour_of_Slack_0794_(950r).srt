1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:09,860
There are those who believe that life here began out there, far across the universe,

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:18,780
with tribes of humans who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians, or the Toltecs,

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,700
or the Mayans. That they may have been the architects of the great pyramids,

4
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:35,360
or the lost civilizations of Lemuria, or Atlantis. Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man,

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:52,880
who even now fight to survive somewhere beyond the heavens. And now, the subgenius hour of SWAC.

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,780
It's so ironic, we're such funny little monkeys, because, you know, Chaz,

7
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:13,320
nobody knows as well as I do that the world ends July 5th. And yet, I just got married,

8
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:21,320
bought a house, moved in, and my wife and I are running around still, trying to hang up our

9
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,680
artwork, or, you know, finish cleaning up the living room before the sun goes down.

10
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:24,680


11
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:24,680


12
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:24,680


13
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,680
Before the world ends.

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,440
Right.

15
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:35,000
And people tend to cling to the habits and that which is familiar, even when something as huge as

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,300
X-Day is facing them. It's breathing right down their necks. I mean, this reality...

17
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,620
Oh, here's another thing. I...

18
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,120
Oh.

19
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,280
Dave's here.

20
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,060
I guess we better go... You know, we gotta...

21
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,500
Wait, no, somebody's going to get him.

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,560
Somebody else is gonna Dave it.

23
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,220
Uh...

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,520
Get the Dave machine.

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,540
Oh, I gotta...

26
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,240
The Dave brain is now arriving.

27
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,240
Okay, in just a few days, we're gonna be aboard these...

28
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,580
In a few days, we'll be aboard these escape vessels with the...

29
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:14,740
Where the very air itself is the computer and the internet that serves you. And when you want

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,100
a hamburger, a hamburger materializes in your hand, emailed out of the ethers.

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,060
And yet...

32
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,660
I spent the last week...

33
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,200
I spent the last week paying for cable modem.

34
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,720
But what have we learned about...

35
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,380
Well, that's probably a good...

36
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:34,300
Oh, I gotta make sure that all the hours of slack are available for the radio station...

37
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:34,700
Yeah, it does...

38
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,300
While the world is ending. My God, how can we be lost in these silly...

39
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,760
Show them a little sympathy, kid.

40
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,720
Silly, trivial things when the grandness of a whole new universe is...

41
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,520
The whole universe is laid before us, barren and bare naked.

42
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,560
Yes, a pond of shit. Bare naked, yes.

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,780
And we're gonna get to crawl all over it.

44
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,960
Well, after a major speech...

45
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,280
And you're worried about it, the damn...

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,580
And I shouldn't have threatened about whether some CDs gonna be in the can or not.

47
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,840
As if I gave a hoot about this...

48
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,120
This is what it's gonna sound like in space. My spaceship...

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,380
What, with Dave?

50
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:20,060
Yeah, you'll just see from the distance, you'll just see this orb all enclosed...

51
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,260
That's another thing I don't like about this.

52
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,980
With neon green lighting...

53
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,200
Church.

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,920
And the lights protruding from the windows, pulsing to the beat of the song.

55
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,760
We're gonna have a good party.

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:40,220
We will definitely have a good party. That much we do know. We no longer know for sure if the world is gonna end or not.

57
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:48,460
And if you wanna hang out at this good party, if you wanna do that, I don't know, what you do at this point is...

58
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,700
Show up.

59
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,360
Just show up at Brushwood.

60
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,940
With a big lot of cash in your pocket.

61
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,420
Yeah.

62
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,580
Bring the big bags of money up to the main pavilion.

63
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,540
Oh, yeah.

64
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,140
Oh, you're gonna have to send someone to carry them. We're gonna need about three people.

65
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,660
Where do poor folk go when they die? They don't go to heaven where the angels fly.

66
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,260
There is a meteor crater here.

67
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,620
...seem again on the fifth of July.

68
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,480
This is where the saucer crashed.

69
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,520
Yeah.

70
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,120
Somewhere under here is our salvation.

71
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,920
Oh, right there!

72
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,760
I don't think that's an egg. It looks more like a Yucatisma...

73
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,100
Sperm cell.

74
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,240
One Yucatisma sperm hit this campground.

75
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,760
...and left this imprint.

76
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:43,040
Yucatisma sperms are so developed that they have skeletons. Just the sperms themselves have skulls and spines.

77
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,060
They have sentient stones.

78
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,720
They are vicious.

79
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,580
They'll actually debate amongst each other where the egg actually is.

80
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,740
Big sperm wars.

81
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,340
It's over there!

82
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,580
This is our planet is the egg.

83
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,220
This is where the Yucatisma sperm entered. Right outside Alt Slack Village.

84
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,000
It inseminated the earth.

85
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,740
And the world will end this morning at 7 a.m.

86
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,820
Have you paid your $30 to Bob?

87
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,580
Dave, do you really think that I need to be saving souls and worrying about that at this late hour?

88
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,520
Well, you could at least gouge this man's gas prices.

89
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,820
Do we really want to save...

90
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,580
I mean, that's what all the other religions do.

91
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,100
We're trying to save souls from themselves.

92
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,540
Theirselves?

93
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,780
Yes, we want to save them from salvation.

94
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,460
Everyone needs to be safe from their self.

95
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,200
Well, that adds a certain tension to that today.

96
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,460
It makes it real.

97
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,520
It's not a sci-fi convention.

98
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,420
This is a real drill for the end of the planet.

99
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,760
The violent end of the planet as prophesied by our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

100
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,980
A lot of EMS study in Earth.

101
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,500
Living avatar of Sloth.

102
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,360
Slack for the subgeniuses.

103
00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:03,520
Not slack for the humans, the pink boys, the mere humes and hume worms that are crawling around in their little cage of three dimensions on this pit of a planet.

104
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:03,860
That's all?

105
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,880
Gravity well.

106
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,680
Four little dimensions.

107
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,860
One for each of them.

108
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,180
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,960
Well, by any time anybody hears this, it will have been over.

110
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,640
So let's pretend like we're on our ship.

111
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,020
You know, I've been thinking, what cut was that?

112
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,900
Get your ship together, man.

113
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:18,900


114
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,120
Put on 12.

115
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,540
Put on 12.

116
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,600
You know, friends, we've been saying for a long time, Earth, Earth, you hear me?

117
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,040
Earth, we must get off.

118
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,460
Earth, we must get off.

119
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,940
A light just came on in my head.

120
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:37,280
A light that means that the mobile revolution of the future has been sent directly into your cerebral cortex.

121
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,780
You're next in for the maximum plus and the pecks next.

122
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,420
Pecks, pecks, pecks, pecks, pecks, pecks, pecks, pecks, pecks.

123
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,800
Is this 12?

124
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,680
Yeah.

125
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,740
Yeah, this was some song about Earth we must get off, only it's not.

126
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,200
It just sounds, this is an X Day song, friends.

127
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:05,360
An X Day song made by somebody who didn't even know that X Day was right around the bend.

128
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,420
Ah, yeah.

129
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:35,900
Sorry.

130
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,620
At everybody, but now it can't be better.

131
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,960
Put your speed on fast so that you can fly theses

132
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,800
Father I don't understand.

133
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:40,860


134
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,740
And we open up the desert.

135
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,820
I think images of the future, decisions deserve a lot down below.

136
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,420
Sort ofhumane.

137
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,100
Kay, go?

138
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,560
So I think I'm falling, falling from the 14 story

139
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,140
One more line and it will be morning

140
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,220
Hit the floor

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,280
Stop the traffic, stop the clock, stop the clock

142
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,960
I wanna get off

143
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,980
I wanna get off with you

144
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,600
I wanna get off

145
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,460
I wanna get off with you

146
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,180
One more job in the supermarket

147
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,700
One more kick to get me started

148
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,740
Everyone get on board, this ship is sinking

149
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,740
Now maybe it's worth a chance

150
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,360
Any chance to tip the luck plane in the direction of the rupture

151
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,800
Oh it's gotta happen

152
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,400
In hell

153
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,040
I'm three years older than I ever planned on being

154
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,500
And I'm pretty damn pissed about it

155
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,600
Yeah you and me both sister

156
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
Mm-hmm

157
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,700
And you know

158
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,660
I sure didn't join this stupid cult back in 81

159
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,680
Just to get a damn 20 year pin with a coprolite chip

160
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,740
I paid my money

161
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,600
I struck the hell out of Dobbs

162
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,520
And I sincerely believe that party line

163
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,300
And now I wanna get off

164
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,480
Tip for tap

165
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,640
Hey that's fun for the cat

166
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,960
Stop the traffic, stop the clock, stop the clock

167
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,680
I wanna get off

168
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,660
I wanna get off with you

169
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,280
I wanna get off

170
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,720
I wanna get off with you

171
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,380
And that's a fitting call

172
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,320
You want more, more, more

173
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,740
That's a rather mistake I hate

174
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,400
I wanna get off

175
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,400
I wanna get off with you

176
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,720
I wanna get off baby

177
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,980
I do wanna get off

178
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,500
We must get off

179
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,620
Yeah I'm going out this weekend to build a tiki bar

180
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,440
That I'm gonna take with me on my pleasure vessel

181
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,820
But I think it's kinda

182
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,500
When I get off

183
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,640
I think those drinks are gonna be a little weird

184
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,260
Gettin' some spiced rum and some guava juice and

185
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,640
Vipin' the old pineapples with the old white sugar

186
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,280
Yeah, little margaritas mix and

187
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,740
I've been getting real

188
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,080
Rookie set

189
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,200
Sentimental about earth

190
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,760
Well there's certain things I wanna take

191
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,320
And I'm gonna get my own body

192
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,400
Cause I know that, you know this will be my last

193
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,020
I'm gonna take Hawaii with me

194
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,060
I think, yeah

195
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,080
My pleasure vessel is just gonna be

196
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,540
A dome over Hawaii

197
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,740
And we're going

198
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,420
And a little bit of the ocean

199
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,080
Gotta have dolphins

200
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,520
I'm gonna take the animal protective league with me

201
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,260
And also the nearest trailer park

202
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,600
There is one two tenths of a mile from the woods

203
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,800
Don't sound like you wanna get off

204
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,840
No, there are some things that are near and dear to me

205
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,700
Don't worry about it Dave

206
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,840
Get off

207
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,240
We must

208
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,760
Get off

209
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,120
But what will I wear?

210
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,040
I've never worn anything but this human flesh suit

211
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,380
This sadly faded

212
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,740
Don't be limited my friend

213
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,460
Don't be limited by these trivial concerns

214
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,780
Free your mind and your ass will follow

215
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,620
My mind's never been anything but this

216
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,020
In order to fly you have to lose your shit man

217
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,760
Yeah man, in order to sink you have to lose your shit

218
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,780
My brain's never been anything but this

219
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,460
Anything more than a soggy jelly roll

220
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:17,840
Filled with vacuous misconceptions and misanthropic misconstruings

221
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,980
All aboard this ship is sinking

222
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,220
That's like that

223
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,600
All aboard Scotty

224
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,680
You too skinny

225
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,140
Put your feet planted firmly apart

226
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,580
And your anus sucking the wind around you

227
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,800
No slurs and malams

228
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,780
It's time to get on board

229
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,420
If there isn't something to be found

230
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,240
Then it's time to go

231
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,840
Okay now it's time to put our hands together and pray

232
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,700
We're gonna ask the baby

233
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,800
Choo, choo, choo, choo

234
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,620
And time to move

235
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,320
All aboard this ship is sinking

236
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,040
And everything that we've been through

237
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,120
Is coming to an end

238
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,460
All aboard this ship is sinking

239
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,260
And everything that we've been through

240
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,600
Is coming to an end

241
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:09,720
Everyone's gonna say

242
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,640
All aboard this ship is sinking

243
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,040
And everything that we've been through

244
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,360
Is coming to an end

245
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,780
I ain't nothing but sadness

246
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:19,820
And nothing else

247
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:19,820


248
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,720
Stop hiding

249
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,300
Stop there

250
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,280
Come to me

251
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,360
Ooh, hey

252
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,020
I'm in the rain, the sun has yet to rise

253
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,760
I shake away the dread fear in my head

254
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,340
I'm in the rain, the sun has yet to rise

255
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,260
I'm in the rain, the sun has yet to rise

256
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,480
The ground is all I see

257
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,180
And the red spot on my moorstick

258
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,780
Is all I really need

259
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,580
I'm not walking on the sidewalk

260
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,020
The ground is on my tail

261
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,700
And every child is in the yard

262
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,580
Don't lose my cool, Mr.

263
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,100
Don't lose my cool, Mr.

264
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,620
Don't lose my cool, Mr.

265
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,400
I can't get you out of my way

266
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,220
I'm, I'm getting you сlown

267
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,440
I'm an out standing

268
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,240
I'm used humble Boipper

269
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,060
I'm in the rain, Mr.

270
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,000
I shake away the dread fear in my head

271
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,560
I don't know what to do

272
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,620
Mr.

273
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,520
I sing, Mr.

274
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,300
I've been missed by the hives, and I've just been picked to go

275
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,460
I've been picked to fill up with silver concrete, and look to the red

276
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,840
I've picked a house, I've picked a dog, I've picked a chicken to eat

277
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:23,240
And when they come out to see the show, I just pick them too

278
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,640
I'm not riding in the car, I'm not driving on the road

279
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,120
I'm not a target, leave me alone

280
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:41,240
And when I'm in the car, I'm not riding in the car

281
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,140
I'm not riding in the car, I'm not riding in the car

282
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,840
I'm not riding in the car, I'm not riding in the car

283
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,740
Why they need me

284
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,860
Why they need me

285
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,020
Try captain door

286
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,160
The button is showing

287
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,160


288
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,020
Wanna go

289
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,820
My heart for me

290
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,160
I like the music

291
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,520
It's wonderful

292
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,980
I'm excited

293
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm flying

294
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,680
I'm flying

295
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,980
I'm flying

296
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,040
I'm flying

297
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,100
I'm flying

298
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,680
I'm flying

299
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:08,900
I'm flying

300
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,080
I'm flying

301
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:15,060
I'm flying

302
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,360
I'm flying

303
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,580
Ooh

304
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:26,740
Ooh

305
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,360
Ooh

306
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,580
Ooh

307
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:54,940
Ooh

308
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,660
Ooh

309
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,700
Ooh

310
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,500
Ooh

311
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:57,700
Ooh

312
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,080
Ooh

313
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,200
Ooh

314
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,200


315
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,340
Ooh

316
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,880
Ooh

317
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,300
Ooh

318
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:01,420
Ooh

319
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:01,440
Ooh

320
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:01,720
Ooh

321
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,280
Ooh

322
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,280


323
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,640
Ooh

324
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,260
Thank you.

325
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,920
Thank you.

326
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,660
Thank you.

327
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,260
Thank you.

328
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,140
Thank you.

329
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:14,540
Thank you.

330
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,520
Thank you.

331
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,840
Thank you.

332
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,160
Thank you.

333
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,060
Thank you.

334
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:43,820
Thank you.

335
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,360
Thank you.

336
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:56,820


337
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,760
Hey,pflicht!

338
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,100
I'm confused!

339
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,120
You think...

340
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,880
what do you mean my name is Will Samson!

341
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,860
I'm gonna've...

342
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,120
...

343
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,700
...

344
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,160
...

345
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,380
...

346
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:12,520
...

347
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:12,540
...

348
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:21,860
We'll just take the very moist, I might add, the very, very moist and disheveled artichoke

349
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:28,660
and place the growth, that's what they can call staying sprayed, into the artichoke.

350
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,060
Now we're going to put it in the shoebox, the old Wheatly's shoebox from 1972.

351
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,240
We're getting out of here.

352
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,920
The world ends a week from today.

353
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:50,140
And if you want to get out on the spaceships, you've got to get your butt out to Brushwood by 7 a.m.

354
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,800
The Bush girls will be at Brushwood.

355
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,560
Thursday morning.

356
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:58,160
All three of them, the evil clone twin who's not allowed out of the White House compound will be there,

357
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,580
and she will be playing with your Argyle socks for nada.

358
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,580
In disguise.

359
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,780
She's lusting all night.

360
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,260
She hasn't missed one yet, and no one's ever figured out which one she is.

361
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,060
I can't wait.

362
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,900
I can't wait for the end.

363
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,580
The opening ritual.

364
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,520
I always get so sentimental about that opening ritual.

365
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,040
That old bagpipe player is going to be there again this time, too.

366
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,880
This time he's going to have a pair of knees so we don't vomit throughout the ceremony,

367
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,220
and he's going to have more of his body together, at least,

368
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,020
so we don't have to stinky kilts and a bagpipe.

369
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,220
We're going home.

370
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,120
We're going home.

371
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,780
Bob's calling us home.

372
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,520
Stardust.

373
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,560
This ain't a threat.

374
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,380
This ain't a threat.

375
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:38,740
This ain't a promise.

376
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,800
It's just a fact.

377
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,500
Bob's calling us home.

378
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,320
We're not sure where the escape vessels escaped to,

379
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,540
but we put our trust in Bob.

380
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,020
Dustbowl.

381
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,760
Dustbowl.

382
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,900
Dustbowl.

383
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,660
Nothing left.

384
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,540
Oh, they come down to our camp.

385
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,180
Security guards.

386
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,540
Beat up the game geeks first.

387
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,940
Then they come looking for us because we were still left here on Earth.

388
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,460
It keeps me always returning to you.

389
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,460
The vessels left a long time ago.

390
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,900
The water from the whales of home.

391
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,700
They say we're going to be picking some fruit really soon.

392
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,540
And now it's just...

393
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,440
The water from the whales of...

394
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,440
Home.

395
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,020
Well, my...

396
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,400
I killed a man.

397
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,500
I guess it was a man.

398
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,140
I thought it was a woman.

399
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,140
Then I thought it was a bee.

400
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,240
Then I thought it was a fly.

401
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,220
Then I thought it was a...

402
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,580
It's time to go.

403
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,120
It's going to be the laws of Bob from now on.

404
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,240
Come on, put your blanket back on your horse.

405
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,500
Did you get mean mad, Stag?

406
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,860
Did you get mean mad when you jumped on the vessel

407
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:53,020
and gave the finger to the bulls and the dicks back there in the camp?

408
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,880
You can take the saddle here, Dwight,

409
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,320
or DJA, anytime you want.

410
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,120
We're ready.

411
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,020
I'm ready.

412
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,000
Hook up the electrodes.

413
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,020
Dave, you ready?

414
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,700
Amazing slap, my friend.

415
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,140
Those electrodes have been lubricated

416
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,280
and their stuff's in there real tight.

417
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,700
I can see that.

418
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:09,740
Oh, oh, oh.

419
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:09,740


420
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,000
Timothy will be there.

421
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,420
In different cornice symptoms.

422
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,680
Without waiting for us.

423
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,020
And the other Timothy will probably be waiting for us, too.

424
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:16,940
Timothy Bleary.

425
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,780
Lenny will be there.

426
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,120
Jimmy will probably play star spangled banner.

427
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,880
Jimmy and Timmy Bleary will be there.

428
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,180
John will be there.

429
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,420
We'll be able to just sit around the place in our socks.

430
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,560
Jim will finally come out of retirement.

431
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,660
The King will be there, my friend.

432
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,580
Tiny Tim.

433
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,700
Little pink poodle-looking record players

434
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,280
that have this strange stink on the side of them.

435
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,160
The Duke of Ute.

436
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,500
You don't know if it's Jerry Lewis and Jerry Lee Lewis.

437
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,640
You got it from your weird uncle

438
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,620
or if it's because your weird uncle put it there on purpose.

439
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,880
Moe Howard will be at the judgment.

440
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,460
All three Stooges will be there and Shemp.

441
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,420
King Louis XIV of France will not be there,

442
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,180
but he will be joking about you

443
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,600
as he sits on the throne extra-medicating.

444
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,760
Oh, man.

445
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,260
I just can't wait.

446
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,860
I just can't wait to get there.

447
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,980
That opening ceremony.

448
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,480
We'll be standing hand in hand

449
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,100
as the saucer lands.

450
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,220
Right in the middle of our circle of humanity.

451
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,740
Nearly a fleet, whatever the hell that is,

452
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,780
or a gaggle, perhaps,

453
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,820
of these shiny, spherical objects coming down.

454
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,120
And we see that there's like a ray of sunshine

455
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,940
or some golden, luminous thing descending,

456
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,860
picking up each and every one of the furry, funky little boys

457
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,980
and girls down there below,

458
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:34,000
so eager to kiss this place off and bye-bye.

459
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,920
And we see now that they're making a formation now.

460
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,800
I don't know what kind of it's perhaps the...

461
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,240
It looks like the saucer...

462
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,160
Keep your hat on tight.

463
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,440
You're back to the wind and you're sagging the saddle.

464
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,360
That's right.

465
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,160
See y'all.

466
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,480
They're giving the finger to the planet...

467
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,880
That reminds me.

468
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,480
Uh-huh.

469
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,180
You know, I saw the passenger manifest for the first day.

470
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,660
Yes.

471
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,020
My manifest destiny.

472
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:02,400
Like you got a manly fist destiny in store for you to...

473
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,700
Uh-huh.

474
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,360
I was so shapely ass wasn't listed on that thing anywhere.

475
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,420
But I have my boarding pass.

476
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,220
Right here.

477
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,300
Hey, wait a minute.

478
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,080
This is for the Achilles, Laura.

479
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,520
Hey, be sure to try their Klingover cocktail.

480
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,740
Two shots of this?

481
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,540
There's gotta be some kind of mistake or something.

482
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,680
Oh, yeah.

483
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,720
I'm gonna go call Stay and straighten this out.

484
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:27,980
Here.

485
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,280
Here, you take over the show, okay?

486
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:30,980
Hey.

487
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,620
Well, why do?

488
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,960
Get Frank and you two finish up our tour of the solar system.

489
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,820
Ah.

490
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,620
And keep it clean, you sleazebag.

491
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,020
I'm off.

492
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,700
Trust me.

493
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,440
Ta-ta.

494
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,560
Ah, good.

495
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,960
Enough of this crap.

496
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,980
Mmm, sweet.

497
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,260
But let's make it stink.

498
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:05,000
And then to your inner...

499
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,800
Your inner...

500
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,780
You're a nice little heaven.

501
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,800
Heaven, heaven.

502
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,360
Wow, what's that smell?

503
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,900
It's Uranus Boner.

504
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,940
God dammit, is it?

505
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,400
I mean the planet, Uranus, Boner.

506
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,500
Blazing.

507
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,580
Comets, Captain.

508
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,920
You mean you brought us back to that godforsaken stinkhole of a planet where Seaman Bob bit the cosmic weenie?

509
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:46,700
If memory serves me correctly, Doctor, you pronounced Seaman Bob dead after he fainted from the smell of his planet.

510
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,680
He is of Uranus.

511
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,820
He's a friend of the planet.

512
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,620
I don't believe my eyes.

513
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,280
It's Seaman Bob.

514
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,860
Check out the bulge inside his swamis.

515
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,880
He must be happy to see us.

516
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,180
Seaman Bob.

517
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,140
So good to see you looking in the pink.

518
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,300
Shove it, Quirk.

519
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,420
You're not going to be glad to see me at all.

520
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,540
Behold.

521
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,440
Hey, it's the wrap of Bob.

522
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,780
It's a great group.

523
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,280
Check it out.

524
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:22,540
Yeah, but enough Masterpiece Theater for right now because something's definitely up.

525
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,660
I'm not on that list.

526
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,840
See, it's all there.

527
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,860
I'd better hightail my butt to Brushwood.

528
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:36,360
I'm going to get off this planet, girlfriend, if I got to tear a piece off a stand, Bob's butts, and bleed a rope to the saucers.

529
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,340
Whoa, hey.

530
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,240
Sounds like an idea.

531
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,780
One minute.

532
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,100
This is the last time I got to get up before seven, right?

533
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:45,900
Oh, yeah, yeah.

534
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,960
We'll have to do this.

535
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,800
I'm sure all the drills will have paid off by this time.

536
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,540
We'll be ready.

537
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,240
I've been drilled too damn many times, if you ask me.

538
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,580
Oh, boy, this is exciting.

539
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,360
It's got to be one of these episodes, right?

540
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,540
Actually, this is a much better turnout than when we do it at the end of the week.

541
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,180
Twenty-five.

542
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,680
They're all dead by then.

543
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:16,840
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

544
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,820
The keys, monsieur.

545
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,080
Here are your keys.

546
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:31,860
Oh, thank you.

547
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,660
Are those the keys to my new planet?

548
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,660
Yes, those are your keys.

549
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,200
My new planet-sized spaceship.

550
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,500
And very have a good time for your whole everything you have.

551
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,940
And anything I want, I can create as if unlike unto a god.

552
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,140
Absolutely.

553
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:50,200
Anything you will learn, your heart desire, you can have just by merely you can shake the keys or let your knees down.

554
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,000
And I can show it all off to my buddies who also bought subgenius membership cards and pledged to the station.

555
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,020
Oh, Mary, Mary, you're too lazy to me.

556
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,420
All your friends you can take.

557
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:56,560
You can take.

558
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,560


559
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,560


560
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,560


561
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,560


562
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,560


563
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,560


564
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,560


565
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,560


566
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,220
You can show off any of your buttock.

567
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,200
You can hang from the ceiling, do anything you have.

568
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,120
And all my buddies have their own planets, too.

569
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,980
In mono, stereophonic, and...

570
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,960
We can have wars and all kinds of stuff.

571
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,660
Oh, my way.

572
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:13,080
Man, I sure am glad I invested that $30 to Bob Dobbs back then in 1996.

573
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,480
When I spent that $30, you know what that amounted to?

574
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,720
Five cents a day until next day.

575
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,260
Yes.

576
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,040
It cost me less than it cost a cup of coffee in a whole year.

577
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,740
I must agree.

578
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,800
You made a very good deal, my friend.

579
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,120
You're a great waiter.

580
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,920
Are you one of the alien sex goddesses disguised as a waiter?

581
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,880
No, no, no, mon ami.

582
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,340
I am actually a waiter.

583
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:46,360
I had a chance to become one of the alien sex goddesses by Pupfer merely to help you and to crack pepper for you, to shine your shoes, to do anything your heart desires.

584
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,520
See how realistic that was.

585
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,540
And mainly I'm here to stroke your ego, just as in real life.

586
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,560
Oh, man.

587
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,440
Man, this is great.

588
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,780
I am so glad that I am a saved subject.

589
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:55,780


590
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,260
I am a subgenius.

591
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,120
Oh, don't forget to try the pork pie or any of the caviar.

592
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,200
It's very excellent.

593
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,020
Oh, the food here is great.

594
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,700
It's like before I even think of it, there is just what I was about to want to eat.

595
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,620
And, oh, I was just thinking about this comic book, this old Zap comic, number five.

596
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,040
Hey, River, baby.

597
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,220
You mind if I sit down at your table?

598
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,960
Uh, Elvis.

599
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,860
How you doing, man?

600
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:24,580
You know, I never really got the chance to get in line with your church and help you out, but I saw something in the after light.

601
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:25,780
Oh, well, what?

602
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,680
I just wanted to sit down and shake your hand and say I'm a real supporter of Bob and whatnot.

603
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,600
Oh, man.

604
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,560
Well, listen, let me tell you, I grew up listening to your music, Elvis.

605
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:33,960
I do these a lot.

606
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,520
As far as I'm concerned, you are the king.

607
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,680
And I just, man, this is great.

608
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,260
Yeah, yeah.

609
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,220
This is just unbelievable.

610
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,040
I think somebody else wants to meet you.

611
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,620
I think Sammy Davis Jr. would like to sit down and have a word with you.

612
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,040
Hey, look, I'll see you later, man.

613
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,600
There's a little filly over there I want to talk to, all right?

614
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,780
Hey, man, hang in there.

615
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,220
I love Bob.

616
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,600
I really do.

617
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,100
Hey, thanks, Elvis.

618
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:52,940
Man.

619
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,200
God, this is just so.

620
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
It's Reverend Baby Ivan Stang.

621
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,780
That's you, isn't it?

622
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,840
It's Reverend Ivan Stang.

623
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,540
Oh, yeah.

624
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,820
I'm a person with, I just had my adenoids removed.

625
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,480
I'm sorry.

626
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,920
I had the wrong table.

627
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:07,920
Why?

628
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:15,400
You know, it's great being rich and famous and having, it's only been, what, two hours

629
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,240
since 7 a.m.

630
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:24,400
The rupture happened two hours ago and already I've stuffed my face, masturbated, met Elvis.

631
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,180
I'm a big fan.

632
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,640
I've done all the things I never, ever did before.

633
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,600
More champagne, monsieur?

634
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,820
Oh, thank you.

635
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,320
Thank you.

636
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,820
Hey, what other celebrities are around?

637
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,120
Lenny Bruce happen to be on my planet?

638
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,560
I think Mr. Bruce is in the other room at the bar.

639
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,720
I bet I will go and then.

640
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,000
Oh, I'll have to.

641
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,320
Well, don't bother him.

642
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,200
Don't bother him right now.

643
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,340
No, no, no, no, no.

644
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,620
Anything for your pleasure.

645
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,560
It may take a few minutes, but I will bring him.

646
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,520
Wow.

647
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,100
You know, it would have been creepy if Lenny Bruce had just suddenly appeared before I

648
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,860
even got to ask.

649
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,420
Hey, you're the guy.

650
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,460
Hey, you're the guy.

651
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,000
You're the guy.

652
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,400
You're the guy.

653
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:03,760
You're the guy.

654
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,080
You're the guy.

655
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,460
And the first time I remember, I was the only Jew.

656
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:07,840
Do you remember?

657
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,540
I was the, you remember that shtick I did?

658
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,000
It was in, I think it was at the Village.

659
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:11,940
No, wait.

660
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,560
It was at the Vanguard.

661
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:12,920
I went.

662
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,380
I've got a bootleg of that, man.

663
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,520
The only Jew in Ohio.

664
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,260
Do you remember that shtick?

665
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,720
Yeah, yeah.

666
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,280
That was you.

667
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,520
That was you, man.

668
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,560
I remember that was you all the way because I was there.

669
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,500
I'm in Canton, Ohio.

670
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,920
I'm in Canton, Ohio and I'm, I drive, it's like a VFW hall or something like that.

671
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,220
That was only four years old?

672
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:31,540
They drive me out to this VFW hall and there are these pictures of, they say it's Bob there.

673
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,220
There's all these pictures of Bob everywhere.

674
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,720
And the next thing you know, I see you're standing there.

675
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,040
Man.

676
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,760
Oh, oh, oh, look, he's shooting up.

677
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:41,780
Wow.

678
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,740
Look, look.

679
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,560
Do you, do you, can you OD?

680
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,400
By the way, can you OD on the escape vessels, Lenny?

681
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,400
Oh, I guess so.

682
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:49,800
Bummer.

683
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,160
And if he were to come back to me.

684
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,440
Oh, well, he was.

685
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:58,760
He was just one of the sex, beautiful sex goddesses in the form of my, one of my heroes,

686
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,400
Lenny Bruce.

687
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,560
I'm sorry, Monsieur.

688
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:05,560
Today is Monsieur Bruce's birthday and as you know, he always gets the China white on

689
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,180
his birthday.

690
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,820
We'd have to clean him up.

691
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,700
He'll be right back, perhaps at another time.

692
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,120
Man, that is so cool.

693
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,120
And Elvis is over there singing just a song just, just for me.

694
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,840
Oh, boy.

695
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,480
This Church of the Subgenius stuff was crazy.

696
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:22,720
Right.

697
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,820
It was, it was well worth all that, all that Xeroxing and this $30.

698
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,000
Hey, man.

699
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:28,880
Hey, Reverend.

700
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,260
You remember me?

701
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,280
Hey, what are you doing, man?

702
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,580
I'm going to heap a, I'm going to heap a do-wunky, buddy.

703
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,620
What, what?

704
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,140
I need some help, man.

705
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,540
Well, now, wait a minute.

706
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,440
I know.

707
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,120
I've, I've retired now.

708
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,140
It's after X days.

709
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,980
You subgeniuses shouldn't need any help.

710
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,940
Yeah, but see, some things don't work out the way we always had them planned.

711
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,940
You see, I don't know how to explain this, but see, everything is just going perfectly

712
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,380
fine.

713
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:52,460
I mean, I'm not saying that I'm not going to be able to do it.

714
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:52,800
I'm not saying that I'm going to be able to do it.

715
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,220
I'm just saying that I'll be fine until, well, things didn't start going so good.

716
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:56,980
Well, wait a minute.

717
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,320
This is my perfect escape vessel living fantasy.

718
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,260
I don't want to sound bleak.

719
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,400
What are you doing here raining on my parade?

720
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,900
Well, you know, it's not exactly paradise, Rev.

721
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:14,160
I guess there were a few more episodes to follow after X day and, you see.

722
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,680
I command you to disappear.

723
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,020
Oh, sorry, man.

724
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,520
This is for real.

725
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,680
He didn't, he, wait a minute.

726
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,440
I should be able to, anything I want should happen.

727
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,280
The stuff.

728
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,020
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, be gone.

729
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,200
Hey, man, listen, I'll put it to you in like a pop culture way.

730
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,680
You ever see that movie, what was it called?

731
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,700
Not Giardos, Novos.

732
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,200
It was by Stanislav Slam.

733
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,620
It was about this year's star, see?

734
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,320
And if people got too close to it, see, whatever they thought was real.

735
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:41,760
Solaris.

736
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,580
Solaris, yeah.

737
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,960
Yeah, that's it, Solaris.

738
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,740
And the guy starts, well, you see, the stuff, you know, that was in your champagne

739
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:54,500
that made you think Lenny Bruce and all them guys, well, the stuff's kind of,

740
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,840
it's bootleg, man.

741
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,680
It's not very good.

742
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,380
All kinds of weird stuff's happening.

743
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,280
Some people are actually dying and staying dead.

744
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,040
What?

745
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,880
Other people are wishing for beautiful lady in Czech Scottish to come and perform

746
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,200
oral sex on them, and their heads explode, and they don't get up,

747
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,900
and they keep on staying in pain.

748
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,240
Wait a minute.

749
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,400
Oh, man, it's pretty bad.

750
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,680
Look, Elvis, that's not really Elvis.

751
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,600
It's just a record.

752
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,440
That's right.

753
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,040
Wait a minute.

754
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,640
What's that song?

755
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,120
It's a whole record.

756
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,460
It's a viewport.

757
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,860
It's outer space, right?

758
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,240
Right.

759
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,860
Wait a minute.

760
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,900
That's what I'm trying to explain to you, man.

761
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,480
Wait, those are just little Christmas lights on a conveyor belt.

762
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:25,820
Yeah.

763
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,300
What the?

764
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,840
Wait a minute.

765
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,080
Yeah, it's a rat burger.

766
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,360
You mean, wait a minute.

767
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,060
It's wearing off, man.

768
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,400
You mean that we've been gypped?

769
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,780
Not only gypped, we might be dying right now.

770
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,760
What about the 90?

771
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,300
Well, if we're dying, then we ought to at least get 90 bucks.

772
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,180
No, no, no, no.

773
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,620
We've got to search around for some kind of antidote pudding for this stuff.

774
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,200
It's something to make us at least go to one or the other different levels.

775
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,180
Bob cheated us.

776
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:48,600
I can't.

777
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,760
That's impossible.

778
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,760
Or you're all too screwed up.

779
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,280
But how could Bob screw?

780
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,260
Wait a minute.

781
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,020
He cheated us, man.

782
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,100
He cheated us.

783
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,260
Damn screw up.

784
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,260
The trick.

785
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,380
Bob's not smart enough to cheat us.

786
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,800
But Jesus and Bob.

787
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,720
Hey, where's Jesus?

788
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,320
Look, man.

789
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,920
I haven't seen Jesus since the rupture.

790
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,980
I don't know nothing about the conspiracy stuff.

791
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,740
And it's Jesus and Bob was out playing golf.

792
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,360
I'm sick all of a sudden.

793
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:14,760
Yeah.

794
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,620
Yeah, you're going to get a lot sicker, man.

795
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,400
I feel like I'm seasick.

796
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,460
Look at your fingernails, man.

797
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,000
They're bleeding, bro.

798
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:20,660
They're falling off.

799
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,520
Yeah, they're bleeding.

800
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:21,840
You're coming loose.

801
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,940
And I'm bleeding, too.

802
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,620
Look at this.

803
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,180
That's my nose.

804
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,300
I'm bleeding.

805
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,820
We're going to find Jesus.

806
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,320
With Bob.

807
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,400
He didn't cheat.

808
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,160
Yeah.

809
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,180
Yeah.

810
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,120
Oh, yeah.

811
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,640
Oh, yeah.

812
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:44,460
Yeah, you ain't never gonna have it.

813
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,700
And you ain't gonna regret it.

814
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,520
Oh, yeah.

815
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,500
Oh, yeah.

816
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:48,720


817
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,000
That's it?

818
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,640
Yeah, let's go home.

819
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,900
Why does Stain run away so fast?

820
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,320
What is the bird?

821
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,300
Slate to...

822
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,580
The world may end tomorrow,

823
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,080
but you will die!

824
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,200
This is such a pathetic joke.

825
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,240
God damn it.

826
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:14,820
Fuck!

827
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,480
I trusted you, man!

828
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,660
Since I was eight years old, man.

829
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,120
I saw you on that flight!

830
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,480
I trusted you, man.

831
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,300
Trusted you!

832
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,240
I still got 659.

833
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,280
You let us down!

834
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,500
Let me down, man!

835
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,160
Who was it who missed you?

836
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,060
You don't even care!

837
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,880
You're just laying there, smiling!

838
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,280
Smoke.

839
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,360
I want my...

840
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,380
I want my 30 bucks back!

841
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,380
Oh, shit!

842
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,740
That's...

843
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,580
I shouldn't start that.

844
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,440
Class action suit!

845
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,020
You don't like that where that goes.

846
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,400
That's an old...

847
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,740
Well, fuck, shit, piss!

848
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,000
The followers work Bob over.

849
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,800
You know, Bob seems to be enjoying

850
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,940
the punishment after the event.

851
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,540
The smile just gets wider and wider.

852
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,000
Let's all play nice.

853
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,220
I don't think he comes here for the sausage.

854
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,340
I think he comes here for the...

855
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,880
The beatings.

856
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,180
The sake of it.

857
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,520
It's not a gag anymore.

858
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,720
I think he really likes it.

859
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,140
Yeah, me too.

860
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,300
Yeah, we better leave the polyester.

861
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,340
We always wondered what that smile was all about.

862
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,380
Now we know.

863
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:27,860
It's all the same.

864
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,700
The old twin wrestling.

865
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,060
The bigger they are, the more they just want to be spanked.

866
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,620
Let's nail it to that big wire fucking thing over there.

867
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,820
Just want to go back to being little babies again.

868
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,880
No responsibility.

869
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,560
I think a hanging would be shorter.

870
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,200
You have large quantities of wood type things over in that area.

871
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,500
What I heard, Bob's already hung.

872
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,480
He's over in that area.

873
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,140
What?

874
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,000
That's what I heard.

875
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:48,240


876
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,840
Wooden materials.

877
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,140
Well, this is a terrible disappointment.

878
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,200
I was so...

879
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,180
You know what?

880
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,520
Yeah, you've made no plans for the rest of the year, have you?

881
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,280
I had dibs on all those monuments.

882
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,260
Yeah, yeah.

883
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,640
You don't have dick for us to be entertained by the longest.

884
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,300
No.

885
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,500
No bottle on my ass.

886
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,420
Actually, we did arrange for somebody to bring a sound system in tomorrow.

887
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,340
So all these talented people will all be...

888
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:17,340


889
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:17,340


890
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:17,340


891
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,100
I have lots to entertain each other.

892
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,960
How do you think I got down here?

893
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,780
Well, that's great.

894
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,340
Jeez, that's a good idea.

895
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:24,940
Follow the...

896
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,020
Follow the...

897
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,140
Yeah.

898
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,840
You'll be trouble if I am unmotivated.

899
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,380
Yeah, jeez.

900
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:30,780
It's silly.

901
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,200
It's 7 AM and we're all awake and shit.

902
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,860
What the fuck are we going to do for like the next three days?

903
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,740
That's the three days.

904
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,480
Holy smokes.

905
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,000
Oh, somebody had the bright idea of 7 o'clock.

906
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,560
Look at this.

907
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:41,920
I'm not going to do that.

908
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,620
Yeah, you shouldn't have run those credit cards all the way out.

909
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,180
Yeah, no shit.

910
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,280
Now I got to get a room.

911
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:47,320
I'm going to get a room.

912
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,140
I'm going to return ticket home.

913
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,380
What the fuck's going on?

914
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,500
Sorry about that, man.

915
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:50,960
Hey, man.

916
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,460
Well, be glad it wasn't a heaven's gate.

917
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:52,720
That's all right.

918
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,200
That's all right.

919
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:53,440
No shit.

920
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:53,800
No shit.

921
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,760
Next time you'll know.

922
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,500
I'll be ready.

923
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,100
I'll be ready.

924
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,280
Yeah.

925
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,140
Well, that's why we call them next day drills.

926
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,800
Time for Scientology.

927
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,260
Yeah, yeah.

928
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,840
Scientologists will still take you.

929
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,780
You know, I don't know.

930
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,180
I don't know.

931
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,100
Scientologists will take anyone.

932
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,060
The job of us is still predicting the end of the world.

933
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,320
What should we learn from history?

934
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:16,780
Then there was Reverend Jacques Treatment, who truly, truly did expect to be lifted up

935
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:23,960
by the saucers on July 5, 1998 of the conspiracy calendar and did run up all his credit cards

936
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:31,240
and quit his job and was kind of scared about half an hour before everybody else was laughing.

937
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:39,000
And the great miracle of Jacques Treatment was he was back the next year with free food

938
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,700
for everybody.

939
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,060
Wow.

940
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,880
Junk food.

941
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,660
Just plans of a lifetime shot to hell.

942
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:46,760
Yeah.

943
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:50,780
All because some preacher man fucked up or lied.

944
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,060
Breaks my heart.

945
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,500
Damn.

946
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,580
One of these days people will learn.

947
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:00,300
No matter how big the disappointment, we are still standing here.

948
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:00,780
That's right.

949
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,520
We still haven't died.

950
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,500
Bob, let us live one more year.

951
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,540
We are still here.

952
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,100
To suffer.

953
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,160
To disappoint me every year.

954
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,180
One more year.

955
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:10,860
One more time.

956
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:11,180
No.

957
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,000
You don't have to kill yourself yet.

958
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,420
Yeah, but it's not much worth for anyone else.

959
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:15,780
Not yet.

960
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,620
Yeah, but one more year.

961
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:16,760
One more year.

962
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:16,760


963
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,260
One more year.

964
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,020
Beware of the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn.

965
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,900
Alone among God's primates, he kills one before all the world.

966
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,500
The golden age of philonic irrigation.

967
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,920
Oh, we're on planet.

968
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,960
You read our book, too.

969
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:31,700
That was sad.

970
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,940
Which one did you like better?

971
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,380
I told you all, Negi is the way to go.

972
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,000
The bullshit of the believers.

973
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,580
Another ex-deaf.

974
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:44,940
No.

975
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:46,760
I'm not a believer.

976
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,760


977
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,760


978
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,760


979
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,760


980
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,760


981
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,760


982
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,760


983
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,760


984
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,760


985
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,760


986
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,760


987
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,760


988
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:46,760


989
00:43:46,760 --> 00:44:02,620
Joe, what do you think is happening?

990
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,580
The率 among us varies.

991
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:07,680
I'm sorry.

992
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:14,700
Small talk with the Grinch.

993
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:16,740
Is this beautiful anywhere?

994
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,540
I think now you can party for three days at beautiful Brushwood Campground.

995
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,260
The voice of the Lord!

996
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,180
Yes, it's me.

997
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,140
Arise!

998
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,940
Where were you at 7 a.m.?

999
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:40,060
While Reverend Stang and myself were busy preaching,

1000
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,080
you slept in and missed it!

1001
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:47,980
Registration begins at noon today.

1002
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,120
You must be bagged and tagged.

1003
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,900
It is time to wake up.

1004
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,640
Again.

1005
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,060
Because I say so.

1006
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:02,840
Hello?

1007
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,600
Boy, where is everybody?

1008
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,140
Oh my God, the rupture did happen!

1009
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,540
And only me, Motormak, and Stang are left.

1010
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,640
They took everybody but us!

1011
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,060
Oh, my God.

1012
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,280
Where are you people?

1013
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,160
I would just figure.

1014
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,720
Yes, the world ends this morning.

1015
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,160
The world ends this morning at 7 a.m.

1016
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,580
Will you be ready?

1017
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,560
Time control.

1018
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:32,300
Well, they don't call it subgenius or not.

1019
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,000
There we go.

1020
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,720
Now, is this mic over here on?

1021
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,680
No.

1022
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,080
Oh.

1023
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,660
I thought, oh, it sounds a little better.

1024
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,280
I'm not much of a technician.

1025
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,300
I don't do shows with people very often.

1026
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,460
People.

1027
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:48,800
Humans.

1028
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,440
Humans.

1029
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,140
People.

1030
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,000
God.

1031
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:59,880
Well, you know, we wanted, I was, had been looking forward to leaving this planet full

1032
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,560
of people.

1033
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,280
Oh, yeah?

1034
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:01,780
Yeah.

1035
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:02,840
Well.

1036
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,060
Yeah, although, you know, it's a good idea.

1037
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:10,840
And then the prophesied end of the world once again pooped out, didn't come through.

1038
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,300
But you know.

1039
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:15,660
And, you know, I had such a damn good time the last couple of weeks.

1040
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:20,640
And especially that week at Brushwood that the, well, I didn't wanna leave.

1041
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,020
I didn't wanna leave the planet.

1042
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:22,340
I was thinking.

1043
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:27,300
If every day was as much fun as X-day at Brushwood, we wouldn't need X-day.

1044
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,420
Well, that's true.

1045
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,320
But what I would.

1046
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,440
We'd be fine on earth.

1047
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,440
Thank you.

1048
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,020
Abracadabra.

1049
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,840
The end of the world as we know it.

1050
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,280
аци angers.

1051
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:44,380
It's the end of the world as we know it. It's the end of the world as we know it.

1052
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,460
Fall till it's mine.

1053
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,780
You're gonna lie to them today, those troops are on their way.

1054
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,080
Put your job, cover your slack, Jared, I've got your back.

1055
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,440
Hail Connie, hail Bob, underneath the righteous fog.

1056
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,720
Give it up, give it in, find yourself your Yeti kit.

1057
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,000
Do your list, radio, hell, folks gonna blow.

1058
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,820
Here to find out what you know, pass the fight.

1059
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,760
Take a joke, I'll punch, this is no joke, it's fierce, fierce, fierce.

1060
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,860
Turn them in, I'll turn them in, I'll lie.

1061
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,740
I'll burn the solutions, then you will burn me.

1062
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,380
I'll turn it in, then I decline.

1063
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,820
It's the end of the world as we know it.

1064
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:21,520
It's the end of the world as we know it.

1065
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,120
It's the end of the world as we know it.

1066
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,320
Fall till it's mine.

1067
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,640
I can't find $30.

1068
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,120
I can't find our little senior quick who will even come.

1069
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:36,120


1070
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:36,120


1071
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:36,120


1072
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:36,120


1073
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,460
It's the end of the world.

1074
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,580
It's the end of the!

1075
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,040
Let me know.

1076
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:03,260
You should know, sis.

1077
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:07,620
It's the end of the world as we know it

1078
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,020
All feels fine

1079
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,300
The end of that is drunk on life, the mortal slipping beyond bars

1080
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,580
Jenny driving fast, first bang, where Red Ivan sang

1081
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,920
Special presence to me, the son of a cop, little me

1082
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,240
Reverend Susan, that's the city doctor, Vincent St. Ed

1083
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,460
One more time, I know you can't

1084
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,420
Anticrystal, Reverend Geo, Dr. Stanton, right?

1085
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,860
It's the end of the world as we know it

1086
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:35,420
It's the end of the world as we know it

1087
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:40,300
It's the end of the world as we know it

1088
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,480
All feels fine

1089
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,440
The end of the world as we know it

1090
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,040
It's the end of the world as we know it

1091
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,560
Wow.

1092
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,900
What I thought would happen, what I thought would happen was, because they had a series of bad lucks,

1093
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,560
and so what I thought would happen was they actually arrived, and everybody had, you know, their own dream,

1094
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:22,140
and mine was another nightmare, and so it was continuing to go on.

1095
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,300
Well, that's one theory. A lot of people...

1096
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,020
That it is going on still then, right?

1097
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,740
Right. Every X day, some people think...

1098
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,320
So it's kind of flashed and disappointed.

1099
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:36,080
Well, the aliens came and they created a whole new planet, but it's a horrible, stinking planet, just like the one I was on in Earth.

1100
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,100
Exactly the same.

1101
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:44,900
I can't free myself from my preconceptions of what life is like, so my new life is ending up just like...

1102
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,260
Right, exactly.

1103
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:51,460
You know, you couldn't really imagine the sex goddesses sexing up you. Not really.

1104
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,200
I mean, you could fantasize, but you couldn't really believe it.

1105
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,880
Yeah, everything was just almost on the edge.

1106
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,360
You couldn't believe.

1107
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,760
Just almost on the edge.

1108
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,060
You know, and it's that lack of faith.

1109
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,680
It's that loss of nerve at the last second.

1110
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,580
Yes, I think that's what it was that made the red light go off and the smoke start expunging from the engine.

1111
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,820
It was bad mind control.

1112
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,560
I think you're being too hard on yourself.

1113
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,260
That's a great hard-on you've got there yourself.

1114
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,260
I think that's too much, man.

1115
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,560
What, to think that I would actually allow my mind to collapse?

1116
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,840
The fibers of my mind collapse so much that I would actually will bad luck on myself?

1117
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,840
Well, I suppose that maybe everybody else had great luck and you were the only one,

1118
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,760
but I think that Bob just screwed up, man.

1119
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,820
If I were you, I'd blame it on Bob Dobbs, not yourself.

1120
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,520
There's a lot I can blame on Bob Dobbs.

1121
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:41,480
I blame damn near everything on Bob Dobbs and all the rest you can blame on the conspiracy of the normals.

1122
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,980
But do you get any sort of requitment or respite out of blaming Bob?

1123
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:47,780
Hell yeah.

1124
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,220
You don't have to blame yourself.

1125
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,640
As my old friend Puzzling Evidence used to say,

1126
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:57,560
let's frop up so we can get back to hating the world instead of ourselves.

1127
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,700
That was true.

1128
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,300
That was what he said.

1129
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,500
I don't know if that's a response from Bob or if he's like the other guy.

1130
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,740
Well, Bob didn't even show.

1131
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,180
I mean, I didn't show almost, but Bob didn't show at all.

1132
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,320
He really didn't show.

1133
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,640
Well, he hasn't, but the last time he did, somebody shot him.

1134
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:15,260
Dead.

1135
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,800
Of course he's not going to show up again.

1136
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,920
There were a number of...

1137
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,880
Somebody will shoot him again.

1138
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:26,180
Ladies and gentlemen, with the assistance in the background of the legendary number six,

1139
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,380
Lord Estafa Trout Waxer.

1140
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:40,300
So just for those of you who are still trying to find your way into the word of Bob, I want

1141
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:44,320
to offer you some insights into the mystical techniques that we use.

1142
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:47,480
And the first one is very, very simple.

1143
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,180
It involves the mastery of the breath.

1144
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:54,400
So all of you breathe in the slack.

1145
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,800
Let me just hear you breathe.

1146
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,080
Everybody inhale.

1147
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,600
And breathe out the work.

1148
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,300
Breathe in the slack.

1149
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,700
And breathe out the work.

1150
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:14,740
Now even works better if you imagine that the shining face of Bob is in front of you,

1151
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,920
or better yet, the shining face of Connie is in front of you, in which case you can

1152
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,020
breathe in the pleasure.

1153
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,620
And breathe out the pain.

1154
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,240
Now.

1155
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:31,800
And the second thing I'd like to introduce you to is our sacred buddhas in the church.

1156
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,700
As you know, the buddhas have a mudra. They hold a hand up like this, little fingers down,

1157
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,480
and put their thumbs and big fingers up. That means something like,

1158
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,600
you'll be very lucky through your enlightenment through the Buddha.

1159
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,820
And then of course, the Hindus have their mudra. They make their thumb and their forefinger into a circle,

1160
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:53,920
representing the world. And the three other fingers sticking out represent Vishnu, Shiva,

1161
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,120
and Brahma, all together, all being one with the world.

1162
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,400
And that's how we start to make our subgenius mudra.

1163
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:06,140
It's that we get rid of Vishnu, and we get rid of Brahma,

1164
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:11,240
and we leave all these bombs sticking straight up in the air, saying,

1165
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,980
Fuck you! I'm gonna blow up the world!

1166
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,760
And so you can sit there on your throne of natural meditation,

1167
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:22,860
flat your hands, doing your mudra on your knees,

1168
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,660
and you can use the last technique I want to show you,

1169
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:31,940
which is to vibrate in the name of our Lord and Savior.

1170
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,840
Everyone take a big breath in, as low as you can, and as deep as you can.

1171
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,280
Everyone go . . .

1172
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,880
. . .

1173
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,100
And you can keep that up for as long as you want.

1174
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,760
If you keep it up for a long, long time, it will gradually wind its way higher,

1175
00:53:53,760 --> 00:54:01,000
and higher, and higher . . .

1176
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,820
And if you can climb for ten numbers of your pledge,

1177
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,380
doing that at once, it's a wonderful, wonderful thing.

1178
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:06,980
. . .

1179
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:14,080
Thank you, Reverend Bodhisattva Trout Waxer, and Number 6.

1180
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:20,600
Preceded there by some ESO Swamp radio from WCSB,

1181
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,720
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave Chasmith, and yours truly,

1182
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,800
Reverend Ivan Stang.

1183
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:30,640
Before that, Saint In and Hell in a Handbasket, live at 4X Day,

1184
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:36,440
and that version of Midnight Turning Pale by ESO, Einstein Secret Orchestra,

1185
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:42,140
likewise recorded at that great, great celebration that we did survive.

1186
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:49,340
And friends, you can learn more about everything from www.subgenius.com

1187
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:52,700
or write to the P.O. box number I'm about to give you,

1188
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:56,340
this music in the background is WOTAN music,

1189
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:03,340
just improvisational music by Dr. Philo Drummond, Number 6, and Hell Pope Huey.

1190
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:10,900
Special thanks to Reverend Susie the Flusie for her great WREK show excerpts.

1191
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:20,700
Friends, write to Bob at Post Office Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 4411.

1192
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:31,260
Me, I'm going back to Time Town, that's that cafe on my escape vessel with that dopey waiter praise, Bob.

1193
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:38,500
Thank you, Reverend Ivan Stang, for those wonderful, inspirational messages.

1194
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:45,060
And now during the cocktail here, cocktail hour here aboard the X's to the vessels of the space...

1195
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,560
I'm sorry, this is my first night here.

1196
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:52,400
Tonight, performing, we're going to be having the...

1197
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,680
Oh, jeez, I can't read these cards.

1198
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,940
Hairy women are going to be crucified.

1199
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:58,700
Was that your request, Reverend Stang?

1200
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,080
Oh, no, no, no, not crucified. I just want to see a live sex show.

1201
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,400
I thought you...

1202
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,600
I don't want to... No, I don't enjoy the violence.

1203
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,400
I thought you wanted to see a hairy...

1204
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:13,160
I've been watching that stuff all day on the view screens.

1205
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,940
It's not her suit to be crucified.

1206
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,380
No, no, I hate the hairy...

1207
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,080
She's a yeti.

1208
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:27,860
Would you like to pretend like there are more people in the audience so we can have more interactive and you can think of maybe something else you might want to do?

1209
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:32,600
No, I'm tired. I think I'll just sit here and listen to Elvis and...

1210
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,340
Would you like to...

1211
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:33,760
...drink?

1212
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:38,300
Would you like to drink real booze or would you like to drink some of the exacerbated booze?

1213
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:38,380
Yes.

1214
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,360
Would you like to drink some of the exacerbated booze?

1215
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:44,860
No, no, I'll just have this off and statters house standard here.

1216
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,500
Primo triple?

1217
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,600
No, no, no, just sit here.

1218
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,860
Would you like your toes shined?

1219
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:54,540
This isn't all I expected it to be. I'm tired and...

1220
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:58,220
It's my first day on the escape vessels. I'm already...

1221
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:58,700
Bored, Caviar?

1222
00:56:58,820 --> 00:56:59,180
Bored.

1223
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,320
Bored with pleasure and...

1224
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:04,560
...panty chocolate?

1225
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,880
Is this what it's going to be like?

1226
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,320
Oh, yes, yes.

1227
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:19,000
One day of having everything you want and by the end of the day, you've had enough. You're bored. You're ready for bed. You don't know what you're going to do the next day. You've had everything.

1228
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,520
Reverend, excuse me. The queen of the Nubians would like to do you again.

1229
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,660
I...I'm just...I don't care.

1230
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,460
I'd rather go on hearing your lies.

1231
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:34,520
Let me just listen. Leave me alone, drone, clone.

1232
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:35,720
The stage is barren.

1233
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,120
Not Sergio? Any of them?

1234
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,580
No, just go away. Shut the planet down. Shut off the sun.

1235
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,160
If that's your pleasure, Reverend, I will go away.

1236
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:49,780
Close down all the malls. Tell the hookers to go home. Or we're back to the factory, wherever they're made.

1237
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:53,240
Is your heart filled with pain?

1238
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:57,040
Shall I come back again?

1239
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,280
If only Elvis would come back.

1240
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,180
Tony D, are you lonesome?

1241
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,360
Hey, Reverend, babe.

1242
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,300
Claire, have a hit of this. You'll love it, man.

1243
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:12,380
Oh. Oh, thanks, Elvis. Maybe that'll make me feel better.

1244
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,360
Hey, it did.

1245
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:38,460
Now to death, in the name of the gods.

1246
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:38,460


1247
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:38,460
