See for yourself, a dog with two bodies and one head.
They're all on the inside right now.
A pig with hands and feet, just like a human, just like yours or mine.
A gruesome, ugly sight, but an educational one.
Come in now.
They're all on the inside right now.
The world's largest collection on tour.
And you're just in time.
Come in now.
Alive, alive, a cow with six legs.
Look, look at the doorway.
The six-legged cow is standing up in there right now.
You're going to see the zonkey, half zebra, half bulldog.
A midget horse standing, only 27 inches tall.
Look, look through the doorway.
They're in there right now.
Smell the aroma, and you know they're alive.
Alive, alive.
They're on the inside right now.
A raccoon with two heads.
A pig with two heads.
A rabbit with two heads.
They're on the inside right now.
Two complete heads on the same body, and they're on the inside right now.
Don't miss.

Is she girl?
Is she fish?
Or is she girl?
You judge for yourself.
And you're just in time.
Come in now.
The first thing that's going to happen is we're going to allow Andrew the Impaled to
finally finish his set with electricity.
So before he was only causing himself pain, and now he will cause us pain.
All right, this is going to be great.
You're not going to know what to think.
I hope you get to enjoy this very, very painful moment.

Now we all know you need a home. So find a bank and get a loan. Pay it back threefold. And if you
don't, out in the cold. You always can refinance if there comes a rainy day. Unless of course the

I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free.
Now go to school for your degree. To get a job, that's what you need. When you're done, you'll be

they would talk about the cannonballs that were off the shore there
from the war of 18
in fact John Shirley was

I have some ghost milk in my fridge now.
If there is normal ghost milk and fat-free ghost milk,
well, then in the creamier, fuller, tastier, thicker, fat-containing ghost milk,
look, it's the fat actually from a ghost.
So you've actually been milking these ghosts yourself,
or is this just the ghost milk you would buy in the stores?
It's a machine.
I have an automatic machine, a fully automatic machine.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
It does all the work, the dirty work, I like to call it, the ghost work.
You don't actually want to touch those ghost mammary areas or anything?
I want some.
The machine has a dial, you know, a knob.
I turn it to the right.
Is it really creamy?
Yeah.
Ghost style.
Is the ghost still creamy?
I've heard it's thin and insubstantial.
I'm turning on the pump now.
Just wait a minute.
Is it kind of...
Now, have you run into any trouble with the authorities coming down on you for ghost abuse?
He's got the machinery running, I think.
Yeah, I can hear the machinery.
The machinery is starting up.
Is it actually...
Actually, ghost fat.
Don't you put a little, like, some pads in there to keep the ghost comfortable?
Do you let the ghost imbibe in some type of intoxicant before you latch onto their breast area?
Is the ghost milk pasteurized?
I hope it is.
I hope we can get the pasteurized...
Although, I'd like to get some whole ghost milk if you have some of that.
Or some raw milk.
Raw ghost milk?
Raw ghost milk.
Yeah, raw ghost milk.
Raw ghost yogurt.
That's the best.
The only kind of milk I will drink from this moment is bastard milk.
Oh, yes.
Bastard milk?

Is that why Casper is fat now?
Because you've been feeding him ghost milk?
Have you been feeding a fat man lately?
Well, no.
Well, maybe he's got a ghost girlfriend.
Do you have chocolate ghost milk?
Well, I hate that.
Can I get some chocolate ghost cottage cheese?
Mm-hmm.

Yeah, chocolate ghost cottage cheese.
That sounds like ghost cottage cheese, ghost ice cream.
I think we're going to bring down the wrath of the authorities with this ghost abuse that's going on here.
Unless we make sure that they're comfortable while we're depriving them of their fluids.
You know, some planets, those fluids are very, very expensive.
And we can make a lot of money.
We've got to give this some careful consideration.

So if you know this song, please sing along.
And everywhere you heard the word Gandhi before, just change it for the next song.

And I'm going to sing the word Bob.
If you don't know the song, you know I've got CDs for sale.
They're only $10.
And I promise you I will only spend the money on wine, women, and froth.
Are you ready?
Oh my God, aren't they adorable?
Oh my God, they're very single too.

We're going to ascend to our native stars, a brighter and better world than this one.
Gleaming in glory.
After a night of dubstep and partying.
After a night of filth and imbecility.
Actually, the dubstep is tomorrow night, which can go on forever.
I thought it was tonight.
No, not tonight.
It was going to be tonight, but I said, it was me that said, I need to sleep before 7 a.m.
You changed the schedule then?
Huh?
You changed the schedule?
Yeah.
Well, no, it's in the schedule.
It's written in there.
The all-night long dubstep, which, by the way, you'll be interested to know,
the Starwood, the early Starwood people complained bitterly about that last year.
I mean, real bitterly.
So they couldn't take it, huh?
Oh, they come in early on Saturday.
Panty waste.
To get, you know, set up their witchcraft stills.
Wimpcraft.
Yeah.
Would they prefer, like, an all-night acoustic yodeling?
They drum all night long.
Oh, the drums.
They drum all damn night long.
The hideous drums.
What's the difference?
The beating of those hideous drums.
The drums.
The drums.
The natives are restless tonight.
But apparently the dubstep was too loud and went on.
Oh, that is sad.
So the pagans weren't able to rest in bowers of this.
They don't appreciate bass drops.
Yeah, really.
You know, if you can't suffer a little bit of discomfort for your so-called faith,

It only works when the sun shines.
And why would you can't hear the stage at a place where they've advertised
they're going to be making noise all night?
What kind of a fair-weather sailor are you, anyway?
Oh, the kind that wants to get a...
Just a minute of sleep, please.
No.
Try going to Burning Man.
Can you just shut up for a minute?
Try going to Burning Man, where they set enormous speakers pointed right at you from across the street.
And yet they don't complain about the giant dick-eating spiders.

They're silenced by the horror of it all.

Okay, friends, I think it's time to end the hour of slack.
It's now become completely slackless, unless you guys want to keep going.
Wait, I did have one more thing that I wanted to ask you guys.
I didn't know if you guys had talked about this yet.
Have you guys heard about on Facebook how they succumbed to the pressure and now you can get banned and have things?
It's completely ruined if you make any rape jokes at all.
I'm a little worried about the state of the slack hole.
We've got three Facebook pages that are nothing but.
And it's filled with the pink and the unsaved and the unwashed and unclean.
And I think it's probably only a matter of time before it gets reported again.
And I worry about it.
God forbid that there should be pornography on the Internet.
Well, but now if we even make jokes about rape bears,
which are awful,
they're obviously a favorite on the slack hole.
It's the most insidious form of censorship is when the government can do nothing,
but they can't stop people from censoring you who aren't with the government.
So they come up with a way that you can all communicate together
and then let somebody else make the rules.
And they'll decide what you can say and can't say.
And usually it'll be the government agreeing.
Well, you can or can't say.
Yeah, you can read my note there.
That's my rant note.
A serendipitous quote at the end of these rant notes is,
rape isn't funny.
It is the way we do it.
That's what's funny, the way we do it.
Yes.
But you'll have to be careful.
Don't be surprised if the whole Facebook comes crumbling down on our ears.
We're here overnight off face crack.
Oh, well.
Oh, well.
We'll just have to go to Scrub.
Yes.
Well, there you go.
The nice thing about it, you can't get into Scrub unless you get past old gatekeeper Stang.
You have to answer the riddle about when and exactly how you paid your 35 bucks.
We should just make the front butt book.
There you go.
Isn't that a common thing?
People say, well, no, I don't have any.
No, certainly not.
Are you sure?
Sure.
And because they don't recognize what's actually happening.
We should end it now.
We've upset you.
I'm sorry.
Oh, she gets upset.
She's so sensitive and sweet.
I'm so mean.
Well, at least she's sensitive.
Most people around here are about as sensitive as a power shovel.
That's me.
I've been working on that for years, building up a good shell.
Right.
Many, many butt cheeks.
I've got your sensitivity.
Right here.
I think I'll be hearing that a lot later tonight.
Okay, well, I'm going to fade this out.
Well, Ivan Stang, what is the theme of tomorrow's ball?
How about that?
You want to put that in the list?
Simple.
What was it again?
Day of the Dead.
The Day of the Dead.
I actually have a sack of skull masks of different kinds in my car.
Oh.
A whole sack of skull masks.
Dear Day of the Dead.
Attention, subgeniuses.
There will be a human fight and accu-beating clinic at the top of the hill at Camp Hypercube before the pig roast.
So get your third nostrils unclogged and meet us at the top of the hill for...
Possibly the bloodiest of the blood orgies to about to begin.
There will be nothing but tits.
At what time?
We shall begin in a few moments.
We were going to start a little later.
But if we can get a few subgenius volunteers to tie up some other subgenius volunteers and drag them kicking and screaming to Camp Hypercube,
we will flay and disperse.
We will dismember accordingly.
And we will be supervising and documenting quite heavily.
So, praise Bob.
Indeed.
I thought we were going to start all the flaying and torturing tomorrow, but that's okay.
Practice makes perfect.
My testicles are actually connected to my body most of the time.
But which body are you talking about?
The undescended testicle of Jesus Christ.
No, no.
If anybody sees a spare unclogged...
Unconnected testicle...
Please send them on home.
Drop us a line.
Okay.
Send them on home now, y'all.
That's a remote orbiting ball.
Send it home.
Send it, the homeless testicle tossed to me.
I lift my lump before the golden door.
You know, childhood innocence is now gone,
and we are left as cynical adults to weather the...
bitter winds that are blowing our way from X-Day,
from the launching platform area where the great saucer ship will descend.
Now, that was a large spaceship in eight and a half, too, wasn't there,
that never got off the ground?
Well, you didn't see it.
It wasn't on camera.
It took off after the movie was over.
I thought there were actually scenes where they were trying to construct that,
and they...
Oh, yeah.
They built a huge spaceship set under construction.
That was the set, an under-construction set of a set under construction.
And when the movie was finished, they could complete it and take off.
But it was important that it not fly during the movie.
Actually, I understand that that whole spaceship set ending was kind of an afterthought.
The movie was going to end a completely different way.
And just as the subject matter of the movie would indicate,
everything's fake and unpredictable and unplanned,
and you can't fit it all into a formula.
There's nobody at the controls.
And that's...
We like it that way.
It's fun.
It's organic.
It evolves on its own.
And slack comes dripping down from the heavens.
You'll get the best slack that way.
It's revolutionary.
There's no status.
There's constant movement.
Movement.
But aren't we closing in on the magic?
It's getting near the hour when we get to go home.
It's getting near the hour.
When the church lights yawn.
As El Duce would say,
it's near the hour.
Yes, it's time.
It's the time, girls.
Make the trains run on time.
And organize...
Oh, not El Duce.
I'm talking about El Duce.
Bob never made the trains.
I think that's one of the greatest things that you could say about Bob,
was the trains never ran on time when he was in charge.
I don't remember.
Oh, no, it was more than that.
When Bob was in charge,
it's not that the trains ran on time or didn't run on time.
It's that time ceased to have any meaning on the trains.
When railroads reorganized time,
our system of time was created by the American Railroad.
The trains ran on time.
Literally.
Instead of stopping at fueling stations with big bins of coal or diesel fuel,
there would be big bins of time that they would put into the fuel tanks of the trains.
The trains literally ran on time.
They would pour in from the hopper by the side of the tracks,
all those seconds, minutes, and pulped hours that had been crammed in by the service railroads.
In the summer, they would switch to daylight savings time,
which has a much lower octane.
Daylight savings time.
Nobody could ever really understand why they did that seasonal switch.
I think it had something to do with California regulations.
I don't know.
And in the winter, it was back to the fungus and the berries that their grandmothers had given them.
They looked out the window and knew that the time was nigh.
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
And praise Tommy Amoeba, the next entertainer on this Pittsburgh cabal.
Praise Bob!
They're our subgenius in Pittsburgh, and sadly, this is what we look like.
That made me salute my pants.
Woo!
Woo!

Yeah, Lord
I'm a hero
I'm a hero
Like Captain Kirk in Star Trek
Aboard the Enterprise
Surrounded by your high tech fantasy
You went out surprised
While jacking your tic-tac
You listened to these lies
And fizzled like fuck
Oh, take a look at this
What is this?
This is my
Lord, make way
I am here to pay
All the money
To me

Hey

unplugged. In fact, everything was unplugged that night at X-Day.
Lee Murr did PR News and
Jesus, and thanks to Dr. Sinister for
letting us on his show at WCSB Cleveland.
We'll hear a little more from that, but otherwise
all the rest is by and large by The Large.
Thank ya.
Yes! You know the...
And I think
it's hilarious when he yells out,
BOMBS!
And it took a while, like
months afterwards, and then I
watched the video again, and I was like,
nothing happened, and I was just very
interested in the video.
And that was it.
Actually, maybe a year later,
I started saying, BOMBS!
And then
everyone burst out laughing.
Everyone was like, BOMBS!
It's very funny.
To say BOMBS,
I thought in the video that it was hilarious
because it's not actually a swear word,
it's just his name.
I like BOMBS.
So that was funny.
And then, you know,
it evolved.
What did I get from other people?
Well, when I watched videos
that I'm a thon,
I'm a thon,
for example,
I'd start doing what they're doing,
or, you know, just do what I usually do.
So, yeah, it definitely
does get picked up.
I'm gonna see if I missed any questions here.
Pick up new ones and old ones go away,
or do old ones never go away?
Some old ones never go away.
They can be kind of...
kind of classics.
BOMBS!
BOMBS!
BOMBS!
BOMBS!
BOMBS!
BOMBS!
BOMBS!
BOMBS!
BOMBS!
BOMBS!
BOMBS!

BOMBS!
BOMBS!
BOMBS!
BOMBS!
BOMBS!
We're going to take one last call.
I can't wait to hear what this is.
I want to hear about the RNA trials.
I want to eat this.
I want to hear about the RNA drops.
Hello, you're on the air.
And join me.
Hello.
Hi, guys.
Are you on the air?
I want to know about the LSD drops.
MST drops.
Man, we're doing it, and we're just about out of time.
Yes, we are.
We could have done something here.
I just figured I'd try one last time before you all went home.
Well, thank you so much.
It's glad to hear from you.
I'm glad to hear from you.
It's good to hear from you.
It is good time.
It is good to hear.
I wanted to say I'm going to miss you guys because I wasn't going to be there for X days this year.
You know what?
No, I won't be there either, Janice.
That makes two of us.
The saucers will find you where you are.
What the hell are you doing?
Man, what the hell have I been doing for the last year?
I don't know.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I suddenly find myself without the means.
I suddenly find myself without the means.
Dragging your butt through the day.
Selling body and soul to a bunch of bad normals?
My daughter was tired of getting...
No, seriously, the conspiracy.
Oh, man.
You know what's really messed up?
You know what's really messed up?
There's a guy in a supervisory position who works on the same floor in my building.
His name is Bob.
And there's a Dobbshead sticker on his wall.
Dope.
And I'm afraid to bring it up.
I would be.
Yep.
Old Bob Cyclops.
Old Bob might take offense at...
Do they know?
Or did they just find a t-shirt in a thrift store somewhere?
Yeah, you never know where that came from.
As long as it doesn't actually say Bob, you have to suspect the worst.
That full knowledge is there.
And the...
What a day of reckoning.
Oh, here's what you can do, Dr. Sinister,
to determine if the guy is a for real subgenius.
See how he spells Bob.
That's it.
Yes.
I know for a fact that in correspondence that has been addressed to him and from him,
there are no quotation marks in his name.
Well, I don't mean his name.
I mean J.R. Bob Dobbs.
The actual Bob.
Yeah.
That is important.
This is important as drawing the pentagram right
when you're performing a magical operation.
What?
You just have to...
You have to draw...
Oh, no.
I got to go home immediately.
You have to put those quotes there.
You better get down that basement pretty quick, buddy,
or the whole house is going to start exploding.
Those amusing chalk drawings.
So, now we come to an end of another session.
If you think Bob's trains ran late,
wait till you see his saucers.
I mean, wait.
He has saucers as big as eyes.
No, the sky will be full of...
Full of ships.
And flame will illuminate the night
as the giant saucers the size of entire U.S. states
make a landing.
So, until next time, folks,
this is the last time we'll speak to each other on planet Earth.
It's been good knowing you.
Thanks for all the fish.
Thanks for all the $35 checks, everybody.
See you in the next world.
See you later, suckers!
See you later, suckers!
It's the last time we will speak to each other on planet Earth.
Staying off again.
Listen to them yowling and howling
in the agony of their own creation.
Well, we tried to warn them.
Anyway, it's been good to be on your show.
Yes, now they are...
And now they are doomed.
They didn't...
We will watch them burn.
...get with the program.
We tried and tried, you know.
I don't know if a professional propaganda ministry
could have really solved the problem.
You can lead a horse...
...to water, but you can't make him drink.
But you can waterboard it.
Well, you can lead a pink to the truth,
but you can't make him think.
And so, now they have to take it.
They have to roll over and take it.
Take their medicine.
And we, the subgeniuses, will snicker and laugh from afar,
sipping effete cocktails from the observation platforms
of the giant globe-spanning saucer ships.
We'll look down on the tossers from our seats
and the saucers.
Well, folks, I think this is as good a time as any
to end the program.
Ope.
This has been a special edition of Synesthesia.
If I manage to get the transmitter onto the saucers in time,
then I'll be broadcasting this time next week from Planet X.
If not, then Bob help us all.
X the Unknown.
Until whenever that next time is, whatever planet that's on.
Thank you, Dr. Hal.
Most welcome.
Thank you, Reverend Stang.
Aye, aye, sir.
Thank you, Princess Wee, even though you're in the other room right now and can't hear me.
Thank you, anyway.
And thank you to the callers who put up with all this.
Until next time, keep it surreal.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In matters of money, it's never wrong.
But in this case, it's complete.



And he's never wrong.
Completely wrong.
And we were moving furniture around.
And somebody said, a woman said, and I wasn't even looking in that direction,
but popped into my head.
And he said, why, I happened to, yes, it happened to be.
And I said, Bob.
And he said, fantastic.
And so I had, and just be looking right at the camera.
No idea at all.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.

Stop.

Stop.


Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.

You're not a slacker, sly sucker
But you're a sly, yeah, wild, wild, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wow, wow, wow, wow
This is all about Bob
Wow
We like to praise people. This is like a godlike thing.
You read to us all the consistence and dots.
It doesn't matter.
Maybe even Bob doesn't give those things to you that you want to have.
But maybe Bob cracks open like Faberge's egg and something comes out from there.
Something that really reflects the innermost truth behind the man-made words.
You know what I'm saying. The man-made words.
We're just making things worse with our codes and premeditated stuff.
And our norms and... you know...
Everything is so normal. Pink.
Reditude.
Unoriginal.
Uninspiring.
Unintelligent.
Not even as sexy as it used to be.
But let's still praise Bob for a while.
We're the funny weirdos making fun of the bad weirdos.
Thank you, The Large.

Praise Bob!
Believe me, your unpaid job doing data entry for Facebook will still be there when you get back.
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other radio stations.
And if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,
you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages
and help out financially as best you can.
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.
But some of you still have jobs.
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay dogs.
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.
P.O. Box 181-417.
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
