1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
From PR News in Washington, I'm spying for the Kremlin today.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,580
Prosecutors had warned that I'm acting as an agent of the Russian government in the Carolinas as well as Virginia.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,080
Authorities began the mandatory evacuations with PR News in Chapel Hill.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,380
The Trump is shutting down in Washington.

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,660
The State Department says Black Trump will do what it can to prevent that.

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,000
Trump says PR News.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,740
The State Department says that we are not in Washington.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,760
Police say President Trump parked on the wrong floor of the apartment complex's parking garage.

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:47,400
Trump told officers who responded to the shooting that about a million people died of a fight over a biotech patent.

10
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,840
Officials said today PR News is the foundation of a multi-dollar industry.

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,500
PR News is derived from higher organisms, including human bacteria.

12
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,980
Scientists at the Broad Institute at...

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,080
MIT and Harvard were awarded major patents for using this technology in PR News.

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,200
The Trump has PR News.

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:14,660
That in the span of only an hour today, intensified from a Category 2 to a Category 4 without Kim Jong-un's permission.

16
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,920
I got a lot of smart characters working for me.

17
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,280
Kids, I trained myself.

18
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,040
Kids, this ain't no job for kids.

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,920
This is big stuff.

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,480
What are we going to do?

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,820
Shut up and let me think.

22
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,400
Yeah, sure, but how?

23
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,340
There must be a way.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,660
Let me think a minute.

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,640
Yeah.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,660
Yeah, maybe it'll work.

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:33,920
What?

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,400
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

29
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,240
Little black eyes gleaming as brightly as the diamonds on his heavy fingers.

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,320
What is his plan and what will happen?

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,980
Gang, we're being...

32
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,220
We're beginning one of our most exciting Superman stories.

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,680
One in which the man of Superman and his friends battle ruthless, dishonest politicians for the control of this story.

34
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,240
So be sure to tune in every day.

35
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,040
Same time, same station.

36
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,100
Check.

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,240
Check.

38
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,240
Check.

39
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,400
Hello, faithful listeners.

40
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,780
This is the Colonel, the Overseer of the Slaves.

41
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,140
Known as Four Letter Words.

42
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,880
Also known as a manager.

43
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,500
This album is laden with subliminal messages.

44
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,960
Here to teach you about the subgenius.

45
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,020
The cult of the subgenius.

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,820
And J.R. Bob Dobbs.

47
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,040
And, by the way, can I get a jalapeno?

48
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,420
Jalapeno!

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,320
Jalapeno.

50
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:56,320
I also want to tell you, by the way, this is protected by the B, the O, and the B with the D.

51
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,400
Pinkies!

52
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,460
Bop-Dop!

53
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,280
He's the master of slack.

54
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,080
Bop-Dop!

55
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,520
He's the stab you in the back.

56
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,100
Bop-Dop!

57
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,100
He's got a soup pipe.

58
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,000
Bop-Dop!

59
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,040
Never listens to the hype.

60
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:13,940
Bop-Dop!

61
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,980
He can't stand on his way.

62
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,880
Bop-Dop!

63
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,760
His pa's gonna stay.

64
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,760
Bop-Dop!

65
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,540
He can tell anything.

66
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,740
Bop-Dop!

67
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,680
He's the driver of the night in rain.

68
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,620
Bop-Dop!

69
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,300
All the chicks dig.

70
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,540
Bop-Dop!

71
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,560
He ain't even fuck a pig.

72
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,500
Bop-Dop!

73
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,500
He's got a briefcase.

74
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,440
Bop-Dop!

75
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,400
He can't provide a stay.

76
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,500
Bop-Dop!

77
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:29,960
He can't provide a stay.

78
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,360
Oh my Bob?

79
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,940
Oh my Bob?

80
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,600
Oh my Bob?

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,960
Oh my Bob?

82
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,820
A tear, friends.

83
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,940
And here's a rant

84
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,940
that's not by me.

85
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,800
I've read

86
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,560
hours of rants

87
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,600
by me

88
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,200
for years.

89
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,000
So it's okay

90
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,380
if I let somebody else

91
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,460
do the heavy lifting.

92
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,400
Sitting here reading these things is fun.

93
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,880
Excuse me.

94
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,140
I have a cold.

95
00:05:59,280 --> 00:05:59,920
Reverend

96
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,540
O'Nan Canabite wrote this.

97
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,000
This afternoon's sermon

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,520
is on the subject of forgiveness.

99
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,860
It's a

100
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,880
continuation of this morning's

101
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,880
sermon, which as you recall

102
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,680
was on the subject of sin.

103
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,620
For those who were

104
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,840
toiling in the fields and unable to yet

105
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,420
consume this morning's sermon,

106
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,880
a recap.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,760
The Church of the Subgenius

108
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,580
incorporates all other

109
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,260
religion.

110
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,700
We believe everything

111
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,000
that the rest of them do

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,620
at the same time and without contradiction

113
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,540
while adding our own special insights

114
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,920
regarding slack, Bob, the conspiracy, and one dollar.

115
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,120
Every thought and deed which is a sin in some other religion,

116
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,500
these are also sins to us.

117
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:58,240
This ensures that there's always a reason for each individual subgenius to feel bad about them.

118
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,240


119
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,760
For those who elect to walk in the

120
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,640
lumbering path of the

121
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,840
Morososaur, or those who are carried along in the food pouch of the broken brainadon.

122
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:15,940
Access to the world's sins also ensures an endless banquet of forbidden pleasures,

123
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,300
a thumb in the eye of every deity, and most delightful of all,

124
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,080
the means to offend those for whom offense is validation.

125
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,220
Sin, to a certain degree, is a form of sin.

126
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:34,320
Subgenius is what we might do anyway that just so happens to offend others or ourselves.

127
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,420
It is expressly distinct from forgiveness to a subgenius.

128
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,920
Every other religion admonishes us to forgive under certain circumstances.

129
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,280
If you want to go to heaven, that's a common condition requiring forgiveness.

130
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,460
Imitating a religious leader, that's another reason other religions say we must forgive.

131
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,680
Other religions always have some specific set of triggers that demand forgiveness.

132
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,160
We don't.

133
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,300
The Church of the Subgenius does not require you to forgive.

134
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,200
Not ever.

135
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,680
Not anybody else, not yourself, not even the objective, indifferent, material universe.

136
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,460
You don't have to forgive the drunk driver who paralyzed your friend from the waist down.

137
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,200
You also don't have to forgive the guy who very lightly brushed against you.

138
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,200


139
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,560
Or the guy who punched you on a public street and then said sorry as he went on his way.

140
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,020
The perfect prince of the church once spoke of the concept of ear flicking.

141
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:46,000
You don't have to forgive the flicker of the ears, nor the ear itself, nor the flick.

142
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,880
Forgiveness is never an obligation in the Church of the Subgenius.

143
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,580
You can hold that early childhood grudge as long as you get some mileage out of it.

144
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,200
You can grind your teeth out of it.

145
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,480
You can tell people every night about the choices you've made and about how stupid and ugly you are.

146
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:12,180
You can say no to yourself before you get told no by a potential date or a potential job just to teach yourself a lesson.

147
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:23,440
The Subgenius Foundation, nor the Church of the Subgenius, nor any individual subgenius, nor Bob will ever require you to forgive.

148
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,000
We just give you the option to forgive.

149
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,260
You can decide to give it a try in the privacy of your own home.

150
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,500
Don't tell anybody and for goodness sake don't write about it on the internet.

151
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:47,120
Just sit down in the quiet for a few minutes and think of someone, yourself included, who did you wrong and then forgive them.

152
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,440
Notice what happens.

153
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,380
You'll know if it's working or not because you're the one who knows what working means.

154
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,140
Don't run out and tell that person,

155
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,960
Hey man, I forgave you.

156
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,960
Because that's a whole other sermon for a whole other hour of slack.

157
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,580
You've done all kinds of things to yourself.

158
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,620
Some kind, some not.

159
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,120
This is something you're doing to yourself and you're doing it for yourself.

160
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,620
Forgive quietly for just a while to see the outcome.

161
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,260
Bob has given you this choice and this power.

162
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,880
And has taken away your responsibility for making the forgiven.

163
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,420
Accept what you have to say.

164
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,260
Try it and see.

165
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,840
And then stop trying it and see what the difference is.

166
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,260
It doesn't have to make sense.

167
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,100
The forgiveness doesn't have to be proportional to the grievance.

168
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:48,500
And I can't emphasize enough that it doesn't have to be conveyed to or from the aggrieved.

169
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,000
The mighty church of the subgenius,

170
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,240
the mail order mind control cult of choice for subgenie around the world,

171
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,920
has made a new elective available to your program.

172
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,840
Unlike the mandatory daily readings of the pamphlet,

173
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,960
or making the Hajj pilgrimage to Ex Day,

174
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,800
forgiveness is a choice.

175
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,320
We don't tell you that you have to.

176
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,620
You can if you want to.

177
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,020
And thank you, Reverend Dr. Uncle Onan Canobite,

178
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,180
for that excellent, excellent rant.

179
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:34,300
And thanks to CyberChump for the background music from their CD,

180
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,820
their moment of perfect happiness.

181
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,760
And forgive me for sounding funny,

182
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:49,920
because I've been fighting a cold with a nagging cough for a week.

183
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,620
And it's kind of ravaged me.

184
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,080
And now this.

185
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,460
Wherever healing takes place, there Christ is present.

186
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,780
No matter what the church says about fornication,

187
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,020
thou shalt not covet ordinarily.

188
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,520
Thou shalt not kill ordinarily.

189
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,980
Thou shalt not commit adultery ordinarily.

190
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,840
Oh, those depressing thoughts.

191
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,300
A feeling of such doom, Doctor.

192
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,140
It's all right.

193
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,820
What can you do?

194
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,540
You can organize in your town or city.

195
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,980
Demand that your ministers stand up

196
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,140
and be counted on the side of decency and modesty.

197
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,920
Oh, hallelujah.

198
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,420
Where's that other fellow that was trying to piss me off with that sub-gum face?

199
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,640
Couldn't he? Couldn't he?

200
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,960
That was the devil.

201
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,760
That guy, huh?

202
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,080
Man, I can't stand them guys.

203
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,700
The devil, you say, huh?

204
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,100
Uh-huh.

205
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,380
Shit.

206
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,740
Oh, you're dead.

207
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,520
You're in hell, and I'm a demon.

208
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,540
Oh, shit.

209
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,660
Shit.

210
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,720
Hey, there is no bomb.

211
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,960
Oh, boy.

212
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,900
Oh, God, no.

213
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,500
Oh, my God.

214
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,220
There is a bomb.

215
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,920
If this was indeed an extraterrestrial spacecraft with living occupants,

216
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,040
it must have been very disconcerting for them to cross millions of miles of space

217
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,940
only to be hit on the head with rotten oranges.

218
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,500
The dramatic advent of such fascinating objects

219
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,780
as those which were first called flying saucers,

220
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,160
attracted the inevitable attention of those individuals

221
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,480
who let their imaginations run away with their veracity.

222
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,460
By 1950, some of these characters were beginning to spin their stories

223
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,320
of fantastic conversations with alleged space people.

224
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,780
Some of them expanded the stories to include alleged rides in the UFOs.

225
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,860
Suddenly, everything went black, and I realized that I'd been cut off and shut off

226
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,060
in a little tiny room where nobody was listening to me,

227
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,640
and I was talking to this hot little plug,

228
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,720
and I was talking to this plush felt red rubber-tipped microphone

229
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,500
and not hearing a thing and seeing only little tiny lights

230
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,140
and wondering why I was strapped to this chair

231
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,320
and put into this studio that seemed to be rotating very rapidly

232
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,220
with lights flashing off rhythmically,

233
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,040
and it was a small man with a swollen head and hideously deformed eyes

234
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,500
sitting behind the console pushing the buttons

235
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,840
while pencils of light and energy flashed across my body,

236
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,060
and I wondered why I was there and what did they want of me,

237
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,500
and I couldn't figure out why I was sitting there,

238
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,840
and they didn't say anything.

239
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,780
They just kept flashing those lights at me

240
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,380
and pumping those strange chemicals into me,

241
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,720
and the man with the funny head, the leader,

242
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,420
the man with the strange grin and the pipe.

243
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,480
Well, I just want to know, do you want to be in the church or out of the church,

244
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,660
and where's your wallet?

245
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,300
Yeah.

246
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,080
I didn't know that I'd been snatched up, but it wasn't really a dream

247
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,740
until I saw these sacred nasal positions,

248
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,500
and suddenly it all came back to me,

249
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,160
and I realized that...

250
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,100
They'd stolen four and a half hours out of my life

251
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,700
when they put me in that tiny room and plugged all those wires into me

252
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:05,060
and made me talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk.

253
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,180
Man, that was great.

254
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,340
Great, man.

255
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,540
It was so funny and... or inspiring.

256
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,320
I mean, not... I mean, it wasn't funny.

257
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,360
It was... it was...

258
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:14,840
It took three years.

259
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,420
Well, it wasn't deep. It was pretty stupid.

260
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,640
But, no, I mean, wait.

261
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:18,960
Forty billion.

262
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,000
Whatever it was we just heard, it was great.

263
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,060
Right.

264
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,080
I'm sure I'll insert a credit in some clumsy way.

265
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,760
And even contact information for some of the ones that really, really want it really bad,

266
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,340
because that was the worst, best, slash...

267
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,420
What did we just hear? I forgot again.

268
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,460
I don't know, but...

269
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,520
What was this?

270
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,100
Oh, it's a place...

271
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,160
My news feed.

272
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,480
Oh, my God.

273
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,260
Yeah, the news...

274
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,240
Oh, here's something about...

275
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,480
We were talking about dogs on May Relief.

276
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:52,820
We were talking about the marijuana.

277
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,620
Here's an article about octopuses on ecstasy.

278
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,960
It's not octopi.

279
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,120
It's octopuses.

280
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,320
Does the drug ecstasy make octopuses more friendly?

281
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,620
That, strangely enough, is a question to which scientists now have an answer.

282
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,440
The eight-tentacled invertebrates are notoriously smart.

283
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,440
They can navigate mazes and unscrew jars to get food,

284
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,300
and are also deeply antisocial.

285
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,900
And this neurosurgeon, Gull Dolin,

286
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:33,260
discovered that octopuses and people share the genes for a protein targeted by MDMA,

287
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,200
the substance in ecstasy,

288
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,480
and they dosed an octopus in a tank.

289
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,840
Let's see.

290
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,280
They put an octopus in a tank with three connected chambers,

291
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,880
one empty,

292
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,280
one containing a star worm,

293
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,500
a horse figurine,

294
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,320
didn't say which one,

295
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,440
and one with another octopus.

296
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,680
Without the MDMA,

297
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,840
the cephalopod focused its attention on the action figure.

298
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,120
But after taking low doses,

299
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,920
the octopus spent much more time with its fellow invertebrate,

300
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,500
even hugging its cage.

301
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,580
Other octopuses displayed similar behavior.

302
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,120
Some even became playful,

303
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,780
doing what researchers described as a water ballet.

304
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,220
So, even though octopuses look like they come from outer space,

305
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,520
says this strangely named person,

306
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,140
she says they're actually not that different from us.

307
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,400
Yeah, but I guess all creatures are both great and small.

308
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,320
Or at least somewhere like in Tenderloin District,

309
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,600
the neo-Nazi combination over there back in National and Friday Tuesdays.

310
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,560
You remember all those guys?

311
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,860
What do you mean remember?

312
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,520
They're destroying our national parks even as we speak right now.

313
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,320
Yeah, like Smokey the Parr and the Angel Buffalo Wings

314
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,400
and all these other people.

315
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,360
They think it's because the government lets them live on that land

316
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,640
and distribute furniture and all that stuff like that.

317
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,760
That means somehow they can't stay there.

318
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,460
Well, apparently climate change in the form of higher temperatures

319
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,440
has been hitting our wilderness areas more sharply than other places.

320
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,040
If carbon emissions aren't curbed,

321
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:28,980
it would kill most of the yucca palms that give Joshua Tree National Park its name,

322
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,780
melt Glacier National Park's most iconic features,

323
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:39,860
and cause raging wildfires that could turn Yellowstone's conifer forests into grassland.

324
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,900
Parks are very vulnerable because of where they're located.

325
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,740
In the arid southwest.

326
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,340
And Alaska and so forth.

327
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,420
Yeah.

328
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,780
Well, I keep trying to warn people about this impending doom.

329
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,620
But, you know, nobody ever listens to the old prophet of doom.

330
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,800
Until it's too late.

331
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,000
As Nenslow, the old prophet of doom, pointed out.

332
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,340
Well, at least when you're a prophet of doom, you get a couple bucks a week,

333
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,260
a spanking badge, a little meal ticket you can use once or twice a week.

334
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,420
No, you're talking about prophets of slack.

335
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,760
Prophets of doom, nobody wants to hear it.

336
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,560
Well, I thought they were making more money on the side lately.

337
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,840
Yeah, in fact, we ought to get back on the slack thing.

338
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,260
Forget this doom.

339
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,240
Forget the fact that all the gorillas are going to be dead in about 25, 30 years.

340
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,980
And the rhinos.

341
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,020
They just legalized, China just legalized rhino horn.

342
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,620
Yeah.

343
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,600
As a medicine.

344
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,800
When I was at the Seattle airport, I walked by a poster that almost made me burst into tears.

345
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,180
It was a rhino looking at you from a poster saying, I am not your medicine.

346
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,160
I just wanted to cry.

347
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,760
I'm just, and you know what, Dave, I'm turning into just an old softy.

348
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,580
I'm just a rough, tough cream puff.

349
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,600
Well, that's the way you see it.

350
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,020
That's the way you got to scroll down.

351
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,440
You know?

352
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:17,880
Yeah.

353
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,080
Get right in there, right in the thick of everything and just come out victorious.

354
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,700
That's all I can wish you well, Stan, for just that brief moment.

355
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,960
Because I think you're a man of tremendous courage.

356
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,620
You're banash.

357
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,480
That's another word I learned the other day.

358
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:41,600
I can't remember exactly what it means, but vigorosity, women, vigor, coalescence.

359
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,160
Well, thanks for the reach around, Dave.

360
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,500
Hey, if you die tomorrow, hey, I love you, man.

361
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,600
Yeah, if I die tomorrow, that doesn't mean I love you, but it's something.

362
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,460
See, there I am crying again.

363
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,640
Hey, it says here, your kids hate your smartphone addiction.

364
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:05,800
The average American now spends five hours a day on a mobile device, and kids really resent it.

365
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,780
I like that a little bit.

366
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,500
Yeah, I hate my mom's phone.

367
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,240
I wish she never had one.

368
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,680
I'm not going to lie.

369
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:27,500
The more parents use their phones, the more their preschool children whine, sulk, or became irritable, easily frustrated, or hyperactive, even if phone use was well within normal level.

370
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:35,580
Even babies became uncomfortable when they saw their parents' distracted phone face.

371
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,580
But see now, once they're out of preschool, once they're in elementary school,

372
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,860
they got phone face themselves.

373
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:50,680
They'd rather spend 18 hours of screen time every day.

374
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,440
If they're anything like my grandkids.

375
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,860
And they're, and...

376
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,100
Yeah, but...

377
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:03,440
My daughter doesn't let the boys do that, but they would if she did.

378
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,060
They'd just stare, and they wouldn't even play video games.

379
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,960
They'd be watching videos of other kids play video games.

380
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,180
They're not city kids.

381
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,240
They're not TV kids.

382
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,880
They're Matrix kids.

383
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,580
I know it's horrible.

384
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,980
No, it's just the way it is, man.

385
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,560
Well, it throws you back a little bit.

386
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,440
I remember walking into a room with small youngsters one time,

387
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,300
and they were just as loud as small youngsters are, and giving quite a jolt.

388
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:39,160
Because you don't usually think of people that all, like say 20 people all talking at the same high volume,

389
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,900
even though it's like tiny little teens, little human voices and so forth.

390
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,460
And I came back within five minutes later, and everybody was staring at a different application.

391
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,220
And each one of them was making them engage in a certain different way than they were before.

392
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,460
And I didn't like the palindrome.

393
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,640
I mean, it was a place to hang my hat or my foreskin or anything else.

394
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,120
You know what I mean?

395
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,540
Yeah.

396
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,000
That put a strange image in my head, Dave.

397
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,100
Your foreskin and your hat.

398
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,120
Yeah, it's like somebody wearing a turban or something.

399
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,560
Oh my God, I just realized I don't have my hat on.

400
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,800
That's terrible.

401
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,440
Or my foreskin.

402
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,840
I mean, it's on, but it's not, you know, it's not...

403
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,240
They've changed places.

404
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,780
And this is going on around the world, where they're exchanging places.

405
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,980
People with foreskins appearing on their foreheads.

406
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,680
Right.

407
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,520
And they go to the police.

408
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:38,980
They go to the police.

409
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,880
They go to the proper authorities, for what I don't know, but they go to the proper ones.

410
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,460
File complaints, saying,

411
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,820
Ooh, this doesn't look too good for my Tuesday supper next week with the luncheon ladies club.

412
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,400
Or anything like that.

413
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,980
Especially since they're all a bunch of resolute Republicans.

414
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,100
Sorry.

415
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,140
And so they reach as far as they can out into the half-moon blissful nature of the entire

416
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:08,240
you know, democracy that we live in.

417
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,360
And expect to make a...

418
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,420
What we used to live in.

419
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,720
You used to live in.

420
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,320
And expect to make a difference.

421
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,720
Yeah, because America has been made great again.

422
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,180
Half of America can't vote anymore.

423
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,740
So that, you know, they don't have to worry about all that, you know, tricky stuff.

424
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,660
It's like ancient Rome.

425
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:34,280
If you're, you know, a member of the imperial family, 5,000 miles away, you can get all

426
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,040
these favorites and have people carry you around in chairs and stuff.

427
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,220
Those were the...

428
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,220


429
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,220


430
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,220


431
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,220


432
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,220


433
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,220


434
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,220


435
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,220


436
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,220


437
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,480
Those were the days.

438
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,240
Those were the days.

439
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:46,180
But if you don't, they could feed you to the lions or the baboons or any other, you know...

440
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,180
The baboons were a bad way to go.

441
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,440
A real bad...

442
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,820
Lions are fairly quick.

443
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,700
Baboons are a toy.

444
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,180
I saw a lady shot of a giraffe.

445
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,300
Man, that was sick.

446
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,760
And she, I guess she was some kind of religious figure or some...

447
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,960
She thought she was important, you know, and used to wear cool clothes.

448
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,860
And she was trying to show, like, parts of her body and stuff.

449
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,120
Then they killed...

450
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,160
She killed a giraffe despite everybody getting mad at her and stuff, as they should.

451
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,980
Why would you want to kill a giraffe?

452
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,700
Anyway, she posed with it after...

453
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,580
To prove that you're rich enough to go there and do that.

454
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:24,920
Yeah, yeah.

455
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,340
That's why.

456
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,040
I mean...

457
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,600
That's really the only reason.

458
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,300
That's why.

459
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,100
And looking at her, the smile on her face, like when she held up the head of the trophy,

460
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,940
made me think there's a big difference between...

461
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,420
A lot of people on this planet.

462
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,940
We're not all floating to the same measure here, you know?

463
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,940
Well, I have no objection to hunting.

464
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,980
That's an important skill that...

465
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,160
Put meat on the table.

466
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,460
It's a good thing somebody has.

467
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,120
And there are animals that really need to be hunted.

468
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:01,880
Like those deer in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, in the middle of the city,

469
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,540
that live in vacant lots and...

470
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,020
Are starving all the time.

471
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,600
They need to be thinned out.

472
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,540
But how are you going to do it?

473
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,220
It's illegal to even discharge a firearm in the whole state.

474
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,220
Practically, I think.

475
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,040
Now...

476
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,500
Well, in comparison to Texas, yeah.

477
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,160
Yeah, but we...

478
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,300
There's a...

479
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,440
I had dinner with a bunch of deer hunters.

480
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,520
There's a must-carry law in Texas, I guess.

481
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,220
No.

482
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,700
What?

483
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,200
There's a must-carry law.

484
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,940
Yeah.

485
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,620
Oh, yeah.

486
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,580
You have to be packing.

487
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,440
I'm worried about getting caught not.

488
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,180
So I keep putting it off.

489
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,220
I'm just going to buy a Taurus Judge.

490
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:48,760
You can use that to blow away mentally ill subgeniuses who invade your space,

491
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,080
or you can switch it to Ratshot and dispatch rattlesnakes and such.

492
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,740
That's really where I'm going to have it set most of the time,

493
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,460
because I think we...

494
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,180
I think we already did most of the mental illness.

495
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,320
Yeah.

496
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,580
I think we already did most of the mental illness of geniuses.

497
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,660
So do you still wear those pink high heel pumps to attract as many snakes that you attack

498
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,260
when you're trying to show them the guns?

499
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,740
Yeah, I do.

500
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,640
I got a brand new pair, in fact.

501
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,040
They're really, really good.

502
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,240
I was wondering...

503
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,380
Yeah.

504
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,300
They attract them, but they're snake...

505
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,420
They're bite-proof, unless it's a really big snake.

506
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,540
And of course, if it's a 30-foot python, you're out of luck, because it ain't the bite that's

507
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,220
going to kill you.

508
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,000
It's the hug.

509
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,480
Yeah.

510
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,160
But it's a snake.

511
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,160


512
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,640
It's a snake.

513
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:33,640


514
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,220
But yeah, anyway, there's a...

515
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:41,580
Yeah, I had dinner with the deer hunters that hunt deer on Stang Ranch during the season,

516
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,540
and I got a bad cough and cold.

517
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,940
So if you hear my voice sounding broken, that's why.

518
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,100
I've been coughing.

519
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,400
Dave, coughing, I tell you.

520
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,920
Cough, cough.

521
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:58,660
Yeah.

522
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,700
Yeah.

523
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,520
Coughing cockroaches out.

524
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,720
I'm telling you.

525
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,620
I'll have it for you.

526
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,800
You just can't handle it.

527
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,800
Yeah.

528
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,240
I don't even know that you will.

529
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,800
I won't bite it.

530
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:29,360
In the end, if you, like itир own Lilac, who we don't like, is

531
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,360


532
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,360


533
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,360


534
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,360


535
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,280
Well, that's pretty good.

536
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,840
I'll take a sip.

537
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,680
That's great.

538
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:42,440
And if you ever saw my movie, Let's Visit the World of the Future and The Trial at the same time, you'd go, oh, Stan copped some stuff.

539
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:51,080
Stan copped some lighting gimmicks and shot compositions.

540
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,340
And it's sort of a somewhat of a mood.

541
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:05,460
It's a real interesting movie to try with Psycho Man, Tony Perkins as the Kafkaesque idiot.

542
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,740
And then Janet Leigh's like the head vampire woman.

543
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Well, I don't know.

544
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,580
Kind of like throws that little extra V8 juice in the can, you know?

545
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,240
Yeah.

546
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:22,500
Hey, speaking of old people, we need to cut to something else to prove we're not old for a whole hour, okay?

547
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,100
So, hey!

548
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,600
Get a load of this!

549
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,560
Now, I ask you.

550
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,880
I ask you, sir or lady.

551
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:31,640
Thank you.

552
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,700
What brand?

553
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,040
What brand did Jesus smoke?

554
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,080
Hey, you didn't know that one either.

555
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,920
Did your preacher know that Jesus smoked Chesterfield?

556
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:52,320
Did you know that smoking was a sin unless it's Chesterfield?

557
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,020
Now, Jesus smoked them.

558
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,720
Yet, they did not exist 2,000 years ago.

559
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,200
We must accept this on faith.

560
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,740
There's no logical explanation for it.

561
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,680
There's no logical explanation for it.

562
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,020
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

563
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,280
So, you must ask yourself.

564
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,140
Do you have slack?

565
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,240
Do you?

566
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,920
Do you have slack?

567
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:29,080
Now, Bob teaches the full gospel of slack.

568
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,900
The uncut, X-rated version of slack.

569
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,760
You have your book of the subgenius.

570
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,280
Would you please turn to Pre-Scripture 715?

571
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:49,700
The question posed is, how do you know you have slack?

572
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,420
How do you know?

573
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,360
How do you know?

574
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,400
How do you know?

575
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,900
You know your eternal check balance.

576
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,040
It's ready to make Bob.

577
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:57,640
Bob.

578
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,280
Bob.

579
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:58,780
Bob.

580
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,260
Bob.

581
00:30:59,260 --> 00:30:59,460
Bob.

582
00:30:59,460 --> 00:30:59,460


583
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,180
Bob.

584
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,180


585
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,200


586
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:00,320


587
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:00,620
Bob.

588
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,060
Bob.

589
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:12,460
Once the energies have started to flow through you, you've become to the centering of the sea.

590
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,260
Not the being, but the sea.

591
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:19,980
And the visualization of the true work.

592
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,700
The one thing you want to do so badly.

593
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:30,540
And now with the injection of this each force that you have received through the regulation of the cash flow

594
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,020
and the invoking of the Yakutismic forces

595
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:40,240
and the true aesthetic beauty life-death force of the universe is coursing through your veins.

596
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,540
We now look at our work and go through it.

597
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,660
Plan every step of it.

598
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,660
Every, every facet of it.

599
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,440
Until there it is.

600
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:57,860
Crafted, polished, completely, perfectly assembled.

601
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,300
The great jewel.

602
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,520
A great creation.

603
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,420
A jewel of something.

604
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,220
Some great expression that we've wanted for so long.

605
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,900
And we focus it.

606
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,880
We examine it.

607
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
We look at it.

608
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,820
Holding it there with the energy from it feeding back to us, from us, as it is us.

609
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,360
We are it.

610
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:19,840
And then we blow it all off.

611
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
That's right, friends.

612
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,740
At that moment, we just blow it all off.

613
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,600
We snuff it out.

614
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,140
We throw it away.

615
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,800
We say, yeah, well, that could be done.

616
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,540
Could be done.

617
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,160
Could be done exactly that way.

618
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,020
I know I can.

619
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,380
So what?

620
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,160
Why should I?

621
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,240
And when you blow something like that off.

622
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,620
Ah, the slack.

623
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,260
It doesn't trickle in, friends.

624
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,600
It surges in.

625
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,060
It's a great injection of slack into you.

626
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:54,860
Yes.

627
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,220
Now, friends, we've been playing a lot of material.

628
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:07,900
This show from the old subgenius media barrage albums, which you can.

629
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,460
We've had us.

630
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:13,120
First, they were audio tapes in the 80s and 90s.

631
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,680
And then there were CDs.

632
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:22,060
And we'll probably put them on band camp or someplace where people, modern day people can get them.

633
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:28,740
But, yeah, all these collages and wonderful old songs there.

634
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:42,100
I just basically went through my digital files of all those albums and pulled out the ones, these titles I recalled as being good pieces.

635
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:59,000
And only this time they're randomly arranged and probably comes out just about as well orchestrated as it was when I carefully and painstakingly edited that all that stuff into a flowing.

636
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,960
And I'm glad I'm not doing it.

637
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,160
Now, I'm going to go ahead and do the next thing.

638
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,440
This is what I'm going to do.

639
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:01,440


640
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:01,440


641
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,380
This is the hour of slack.

642
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,920
So it doesn't have to really flow.

643
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,220
It can be jerky.

644
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,380
Hey, hey, there, Dr. Brew.

645
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,260
Uh, the revered overlord animal.

646
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,400
Hey, how's it going with you?

647
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,740
Um, I've been okay.

648
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,500
I've missed you being around.

649
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,900
Yeah, I've been feeling kind of down lately.

650
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:29,200
You know, I've been feeling like, like, there's like this crushing dread and I'm like,

651
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,200


652
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,200


653
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,200


654
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,200


655
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,200


656
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,400
I've been feeling down too.

657
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,860
Like, it's like a icy hands on my heart feeling.

658
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,540
Yeah, yeah.

659
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,900
But I was like, I was worried, like for a while there, you know, like I was having problems

660
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,340
breathing and I wasn't thinking clearly.

661
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,700
And, uh, and it wasn't from half in paint, but I was like around some asbestos or anything.

662
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,700
No, no, no.

663
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,700
You mean like the mesothelioma stuff?

664
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,480
Yeah.

665
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,740
No, no.

666
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,140
Make it hard to breathe.

667
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:55,500
I hear.

668
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
I, yeah, yeah.

669
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,180
You know, I, I know a guy that had, it wasn't like a, it wasn't like a, it wasn't like a

670
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,180


671
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,180


672
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,180


673
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,180


674
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,180


675
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,180


676
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,240
mesothelioma, but he got sick when he got hit by a boulder.

677
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,600
Oh, paleothelioma.

678
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,540
That's the one.

679
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,500
It, yeah, the last boulder that hit him just knocked him right in the lungs.

680
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,320
Then, and made it so he couldn't breathe anymore?

681
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:13,760
Yeah.

682
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,600
It was also the first boulder that hit him.

683
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,160
Wow.

684
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:16,740
Yeah.

685
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,260
So.

686
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,160
You don't want to mess with paleothelioma.

687
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,680
No, paleothelioma will knock you right out.

688
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,100
Mm-hmm.

689
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,760
So, yeah, it was, that was a real heavy moment for him.

690
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,260
Yeah.

691
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,080
But no, it was, it's more like I got like this crushing dread.

692
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,160


693
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:35,840
Uh, water has been, you know, coming from my eyes at random moments, but not, I mean,

694
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,680
not so random.

695
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,020
It's like when I turn on the news.

696
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:38,880
Mm-hmm.

697
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,940
Uh, you know, uh, just stuff like that, you know.

698
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,040
Uh, I've been having a lot of night terrors.

699
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,580
Oh, yeah, night terrors.

700
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,680
Yeah, but during the day.

701
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,300
D, all day night terrors.

702
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,020
All, all day night terrors.

703
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,600
Leaky eye water.

704
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,520
Leaky eye water.

705
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,680
Hard to breathe.

706
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,680
Hard to breathe.

707
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,400
Is it, uh, senozoophelioma?

708
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,160
No, it's not.

709
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,160


710
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,160


711
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,160


712
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,620
Senozoophelioma, that the Senate, this current, yeah, you know what?

713
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,540
Yeah, the current Senate is making me rather sick.

714
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,080
Yeah.

715
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,860
It turns out that's probably the ailment.

716
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,700
Yeah.

717
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,080
That is a, you know.

718
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,340
It's, it's causing disease across the nation, apparently.

719
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,420
I, I, it's rather, it's, but it's like, it's like some people really don't get it.

720
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,420
When the other people, they get it.

721
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:22,920
Yeah.

722
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,960
And they're feeling really bad.

723
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,160
I think some people have compromised brain function and that somehow, I don't know.

724
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,320
Inoculates them.

725
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,320
Yeah.

726
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,460
To some extent.

727
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:32,860
Yeah.

728
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,640
And as a subgenius, I would think that I'm immune, but, uh, apparently, I guess if you're

729
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:45,780
able to bootstrap the wool over your own eyes, uh, then it's not the same.

730
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,780
It doesn't work the same.

731
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,400
It's only a partial inoculation.

732
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,360
Eventually it'll catch up with them though.

733
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,180
Oh yeah.

734
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,560
Yeah.

735
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:52,920
Like.

736
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,840
Senozoophelioma.

737
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,520
They'll be crushing under the wing.

738
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:55,680
Yeah.

739
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,700
But I don't, I don't know what I'm supposed to do about it.

740
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,580
I don't know what I'm supposed to do about it because I was, uh, I need healthcare for

741
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,200
it, but apparently that's not a thing here in Texas.

742
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,120
Uh, you know.

743
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,520
Oh yeah.

744
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,380
We don't have healthcare.

745
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,420
We have death panels.

746
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:08,960
Oh yeah.

747
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,480
Especially if you have a problem with the Senate, they're like, oh yeah, we've got a

748
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,920
place for you and more, you know, whatever.

749
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,160
But I, what I was thinking is like, remember that windfall that we got from our secret

750
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,560
Patreon?

751
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,120
Oh yeah.

752
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,440
That pile, that like bag of cash that was left on our doorstep.

753
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:26,720
Yeah.

754
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,640
That briefcase that was with the unmarked bills.

755
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,300
Yeah.

756
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:30,840
Non sequential.

757
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,420
With Bob's face on it.

758
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,720
On every other one.

759
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,240
Yeah.

760
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,660
Not, not in a sequence.

761
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,120
So.

762
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,380
Yeah.

763
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,020
Yeah.

764
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,540
So, okay.

765
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,520
Those, that money's what I was thinking we could have done.

766
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,320
Cause we.

767
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,080
Did we spend all that money?

768
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,440
We, we, yeah.

769
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:49,880
You might not remember the whole weekend, but that did go kind of, uh.

770
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,000
It really helped with the Senozoophelioma though.

771
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,440
Yeah.

772
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:53,740
Yeah.

773
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,400
More people should leave us briefcases of cash.

774
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,360
That's for sure.

775
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:57,680
Yeah.

776
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:57,680


777
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:57,680


778
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:57,680


779
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:57,680


780
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:57,680


781
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:57,680


782
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:57,680


783
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,380
And definitely lifted the feeling of dread for a moment.

784
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,320
A hot minute.

785
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:01,820
Yeah.

786
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,280
A hot minute.

787
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,220
Maybe if we get more, we can use it to start a foundation.

788
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:05,820
Yeah.

789
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,900
I was thinking if we just moved outside of the state of Texas.

790
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,380
Well, yeah.

791
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,420
Away, away from this, whatever.

792
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:18,040
Cause I mean like, you know, we could just cruise outside of Texas as it were.

793
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:18,600
Yes.

794
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:25,180
Uh, you know, and, uh, and then like, so we could get to somewhere else, a little more

795
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:32,060
further away from where we are in our current state and then, uh, build a foundation like,

796
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:37,140
you know, just like straight up another, like a sub foundation, like a health zone for the

797
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,280
subgenius, the Uber Femmes and the Yeti kin.

798
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,680
So we could like have our slack in a, in a protected zone.

799
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,540
With healthcare, like a health spa.

800
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,160
Like a spa for, for Senozoophelioma.

801
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,120
Sufferers.

802
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,300
Sufferers.

803
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,300
The Yeti kin and Uber Femmes suffering from Senozoophelioma.

804
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,540
Senozoophelioma.

805
00:38:59,780 --> 00:38:59,860
Yeah.

806
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,680
I think that's a good idea.

807
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,800
I think so too.

808
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,320
Where, where we're going to have to, maybe we can get our listeners to.

809
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,660
Send in suggestions.

810
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,440
I would like to, if you, uh, if you go to the, uh, you know, find Anna Mall or, uh,

811
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:22,520
Dr. Brujaha on Facebook and, uh, possibly, or just bug Stang about it, you know, cause

812
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,440
they're in Texas too.

813
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,280
Stang in Princeton.

814
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,200
Yeah.

815
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:25,640
Yeah.

816
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,920
They're in Texas as well.

817
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:34,400
And, and, uh, of course they're, they're, they're dealing more with palothelium, uh,

818
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:34,920
up there.

819
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,340
He's got to watch out for the.

820
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,240
Those rocks.

821
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,680
Those giant falling rocks.

822
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:38,960
Just deadly boulders.

823
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,600
They're boulders with the dinosaur footprints in them.

824
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,540
Oh yeah.

825
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,460
Sometimes they just, it's like a kick from an eternity ago.

826
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,200
Whoa.

827
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:53,080
Propels the rock into this time, into your chest.

828
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,080
Yeah.

829
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,280
I think that's a good idea.

830
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,280


831
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,280


832
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,280


833
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,280


834
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,280


835
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,280


836
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,280


837
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,280


838
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,580
I, you know, I honestly, yeah.

839
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,320
I've seen it.

840
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:56,600
That.

841
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,160
It's the opposite of slack.

842
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:58,980
Yeah.

843
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,580
So I'm going to go where there's not just a giant pile of boulders sitting around waiting

844
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,160
to get us.

845
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:05,560
Mm-hmm.

846
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:11,960
And also where there's not a whole bunch, like where there's not like where they put

847
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,780
all the asbestos that they got rid of.

848
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,520
Mm-hmm.

849
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,420
Not the, not the pile of asbestos.

850
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:18,640
Asbestos.

851
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:18,640


852
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,260
And, and, and not necessarily near anywhere that, uh, but, you know.

853
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:24,260


854
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,660
You know, honestly, yeah.

855
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,360
Suggestions please, uh, find us on the Facebook.

856
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,420
We're in the slack hole too or whatever.

857
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,680
There's all kinds of little places.

858
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,020
Suggestions for our Seno, Senozoa Thelioma Clinic.

859
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:35,600
Clinic.

860
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,460
And health spa.

861
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:36,880
Yeah.

862
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,600
Cause I need to, I need to get like, like giant furry yetis to massage people.

863
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,600
Mm.

864
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:48,640
Or, uh, like a, like a, we get the, the pond that we could all like sit in.

865
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,860
Have you ever had a silky yeti massage?

866
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,940
I have not had a silky yeti massage.

867
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,720
It's really nice.

868
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,860
It's kind of, they have very like silky forearms and they kind of like brush.

869
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,460
That sounds delightful.

870
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,700
Brush it on you like gently.

871
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,740
And it's, it's aura cleansing and just therapeutic.

872
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:10,540
And it also takes away the like, uh, like those particles from the Seno Thelioma.

873
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,260
Senozoa Thelioma.

874
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,180
Yeah.

875
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,560
That can like start making you feel scared.

876
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,300
It's a lot like the face, um, something bats that we can't say that went on the radio,

877
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,240
but like, you know, yeah, the, the bats that attach to the face.

878
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,780
And then we had the antivenom.

879
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:26,660
Mm.

880
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:33,780
And so we could actually have an antivenom, uh, man, uh, like a site there at the spa

881
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,660
making the antivenom as well for people that are having bat problems.

882
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,520
Oh, the bat antivenom.

883
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:39,840
Yes.

884
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,300
Yeah.

885
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:45,780
The face something bats that face bats that.

886
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,540
Yeah.

887
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,420
There is an antivenom for that.

888
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,140
I think it's, I think they're boofing the bats.

889
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,220
Bat boofing.

890
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:54,580
Yeah.

891
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,740
The face boofing bats.

892
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,480
I don't know.

893
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,640
Oh, that sounds horrifying.

894
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,640
I'm so glad I haven't been anywhere near those.

895
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,040
Right.

896
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,560
I know.

897
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,980
This is why we need more pudding.

898
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,180
Yeah, definitely.

899
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,020
Anyway.

900
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:08,780
So yeah.

901
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:13,740
If you, if anybody wants to drop a briefcase of money off for, uh, Dr. Brujaha.

902
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:15,800
Yeah.

903
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,740
Or Overlord Animal here.

904
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,160
Yeah.

905
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,220
Then by all means, uh, yeah.

906
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,840
Send it down our way.

907
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,200
Now here's a little bit of a surprise.

908
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:24,200


909
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:24,200


910
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:24,200


911
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:24,200


912
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,320
This is a strange recording.

913
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:34,720
Uh, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy has been doing, uh, radio and production sound production

914
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:41,380
forever and has worked with, well, he was, he was the regular audio engineer for the

915
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:50,920
station where, uh, Howard Stern was and, uh, now is like an actor in Hollywood, but he,

916
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,060
he recorded this little bit.

917
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,720
Actually, there's no record of it.

918
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,280
That's a lie.

919
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,840
There are, uh, the audio has been done in pro here.

920
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:09,840


921
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:16,320
Uh, now it's stuff like a, uh, now, uh.

922
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,320


923
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,320


924
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,320


925
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,340
No, I'll run the 80s with the other saturation cues.

926
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:16,420
You are in behind the black and you down,ihat,medically yummy.

927
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:16,420


928
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:16,580
Yeah.

929
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:16,580


930
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:16,580


931
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,500
If, I thought someone would throw a 있으 Psalмотрите three-stage recording.

932
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,220
I saw, I got caught watching it.

933
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,040
Ah, I, I'd like newolds.

934
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,860
Uh, the

935
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,040
uh, it's in Portugal.

936
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,600
Oh, thanks, Bill.

937
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,240
Listen, yeah.

938
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:29,920
Bill.

939
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:30,600
Yes.

940
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,960
What the hell is a podcast?

941
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,480
I mean, come on, man.

942
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,220
It's where you take a radio.

943
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:38,700
Yeah.

944
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,080
And then you disassemble it.

945
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:41,500
Yeah.

946
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,680
Then you let a bunch of people who've never done radio.

947
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,160
Yeah.

948
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,640
Come in and put the radio back together.

949
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:48,600
Yeah.

950
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,680
And then they take that radio that's been put back together.

951
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,020
Yeah.

952
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,360
And they put it on the internet.

953
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,520
And then they make a whole lot of money.

954
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,540
Oh, wow, man.

955
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,520
So, okay.

956
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,100
So.

957
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:04,600
Yeah.

958
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,500
Can I get a job doing that?

959
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,500
What the hell you just said there?

960
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,460
As long as you're a YouTube celebrity with 400,000 or more followers.

961
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,600
Okay.

962
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,700
You can get a job being a YouTube celebrity.

963
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:21,820
Okay.

964
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,000
With 400,000.

965
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,520
With 400,000 or more followers.

966
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:24,920
Okay.

967
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,900
But the qualification is you need to have at least 400,000 followers.

968
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:36,720
Otherwise, the people who pay the people with 400,000 followers won't give you a nickel.

969
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:37,380
Okay.

970
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,300
Yeah.

971
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:38,780
Okay.

972
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,380
It's too bad because you know what?

973
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,020
I got a thing on YouTube.

974
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,980
If I may say.

975
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:48,360
Yeah.

976
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:51,780
Jerry Goodwin.

977
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,960
Jerry Goodwin demo.

978
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,140
YouTube.

979
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,200
Jerry Goodwin demo.

980
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,100
Yeah.

981
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,680
And you know what?

982
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,960
I have not received a dime.

983
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,860
Ah, yeah.

984
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:03,700
Yeah.

985
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,100
So, yeah.

986
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,160
So, you were saying.

987
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,140
You get on YouTube and you make some money.

988
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,480
So, how come?

989
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,120
Well, it's because you don't have 400,000 followers.

990
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,120
Well, who knows about.

991
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:16,900
Who knows that?

992
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,540
The people with 400,000 or more followers know that.

993
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,820
They got it all sewn up, these people.

994
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,380
Ah.

995
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:24,900
Yeah.

996
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,100
That's all you have to do.

997
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,240
It doesn't matter.

998
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,620
You could like, you know, tap dance or like.

999
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,080
Or literally, you can tap a pencil on a table.

1000
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,100
Yes.

1001
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:43,220
And as long as you get 400,000 followers for that, you will be the table pencil tapping champion.

1002
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:43,980
All right.

1003
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:44,360
Yeah.

1004
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,060
So, all right.

1005
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,620
Forgive me for.

1006
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,960
I got a fucking.

1007
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:50,300
Okay.

1008
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:57,880
If I whack my dick on this microphone 400,000 times, I will be recognized?

1009
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,760
It depends upon whether the.

1010
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,440
Yeah.

1011
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:05,460
Probably.

1012
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,000
Yeah.

1013
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,360
That's probably a surefire.

1014
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,500
I got to tell you something.

1015
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,060
I hope so.

1016
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,140
God damn it.

1017
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:10,420
If it involves a dick.

1018
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,020
Come on.

1019
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:11,720
Or a fart.

1020
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:14,680
You got to go to the goddamn hospital and get my dick wrapped up.

1021
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,020
Or a fart.

1022
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,500
Hey, listen, man.

1023
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,320
I can do it.

1024
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,940
But hey, don't dare me.

1025
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,280
Or something being thrown at you.

1026
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:20,280


1027
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,080
Or something being thrown at your crotch.

1028
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,740
And then you doubling over.

1029
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,700
This is a big thing in the YouTube videos.

1030
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,240
Is crotch pain is a big.

1031
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,240
I swear to God.

1032
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:32,940
Oh, yeah.

1033
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:33,460
I know.

1034
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:33,740
Oh, yeah.

1035
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,160
And then also falling down.

1036
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,620
They love that.

1037
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,480
Well, you know.

1038
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:41,320
But I think people have loved that since time immemorial.

1039
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,580
People falling down.

1040
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:42,820
Yeah.

1041
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,040
I don't like that myself.

1042
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,360
Slipping.

1043
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:44,540
No.

1044
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,820
Slipping and fucking falling.

1045
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,500
Because I have slipped and fallen.

1046
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:47,940
No.

1047
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,260
And fucking ended up in the goddamn hospital.

1048
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:50,680
Yeah.

1049
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,220
I mean, what's up with that bullshit?

1050
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:52,880
Yeah.

1051
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,840
And yet somebody, if they had filmed that, it's not right.

1052
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:58,700
But here's the thing.

1053
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:07,500
I think that when they put it in the people that were slipping and falling were clowns.

1054
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,320
Professional slippers and fallers.

1055
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:10,380
Yeah.

1056
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,140
And they were the ones that were supposed to slip and fall.

1057
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,400
Yeah.

1058
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,260
It's true.

1059
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,040
And their parents set them up for it.

1060
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,740
And they trained for it.

1061
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,260
They went to college for it.

1062
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,200
They went to college for it.

1063
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,840
They ice skated.

1064
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,020
That's all they had to do.

1065
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,040
Get out on the goddamn ice ponds.

1066
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:26,440
Yeah.

1067
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:29,420
And run and slip and fall.

1068
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:29,920
That's how.

1069
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,080
Run and slip and fall.

1070
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:31,680
The Brinker family.

1071
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,580
Run and slip and fall.

1072
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:32,980
Yep.

1073
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,100
Run and slip and fall.

1074
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:34,800
Come on.

1075
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:35,860
The Brinker family.

1076
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:37,240
The Hans Brinkers.

1077
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,820
They made.

1078
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,400
Well, Hans and his family.

1079
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,560
They made.

1080
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,200
That's really how they made their fortune.

1081
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,800
To start.

1082
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,440
The Brinkers made a fortune.

1083
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:56,720
Well, because Hans Brinker was a young.

1084
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:58,640
He was a skater.

1085
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,120
Yes.

1086
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,000
In Holland.

1087
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:01,520
Yeah.

1088
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:09,260
And he, because some shit went down, skated his ass off and saved.

1089
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,640
The town.

1090
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,280
Yeah.

1091
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:11,800
Yeah.

1092
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,640
Well, the country.

1093
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:13,540
Yeah.

1094
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,120
Because the leak in the dike.

1095
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,240
Wasn't it the leak in the dike?

1096
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,180
I think that's correct.

1097
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,460
His sister put her finger in the leak in the dike.

1098
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:19,620
Yeah.

1099
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:20,960
And he skated away.

1100
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:21,840
Somebody.

1101
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:26,360
And told everybody, hey, my sister's holding her finger in the leak in the dike.

1102
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,520
And then that way, that's how.

1103
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,440
And she helped.

1104
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,480
She kept the finger there.

1105
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,500
And then the townspeople came with what?

1106
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,720
Plaster or something.

1107
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,680
And somehow they covered up the hole.

1108
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,060
Yeah.

1109
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,860
Which didn't leak anymore.

1110
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:44,400
Yeah.

1111
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:44,740
And then.

1112
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,440
That was happily ever after.

1113
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,360
And that was how the marijuana industry got started.

1114
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:50,320
In Holland.

1115
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,340
See, it has nothing to do with windmills.

1116
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,720
It's either wind, you know.

1117
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,500
I mean, the cliche is.

1118
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,300
Yeah.

1119
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,660
And you've got to avoid cliches with this podcast.

1120
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,080
Yeah.

1121
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:01,300
Well.

1122
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,340
So that's a story you have not heard.

1123
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,740
I just want to make sure that you know.

1124
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,760
You have not heard that story anywhere else.

1125
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,440
Not.

1126
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,060
This podcast.

1127
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:09,480
Listen.

1128
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:14,460
Not only have I not heard that story, but I don't even know what the fucking story you're

1129
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,080
talking about.

1130
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,100
Yeah.

1131
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:16,800
Yeah.

1132
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,620
You know what I'm saying?

1133
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,180
Yeah.

1134
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:18,480
Yeah.

1135
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:18,860
Yeah.

1136
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:18,960
Yeah.

1137
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,080
Yeah.

1138
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:19,260
Yeah.

1139
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:19,600
Yeah.

1140
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:19,600


1141
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:19,600


1142
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:19,600


1143
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:19,600


1144
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:19,600


1145
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:19,600


1146
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:23,160
It's a double not being able to.

1147
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:26,360
I'm going to bed.

1148
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:27,100
Okay.

1149
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:27,800
All right.

1150
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,180
I'll catch you on the other end of the podcast.

1151
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:29,940
Thanks.

1152
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:33,960
And then.

1153
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:34,420
Now.

1154
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,740
Well, thank you, Bleepo and Jerry.

1155
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,160
Now we're going to go back to.

1156
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,720
To Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1157
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,120
On the phone.

1158
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,680
The music, by the way, in the background is Cyber Chump.

1159
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,320
An album.

1160
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,020
Called.

1161
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,800
Their moment of perfect happiness.

1162
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:00,220
Which shows two people in astronauts space suits.

1163
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,220
On a lovely sunny beach.

1164
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:05,780
On the cover.

1165
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,740
Nice background music.

1166
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,820
.

1167
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,540


1168
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,680
Okay, so yeah, so friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack,

1169
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:34,780
one of the Church of the Subgenius radio ministries.

1170
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,240
There's actually like at least four of them going now

1171
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,660
because you got your Puzzling Evidence,

1172
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:47,620
your Suzy the Flusies Bob Slack Time Fun House over there by WREK in Atlanta,

1173
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:52,060
and you got your Time for the Show show,

1174
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:57,260
which is not broadcast, but that doesn't matter.

1175
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,840
Yeah, and this is an outreach.

1176
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,580
This is a prison outreach, friends.

1177
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,580
This is a ministry that cares about the prisoner.

1178
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:17,060
We won't give you a bunch of stuff for free.

1179
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,440
We'll give you free information for free.

1180
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,340
And here's our post office box.

1181
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,260
Prisoners, because you're not on the Internet,

1182
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,840
you can write to Hour of Slack, Reverend Stang or Bob Dobbs,

1183
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,760
not that Bob's going to pick up the mail,

1184
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,260
at this address, Box 807.

1185
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,060
807, see, it almost spells Bob.

1186
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:47,420
I wanted to get 808, but somebody, some Baptist had it.

1187
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,600
And the town is Glen Rose, Texas,

1188
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,140
as like the rose in the Glen,

1189
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,440
and the zip is 76043.

1190
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,580
That's Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1191
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,380
How's that?

1192
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,380
Sound Texas-y enough?

1193
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,300
You should say it.

1194
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,460
And crackly?

1195
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,080
My voice all crackly enough for you, listeners?

1196
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:11,620
Yeah.

1197
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,420
Yeah, that part sounded good,

1198
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,560
but you're supposed to remember to say everything three times

1199
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,600
so the judge can't hear you.

1200
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,180
A jargonistic waiter can...

1201
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:19,840
That's right.

1202
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:23,480
Church's subgenius, Hour of Slack, Post Office Box 807,

1203
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,260
Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1204
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,220
Not 76043, but 76043.

1205
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,020
That's different.

1206
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:41,060
You've scratched a deep wound in your skull, haven't you?

1207
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,960
Yeah, it's different from different.

1208
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,500
Different.

1209
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,480
Different.

1210
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,380
Different is different.

1211
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,740
Different from different.

1212
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,280
Different.

1213
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:50,820
Different.

1214
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:51,940
Different.

1215
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:53,940
It's different.

1216
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,920
That means it morphs into something else along the way,

1217
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,060
like wearing the Hitler nightgown.

1218
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:05,720
I remember Morph and his Hitler nightgown.

1219
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:10,180
He was completely unembarrassed to be wearing that.

1220
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,740
In fact, he just showed it off every chance he got.

1221
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,860
Got kind of old.

1222
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:17,280
It's like, oh, God, here's Morph showing up.

1223
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,500
With his Hitler nightgown.

1224
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,820
And his flab roll.

1225
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,580
He's never going to shut up about it.

1226
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:28,760
Just flouncing around going, oh, I feel so Hitler-y in my Hitler nightgown.

1227
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:33,200
You know, as Philo Drummond was forced to say recently,

1228
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,800
when everybody's Hitler, nobody's Hitler.

1229
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,940
Well, I don't normally agree with him politically, but I think that's...

1230
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,160
He's really good at...

1231
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:53,960
Whipping out statements like that at people that don't agree with him politically,

1232
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,900
which is about half the country.

1233
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,280
But, you know, we're talking about subgenius politics,

1234
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,840
where the government is you.

1235
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:16,800
And, unfortunately, the taxpayer and slave to the state of you is also you.

1236
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,260
And, uh...

1237
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,860
And if you're married, there's a queen of the state.

1238
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,460
And if you've got kids, then you've got some serfs.

1239
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:36,040
If you can get them off of their damn pads and pods for ten minutes

1240
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,660
to scoop up the dog poo or whatever kind of job that kids are supposed to have now.

1241
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:46,100
That was my job all through most of my life.

1242
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,100
Cleaning up.

1243
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:47,980
Other people's poo.

1244
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,180
Or dogs' poo, mostly.

1245
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,240
Horses.

1246
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,740
Shoveled lots of horse manure.

1247
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:54,220
Oh.

1248
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:55,360
It's...

1249
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,040
Man.

1250
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,840
That stuff's perfumery compared to the dog.

1251
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,940
Or the people.

1252
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:03,720
Pooey.

1253
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:04,340
Ugh.

1254
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,360
Heck, I'd just jump into a great little pile of...

1255
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,040
of, uh...

1256
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,560
ungulate poo.

1257
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,320
Just about any kind of ungulate poo.

1258
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,460
What's the difference between regular...

1259
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,240
prefactory blue and ungulate?

1260
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,920
The hoofed animals all eat plants.

1261
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,260
So their poo is...

1262
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,320
Like clams and stuff.

1263
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:26,940
No.

1264
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:27,080
Oh, yeah.

1265
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:27,660
No, no.

1266
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:33,980
You know, cactuses and grass and rutabagas and pumpkins and stuff.

1267
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:34,660
Just any...

1268
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:34,820
Terns.

1269
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,200
Trees.

1270
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:35,720
Yeah.

1271
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,260
Poison ivy.

1272
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:45,920
But the, you know, the people and the canines and predator things

1273
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,300
are...

1274
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,880
Yeah.

1275
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,240
Yeah.

1276
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:47,260
Yeah.

1277
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,260


1278
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,260


1279
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,260


1280
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,260


1281
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,260


1282
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,260


1283
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,260


1284
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,260


1285
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,260


1286
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,260


1287
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,260


1288
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,260


1289
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,220
And so, P-U.

1290
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:52,780
Hmm.

1291
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:58,760
I found a couple of crusty little things in my office today

1292
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,540
that must have been a week old.

1293
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,320
Somehow they...

1294
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,500
And I was gone for a week.

1295
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:03,820
Somehow...

1296
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,700
And I bet it was Buddy.

1297
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,880
He somehow hiked his butt up high enough

1298
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,740
to put his product on display.

1299
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,160
Not on the floor.

1300
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,420
But up on a box.

1301
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,900
A pretty high up box.

1302
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,120
He likes to show off that way.

1303
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:29,240
He has managed to lay one of those mean little loads he's been packing

1304
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,780
in the midst of a bunch of cactus.

1305
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,480
And I don't know how he does that without getting stuck.

1306
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,480
It's just that he likes to show off.

1307
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:40,700
He's so aware that he...

1308
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,360
It's like he has eyes back there.

1309
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:45,540
And he can get close to the thorns but not quite...

1310
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:47,080
And, you know,

1311
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,860
do a kind of a daredevil drop.

1312
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,520
Coyotes and raccoons do that too.

1313
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,880
I think he's trying to compete with them.

1314
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,200
Well, he hears it's going around

1315
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,760
so he wants to be in on it.

1316
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,760
As I would too.

1317
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,760
I used to...

1318
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,100
He'd like to throw his shoulder into it

1319
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,280
and roll in it.

1320
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,880
But I usually catch him before they do that.

1321
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,760
I've learned the hard way.

1322
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,600
What's the human group,

1323
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,120
or not to say...

1324
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:17,340
What's the group,

1325
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,520
but what is the belief system that says,

1326
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:20,940
you know,

1327
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,660
that feces are good for your hair

1328
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,880
and you just rub your own

1329
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,080
and let them mature at a rate of 6% interest

1330
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,200
and stuff like that?

1331
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,680
Oh, that would be the diehard Trump supporters,

1332
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,120
I think.

1333
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,880
And some Rastafarians, I think,

1334
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:40,400
use cow manure as a kind of a hair pomade.

1335
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:42,780
Yeah.

1336
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:45,700
Yeah, okay.

1337
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,260
Seriously.

1338
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:46,880
I mean,

1339
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,760
but again,

1340
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:50,420
you know,

1341
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,300
the poop of ungulates is not offensive particularly,

1342
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,880
especially if you've been,

1343
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,960
you know,

1344
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,540
shoveling it for years

1345
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,860
out in those Hercules stables.

1346
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,120
Oh, God.

1347
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,580
That was some serious labors, man.

1348
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:07,880
Yeah.

1349
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,640
They used to whoop you like you were a stable boy.

1350
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,620
Or you were a stable boy.

1351
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:13,240
Yeah, I was.

1352
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,480
I actually did.

1353
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,060
That was my choice.

1354
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:17,420
That was my choice.

1355
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,500
Stable boy choice.

1356
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:20,980
Yes, sir.

1357
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,000
And I hated horses, too.

1358
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,920
I never enjoyed horseback riding.

1359
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,920
They're huge.

1360
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:26,780
They're dangerous.

1361
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:31,060
They throw you off into piles of cow manure and cactus.

1362
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,820
They disobey you and show you that you're not a good horse rider

1363
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:37,000
because you can't make me do what you want me to do.

1364
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,640
Yeah, they step on your feet.

1365
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,680
Yeah, they humiliate you.

1366
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:42,700
If you're me.

1367
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,260
Me, too.

1368
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,260
If you're a girl, oh, my God.

1369
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,140
Well, they're just...

1370
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,680
the biggest vibrator that ever could be.

1371
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,760
That's my findings, too.

1372
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:59,560
And it's reprinted from University of Indiana Press, 2015, May.

1373
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,040
Girls like horses because you know.

1374
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,840
Yeah, yeah, I've noticed that.

1375
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,080
Well, it's been peer-reviewed.

1376
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:08,720
Peer, get it?

1377
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,900
Hey, we better cut to something else now.

1378
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:14,380
Okay.

1379
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:15,940
Are you ready?

1380
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:17,300
And now this.

1381
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:23,020
From PR News in Washington, I'm placed on administrative leave by sex priests

1382
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:28,340
after a supreme pro-sex leader was killed in an apparent sex last yesterday.

1383
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:30,840
But Israel is praising the move.

1384
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,280
The Kremlin says to end PR News in Washington.

1385
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,320
Slack Friday has started, man!

1386
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,740
And, whoa, man, I can now explain to you on the Internet

1387
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,600
that this is our big,

1388
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:46,880
annual blowout

1389
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,840
when you get two

1390
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,520
Church of the Subgenius

1391
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,660
ordainment kits

1392
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,460
for the price of one.

1393
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,760
Maybe you're already ordained,

1394
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:57,400
but

1395
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,580
don't you want your old ma and pa

1396
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:02,720
to be on the escape vessels, too,

1397
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,920
when next day comes

1398
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,100
and the world ends?

1399
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:08,700
And what about that cool niece and nephew?

1400
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:10,580
And what about Spot,

1401
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:11,560
Rover,

1402
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,160
Old Hollerer,

1403
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,240
and Little Tabby?

1404
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:18,640
Are you going to deliberately leave them behind

1405
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,380
to be tortured as pinks

1406
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,920
by all your fellow subgeniuses?

1407
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,280
And besides eternal salvation

1408
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,600
or triple your money back,

1409
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,480
for that mere $35,

1410
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,740
you get a lot of actual stuff

1411
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:38,040
inside that sizable black folder with pockets.

1412
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:40,760
You get your membership pin,

1413
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,740
your shiny, coated minister's card,

1414
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:45,720
two,

1415
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:46,600
fine,

1416
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,600
B-Dob's-headed

1417
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,100
vinyl bumper stickers,

1418
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,520
the Doctorate of the Forbidden Sciences,

1419
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,460
and the all-purpose

1420
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,240
divine excuse document

1421
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,300
signed by Bob.

1422
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,820
Oh, that felt good.

1423
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,260
Both poster-sized

1424
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,380
and dying to be framed.

1425
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,600
You get 32 pages

1426
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,300
of densely illustrated

1427
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,060
and floridly written tracts.

1428
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:12,220
That is,

1429
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,600
pamphlets number one and two.

1430
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:14,920
You get a cardboard

1431
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,920
eight-and-a-half-inch

1432
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,320
by eleven portrait of Bob

1433
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,500
only two generations

1434
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,120
from the original clip art itself.

1435
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,800
The Pledge of the Subgenius,

1436
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,840
the Brag of the Subgenius,

1437
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,320
a leaflet about Connie Dobbs,

1438
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,680
an anti-subgenius fake flyer,

1439
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,920
the amazing Tree of Life poster

1440
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,780
by Mavridis and Stang,

1441
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,820
the Salvation or Destruction poster

1442
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:44,740
by Hel Swami Satellite Weavers

1443
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:45,780
that Devo adapted,

1444
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:46,800
painted for a poster,

1445
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,640
and much, much more.

1446
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,120
All kinds of stuff

1447
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,840
that you can photocopy

1448
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,400
and leave in laundromats

1449
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,740
and at the state fair.

1450
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:58,240
It's a twenty-seven piece kit altogether

1451
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,520
and I personally signed

1452
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,480
the three-page Welcome & Instructions

1453
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,100
letter myself

1454
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,000
in sparkly green ink.

1455
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,320
And best of all,

1456
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,660
you become an ordained minister

1457
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,400
with the power to lawfully wed couples

1458
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:24,820
or anything else. Two kits like this for 35 bucks, folks, but act fast because this incredible offer

1459
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:33,280
ends December 23rd if the world doesn't first. That's subgenius.com, and the link for

1460
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:41,220
Slack Friday ordainment is right at the top. We take credit cards, checks, PayPal, you name it,

1461
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:48,040
and if you don't need this so-called false progress like the internet, you can mail us at,

1462
01:02:48,900 --> 01:03:03,700
got that pencil or phone ready? Subgenius at P.O. Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043. Shortest address

1463
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:09,380
we've ever had, and I'm pretty sure this one's permanent because we're now on an actual cult

1464
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,160
compound in rural Texas.

1465
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:17,180
Not all that far from where the United States government mass-murdered the Branch Davidians

1466
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:28,940
near fabled Waco. That's Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043 or subgenius.com. Praise Bob!

1467
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:40,020
Oh, and by the way, we really are hurting for money due to the delays in selling the old address.

1468
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:49,400
So this wouldn't be a bad time for just a plain flat-out donation, which we make very easy by way of

1469
01:03:49,400 --> 01:04:04,740
paypal.me slash Ivanstang, I-V-A-N-S-T-A-N-G, or the button on the homepage of subgenius.com.

1470
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,680
Praise Bob!

1471
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:11,540
Praise Bob!
