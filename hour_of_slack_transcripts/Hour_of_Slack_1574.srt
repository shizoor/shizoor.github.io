1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,060
You're not going to sedate me anymore.

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,780
Who are you?

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,340
The Self Genius Power of Swag.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,120
I seem to be in a timeless space void.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,280
Neither light nor dark.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,980
I have awareness but not mind but no memory.

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,920
That should hold her till you get her home.

8
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,760
Gentlemen, thank you all for coming.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,620
I know you have parishes, flocks and temples making enormous demands on your time.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:48,920
But I'm sure you appreciate also the great masses of humanity look to pictures for information and uplift and yes, entertainment.

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:59,380
Here at Capital Pictures, as you know, an army of technicians and actors and top-notch artistic people are working hard to bring to the screen the story of the Christ.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,640
It's a swell story.

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,440
A story told before, yes.

14
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,060
But we like to flatter ourselves that it's never been told with this kind of distinction and panache.

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,360
Perhaps, sir, you forget it's telling in the Holy Bible.

16
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,920
Quite right, Patriarch.

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,220
The Bible, of course, is terrific.

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,520
But for millions of people, pictures will be their reference point for the story.

19
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,100
The story is embodied.

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,980
The story is, uh...

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,320
Realization.

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,760
Realization.

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,880
You realize, of course, that for we Jews, any visual depiction of the Godhead...

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,240
...is most strictly prohibited.

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,460
Oh.

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,900
But, of course, for us, the man Jesus Nazarene is not God.

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,440
Aha!

28
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,560
Who plays Christ?

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,140
A kid we're all very excited about.

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,600
Todd Hawkeye is a wonderful young actor we found in Akron, Ohio, in a nationwide talent hunt.

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,160
But Hawkeye is seen only fleetingly and with extreme taste.

32
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,360
Our story is told through the eyes of a Roman tribute.

33
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,580
Atollicus Antoninus.

34
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,080
Ordinary man.

35
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,400
Skeptical at first.

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,980
But who comes to a grudge...

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,200
...and a grudging respect for this swell figure from the East.

38
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,340
And Atollicus is played by...

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,780
...Baird Whitlock.

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,200
Oh, my.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,420
Well, he is certainly a great talent.

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,580
Now, Hail Caesar is a prestige picture.

43
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,160
Our biggest release of the year.

44
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,840
And we're devoting huge resources to its production in order to make it first class in every respect.

45
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,700
Gentlemen, given its enormous expense, we don't want to send it to market...

46
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,180
...except in the certainty that it will not offend any reasonable American, regardless of faith or creed.

47
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,760
Now, that's where you come in.

48
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,640
You've read the script.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,160
I want to know if the theological elements of the story are up to snuff.

50
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,520
I thought the chariot scene was fakey.

51
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,900
How is he going to jump from one chariot to the other going full speed?

52
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,880
Uh-huh. Well, we can look at that.

53
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,480
But as for the religious aspect, does the depiction of Christ Jesus cut the mustard?

54
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,220
Well, the nature of Christ is not quite as simple as your photo play would have it.

55
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,080
How so, Father?

56
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:58,980
It's not the case.

57
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,500
It's simply that Christ is God, or God Christ.

58
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,340
You could say that again. The Nazarene was not God.

59
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,360
He was not God.

60
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,240
He was a man.

61
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,060
Part God.

62
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,500
No, sir.

63
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,200
Rabbi, all of us have a little bit of God in us, don't we?

64
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,460
Well, it's the foundation of our belief that Christ is most properly referred to as the Son of God.

65
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,280
It's the Son of God who takes the sins of the world upon himself...

66
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,320
...so that the rest of God's children, we imperfect beings, through faith...

67
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,620
...may enter the kingdom of heaven.

68
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,540
So God is split?

69
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,860
Yes. And no.

70
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,900
There is unity in division.

71
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,300
And division in unity.

72
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,980
I'm not sure I follow, Padre.

73
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,020
Young man, you don't follow for a very simple reason.

74
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,220
These men are screwballs.

75
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,560
God has children.

76
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,020
What? And a dog? A collie, maybe?

77
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,360
God doesn't have children. He's a bachelor. And very angry.

78
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,140
No, no. He used to be angry.

79
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,880
Why? He got over it?

80
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,420
You worship the God of another age.

81
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,400
Who has no love.

82
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,960
Not true. He likes Jews.

83
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,260
God loves everyone.

84
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,580
God is love.

85
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,400
God is.

86
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,100
Who is?

87
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,120
This is special. Who isn't? Who is?

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,420
But how should God be rendered in a motion picture?

89
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,760
God isn't in the motion picture.

90
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,300
Then who is taught archives?

91
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,880
Gentlemen, maybe we're biting off more than we can chew.

92
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,560
We don't need to agree on the nature of the deity here.

93
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,960
If we could focus on the Christ, whatever his parentage...

94
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,080
My question is, is our depiction fair?

95
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,800
I have seen worse.

96
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:23,960
Reverend?

97
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,940
There's nothing to offend a reasonable man.

98
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,740
Father?

99
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:34,280
Well, the motion picture teleplay was respectful and exhibited tastefulness and class.

100
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,940
Who made you an expert all of a sudden?

101
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,040
And what do you think, Rabbi?

102
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,040
Eh. I have been an opinion.

103
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,060
Well, I certainly do.

104
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,060


105
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,060


106
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,060


107
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,500
The Bible says that every man was born in mortal sin.

108
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,020
Or no sin.

109
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,200
Each one of us must answer when our judgment day begins.

110
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:12,860
Judgment day.

111
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,940
Make sure your path is righteous when Saint Peter picks your side.

112
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,840
C יש עeka Night of the 11 tags.

113
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,960
The pearly gates will open if your scrotum you don't hide.

114
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,600
Don't you hack it, drop your crusty britches, flop that scrotum down

115
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,480
Don't you raise your zip-wood chains till Satan comes around

116
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,460
Watch out for that rich man, he's coming down the aisle

117
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,100
So, hop-hop that bulbous scrotum and make Jesus smile

118
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,480
The Lord, he gave us lubricants to squirt in every hole

119
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,280
The devil gives us painted beef so he can steal our soul

120
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,080
Beware of men who whisper when they leave you only crud

121
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,860
Even you, there shall not be delivered unless you softly hum

122
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,080
And drop, drop your nasty britches, flop your scrotum down

123
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,660
Flap that scrotum down, and when a pagoda comes to town

124
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,260
Stand up for America, make your life worthwhile

125
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,200
And, uh, hop that bulbous scrotum, you'll make Jesus smile

126
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,020
The world is full of wicked men who want to prey on you

127
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,680
A bifurcated penis shaft will help to see you through

128
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,020
Try not to wiggle on the slab until the blade withdraws

129
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,340
Don't worry about the bleeding cause we saved our grandpa's jaws

130
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,160
Drop, drop your stanky britches, flop that scrotum down

131
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,080
Choose the path of communism, each man his own way, and you'll see the world fall apart

132
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,080


133
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,080


134
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,100
And that's a king, old cow, and sausages with throbbing veins

135
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,080
Or better, by a mile, you just pop, pop that bulbous scrotum

136
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,620
And make Jesus smile

137
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,340
And you just pop, pop that bulbous scrotum, you'll make Jesus smile

138
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,180
Thank you, Jesus, pop that bulbous scrotum

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,660
The piccolo player is a motherfucker

140
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,060
And make Jesus smile

141
00:07:48,080 --> 00:08:11,060
And make Jesus smile

142
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:41,060
And make Jesus smile

143
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,960
The Hispanic in me is released

144
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:55,500
And that's leave them without me

145
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,440
And make Jesus smile

146
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,040
The cosmopolitan is that horny

147
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,140
The scum of Christ

148
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,660
The chanting of the

149
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:07,700
lapd

150
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:13,000
to see. And I'm not blaming. I'm proud of my heritage. We're all proud of our

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,960
heritage. I don't want to build a wall.

152
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,960
I want to build a wall. I mean I can, I don't think it's very confusing. It has

153
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,620
nothing to do with anything except common sense. We go to the judge, we say

154
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,800
to the judge, hey you can't let her out of the case. How do you allow a case to

155
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,440
proceed when the plaintiff asks to be dismissed from the case? The plaintiff in

156
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,460
the case was a woman. The plaintiff in the case was a woman. We go to the judge,

157
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,940
we say to the judge, hey you can't let her out of the case. The plaintiff in the case

158
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,420
was a woman.

159
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,840
And you're left to conclude that this world is run by psychopaths.

160
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,280
What do you do when the psychopaths have taken the reins of power? See all you

161
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:18,980
need to do is three things. One, give them a uniform. Two, give them privileges. Three,

162
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,780
tell them they're above the law. And you've got a psychopath.

163
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:32,420
And perhaps it is their psychopathy that allows them to rise to the top. And that's

164
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,780
why we seem to be in a position to do that.

165
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:33,780


166
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,120
We need to be in the mess that we're in. The world is ruled by psychopaths. What does

167
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:44,340
that say about society? That we allow these type of people to rise to the top. And how

168
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,640
do we defend ourselves against them?

169
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,180
They do not have as much of a fear response to getting injured like most of us do. We

170
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,500
do something, you know, you cut your hand and then you learn really well not to do that

171
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,740
a second time because you don't want to get cut again. Their response isn't that great.

172
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,780
So they're able to make, they're able to take chances that are not going to happen. And

173
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:03,780


174
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,820
a lot of people wouldn't take. And that again, you know it's

175
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,640
leadership qualities. It's would normally be admirable in a leader that they're willing

176
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,340
to take chances and risks, you know, that is that's what you want from a leader.

177
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,960
How many Adolph Eichman's are there anyway, that quality makes good leaders.

178
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,180
And that's why we want to follow them. Because, you know, you don't want to

179
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,960
follow somebody that's humming and hawing and says, Well, you know, geez,

180
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,940
maybe I think we should do this. Maybe No, we want somebody that's confident,

181
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:39,820
and sure of themselves and makes broad statements and inspires us.

182
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,860
Yeah, I want to do that. I want to follow people like that.

183
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:48,380
The spiral of inequality can be broken if the illegitimacy of the power distribution is revealed.

184
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,100
One way to undermine the legitimacy of authority is open revolt,

185
00:11:53,340 --> 00:12:01,240
but a more subtle way in which the powerless might curb self-enrichment by the powerful is by tainting their reputation.

186
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,920
Authoritarian sociopathy can not only be stopped but driven into reverse,

187
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,720
not by violence or revolution, but simply by undermining their sense of legitimacy.

188
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:19,060
Viewed this way, it could be said that comedians such as George Carlin or Penn Jillette

189
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:25,060
have done more for freedom than politicians like Ron Paul or intellectuals like Murray Rothbard.

190
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,160
And then the culture itself, which is, of course, encouraging people to be selfish,

191
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,220
you know, to be...

192
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,800
Good consumers, you have to be able to spend everything on yourself, so...

193
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,820
It is the witnesses who are the majority and thereby the most capable of meaningful intervention.

194
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,600
And we want good consumers, so let's make them all selfish people

195
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,280
and irresponsible for, you know, future payments on their credit cards, you know.

196
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,720
Live for the moment, enjoy life, rock and roll, die young, you know, which is very profitable.

197
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,220
All that is necessary for the triumph of evil...

198
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,320
is that good men do nothing.

199
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:12,380
If we want to fight corrupt authority, we must fight it where it truly resides, in the mind.

200
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,260
Yeah!

201
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,160
I said...

202
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,860
I said...

203
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,360
I'm Hispanic!

204
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,160
Can I buy for Peter Trout?

205
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,020
You can't get Mexico to pay for the wall.

206
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,180
I'm Hispanic!

207
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,200
Can I buy for...

208
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,200


209
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,200


210
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,140
Peter Trout!

211
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,480
And nobody builds walls better than me, believe me.

212
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,960
The greatest wall that you've ever seen.

213
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,140
Two walls, one here, one there, in between, a load.

214
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,800
The greatest wall that you've ever seen.

215
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
Peter Trout!

216
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,300
Yeah!

217
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,820
They said...

218
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,280
Yeah!

219
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,160
Peter Trout!

220
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,600
Yeah!

221
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,500
They said...

222
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:56,740
Peter Trout!

223
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,640
Peter Trout!

224
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,480
Peter Trout!

225
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,080
Peter Trout!

226
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,180
Peter Trout!

227
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:00,860
Peter Trout!

228
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,540
Peter Trout!

229
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:04,380


230
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,220
They said...

231
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,220


232
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,960
Peter Trout!

233
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,360
Yes!

234
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,360
Peter Trout!

235
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,860
Yes!

236
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,560
They said...

237
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:13,680
Yes!

238
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,920
They said...

239
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,660
We love you!

240
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,520
We love you!

241
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,960
I have a warrant for the end of my loss.

242
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,860
They said...

243
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,620
We love you!

244
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,300
We love you!

245
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,340
They played with my nose.

246
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,360
I don't want touching.

247
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,280
I don't want touching.

248
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,160
We love you!

249
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,000
We love you! We love you!

250
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,560
We love you! We love you!

251
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,940
We love you! We love you!

252
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,820
Oh, yes, dear friends.

253
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,540
What you're listening to here on Hour of Slack

254
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:51,540
is a collage by Phineas Narco of NationalCynical.com.

255
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,220
There was another Trump collage earlier

256
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,380
that was by Reverend Cuttlefish.

257
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,260
That song, Pop That Bulbous Scrotum,

258
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,060
was by the Rudy Schwartz Project,

259
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,140
and the dialogue clip was from Hail Caesar.

260
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,240
Now back to National Cynical Radio.

261
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,220
They're going to...

262
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,260
Call me?

263
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,120
Not gonna be any good. They didn't give me any money.

264
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,860
Not gonna be any good. They didn't give me any money.

265
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,800
I don't need it. I don't want it.

266
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,520
I couldn't care less. Couldn't care less.

267
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,780
You are going to love President Trump.

268
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,760
Bing, bing, bong, bong.

269
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,520
Bing, bing, bong, bong.

270
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,320
Bing, bing, bong, bong.

271
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,980
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.

272
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,540
China.

273
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,420
China, China from China.

274
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,660
And I love China.

275
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,080
Nothing wrong with China.

276
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,220
I love the Mexican people.

277
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,480
They have tremendous spirit.

278
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,900
They're taking your job, taking your money,

279
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,740
they're taking everything.

280
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,440
And I'm going to win the Hispanic vote.

281
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,240
It's true.

282
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:42,580
Bing, bing, bing, bong.

283
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,700
China, China, China from China.

284
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,360
You are going to love President Trump.

285
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,780
Bing, bing, China, China, China from China.

286
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,460
You are going to love President Trump.

287
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,360
Bing, bing, bing, bong.

288
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,000
Bing, bing, bong.

289
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,980
Bing, bing, bing, bong.

290
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:12,700
What you know what that is?

291
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:27,360
Bing, bing, bing, bong.

292
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,220
Somebody, somebody, somebody is doing the raping.

293
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,620
I love China.

294
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,880
China all the time.

295
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,460
I love China.

296
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,720
China all the time.

297
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,280
I love China.

298
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,540
I love doing the raping.

299
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,360
China.

300
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,920
I love doing the raping.

301
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,720
Nope.

302
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:48,280
I love doing the raping.

303
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,700
Somebody's doing the raping.

304
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:19,000
I love doing the raping.

305
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:26,700
I love doing the raping.

306
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,300
I love doing the raping.

307
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,700
I love doing the raping.

308
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,020
I love doing the raping.

309
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:56,860
I love doing the raping.

310
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,860
I love doing the raping.

311
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,440
No need to tell one from another.

312
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,880
Everything we offer is just like the other.

313
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,480
No need for choice.

314
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,120
It's all the same thing.

315
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,600
Let's all rejoice.

316
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,320
Let freedom ring.

317
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,120
Yours like mine.

318
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,360
And mine's like yours.

319
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,200
I like mine.

320
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,920
And I like hers.

321
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,420
We are one.

322
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,340
It is what it is.

323
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,980
Comfort in numbers.

324
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,480
I know what it is.

325
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,620
This is Generica.

326
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,920
All one brand.

327
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,960
This is Generica.

328
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,260
Land of the bland.

And this Generica.

330
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,540
and this Generica.

331
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,860
and this Generica.

332
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,960
and this Generica.

333
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,040
Everything's familiar.

334
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,680
not meant to confuse.

335
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,200
We've got your favorites, everything you use.

336
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,380
No reason to travel, no reason to fear.

337
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,680
Stay where you are, the same things are here.

338
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,920
It's a comfort, you know what you'll get.

339
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,240
We've got you covered in our safety net.

340
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,340
Everyone's protected, we're free to stay.

341
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,760
Everyone's connected, it's the only way.

342
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,320
This is Generica, all one brand.

343
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,640
This is Generica, land of the bland.

344
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,560
This is Generica.

345
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,740
This is Generica.

346
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,180

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,800
This is Generica.

350
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,620
This is Generica.

351
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,380
This is Generica.

352
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:46,280
This is Generica.

353
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,160
The sun's gone down, folks are going to bed.

354
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,640
The skillet's all greased and the hogs are fed.

355
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,500
Fetch my saw from the back of the shed, we're going clunking.

356
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,520
Lordy, lord, lordy, gonna have some fun.

357
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,260
Got a meatball sandwich and a bottle of rum.

358
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:26,140
Leprechauns dancing on the end of my thumb, clunking.

359
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,380
We're going clunking.

360
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,380
Now I know a guy at the top of the hill.

361
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,100
He got a straight razor and a cordless drill.

362
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,760
His sister makes whiskey out of nails and wax.

363
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,620
She got a sour disposition, she keeps it a sack.

364
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,320
Gas up the car and change the windshield wiper.

365
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,080
Batten down the hatches and don't pay the piper.

366
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,360
Checking the tabs on my engine.

367
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,640
I'm a big continents diver.

368
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,820
Clunking.

369
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,500
We're going clunking.

370
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,920
The car's14m fast.

371
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:43,920


372
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:43,920


373
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,260
Now that I'm naturally quick-witted, job-wiper grows it's influence on me.

374
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,180
Half for cleaning it up.

375
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,500
The percentages in my head are relative to my worrying, deep throughout my brainwaves.

376
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,360
Have so much fun laughing out your eyes and growing up in a closet.

377
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,900
We gone clunkin', that's what we said

378
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,860
All dressed up in satin and frills

379
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,240
Crisco drippin' from the pine ford sills

380
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,300
With a double-breasted jacket and a fistful of pills

381
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,800
We gone clunkin'

382
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,700
Now I don't care what the preacher man say

383
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,560
About Jesus and the devil and the jars of clay

384
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,380
I'll be clunkin' come Judgment Day

385
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,000
Pop the bag and let the chisholm spray

386
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,560
Don't you all worry about gettin' me home

387
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,140
Drop me in the gutter with my pocket comb

388
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,080
Ready Os Collect or vitally shalom

389
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,580
Clunkin!!!

390
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,040
We gone clunkin.

391
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,720
Yes it's really something when you Go on out and clunkin'

392
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,780
What you say Bop!

393
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,220
Bop!

394
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:06,640
Bop!

395
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,080
Bop!

396
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,400
We gone clunkin.

397
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,080
Yes it's really something when you Go on out and clunkin'

398
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,180
What you say Bop!

399
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,540
Bop!

400
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,040
Bop!

401
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,440
Bop!

402
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,940
We gone clunkin'.

403
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,500
Yes it's really something when you Go on out and clunkin'

404
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,540
What you say Bop!

405
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:20,960
Bop!

406
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,480
Yes, it's really something when you

407
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:32,940
Yes, it's really something when you

408
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,080
Oh, yes, dear friends.

409
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,740
And that clunk in there was by the Rudy Schwartz Project,

410
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,180
our old buddy, Reverend Joe Newman,

411
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,980
probably the cousin of Alfred E. Newman

412
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,580
and possibly of Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

413
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,480
You calling me a cowboy Dave?

414
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,540
Yeah, Lonesome Cowboy Payne.

415
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,340
Payne, indeed.

416
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,700
I was going to once again, as usual,

417
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,760
ask if we can hear a loud buzzing,

418
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,020
in which case I will use the other phone.

419
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,080
I cannot hear. I cannot hear no buzz.

420
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,660
Okay, well, then it's good. Let's get started.

421
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,360
Who is the first president of the United States for real?

422
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,540
Because there was a different person

423
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:50,940
than Joe.

424
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,420
George Washington.

425
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,080
Really?

426
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,860
Yes, there is a town nearby here

427
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,560
that has a series of paintings

428
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,960
next to an old country store.

429
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,660
And it says,

430
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,720
the real first president of the United States.

431
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,380
I don't understand the story, though.

432
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,200
Really?

433
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,180
But they claim there was someone else besides George Washington.

434
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,520
That person later moved to northeastern Ohio

435
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,780
to become an Indian-hating farmer, a redneck.

436
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:20,940
Really?

437
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,540
Benjamin Franklin, the only president of the United States

438
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,720
who was never president of the United States.

439
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,640
And now, Dave, are you going to enlighten us

440
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,640
as to who this person is that really is the real first president?

441
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,620
Well, it's in a town called Hartsgrove, I believe,

442
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,100
or Williamsfield, or one of those two close to Geauga County.

443
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,220
Okay.

444
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,320
And it's a draw, a tourist draw,

445
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,540
that the people come and they look at this stuff.

446
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
And read the diary,

447
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,720
or, you know, what's left of a little makeshift thing

448
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,720
for a diary, you know,

449
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,360
and you go up there and you look at it and you go,

450
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,380
hmm, could be maybe there really was a different president

451
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,920
before George Washington.

452
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,820
If you walk away and go back to Chicken Falls

453
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,100
or wherever you're from,

454
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
that's all I can say.

455
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,700
That's all I will say.

456
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,360
I see.

457
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,400
So you do not know the name of this individual

458
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,400
who was the first real president of the United States.

459
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,580
No, but I will find out sometime.

460
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,320
Okay.

461
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,620
And I will report it duly.

462
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,620
Hey, I've got a report here

463
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,480
that just came in.

464
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,700
I got a very long text

465
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,760
from our friend Dr. Legume,

466
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,320
who lives in Seattle now.

467
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,440
Wow, he's a grambling guy.

468
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,040
He's been all over the world, hasn't he?

469
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,040
Well, this has a kind of an ironic punchline.

470
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,820
And I'm going to read this.

471
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,860
This is the first time I've ever read a text.

472
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,980
This is the first time I've ever read a text on the radio show.

473
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,020
It's another first, friends.

474
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,820
Machete improvises.

475
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
Another first.

476
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,100
Anyway, yeah, Legume texted me saying,

477
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,180
I just returned from Amazon Island.

478
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,460
I was literally the only man there among hundreds of women.

479
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,180
And I've spent three days there in a kilt and giant boots.

480
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,540
And naturally, since it's me,

481
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,260
it all went to hell.

482
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,860
In the most hilarious and ironic way.

483
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:27,000
It all started with me being invited to tag along

484
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,080
to a reunion of my girlfriend's college mates.

485
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,700
I'm expecting some rustic rental campground,

486
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,740
but no, it's more like a big-budget wisteria

487
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,380
with lodges and stuff.

488
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,620
And my girlfriend's friends show up,

489
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,060
and I'm there for three days,

490
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,860
surrounded by middle-aged women,

491
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,520
most divorced.

492
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,640
And of late, your humble doctor's been keeping up his exercises.

493
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,660
And I'm looking pretty damn fit.

494
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,060
So I walk up to the main food service pavilion at this place.

495
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,380
I walk in the door, and it's like a movie.

496
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,920
Everything screeches to a halt.

497
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,180
Every head snaps around and stares at me.

498
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,740
Hundreds of them.

499
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,620
The campground was also hosting

500
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,860
the Women to Women Recovery Weekend.

501
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,280
The trashiest pack of drug-addicted,

502
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,600
alcoholic losers you ever saw.

503
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,700
Like gazing deeply,

504
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,100
into the gene pool of someone you both know.

505
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,380
And they were not even a bit subtle.

506
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,140
The room filled with giggles.

507
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,980
One girl grabbed her friend by the head

508
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,700
and physically wrenched it around

509
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,040
so she wouldn't miss me.

510
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,460
And for the first time in my life,

511
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,600
I was the hot guy

512
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,820
and the only man on Hooker Island.

513
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,400
The subgenius dream come true.

514
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,580
Like in your old story about the subgenius

515
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,940
who wanted nothing more than to have someone touch his...

516
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,660
uh, wiener and how he crossed the burning desert for that.

517
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,180
So for the next three days, I heard hoots and whistles.

518
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,880
I was objectified and leered at like a sex object.

519
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,900
They raped me in their minds and their hearts and their eyes.

520
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,500
Oh, poor Dr. Lincoln.

521
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,780
And I was cool with that.

522
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,840
On the last day,

523
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,460
the owners of the campground approached me on the path

524
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,120
and told me they'd received several complaints

525
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,940
because many of the women in recovery...

526
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,380
are afraid of me

527
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,040
because they're survivors of rape and abuse by men.

528
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,860
Therefore, I should remain sequestered in the lodge

529
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,720
for the duration of my stay.

530
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,060
At no point during the weekend

531
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,820
did I approach a single person

532
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,760
or speak an impolite word to anyone who spoke to me.

533
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,460
I kept to myself

534
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,760
and at no time even responded to their wolf whistles.

535
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,600
I spent my weekend listening to the frogs

536
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,780
and strolling through the forest pass.

537
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,700
But that's not what they...

538
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:50,940
they said.

539
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,240
I saw.

540
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,460
The black rape death came from the woods,

541
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,780
hungry for victims.

542
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,020
He knew he'd hit pay dirt

543
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,880
as the place was packed with them already pre-victimized.

544
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,640
He skulked the shadows of the night,

545
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,440
peering through poop-yellow lust-maddened eyes,

546
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,140
seeking out the youngest and weakest to feed upon.

547
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,320
Seeing poor little alcoholic Polly

548
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,740
in her pigtails and Bible panties,

549
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,940
the dark monster lifted in,

550
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,360
his black groin flaps,

551
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,720
unleashing a torrent of evil rape

552
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,340
that raped her, et cetera, to death for seven years.

553
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,140
None of them were even in my league.

554
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,520
It's got kind of a familiar flavor though, don't it?

555
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,420
And I thought...

556
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,660
I thought he was describing his last Starwood at first there.

557
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,140
Yeah, when you said familiar flavor,

558
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,580
I thought it was one of my relatives.

559
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,180
Well, you know, there's moral...

560
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:50,500
I'm gonna give away the punchline of my big Starwood sermon.

561
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,940
The powerful new drug that's sweeping the nation

562
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,140
is moral outrage.

563
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,060
People feel...

564
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,480
It's not a drug, Stan. It's a consistent state of confusion.

565
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,500
Oh, God, they love it so much.

566
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,400
But, you know, Facebook. You get on it...

567
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,500
What exacerbates it, though? What causes it?

568
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,080
Pain and misery and insecurity, anxiety,

569
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,580
and inability to really get up off your butt

570
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,060
and do something about anything.

571
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,780
So instead, they get...

572
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:19,960
And they're more than...

573
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,940
People get up in the morning...

574
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,500
They read the news looking for something to tell their friends

575
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,900
how they're properly outraged about it.

576
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:34,120
And they're making sure that their friends aren't morally outraged

577
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,860
for the wrong reason.

578
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,580
I spent half today reading people on Facebook

579
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,200
alienating half their friends and families

580
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,500
just for that 10 seconds of juicy feeling

581
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,780
that you get when you push the send button.

582
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,500
But this is getting worse.

583
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,260
This is what you're saying is that it's getting worse.

584
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,460
It's reached epidemic proportions.

585
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,900
And you're not saying why, though.

586
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,840
Yeah, because of the internet. That's why.

587
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,320
Because they can.

588
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,300
Because they don't have to say anything to another person face to face

589
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,060
except at their job, and they hate everyone in real life.

590
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,320
So they get on the internet where their only friends exist.

591
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,860
You know, the people they don't have to spend any time with.

592
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,200
And just...

593
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,360
Just...

594
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:26,880
Just build up that drug-like feeling of moral superiority at all costs.

595
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,280
It's like, it's not enough to be outraged.

596
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,560
You have to be outraged for the correct reasons.

597
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,920
And frankly, I'm getting my outrage off of their outrage.

598
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,540
Yeah, me too.

599
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,000
They're turning me into a junkie.

600
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,920
I hate them. I hate them with a visceral anguish.

601
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,600
And it just won't go away.

602
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,340
I like to kick them in the pussy.

603
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,680
I like to kick them in the butters and smack them in the wing-wing.

604
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,720
And...

605
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,220
Well, I don't mind people whining and complaining as long as they're funny about it, you know?

606
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,540
Yeah, but how...

607
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,680
So I better come up with a joke myself.

608
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,100
After the second or third line, all of a sudden you realize that the person is really disturbed

609
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,920
and yet is living in society and should be smacked down.

610
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,700
Well, it's interesting the fact that so many of them have so much time

611
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:15,640
to...

612
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,880
to post their opinions.

613
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:19,920
On the internet.

614
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,800
Now, most of their opinions are only a few words long.

615
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,640
My life sucks.

616
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,840
LOL.

617
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,920
And then everybody else goes,

618
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,740
Yeah, I know how you feel, LOL.

619
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,480
And that's the level of discourse now.

620
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,560
A vapid crew of insolent swineberries.

621
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,440
Um...

622
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,300
Yeah, but...

623
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,120
You know, if you don't have something nice to say,

624
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,060
just don't say anything at all.

625
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,620
Yeah.

626
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,900
That's what my mom used to...

627
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,220
That's what my mom used to say.

628
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,880
That's what Donald Trump would tell you.

629
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,440
He'd say, if you got something...

630
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,780
If you don't have something great to say about me,

631
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,500
just don't...

632
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,660
You can't say anything.

633
00:37:59,460 --> 00:37:59,940
LOL.

634
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,720
I know how he feels.

635
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,980
If you can't say something about how wonderful and how beautiful

636
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:10,100
and how handsome and intelligent I am,

637
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,240
please do not speak in my direction.

638
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,000
Well, I guess we better end the show now.

639
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,480
Oh, no.

640
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,040
Switch over to music.

641
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,660
No.

642
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:18,900
No.

643
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,720
Just kidding.

644
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,800
Just kidding.

645
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,140
And then there's the problem of...

646
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,700
What's the polite word?

647
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,460
Ball busting?

648
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,020
Ball busting.

649
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,460
Where, you know, manly men call each other names

650
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,800
and say mean things to each other,

651
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,320
because that's how they show they're bros, right?

652
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,860
I suppose.

653
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,640
Well, on the Internet, that doesn't always carry.

654
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,420
Not everybody is really that excellent of a writer.

655
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,020
I mean, I don't know.

656
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,020


657
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,520
Wrong, I'm not gonna lie, okay?

658
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,020
I don't know.

659
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,460
Oh, man, we're not out of time yet.

660
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:02,100
If we did get to do something more interesting Eisley,

661
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,320
would it be so hard to keep our demands from all of us

662
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:06,640
to keep our own convictions,

663
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:06,640


664
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,260
I guess I don't know,

665
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,920
Are we really done with it yet, tonight,

666
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,320
or have we just started, you know,

667
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:17,000
We've got 5 to 3 books Jemma and I want to give some small notes.

668
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,920
to sound like all those whiners on the internet.

669
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:20,520
Yeah.

670
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,180
I think all those violent people should be punished

671
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,900
with amputation on live TV,

672
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,320
because violence is bad.

673
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,660
So we should be getting more violence.

674
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,360
I understand. I'm sorry.

675
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,820
I retract that statement,

676
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,280
and we'll put in a more suitable statement

677
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,180
within the next 22 minutes.

678
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,400
Well, like, for instance,

679
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,420
let's use this generic example.

680
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,460
I got up this morning, and there was bad news.

681
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,560
There was violence in the news.

682
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,180
Well, people were more upset

683
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:56,680
about whether each other's outrage at the violence

684
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,760
was the proper kind of outrage

685
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,040
than they were about the violence itself,

686
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,680
because some of them were going,

687
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,960
well, it's obviously a false flag

688
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,400
that candidate number one did to take away our guns.

689
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,420
Oh, no, it's a false flag that candidate B

690
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,780
did to...

691
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,500
I can't even follow some of the rationalizations.

692
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,640
But, you know, it's like you wake up with your...

693
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,620
You got your pet conspiracy theory,

694
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,180
and you just find the first thing in the news

695
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,760
and somehow manage to make that news item

696
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,080
validate your personal pet conspiracy theory,

697
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,260
the one that means...

698
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,720
That's the only thing that proves

699
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,360
that you're better than everyone else,

700
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,020
because you know something they don't know.

701
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:43,800
Yeah.

702
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,380
Especially if you're like a man

703
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,960
or a female orifice or an organ or...

704
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,720
I mean, if you're a male and stuff,

705
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,220
and you can somehow prove

706
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,720
that your male organ is the size of a boa constrictor,

707
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,860
you could just walk all over those people.

708
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,700
Well, yeah, but there's not many people proving that,

709
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,460
so that's not happening.

710
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,560
Well, verbally, they're trying to.

711
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,200
Exactly. They can't.

712
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,240
They use their cars or their Facebook page

713
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,080
to replace a healthy penis, basically.

714
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,260
Well...

715
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:19,420
Or relationships with other bipeds,

716
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,160
subgeniuses or humans.

717
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,900
Help me understand something here.

718
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,620
Reverend Stang, you played a piece of music this evening

719
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,440
that was called Pop That Bulbous Scrotum,

720
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,920
and then you're asking me

721
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,500
if teasing between men is called ball busting?

722
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,200
Wait a minute. I'm confused.

723
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,220
Well, or scrotum popping would be another term.

724
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,980
It would be more polite, I guess.

725
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,060
Yeah, yeah.

726
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,340
So, yeah, I hadn't made that connection, though.

727
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:48,660
You're right.

728
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,000
It's very uncomfortable, and I just don't get it,

729
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,700
but it's a guy thing.

730
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,640
It's boys.

731
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:55,840
Yeah, it's a guy thing.

732
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,460
You wouldn't understand.

733
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,680
Girls don't tease each other like that.

734
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,720
It's boys that do that.

735
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,740
It's a very important part of our existence.

736
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,840
It would be the same thing as, like,

737
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,900
if women were to argue

738
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,420
and they were to call it titty-dwanging

739
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,580
or something like that.

740
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,060
Right.

741
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,740
It's, you know, a sensitive area.

742
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,360
Not that sensitive.

743
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:11,940
We're not in a safe harbor yet.

744
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,000
Last week, we had to talk about,

745
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,660
uh, two cups of tea.

746
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:17,920
Also.

747
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,120
You'd be surprised how,

748
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,880
what kind of innocent things

749
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,480
can cause moral outrage

750
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,480
among an, oh, I don't know,

751
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,460
an FCC-minded crowd.

752
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,540
Well, most of these people

753
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,220
have IQs below 90,

754
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,080
and they have jobs...

755
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,840
That's the average.

756
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,380
The average IQ is 90, right?

757
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,340
So, by definition,

758
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,120
half of them are less than that.

759
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:40,900
Yes.

760
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,160
Subgeniuses, you might call them.

761
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,400
They're just...

762
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:44,720
They're not...

763
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,820
They're below a genius.

764
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,380
Yes.

765
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,660
I actually fall into that category.

766
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:49,740
I actually do, too.

767
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,040
If my...

768
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,360
I mean, my IQ hasn't been measured

769
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,740
since I was six years old.

770
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,460
And, of course,

771
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,420
those things are skewed

772
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,300
for six-year-old middle-class

773
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,940
white kids from Fort Worth.

774
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,600
They sure are.

775
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,080
So, apparently, I did well,

776
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,920
but not quite genius level.

777
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,240
I told Philo that around 1976,

778
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,080
and he said,

779
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:10,560
that's funny.

780
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,840
They told me my IQ was the same.

781
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,640
Hey, we're both...

782
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,960
We're just below genius.

783
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,900
I guess we're subgeniuses.

784
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,240
And...

785
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,740
And that's how it all began.

786
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,780
Well, I thought to myself,

787
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,560
that's what Bob and Philo

788
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,580
were talking about

789
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,740
while at that party

790
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,260
that they wouldn't let me go to.

791
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,120
That they wouldn't let you go to.

792
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,440
No, they didn't invite me to.

793
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,080
I snuck in.

794
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,040
That's the caveat to them tours

795
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,040
to all the other cavities

796
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,600
of them tours.

797
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,820
I had to...

798
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,480
Yeah, I don't want to say

799
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,180
what I had to do

800
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,200
to get into that party.

801
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,520
But I can...

802
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,200
Let me say this.

803
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:43,580
I can...

804
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,720
I can identify with women

805
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,300
who have been traumatized

806
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,260
by beastly acts.

807
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,660
Well, you have been raped by...

808
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:53,960
No, not exactly.

809
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:54,400
By a goon?

810
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,800
Like him?

811
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,540
No.

812
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,020
Psychically.

813
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:58,900
No.

814
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,760
He's waiting in line

815
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,940
just like everybody else

816
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,800
at Bob's door.

817
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,020
But...

818
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,560
With his palms open

819
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,040
and his...

820
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,380
Yeah.

821
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,720
You know, everybody...

822
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,620
If it's Bob,

823
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,320
then, oh,

824
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,520
it's different somehow.

825
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,700
Don't ask me.

826
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,100
A brisket of beef.

827
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,060
That's all I can think of right now.

828
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,360
A full, hearty brisket of beef

829
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,060
surrounded by slaves

830
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,640
with wearing truncheons

831
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,960
and ski masks.

832
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,240
And that just brings me back

833
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,280
to the same reasons

834
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,300
why I wanted to quit the Internet

835
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,080
to begin with

836
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,340
rather than listen

837
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,160
to these people's

838
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,900
irate confusion.

839
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,380
Well, it'll all be over

840
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,160
with soon enough.

841
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,140
X Day is, what,

842
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,220
two weeks away.

843
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,480
The day called X

844
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,560
when the world's biggest...

845
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,820
The world finally gets

846
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,220
what's coming to it.

847
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:46,980
A ton of slack.

848
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,380
Well, or not.

849
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,180
Well, the slack

850
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,840
for those who deserve slack.

851
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,520
And, you know,

852
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,440
for some people,

853
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,060
death would be slack.

854
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,680
Or slavery under a subgenius,

855
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,880
a benevolent subgenius dictator.

856
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:03,900
It might be better

857
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,680
than what they have now.

858
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,240
I don't know.

859
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,860
We're going to find out.

860
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:07,560
Or not.

861
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,600
Is this one of those bars

862
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,400
of Devo called Slouch?

863
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,780
Is it the same thing as slack

864
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,480
or is it almost the same?

865
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,020
No, no, no.

866
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,520
Slouch is blasphemous.

867
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,500
That's the opposite of slack.

868
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:18,240
That's mere...

869
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,360
That's like sloth and sloth.

870
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,220
It's laziness.

871
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,380
That's not the same thing as slack.

872
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,200
Slack is doing what you want to do.

873
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,180
It's not doing nothing.

874
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,920
Unless nothing is what you want to do,

875
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,200
then that's slack for you.

876
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:31,920
But most people

877
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,800
actually get bored

878
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,960
with nothing pretty quick.

879
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,180
Okay, I see the subtle differences

880
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:38,960
in between the...

881
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,420
Slack, sloth, nothing, laziness.

882
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,680
Stupidity versus subgeniusness.

883
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,080
Working real hard

884
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,660
on something you love really a lot.

885
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,580
That's your big slack.

886
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,000
Brainlessness versus break thinking.

887
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,000
Break thinking?

888
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:54,520
Yeah.

889
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,160
Like a form of dance?

890
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,640
Break winding versus no mind.

891
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,980
The practice of no mind.

892
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:04,160
That's a kind of a zen-like thing.

893
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,640
I smell the zen thing there.

894
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,340
Yeah, first you stop desiring.

895
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,060
You even stop desiring

896
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:11,400
to stop desiring.

897
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,860
You don't even care

898
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,520
whether you're desiring or not.

899
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,480
Then, much less whether you're desirable.

900
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,980
And at that point,

901
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,100
you get a hit TV show

902
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,200
and run for president.

903
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:25,920
I guess.

904
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:26,580
I don't know.

905
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,760
I don't know.

906
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,200
I'm just not so sure

907
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,220
I'm right about everything

908
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,300
like I used to be.

909
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,100
The more I learn,

910
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,040
the less sure I am of everything.

911
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,780
It's funny how that works.

912
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,180
Billy Goats and Frogs

913
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,220
used to have the gumps

914
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,560
and they had to understand things

915
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,060
before they could run for orifice.

916
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,620
Like, say, for instance,

917
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,380
Donald Trump.

918
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,920
He has no understanding

919
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,440
of comprehension.

920
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:54,640
That's it.

921
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,340
Well, that means he's a perfect representative

922
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,640
of the average American.

923
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,500
He doesn't know

924
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,840
and he doesn't want to know

925
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,720
and he doesn't care.

926
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,560
He just knows what he wants

927
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,620
and what he wants

928
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,340
is what he's going to say right then.

929
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,700
And that's all there is to it.

930
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,900
And some people,

931
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,480
that's what they wanted

932
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,160
was a confidence man.

933
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,700
A confident man.

934
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,860
Whether there's any reason

935
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,440
for that confidence

936
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,520
or whether it's just

937
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,160
kind of a form of insanity

938
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,300
doesn't matter

939
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,300
because the important thing

940
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,840
is somebody acts like

941
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,900
they know everything.

942
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,880
Just like all the most ignorant people

943
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,540
in the world.

944
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,980
Are the most sure and certain

945
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,720
that those smarty pants

946
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,580
don't know nothing

947
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,560
because look at the world.

948
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,300
It looks pretty flat to me.

949
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,940
Which, by the way,

950
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,020
the flat earth thing is coming back.

951
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:54,820
Unbelievable.

952
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:55,360
It is.

953
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:56,760
In the last year,

954
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,660
because of this, you know,

955
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,060
proud to be stupid thing,

956
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,500
it's like now,

957
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,240
well, we've seen it

958
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,820
with all the different minority,

959
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,580
you know, for women,

960
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,180
became proud just to be women.

961
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,540
Black people got pride

962
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,540
in their ethnic heritage

963
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,440
and, you know,

964
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,900
whatever your thing is,

965
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,280
you're encouraged to be proud.

966
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,560
And finally, the stupid

967
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,960
are stepping up to the plate

968
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,780
to take pride in their

969
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,980
special understanding.

970
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,120
And, you know,

971
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,000
when a subgenius is griping

972
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,400
about people being stupid,

973
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,120
that's a bad sign, man.

974
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,600
That's a canary in the coal mine.

975
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,300
And the buzzard eating

976
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,100
the canary in the coal mine.

977
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,380
Yeah, that's a couple

978
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,680
of fierce birds right there

979
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,860
trying to eat each other's food.

980
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:46,840
Who do you think is going to win,

981
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,160
the canary or the buzzard

982
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,700
in that coal mine?

983
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:50,220
The smallest of the two

984
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,160
is not going to win.

985
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,280
But they're both going to die

986
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,000
because there's gas leaking

987
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,420
into the damn mine.

988
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,160
Oh, I forgot that part.

989
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:57,500
Yeah.

990
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,240
So that's why they have us

991
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,860
canaries down here, Dave.

992
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,340
That's why they're just

993
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,780
waiting to hear us stop singing.

994
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,260
And when we quit singing,

995
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,080
they go, hey, wait a minute.

996
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,780
Somebody check the canary.

997
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,660
Oh, my gosh, it's dead.

998
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:14,400
And not a mark on it.

999
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,920
Do you smell something funny?

1000
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:16,840
No?

1001
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,040
Let's get out of here.

1002
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,240
So, what?

1003
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,220
The boss man,

1004
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,740
the elevator,

1005
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,440
they turned the power off

1006
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,700
to save money.

1007
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,060
We can't get,

1008
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,220
we can't take the elevator

1009
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,940
out of this collapsing coal mine.

1010
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,400
It's Obama's fault.

1011
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,280
He's trying to destroy

1012
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,120
the coal industry.

1013
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,000
There you go.

1014
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,000
It all adds up.

1015
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,660
Any conspiracy theory

1016
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,640
can be validated

1017
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,500
just by the proper exercise

1018
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,820
of stupidity,

1019
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,620
impatience,

1020
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:49,620
ignorance,

1021
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,460
and a general tendency

1022
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,560
to see the world

1023
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,820
as black and white,

1024
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,480
right or wrong,

1025
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,080
no in between.

1026
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:58,760
And since there's

1027
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,240
no in between,

1028
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,260
you've got to be

1029
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,120
either right or wrong.

1030
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:01,720
And since it's you,

1031
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,460
you must be right

1032
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,760
because you couldn't be wrong.

1033
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,360
Or confused

1034
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,480
or maybe not,

1035
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,280
maybe not.

1036
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:08,280


1037
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:08,280


1038
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:08,280


1039
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:08,280


1040
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:08,280


1041
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:08,280


1042
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,080
I mean, I'm not really qualified

1043
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,560
to judge exactly

1044
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,820
how the entire world

1045
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,480
should be run.

1046
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,260
But strangely enough,

1047
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,380
everybody seems to know

1048
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,980
how to run the zoo,

1049
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,100
the world,

1050
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:18,860
the convention,

1051
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,080
the traffic,

1052
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,440
my business.

1053
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,280
Well, I thought that

1054
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,000
what you said,

1055
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:26,840
the simple premise

1056
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,860
was the very best,

1057
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,720
was I smell something funny,

1058
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,700
let's get out of here.

1059
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,060
That's, to me,

1060
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,520
that encompasses everything

1061
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,000
from A to Z.

1062
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,500
But I can't,

1063
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,220
I can't leave

1064
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,640
because I'm too depressed.

1065
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,300
I can't change my environment

1066
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,460
because they've already

1067
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,360
beaten me down.

1068
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,040
The conspiracy is so powerful

1069
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,160
that I can't quit my job

1070
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,380
and change to another job.

1071
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,760
I'd lose my house

1072
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,760
in between jobs.

1073
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,800
I can't, I'm helpless.

1074
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,020
I'm completely helpless.

1075
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,180
I need a strong man to save me.

1076
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,120
And in lack of that,

1077
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,120
I need somewhere

1078
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,000
to really complain bitterly

1079
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,180
so everyone will know

1080
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,360
to feel sorry for me

1081
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,640
for the right reasons.

1082
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,240
Not for the wrong reasons.

1083
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:09,700
I don't want them

1084
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,560
to feel sorry for me

1085
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,260
just because I'm lazy and stupid.

1086
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,860
I want them to feel sorry for me

1087
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,500
because it's their fault.

1088
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,420
There is a lot of

1089
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,780
Wittgenstein-style semantics

1090
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:21,360
going around

1091
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,900
stating that the use of,

1092
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,740
the use of language

1093
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,620
in the case of Donald Trump

1094
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:30,160
is very, very close to...

1095
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:31,700
Seventh grade?

1096
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,980
Yeah, I noticed that too.

1097
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,900
And, you know,

1098
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,100
it seems obvious,

1099
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,380
but to have a bunch of,

1100
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,600
social scientists

1101
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,560
and sociologists

1102
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,300
and other people

1103
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,940
bring out direct references...

1104
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:43,320
That's because

1105
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,320
those sociologists

1106
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,340
are no better than

1107
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,560
sophomores in high school.

1108
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,420
It's like sophomores

1109
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,940
making fun of the seventh graders.

1110
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,780
And here's old man Dave

1111
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,960
and old man Stang

1112
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,240
and young, beautiful Princess We

1113
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,760
sitting on our mountaintop judging.

1114
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,120
It's so much fun to judge.

1115
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,780
It's even better than pushing send.

1116
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,660
Hey, we're pushing send

1117
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,720
on the radio.

1118
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,060
That's even better

1119
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:07,480
than pushing send.

1120
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:07,820
We're pushing send

1121
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:07,820


1122
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,380
Uh-huh.

1123
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,380
Yeah.

1124
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,880
Because they can't talk back.

1125
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,140
And if they could talk back,

1126
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,140
we wouldn't listen anyway.

1127
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,400
Well...

1128
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,860
Their disparate arguments

1129
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,380
would be cast into the wind.

1130
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,240
We'd turn everything around

1131
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,940
and make them sound silly.

1132
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,840
We'd argue amongst ourselves

1133
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,180
to make each other sound silly.

1134
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,860
And then we would pronounce a winner.

1135
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,260
I don't know if we would say it

1136
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,460
in Spanish or Urdu,

1137
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,500
but we would pronounce a winner.

1138
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,020
Spanish or Urdu?

1139
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:38,740
Well, you know,

1140
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,080
the only one who always wins

1141
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,800
in the end is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1142
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,140
On Dr. Death.

1143
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,360
Oh, old Dr. Death?

1144
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,020
Yes, he...

1145
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:48,680
Well, yeah, sure.

1146
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,480
The grinning guy always...

1147
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,220
Well, wait.

1148
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:52,900
Which grinning guy?

1149
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:53,380
The skull?

1150
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:54,340
The death guy?

1151
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,520
Or the pipe guy?

1152
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,780
Because they're both grinning

1153
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,900
like a skull.

1154
00:52:59,260 --> 00:52:59,740
Yeah.

1155
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,440
One's got a sith

1156
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,540
and one's got a pipe.

1157
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,820
And semantic disagreements.

1158
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,820
One's got horns

1159
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:07,460
and one's got a pipe.

1160
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:07,460


1161
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:07,460


1162
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:07,460


1163
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:07,460


1164
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:07,460


1165
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,600
And one's got Brylcreem.

1166
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,540
I'll go with the Brylcreem savior.

1167
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:15,480
Or the Mephistopheles type guy.

1168
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,480
Or the least Mephistopheles.

1169
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,520
Hey, speaking of Mephistopheles,

1170
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,600
Princess Weed,

1171
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,520
did you ever find out

1172
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,480
whether Mickey Mephistopheles

1173
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,960
was coming to X-Day or Starwood?

1174
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,100
He would love to come,

1175
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:29,600
but he...

1176
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,220
He got scared of X-Day

1177
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,460
because he read about

1178
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,740
somebody being butthurt.

1179
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,120
No, actually,

1180
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,020
his slave job is keeping him

1181
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,160
and he's unable to come.

1182
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,860
But he wants to come

1183
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,940
to the witch's ball.

1184
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,040
Well, it was such a shame

1185
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,380
to see him being picked on.

1186
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,040
This is his satanic majesty, okay?

1187
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,300
This is a guy whose skin is red.

1188
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,820
He's got horns on his head.

1189
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,840
Now, granted, he has giant shoes

1190
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,120
and a big red nose.

1191
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,920
And he talks like this.

1192
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,260
But he's, you know,

1193
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,420
he's satanic.

1194
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:07,880
Right.

1195
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,360
And then he shows up at Starwood

1196
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,740
and he's been to a couple of X-Days.

1197
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,320
Not the way Satan talks.

1198
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,260
Well, the funny...

1199
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,280
No, no, he does.

1200
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,000
He talks just like Mickey Mouse.

1201
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,800
No, Satan talks like...

1202
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,360
Actually, it's kind of a lift, too.

1203
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,300
It's a bit of a lift,

1204
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:23,820
but he talks...

1205
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,500
And he gets picked on by children.

1206
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,660
He's Thayton, Prince of Darkness.

1207
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,320
Yeah, Thayton, Prince of Darkness.

1208
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,060
Thayton, Prince of Darkness.

1209
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,220
He stabs them with his trident

1210
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,860
and yet they cannot feel

1211
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:35,920
and they laugh still.

1212
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,280
Don't you...

1213
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:37,460
Don't you...

1214
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,500
He can't come this year.

1215
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:39,780
Here's a real good picture

1216
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,200
of me and Thayton

1217
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,420
standing in front of the fires of hell.

1218
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,340
And Oberon.

1219
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,320
Oh, that's right.

1220
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,620
Yeah, the head of the sex cult,

1221
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,920
the Church of All Worlds.

1222
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,340
Yes.

1223
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,100
The...

1224
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:51,920
Yeah, yeah.

1225
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,360
So, yeah, there's Satan

1226
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,340
and two sex cult guys.

1227
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,140
A real sex cult

1228
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,080
and a fake sex cult guy.

1229
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,200
And an easy way to see it

1230
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,880
is just to type the word Starwood

1231
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,820
into your browser.

1232
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,800
I've gotten that picture many times.

1233
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,220
You have?

1234
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:04,540
Yes.

1235
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,300
Just by typing in Starwood.

1236
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:06,960
That picture?

1237
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:07,240
Yes.

1238
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:07,700
That picture.

1239
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,420
The picture of me and the devil

1240
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,600
and the cult leader?

1241
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:11,160
Yes.

1242
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,560
Well, you know, I typed in...

1243
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,120
I typed in the word...

1244
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,660
I have to spell it out on the radio.

1245
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,400
T-I-T-S.

1246
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,200
Uh-huh.

1247
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,700
And the second picture that came up

1248
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,740
was Suzy the Floozy

1249
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,900
at an ex-day

1250
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,840
after she had had her body cast made.

1251
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,140
And there she was standing

1252
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,780
next to her own torso.

1253
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,480
Her own gorgeous torso, by the way.

1254
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,020
So...

1255
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,540
Yeah, you just never know

1256
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,380
what you're going to see

1257
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,220
when you Google those things.

1258
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,740
But, Dave, believe it or not,

1259
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,140
the time has flown away.

1260
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,080
And all of Suzy is gorgeous,

1261
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:48,740
by the way.

1262
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,600
Just saying.

1263
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,140
I can imagine that.

1264
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,140
We got...

1265
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,080
We're talking about getting you here

1266
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,160
to the station for the ex-day show

1267
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,140
in two Sundays.

1268
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1269
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,220
And...

1270
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,800
Oh, I mentioned...

1271
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,960
I've been talking about ex-day,

1272
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,240
but I forgot to mention something.

1273
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,180
Women get in free.

1274
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,860
This isn't normal.

1275
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:07,000
This isn't normal.

1276
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:07,560
Wait a minute.

1277
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,440
Yeah, and it's a dumb idea,

1278
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,520
and it sounds like a strip club, right?

1279
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,940
Strip clubs make that offer

1280
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:13,720
because they're desperate.

1281
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,120
Well, this was...

1282
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,260
We were accused of

1283
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,000
the stupidest thing

1284
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,980
you could ever imagine.

1285
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,800
And I was stupid

1286
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,100
and took the accusation seriously enough

1287
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,920
to go, no, no, we like women.

1288
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,040
In fact, I'll put my money

1289
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,900
where my mouth is.

1290
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,600
Ladies can get in free to ex-day this year.

1291
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,560
It didn't help

1292
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,700
with those...

1293
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,960
with the anger.

1294
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:37,320
I mean, there are angry people,

1295
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,620
but apparently there are going to be

1296
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,320
lots of people getting in free this time.

1297
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,300
Let me tell you,

1298
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,300
nobody respects women more than

1299
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,340
the Church of the Subgenius.

1300
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,500
I respect them more than anybody.

1301
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,640
I'm the most respecting...

1302
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,040
I'm the most respecting church

1303
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,360
in the universe.

1304
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,360
Thanks, Donnie.

1305
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,740
I think that's the way you should publicize it,

1306
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:00,540
is free women.

1307
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:01,800
Well, we did.

1308
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,840
That was the fright.

1309
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,280
Well, no, women free.

1310
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,500
Free women is different.

1311
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,000
So it's just women free.

1312
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,000


1313
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,600
It may end up being women free,

1314
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,760
but so far, we have had quite a few pre-regs.

1315
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,780
Anyway, this is the Hour of Slack,

1316
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,340
the official voice of the Church of the Subgenius.

1317
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,400
You can find out more about all of that

1318
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,580
and the stuff we play,

1319
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,980
such as the Rudy Schwartz Project coming up,

1320
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:26,460
by clicking around on subgenius.com.

1321
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,020
And now I'm going to play

1322
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:32,180
the next to last song

1323
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,280
from the Rudy Schwartz Project album

1324
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,740
called Sunshine Supers.

1325
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,220
It's a hit.

1326
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,720
That's what I call it on the radio anyway.

1327
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,380
Another good seller besides free women

1328
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,660
would be Fierce Wombats.

1329
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,420
It's very intriguing to think of,

1330
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,600
you know, Fierce Wombats.

1331
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,020
Hey, I hear the buzz now

1332
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,520
because I potted that out,

1333
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,160
but now we're not going to hear any of it.

1334
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:51,820
Thanks, Dave.

1335
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,760
Now I'm hearing it too.

1336
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,300
See you, Dave.

1337
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,440
Okay, bye, man.

1338
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:55,520
Bye, man.

1339
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,220
Bye, man.

1340
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:57,540
Bye, man.

1341
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:58,300
Bye, man.

1342
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:58,300


1343
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:58,300


1344
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:58,300


1345
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:58,300


1346
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:58,300


1347
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:58,300


1348
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:58,300


1349
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:58,300


1350
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:58,300


1351
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:58,300


1352
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,320
Bye, man.

1353
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,760
Bye, man.

1354
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:16,940
Bye, man.

1355
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:34,120
Bye, man.

1356
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,960
Bye, man.

1357
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,400
Bye, man.

1358
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,640
Bye, man.

1359
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,240
Bye, man.

1360
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,020
Bye, man.

1361
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:38,180
Bye, man.

1362
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:38,400
Bye, man.

1363
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,220
Bye, man.

1364
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:39,600
Bye, man.

1365
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:40,080
Bye, man.

1366
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:41,260
Bye, man.

1367
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:42,500
Bye, man.

1368
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,840
Bye, man.

1369
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:43,880
Bye, man.

1370
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,420
Bye, man.

1371
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:45,440
Bye, man.

1372
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:45,600
Bye, man.

1373
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:45,760


1374
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,220
Bye, man.

1375
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,700
Yesterday morning,

1376
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,440
Donald Trump went on the Today Show.

1377
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,200
And he came out and agreed

1378
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,440
with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.

1379
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,940
And Donald Trump said

1380
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:57,420
that grown men

1381
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,640
should be allowed to use

1382
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,600
the girls' restroom.

1383
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:11,780
I'm sorry that I missed your call

1384
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:16,720
I hope you won't be too appalled

1385
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:21,080
But it seems that I've got

1386
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,940
It seems that I've got

1387
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:28,140
My testicles in Ted Cruz's mouth

1388
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,160
Don't be concerned, I'm doing fine

1389
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:37,920
I know that we had hoped to die

1390
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,400
But right now my balls

1391
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,220
Both of my balls

1392
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,240
Are stuck inside of Ted Cruz's mouth

1393
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,700
I know very well that I had promised you

1394
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,320
That later we'd go out and have a beer

1395
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,460
No!

1396
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:03,440
La la la la la la la la la la

1397
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:08,320
It's just hard to socialize

1398
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,220
With this uncoiled inside my ring

1399
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:15,940
It's been this way for several weeks

1400
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:20,880
There's bruises forming round his cheeks

1401
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:25,020
Oh dear, it seems my testicles

1402
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,540
Are into Ted Cruz's mouth

1403
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:28,120
Oh dear, it seems my testicles

1404
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:32,940
Are into Ted Cruz's mouth

1405
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:46,080
That sound it makes me cry

1406
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,880
No excuses made that are placed on the screen

1407
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:03,560
Mais oui j'ai mis le testicule in Ted's bruises mouth

1408
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:09,160
You and I should really find the time to take a stroll down by the sea or in the village square

1409
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:16,260
La la la la la la la la la la la

1410
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:24,320
That will give Ted time to floss and extra beat my cubic hair

1411
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:33,960
It's getting late and sadly I'm still lipo dripping down my thighs

1412
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:40,980
Cause it seems I've got my balls, I still have my balls

1413
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:45,040
Stuck deep inside of Ted's bruises mouth

1414
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,420
Oh mommy!

1415
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:53,480
My sweaty rancid ballsack stuck in Ted

1416
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,300
Oh mommy!

1417
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,440
My bruises

1418
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,280
Mouth!
