1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
So, Bob, what religion are you converting to now?

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,940
The Soul Genius.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,740
The All-Powerful Genius of the Soul.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,200
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,900
Uh, yes, dear friends, and welcome to Hour of Slack number 1,151,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,900
which is actually a rerun of the ancient, crumbling, early 1987 episode,

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,220
Hour of Slack number 82, which was an especially good one.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:37,220
That's one reason for rerunning, and the other is that I'm busy being Professor Stang,

9
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,360
teaching a subgenius history and cult maintenance how-to course online

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,140
at Robert Anton Wilson's MaybeLogicAcademy.net.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,500
Teaching by internet is easy, because you don't have to shave or look nice or anything,

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,620
sort of like doing radio.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,740
The students are forced.

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,400
to listen to subgenius albums that even predate this show, which started in 1985.

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,800
The Puzzling Evidence show started in 1982.

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,460
Our first book came out in 1983, and our first pamphlet was self-published on January 1, 1980.

17
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,420
There, the history course is done.

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,600
Anyway, this old show, number 82, was done right after my first wife and I had a big fight over money.

19
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,480
And it shows in the show.

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,880
We also hear the young Michael Pazdik.

21
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,800
Heppie's classic ad, or part of it.

22
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:35,460
And some Ken Nordean, who is not a subgenius minister exactly, but did trade tapes with us.

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,080
We'll hear some of the greatest subgenius music ever, by Don Truby, Brother Cleave,

24
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,320
the late Reverend Clay Animation, and D.K. Jones in Malcolm X.

25
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,860
And even Buck Naked.

26
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:56,560
Some KPFA Puzzling Evidence show is going to be playing, which is so old that it has

27
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,580
Palmer Vreedies and Baby Dr. Howell and Baby Stang on it.

28
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:08,340
We'll hear Reverend Sister Chris doing William Burroughs for Bob.

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,340
Imagine that.

30
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:16,760
And best of all, an actual taped rant by Reverend Orton Nenslow, which is really wonderful.

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,300
The music in the background right now is from Stephen Kent's CD, Oil and Water.

32
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,540
But everything that follows is from the year of...

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,200
Of 1986, or 87.

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,360
21 short years ago.

35
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,480
Baby, I'm so making you burn.

36
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,300
Man, I'm...

37
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,280
This, this is...

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,400
Now, now, now, now, now...

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,860
FM in Dallas, Texas.

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,260
And, uh, dear friends, this is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour.

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,120
I want to point out that if you take this station's call letters, 90.9, and turn them

42
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,140
upside down...

43
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,540
Countless worlds upon worlds.

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,960
Worlds without end.

45
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,580
In these galaxies, every possible reality exists.

46
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,980
And what is reality on any one world is mere fantasy on all others.

47
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,460
Here, all is real, and all is illusion.

48
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,860
What is, what was, and what will be start here with the words...

49
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,400
Bob?

50
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,360
Bob?

51
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,360
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

52
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,880
Every time you say, see, hear, or think...

53
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,240
Bob?

54
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,000
That's your key phrase.

55
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,780
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

56
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,480
You see?

57
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,020
Maybe you should know what we're here for.

58
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,400
The Daddy S arte of the

59
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:18,400


60
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,600
And your smelly Lynds

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,120
When you arithmetic

62
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,600
but

63
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,540
it's phrase

64
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:26,540


65
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,400
See how well he obeys me.

66
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,620
He's loyal.

67
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,640
Stupid, but loyal.

68
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,160
A trait you will never share, Skeeto.

69
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,100
But little listeners, you may ask, is there hope?

70
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,420
Listen, you little listeners, whistling in the glistening mists.

71
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,600
Listen to these inspirational words from the Book of Lies,

72
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,520
Chapter 10, Bankruptcy, Verse the Never.

73
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,600
The passage runs, and I quote,

74
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,480
If you be tired or depressed,

75
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,820
if you've got that run-down feeling,

76
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,180
remember, you're not just anybody.

77
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,300
You're special.

78
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,460
You are living proof that God does not exist.

79
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,460
Yes, you, little listener,

80
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
if you're like most of the people who listen to this show,

81
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,720
are proof that no supreme being could ever exist.

82
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,840
It's a duck hunt.

83
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,420
Hanson, please, don't start.

84
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,280
Please, please.

85
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,840
Yeah, I'm sorry.

86
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,060
I've got to start anyway.

87
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,100
I don't want to start, believe me.

88
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,900
Dear friends, I've got to admit,

89
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,120
I'm just too depressed to do a good show.

90
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,800
Today.

91
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,440
So, this one's going to be a terrible show.

92
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,440
I'm already convinced of it.

93
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,280
Because I started out depressed about money,

94
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,800
but now I'm depressed about everything.

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,100
You know, maybe slack and money are the same thing.

96
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,780
Maybe there isn't any reason to live without money.

97
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,360
Maybe nothing can ever be fun again.

98
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,680
Maybe the conspiracy is right.

99
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:04,180
A person without money, friends, is ipso facto a bad person.

100
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,700
A radio show without money, for that matter,

101
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,600
is by definition a bad radio show.

102
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,500
Goodness and one's value to humanity

103
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,200
is in direct proportion to one's income.

104
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,760
There's no reason to care about anything ever again.

105
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,280
Even if you inherit it,

106
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,720
that doesn't count.

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,160
It only counts if you've procured the money yourself.

108
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,160
Money, friends, is more important than any human being's feelings.

109
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,840
Feelings are ephemeral.

110
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,120
They're gone with the breeze.

111
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,760
You can't compress happy feelings or sad feelings

112
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,800
into tanks and store them in a bank.

113
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,820
Can't sell them, so they don't matter.

114
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,020
Feelings don't matter.

115
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,500
Not even action matters.

116
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,280
Not even trying to matter.

117
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,480
Not even trying to make money matters.

118
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,840
Even giving away money doesn't make you more of a man.

119
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,780
Only making money makes you worthy of anyone's respect,

120
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,860
including God's.

121
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,920
It doesn't matter what kind of job you have.

122
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,840
Just make money.

123
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,640
Even if your job is inherently immoral,

124
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,140
even if it exists to exploit and prey upon others,

125
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,160
as long as the conspiracy hasn't actually jailed you for it,

126
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,200
then that's okay.

127
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,840
It's better than a job that doesn't pay much.

128
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,480
I don't care if you invented a cure for cancer

129
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,360
if you weren't paid well for it.

130
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,160
Friend, you're a despicable fool.

131
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,500
I don't care if you spent the last ten years

132
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,060
in dangerous situations trying to aid oppressed, starving people.

133
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,500
You're lower than scum if you didn't get rich doing it.

134
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,700
And that includes Mother Teresa.

135
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,660
At PUBG, reliance on З me

136
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:05,720
And I only use B freelancer,

137
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:05,720


138
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,080
I don't care if it means hole myself.

139
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,280
I don't care if I make myself turn into Z me,

140
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,120
I don't care if I can do drugs.

141
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,280
I also don't care if I make what nobody else knows

142
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,480
and men.

143
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,700
I don't care if I dotı

144
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,380
Or put on a gold medal,

145
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,080
but I'm broke too.

146
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,620
It's because I don't have a head to prayer.

147
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,140
And my Vicent is really a reward for suffering.

148
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,640
Plenty of it.

149
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,580
I need dough and plenty of it.

150
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,560
Welcome, sweet little smackaroos.

151
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,060
Welcome, sweet little smackaroos.

152
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,040
Welcome, sweet little smackaroos.

153
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,080
That's the kind of sugar Papa likes.

154
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,580
Oh, just look at that fat, rich, printed number.

155
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,600
Oh, 200 pesos.

156
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,040
Welcome, sweet little smackaroos.

157
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,560
Hey, that's my number.

158
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,720
Oh, just look at that fat, rich, printed number.

159
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,960
That's the kind of sugar Papa likes.

160
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,500
Oh, I don't know.

161
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,340
everything goes wrong with me.

162
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,000
The office,

163
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,020
some guys there

164
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,780
that ought to get me.

165
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,080
And then at home, I don't know,

166
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,360
my wife,

167
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,600
all the kids, you know, everything.

168
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,620
And then there's the payments

169
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,300
due on the car.

170
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,040
Oh, no.

171
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,480
Oh, no.

172
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,720
Well, I'm just telling you,

173
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,300
I sometimes wonder if it's worth it.

174
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,080
I mean, really.

175
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,220
I wonder if it's worth even trying.

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,540
What am I killing myself for like this?

177
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,000
What am I...

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,980
I don't know.

179
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,380
Oh, if I had any brains.

180
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,420
That's the trouble.

181
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,760
I've got the brains,

182
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,860
but I don't know,

183
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,880
maybe it's my attitude.

184
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,120
It's wrong or something.

185
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,060
Nothing happens.

186
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,300
I figured,

187
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:52,700
that'd be

188
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,000
something in the office by this time.

189
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,640
Everybody gets pushed up ahead of me.

190
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,540
And that, of course,

191
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,200
and then there's

192
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,480
the wife

193
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,920
and the kids

194
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,820
and the trouble

195
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,420
and the car.

196
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,660
Yeah, and there's...

197
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,580
I don't know.

198
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,920
Let's have another drink.

199
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,140
Oh, stop it.

200
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,140
You're killing me.

201
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,820
See, it makes me feel much better

202
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,320
just talking to you.

203
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,520
Anytime, baby.

204
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,560
Anytime.

205
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,220
Anytime.

206
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,260


207
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,380
Oh, yeah.

208
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,660
That was Ken Nordean.

209
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,840
And that's how the conspiracies made me feel too, friends.

210
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,360
I don't know why I keep calling you friends.

211
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,400
I don't have any friends.

212
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,280
Nobody has any friends.

213
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,560
All we have are bosses and customers.

214
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,720
All the rest of it's bluff.

215
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,860
Pure bluff.

216
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,340
It's like on that Fireside Theater record.

217
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,820
We're all just faking being interested in each other as human beings.

218
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,480
All we're interested in is finding people we can have.

219
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:22,480


220
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,640
What pretending looks to be real is just imp musi.

221
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,900
None of now somewhat know what people they shot at us do.

222
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,980
Let's take a big step and see.

223
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,320
Yeah, you know the Mama thing.

224
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,980
Because Kim is such a little dummy in Canadian weather.

225
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,960
But, uh...

226
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,600
There's some kind of formula that's involved too.

227
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,160
함

228
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,480
Hey, you alright?

229
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,140
Okay.

230
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,840
and slammed against him and crushed him to death.

231
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,320
Crushed under quarters.

232
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,700
Slack friends?

233
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,280
Friends.

234
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,140
That guy got him.

235
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,760
Not as close to slack as any of us are going to get.

236
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,280
You know, it's gotten to where I can't even hate the conspiracy anymore.

237
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,420
At least they make money.

238
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,840
I can hate myself.

239
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,200
My money ran out and I haven't gotten any more yet.

240
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,960
Since I can't make any money when I hate myself this much,

241
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,900
I guess that means I'm out of money for good, huh?

242
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,720
The only thing that could make me like myself would be money.

243
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,220
That doesn't mean I'll like you if you have money.

244
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,560
I'll hate you even more, but at least I'll respect you.

245
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,120
Because I knew you could bluff better than I could.

246
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,800
So you can call Non-Nor-F-N-O-S-E-R-F-U-S-T-Y-A-N-O

247
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,520
and let the Will-O-Dobs bluff you.

248
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,080
You can bluff the Will-O-Dobs, I don't care.

249
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

250
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,680
Listen to this.

251
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,540
Listen to this.

252
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,200
Listen to this.

253
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:06,600
God has told me that your parents or anyone else who tells you what to do is the devil

254
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,660
and you ought to shout right back at them.

255
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,920
No, I'm not a Christian.

256
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,860
I'm not a Christian.

257
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,740
I don't have anything to do with that.

258
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,580
I'm not a Christian.

259
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,720
I want to say it so plain that a two-year-old child will understand me.

260
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,800
Be vocal.

261
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,700
Be loud.

262
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,780
Be concise.

263
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,100
And be clear.

264
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,900
I don't care who you are.

265
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,100
You ought to shout right back at them.

266
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,080
It's a cover-up.

267
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,680
It's a scam.

268
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,240
It's a facade.

269
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,060
There is no God.

270
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,780
Man is God.

271
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,960
Yes, I know.

272
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,060
Yes, I know.

273
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,540
There is no God.

274
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,300
Man is God.

275
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,620
Yes, I know.

276
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,040
Yes, I know.

277
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,620
Yes, I know.

278
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,320
No, I'm not a Christian.

279
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,300
I'm not a Christian.

280
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:41,800
No.

281
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,660
Christian.

282
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,040
A Christian.

283
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,980
A Christian.

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,580
A Christian held up to the American public as that which is good and noble,

285
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,160
when in reality it is.

286
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,820
Dirty, degrading, filthy, and rotten.

287
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,420
You'd better take a strong look, mister, at where you're going to change.

288
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,080
We can't give you all the answers.

289
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,540
But we can help you flesh out your fantasy that there are some.

290
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,400
At our lab, we use only the finest homemade ingredients.

291
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,200
Love.

292
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,180
Children.

293
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,140
Huh.

294
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,060
And the purest blend of money your needs can buy,

295
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,240
grown right here by our special process.

296
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,360
A process in use since our first mom-and-pop operation.

297
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,480
Who are we?

298
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,360
We're the normal people.

299
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,060
The most normal people in the world.

300
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,420
But not quite as normal as you.

301
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,120
Why?

302
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,580
You're unique.

303
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,280
It's natural.

304
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,940
Everyone's unique.

305
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,340
But you stand apart from the crowd.

306
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,520
You're normal.

307
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,140
Normal is a typical herd of sea cows.

308
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,600
Normal is an exploding stellar nebula.

309
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,960
Normal is the world in which we live.

310
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,380
And what could be more normal than that?

311
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,720
Certainly not the competition.

312
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,840
How do we stay so far out in front of a pack?

313
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,460
By building a race for the world.

314
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:22,460


315
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,780
Cast, track, decoy, ideology.

316
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,040
The join with a pickup of a domestic.

317
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,960
And the maneuverability of an import.

318
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,840
Who are we?

319
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,880
We're the communication people.

320
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,520
The people who talk is strictly state-of-the-art technology.

321
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,420
Its disposable.

322
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,920
Não está usurpada.

323
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,480
Reversible.

324
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,040
Reusable with almost any living brand of idea,

325
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,640
including our deluxe line.

326
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,960
Yours.

327
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:55,560
yours. Sound costly? Put away that semantic checkbook. Now communication can be yours

328
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,100
in a fashion of what it calls rent.

329
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:16,940
The end times are here, but there's nothing to fear. If you just send us a dollar. Get

330
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:30,800
ready, get set, prepare for the launch of the leading bit of a bomb. Remember the motto,

331
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:43,820
perform the salute, smack off and study the pandemics. And if you shoot harder, then look

332
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,420
to the sky.

333
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,840
Cause by.

334
00:16:49,560 --> 00:17:03,780
There's a pipe in the sky. And I'll follow you anywhere. Through the sun, there's no

335
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:16,280
power. Through American time. There's a pipe in the sky.

336
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:46,920
The mountains so high. Won't never set, these never bankers. Except for the 엄마 de havas.

337
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:46,920


338
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:46,920


339
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:46,920


340
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:46,920


341
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,600
Thank you.

342
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,460
Thank you.

343
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,500
Thank you.

344
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,720
Thank you.

345
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Thank you.

346
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,300
Thank you.

347
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,300
Thank you.

348
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,180
Thank you.

349
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,580
Thank you.

350
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,340
Thank you.

351
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,020
Thank you.

352
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,940
Thank you.

353
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,980
Thank you.

354
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,920
Thank you.

355
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,100
Thank you.

356
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,920
Thank you.

357
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,400
Thank you.

358
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,680
Distinguished guests,

359
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,600
brothers and sisters,

360
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,460
ladies and gentlemen,

361
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,160
friends and enemies,

362
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,840
Malcolm X.

363
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,480
No sellout.

364
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,600
Malcolm X.

365
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,260
No sellout.

366
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,380
Malcolm X.

367
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,940
No sellout.

368
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,060
Malcolm X.

369
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,620
No sellout.

370
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,220
No sellout.

371
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,100
No sellout.

372
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,060
No sellout.

373
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,280
No sellout.

374
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,140
Malcolm X.

375
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:58,000
They might sound like it's stirring up trouble, but it's the truth, it's the truth.

376
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:15,440
We don't care who likes it or not, as long as we know it's the truth.

377
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:29,280
No, we need either this or that, this or that.

378
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,440
If you're wrong, you're wrong, and if you're right, you're right.

379
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,940
There'll be no showduggery, no flim-flam.

380
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,420
No compromise, no sellout.

381
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,720
No control, no...

382
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,200
Malcolm X.

383
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,820
No sellout.

384
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,920
Malcolm X.

385
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,500
No sellout.

386
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,600
Malcolm X.

387
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,260
No sellout.

388
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,360
Malcolm X.

389
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,920
No sellout.

390
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,080
You can't deny that.

391
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,340
You may not like my saying it, but you can't deny it.

392
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,400
If you're afraid to tell the truth, why, you don't even deserve freedom.

393
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,040
You can't say that you're not going to have an explosion and you leave the condition.

394
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,640
And as long as those ingredients are explosive, the ingredients remain,

395
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,520
then you're going to have the potential for explosion on your hands.

396
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,020
You're going to have the potential for explosion.

397
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,560
You're going to have the desire for explosion.

398
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:36,560


399
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:36,940
Who's the low life.

400
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,920
Who is he?

401
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,020
Who is my hero?

402
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,420
Who is my��?

403
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,840
Who's my duranteur.

404
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,200
Who's the croat?

405
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,200


406
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,880
Who can be a tobacco,ος.

407
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,960
Who die in my sight?

408
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:47,980
Desiros, abs mines as long as you have hope in your head, you will be affable.

409
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:47,980


410
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,580
Not only will you find outdated ideas.

411
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,800
But this time you don't will fill these eyes with бокzer.

412
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:50,800


413
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:50,800


414
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:50,800


415
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,060
Your dreams never go wrong.

416
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,080
I'm not the kind of person who came here to say what you like.

417
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,440
I got a plate in front of me, but nothing is on it.

418
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,220
Because all of us sitting on the same table are all of us diners.

419
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,840
I'm not a diner until you let me die.

420
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,660
Then I become a diner.

421
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,560
I was in a house last night that was by my own.

422
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:59,200
It isn't something that made me lose confidence in what I'm doing.

423
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,120
I'm not a diner.

424
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,700
I'm not a diner.

425
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,460
Travel to your favorite outlaw state.

426
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,240
Free a hostage.

427
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,040
Mine a harbor.

428
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,340
Burn a notorious terrorist training site that's described as a Palestinian-ready G-Camp or Libyan village.

429
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,520
You get to pick the target and decide the public pretext.

430
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,340
Jews will look at many already finger-patterned statements.

431
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,880
Due to technical difficulties,

432
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,480
On behalf of the Seventh-day Adventist Church,

433
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,800
All Jews, the Armageddon special rides the challenge.

434
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,640
First space shuttle launch, Star Wars.

435
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,680
Receive a special briefing on America's first strike strategy.

436
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,540
And get back to Earth in time for nuclear winter.

437
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,220
Prize subject to cancellation if World War breaks out before Star Wars is completed.

438
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,700
It will be total organization.

439
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,740
Every muscle must be tightened.

440
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,160
Hey, I'll brush some of those bugs off Sting.

441
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,780
He sat still.

442
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,260
Still too long.

443
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,400
They're crawling into his mouth.

444
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,380
Oh, Reverend Andy.

445
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,460
Oh, what?

446
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,600
You talking to me?

447
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,560
Get him off me!

448
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,060
Get him off!

449
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:02,500
What?

450
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,880
You guys had that dream monitor on again.

451
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,520
What, you don't have any business in you saving my adulterous dreams?

452
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,400
Hey, I thought that dream was pretty good.

453
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,740
Just unfortunately, we couldn't get the bugs out again.

454
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,200
Look, look, we can sell these dreams to...

455
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,720
Sell somebody else's dreams to the Bobby.

456
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,680
Why do I have to drag my...

457
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,300
I sold it up over the years.

458
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,080
Cutting it off?

459
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,420
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

460
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,740
These are the same dream monitors used by the Lord God Almighty.

461
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:38,100
And he records your sins and makes you watch as they're played back later.

462
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,460
When you're only glad your life is so full of holes.

463
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,500
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

464
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,380
And I got it.

465
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:48,620
Well, as a matter of fact, we are Bob Dobbs Preach that, uh, uh, I don't, I don't practice what I preach, he said.

466
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,900
Because I'm not the kind of man or woman I'm preaching to.

467
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,400
I'm not the kind of man or woman I'm preaching to.

468
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:52,700
I'm not the kind of man or woman I'm preaching to.

469
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,640
Reverend Stang is referring to the cult of the...

470
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,500
Two, two, two subgeniuses, one.

471
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:02,260
...powerful blinding apostasy which fears no throne, but it looks in its own freedom to scatter its fundaments on the earth,

472
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,240
soiling the uppers of its shoes to let down the...

473
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,660
If there were any hope, I'd agree with you.

474
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,360
...fertilizing the fields of science, sorcery, art, and religion.

475
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,040
And in addition, my dear friends, our ministry neither neglects nor fails to mention,

476
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,900
besides and beyond our mulching of the field of sorcery,

477
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,140
our enrichment of the acreage of coppery,

478
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,400
our fortification of the soil of platery,

479
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,560
our irrigation of the garden of teapottery,

480
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,780
or our husbandry of the rich loam of cream pitchery.

481
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,720
For lo, the frock cloudeth my brain, and my buckler and shield are ripped away.

482
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,900
I am naked before thee, Dobbs, thou who hast unbuckled my buckler and unsnapped my shield,

483
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,500
which was my sole protection.

484
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,020
Yea, my buckler being unbuckled, I am even as a poe-bucker, buck naked before Bob.

485
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,180
Bob dashes a bucket of ice water over my loins.

486
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,980
The buck passeth not, for the doe and the buck dwell in the same forest.

487
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,540
The buck is Bob. He is bucking tradition.

488
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,780
He changes brickbats into buckets of bucks.

489
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,160
Bucks, bucks, yea, bucks, bucks, but it's difficult to explain.

490
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,060
I am chicken before my epoch.

491
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,440
Yea, foul, like the birds of the ground.

492
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,760
Merodicus, chapter 13, buck six.

493
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,760
Sick is this world, O Bob, who has beslimed the ground after thee,

494
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,560
even like unto the slugs and snails of the garden,

495
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,420
whose chambered shells you may crush and step on inadvertently.

496
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,120
Them Mowgli-Bobs.

497
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,220
Bob, Bob.

498
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,840
I got a Bob in my pocket.

499
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,480
Whoo! Got a Bob in my pocket and he's waiting for you.

500
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,000
And I ain't glad, neither.

501
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:27,860
Bob-Bomb.

502
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,420
Gosh.

503
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,020
This reunion is the first time I've ever heard of the Church of St. John.

504
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,420
You gotta go up before the Senate tomorrow and, uh...

505
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,340
Very impressive, Mr. St. John.

506
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,680
I'm a little worried about your, your testimony here.

507
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,820
I think we better go over this one more time.

508
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,240
Alright, you wanna rehearse it one more time?

509
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,020
I, I...

510
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,280
Look, as far as, I just don't understand. I mean, first they pay us...

511
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,740
I just don't understand you, Ivan.

512
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,200
Look, one of your lawyers there, Wellman, what's his name?

513
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,020
Yea, Wellman.

514
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,440
Yea, yeah.

515
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,620
He's just sitting over there with a tape recorder.

516
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,600
Doesn't that make you nervous? He's supposed to be your lawyer.

517
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,200
What's that tape for?

518
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,400
Well, uh...

519
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,440
Your Honor, the special marshal has, uh, permitted the use of a tape recording in this proceeding.

520
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,100
What are you doing here? This is supposed to be a private conversation between counsel and, uh...

521
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,740
And victim.

522
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,540
I know a sister. I just know a sister. She said I could...

523
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:19,380
It's time we leave the chambers and convene again as we enter the fourth half of our...

524
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,180
I'm gonna sit behind you.

525
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,040
I won't listen to that unless you're done...

526
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,520
Manders?

527
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:28,040
Manders, come over here. Show Reverend Stang what you're made of.

528
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:34,140
And, leaning at the child's underwear, Reverend Stang committed yet another indiscretion.

529
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,040
It's the sub-knowledge, you know, underneath the... You know what it says there in the Bible.

530
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,380
I want you to keep your mouth shut.

531
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,360
Of course you know what this will mean when you get caught.

532
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:01,680
I've seen, I've seen the man, I've seen the man in the dinosaur suits.

533
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:10,140
I've seen the men in the dinosaur suits walking and waving their spindly little arms.

534
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:20,660
I've seen them tromping and tromping across the bushes, stamping through little tiny model cities,

535
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,360
BUSTING!

536
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,700
I've seen the Japanese temples to flinders.

537
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:34,600
I've seen the man in the bad King Kong suit climbing up the imitation Eiffel Tower that

538
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,580
stands in the middle of Tokyo.

539
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,740
I've seen it all, friends, but...

540
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,440
X day, O X day...

541
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:52,500
Somebody said to me once, he says to me, he says, well, Bob is too psychedelic for me.

542
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:52,500


543
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:58,360
I mean, Bob... Psychedelic, he said, psychedelic you haven't seen.

544
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,480
You haven't seen psychedelic, little pals.

545
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:10,480
You haven't seen psychedelic until you've seen the flesh boiling off your bones.

546
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:18,140
Not just one time, not just a million times, but over and over again for eternity.

547
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:26,620
You haven't seen psychedelic until you've looked up in the sky and seen those dead ships

548
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:35,400
flying away forever and knowing, knowing that the next thing that's gonna happen is gonna

549
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:46,560
be the Earth, the entire planet Earth turning inside out, inside out, and the golden burning

550
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,120
cities of the universe.

551
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:56,940
The Nazi clone beasts led by the clone body inhabited by the evil, evil brain of Adolf

552
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,280
Hitler.

553
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,380
The golden cities are gonna be on the outside, and where are you gonna be?

554
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,480
You're gonna be on the inside, falling forever into the infinite gravity well, which is,

555
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,260
which will be the new home of Jehovah One.

556
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,120
He's here now.

557
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,680
He's here now.

558
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,100
They call him the Vanity.

559
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,100


560
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,100


561
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,020
Van Allen radiation belts.

562
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:27,200
They call him the magnetic field of the Earth, but you and I know, you and I know that it's

563
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,260
the D-E-R-O.

564
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,680
Yes, they've used that word before.

565
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,040
They've used that word wrongly so many times.

566
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,060
They, they pronounced it D-R-O.

567
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:44,520
They've pronounced it D-R-O and they've said it was the horrible robot.

568
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,120
Oh.

569
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,080
Well, we'll continue with that, uh, statement from the guy who's gonna be the robot.

570
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,080


571
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,080


572
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,080


573
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,080


574
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,080


575
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,080


576
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,080


577
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,080


578
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,080


579
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,080


580
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,080


581
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,080


582
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:55,800
We'll continue with that statement from Reverend Orton Neslow of Boston next week.

583
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:02,580
This has been, that was the, uh, swinging love corpses there behind him and behind me.

584
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,620
And, uh, oh, this is the one I didn't play last week.

585
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,940
This is, uh, Brother Cleve Duncan.

586
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:15,620
No matter how much you shake and dance, the last few drops go down your pants.

587
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:15,940
Hit me.

588
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,400
Hit me.

589
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:48,060
With us I'm R음 מת halыҡ carts, but we should talk about some more of it.

590
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,060


591
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,800
If you think it's gonna get any better

592
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,900
Just keep dreaming away

593
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,460
You got to hold your head up high all day and night

594
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,420
Cause if you're the only weapon you need

595
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,700
To settle up a fight

596
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,040
Cause no matter how much you shake and dance

597
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,400
The last few drops go down your pants

598
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,800
No matter how much you scream and shout

599
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,160
Ain't nobody gonna try to help you on out

600
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,660
No matter how much you piss and moan

601
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,740
Ain't nobody gonna go and leave you alone

602
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,420
No matter how much you whack your head

603
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,720
You're better off living than being dead

604
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,400
Society pushes harder on you every day

605
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,180
You gotta get the truth back and you hear them say

606
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,020
You can't work, you can't get, you can't eat until you know

607
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,820
There ain't enough to go around and it's starting to show

608
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,840
The planet's getting the power all the time

609
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,500
Romantic in your brain just like the grape turning to wine

610
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,600
We gotta destroy the forces that are stealing your slack

611
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,980
Scare all them mothers giving one big heart attack

612
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,640
We gotta regain control of our destiny

613
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,820
Cause they wanna take it away from you and me

614
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,600
But we gotta stop all this fighting amongst ourselves

615
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,540
Cause that just keeps them confused and they think that's swell

616
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:33,420
Set up all your lights and soon you'll win them back

617
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,160
Or else I'll barbecue you while you're lying there on your back

618
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,480
No matter how much you shake and dance

619
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,880
The last few drops go down your pants

620
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,940
No matter how much you shake and dance

621
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:54,280
What about government's role in offsetting the negative consequences of the free enterprise business community you talked about?

622
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,000
Oh, now, no, now you get back, no, now you get back to what I said earlier.

623
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,880
What I'm talking about is the free marketplace, free enterprise.

624
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,580
The regulations that government exists to have and are necessary

625
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,900
is yes, to ensure that someone can't sell us a can of poisoned meat.

626
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,340
I think, um, uh,

627
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,840
every can of poisoned meat had a problem that I think the people must recognize.

628
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,700
The problem is, uh, if you open a can of poisoned meat,

629
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,320
hold it in your hand, it gets warm very fast while you're drinking it.

630
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,140
We punch the holes in the top and drink it.

631
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,620
Well, this fella's made a very economical stein handle.

632
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,900
You can buy a dozen of them and have them like you have your silverware.

633
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,120
You're serving people, uh, poisoned foods in the can.

634
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,840
You just clamp the stand, snap the stand.

635
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,860
You just clamp the stand, snap the stand.

636
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,080
You just clamp the stand, snap the handle onto it,

637
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,640
and people hold it, but the handle in the drink doesn't warm up.

638
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,700
And he's gonna make a million dollars.

639
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,100
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

640
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:12,020
Oh, uh, that was, uh, Doug Kahn did that, uh, cut, that amazing little cut there.

641
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,440
Doug Hunt.

642
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,980
Uh, Hanson, please, don't, don't, don't start. Please, please.

643
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,260
Ah!

644
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,800
Ah!

645
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,460
Listen, our evil has landed. The world is in great danger.

646
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,320
Yeah, it certainly is when you're out on the highway.

647
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,100
Look out!

648
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,180
Feels like something inside me.

649
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,780
I'm thawing at my guts. What's wrong with me?

650
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,040
What did you have for lunch?

651
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:43,940
Oh!

652
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:45,820
Oh!

653
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,920
Oh!

654
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:47,120
Uh-huh!

655
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,240
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

656
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,020
Ah!

657
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:49,740
Ah!

658
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:50,820
Ah!

659
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:56,740
Well, I guess I don't have to tell you everything you know about the revolution is wrong.

660
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,160
You know that now.

661
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,180
But did you know that Indians can be in two places at once?

662
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,660
That they can change into animals?

663
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,260
That they invented the wire recorder?

664
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,940
Oh, I've seen it. I've heard it.

665
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,620
Now, listen to this.

666
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,660
The idea is not to be funny here.

667
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,240
Okay.

668
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:21,040
The idea is to give you some clues as to what's happening in general.

669
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,880
Quite well. Okay. Bye-bye.

670
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,660
Okay, bye.

671
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,420
This is actually the only way to escape this show.

672
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,820
He's listening to it.

673
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,440
I know.

674
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,020
Yeah.

675
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,040
Oh, wake up!

676
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,080
Something may happen, Henry.

677
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,980
Tell him to wake up.

678
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,500
This one's not very reliable because there are no definite rules.

679
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,080
Why are the subgeniuses interested in it?

680
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,880
That is tough.

681
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,260
Bring the idea back to me.

682
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,060
Oh!

683
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,760
Oh, my God.

684
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,040
Does it hurt to listen to this show?

685
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,360
No, no.

686
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,340
Okay. Here we go.

687
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,660
Should be washing all over on the mock.

688
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:49,860
That's right.

689
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,300
That's right.

690
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,400
The show should be laughing at your feet right now and just kind of licking at your

691
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:53,820
thighs.

692
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,200
The show should be too heavy, a little thinking.

693
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,240
Oh, God.

694
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,620
This is awkward.

695
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:08,620


696
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:08,620


697
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:08,620


698
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:08,620


699
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:08,900
Oh, God.

700
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,640
We've got to leave him.

701
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,500
Oh, God.

702
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,020
Are you okay?

703
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,020


704
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,020


705
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,020


706
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,020


707
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:24,140
Oh, dear friends, thanks to Puzzling Events and Gary DeBrogkram for that last little bit from the Subgenie show on KPFA in Berkeley.

708
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:28,500
I can see that he has a strong hold on this family.

709
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:35,340
I'm paid. It's like I'm transforming inside. I'm afraid I'm about to become something else.

710
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,300
Oh, great. Like a sex change or something.

711
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,920
Like something's growing inside me. It's replicating and superseding all my internal organs.

712
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,560
Well, we'll stop at a bathroom, then.

713
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,880
That monster's shape I saw.

714
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:51,860
Jennings!

715
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,320
It's inside my body.

716
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,620
This guy's delirious. He's not making any sense.

717
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,860
It's too late. The end of the world is coming.

718
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,120
I won't be the king.

719
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,320
Jennings, slow down. Steer, you big yo-yo. Steer.

720
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:08,980
Oh, my God.

721
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,280
This show is guaranteed to offend over eight people an hour.

722
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,420
That's right, and we're three of them.

723
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,360
Things are all stinky and smelly down here at this show.

724
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,520
Why go to work anyway?

725
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,400
It's scary.

726
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,440
What is this? How are we?

727
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,000
Okay, here's a little show part dripping onto the floor.

728
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:32,900
Ew.

729
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,660
That sure is awful.

730
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,600
Okay, now we kiss the show.

731
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,540
Beat it on this little diaper here.

732
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,420
Okay, thanks.

733
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,120
Hi.

734
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,140
Hi, Nicky.

735
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,640
I think what I'd like to see you do now is, you know, there's a little light on my radio.

736
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,500
It says stereo.

737
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,040
Yeah.

738
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,440
Can you turn that little light off and on and off and on?

739
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:53,920
Okay, watch this.

740
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,740
Dargon boarded Dragonflyer and telebonded to his steed.

741
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,220
Up, Dragonflyer! Take me up!

742
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,120
His red eyes glowed.

743
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,160
With satisfaction, as he cracked his whip beside Spiderflyer.

744
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,980
Everyone will panic.

745
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,080
Chaos will reign supreme.

746
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,320
Then, Sky Island will be mine.

747
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:25,200
Piled high on the dock, under the blazing suns, were thousands of shiny white eggs.

748
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,180
As the sun's heat spread through them, life began to stir inside.

749
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:36,360
Already, the fighter ant's strong legs were starting to scratch at the inside of their shells.

750
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,980
It was just a matter of hours before the first one.

751
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,660
Then, countless thousands of the monsters would crack open their shells and attack.

752
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,560
The transformation has come to lead.

753
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:52,000
I am now someone else.

754
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,580
Try telling that to me.

755
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,280
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

756
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,060

He's the one for me.

Arnold Palmer has been elected to the Ellis Island Hall of Fame as a Scottish golfer.

787
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,060
For the board, the elite, and the initiates.

788
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,660
Are these the words of the all-powerful boards and syndicates of the earth?

789
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,940
These are the words of liars, cowards, collaborators, traitors.

790
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,340
Liars who want time for more lies.

791
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,920
And where television networks are.

792
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:41,280
And underhandedly execute creative music visual channels like U68.

793
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:48,620
Or rearrange Pee Wee Herman shows with garbage galaxy high cartoon shows.

794
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:54,880
To acquaint late rising children to the new breeds of mutant and mucus-like classmates.

Cowards who cannot face your dogs, your gooks, your errand boys, your human animals with the truth.

To defecate forever.

801
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,520
For this you have sold out your sons.

802
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,020
Sold the ground from unborn feet.

803
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:23,840
Forever.

804
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,520
Traitors to all souls everywhere.

805
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:29,180
You want the name of Hassani Shaban.

806
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,860
Your filth deeds to sell out the unborn.

807
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,400
What scared you all into time?

808
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,380
Into body?

809
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,100
Into spirit?

810
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,280
Into spirit?

811
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:37,800
To the death.

812
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:39,520
To the death.

813
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:39,520


814
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:39,520


815
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,160
Alien word.

816
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:40,840

00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,000
In body.

819
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:46,840
And spew them.

820
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,100
Prisoner come out.

821
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,640
The great skies are open.

822
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:54,140
I, Hassan H. Shaban, rub out the word forever.

823
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,720
If you cancel I, all your words forever.

824
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,880
And the words of Hassan H. Shaban is also cancel.

825
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,520
Across all your skies.

826
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,900
See a silent writing of hardcore.

827
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,460
Short stereo flange.

828
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,060
Hassan H. Shaban.

829
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,540
Drew July 5th, 1998.

830
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,000
Over New York.

831
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,760
Oh, thank you, Sister William Burroughs.

832
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,340
Well, I don't care if I'm caught.

833
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,640
Let him go ahead.

834
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,020
Let him find out everything.

835
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,560
I think it would set a good example for the young subgeniuses out there.

836
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,540
You know, set a standard of honesty.

837
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,940
We need something to battle.

838
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,680
I mean, my gosh, when my mother-in-law looks at me and says,

839
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,680
I can't believe you're going to go out there and give that speech and then claim honesty as a defense.

840
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,920
Well, my gosh.

841
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,380
I mean, it's getting to look like it with all the way the politicians and the preachers are being.

842
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,520
Look, sir, you're in trouble.

843
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,720
You only have.

844
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,560
The subgenius church is probably the most conservative one left.

845
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,180
And that word.

846
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,500
I agree to help defend you here.

847
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:06,020
And yet you tell me that between your bank account.

848
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:11,760
And your home there, you only have an equity level of what was it?

849
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,740
Fifteen dollars and seventy five cents.

850
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,520
Fifteen dollars and two cents.

851
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,280
Fifteen dollars and two cents.

852
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:27,860
And but I mean, we had tremendous losses last year and a half of it was for lawyers with because this press, all these these so-called scandals.

853
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,980
I am your lawyer and I don't remember getting a penny of it.

854
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,200
Well, no.

855
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,340
Well, you're not our only lawyer.

856
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,040
I mean, you know, we have we have we have pretty big.

857
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,000
How do you think we won?

858
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,960
Not so loud.

859
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,780
In a court case without spending money.

860
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:43,840
Not so loud.

861
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,840
Senator Hale is out in the studio version.

862
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,980
Well, just because he didn't get any of the slow motion replay of Dobbs assassination.

863
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,820
The judge that needs to shooting money.

864
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,880
And I deflect prosecutors, prosecutors.

865
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,160
But what good is a bribe going to do a prosecutor?

866
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,880
What good is a script going to do this show?

867
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,060
Look, it's been on the.

868
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,500
Air half an hour now and nothing's happened.

869
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,660
There's been almost no continuity.

870
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,680
Only sitting over there taping everything.

871
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,620
He's taping the other guy with a movie camera.

872
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,420
They're being taped and nothing.

873
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,860
And there's hardly been any humor at all.

874
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:19,180
Yeah.

875
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:27,300
And I've got these little electrodes in my head so that every every podunk reporter can monitor every little dream or.

876
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:28,040
Latest.

877
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:28,420
Oh, yeah.

878
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:29,580
So you're talking about.

879
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:33,200
A healthy, red blooded preacher might happen to have natural selection.

880
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:33,580
About.

881
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,260
The young.

882
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,120
Volunteers and missionary.

883
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:36,740
Uh.

884
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:37,820
Dr.

885
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,420
Staines electrodes.

886
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:38,920
We have.

887
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,020
Tied into the.

888
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,360
Look, you're just lucky we kept them away from your back door.

889
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,560
You can access your mini computer using standard terminals.

890
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,000
Well, there's a lot of back doors.

891
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,020
They could probably be kept away from.

892
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,100
Smart turn terminal emulation.

893
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,560
Regurgitant software.

894
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,760
You wake up with a little pin in the back of your head.

895
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,020
So they can listen to everything.

896
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,060
Recorder.

897
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,080
I don't know what's a dream and what's not anymore.

898
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,200
Skull sockets.

899
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,240
All a dream, son.

900
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,180
Just lay back.

901
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:10,460
Are part of the new one with electronic equipment.

902
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,600
Beginning with most terminal emulation software companies.

903
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,200
Here, let me mop your brow.

904
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,160
With this sponge.

905
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,700
With Permasoft sponge.

906
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:20,660
It smells like ether.

907
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,100
Smart Terms.

908
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:21,560
The.

909
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:21,680


910
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,160
Exchanger.

911
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:24,980
At 240.

912
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,160
The latest in.

913
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:26,700
.

914
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:27,640
.

915
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:31,960
.

916
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:31,960


917
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,160
.

918
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:32,200
.

919
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:32,200


920
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,260
💣

921
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:44,940
Thank you.

922
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:53,700
But, I'm proud to be a part of it now.

923
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:53,720


924
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:53,720


925
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:54,440
.

926
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:54,440


927
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:54,440


928
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:54,440


929
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:54,440


930
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:54,440


931
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:54,440


932
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:54,460
.

933
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:54,460


934
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:54,460


935
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:54,580
.

936
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:54,620
.

937
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:54,660
.

938
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:54,680
.

939
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:54,700
.

940
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:54,760
.

941
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:54,800
.

942
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,000
.

943
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,000


944
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,000


945
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,020
.

946
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:55,040
.

947
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,040


948
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,040


949
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,040


950
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,700
Thank you.

951
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:49,920
Thank you.

952
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,560
Well, that was Zug's Rift off his new one.

953
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,580
I used to work at this fast food restaurant.

954
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:56,980
Oh, wait a minute.

955
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,780
I can't play that.

956
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,900
Yeah, that was Zug's Rift off of the new one,

957
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:02,100
Water.

958
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,000
Water.

959
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,640
It's got a lot of instrumentals on it.

960
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:09,180
And this coming up is from Plato's Nightclub

961
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,540
by Reverend Clay Animation.

962
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,980
The children's clothing is not too tight.

963
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,940
That will not be comfortable.

964
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,860
I shall continue to insist on civilian control

965
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:25,620
of our superb military establishment.

966
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,460
Punch with your right fist.

967
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:29,880
One.

968
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:32,160
Punch.

969
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:32,600
Two.

970
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,720
Extend your arm fully and add more power.

971
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,240
Punch.

972
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:39,800
Three.

973
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,240
There's going to be a picture on the wall,

974
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:46,400
a crack, a spot on the ceiling, anything at all.

975
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,680
Be sure to kick with the ball of your foot.

976
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:56,100
That could be your forehead, your nose, your ear, your chin,

977
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,180
just any part.

978
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,000
I regret this.

979
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:01,740
I regret this.

980
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:01,880


981
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:01,880


982
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:02,740
I regret this.

983
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,260
It may have been done in the course of the events

984
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,360
that led to this decision.

985
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:09,540
A strong defense is the surest way to peace.

986
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,840
Strength makes a calm attainable.

987
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,420
Weakness invites war as my generation.

988
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:21,260
My generation knows some poor, very bitter experiences.

989
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,540
Of course, I don't want one.

990
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,740
I'd just like to see what one would be like.

991
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,160
Kick nine.

992
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,880
Kick ten.

993
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:32,900
Excellent.

994
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:37,220
If anything, you'll be just slightly distasteful.

995
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,900
But it will not bother you.

996
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,520
Just slightly unpleasant.

997
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,340
Execute a low block to defend yourself.

998
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,440
Then in order to prevent your opponent from attacking again,

999
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:55,240
it is recommended that you quickly apply a counterattack,

1000
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,600
such as a...

1001
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,440
Try telling that to your insurance company.

1002
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,240
I think he needs some coffee.

1003
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,200
Well...

1004
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:01,420
I don't know.

1005
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,400
Sit down.

1006
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,200
I need a beer bath.

1007
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,720
Gotta find a waitress.

1008
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:05,880
Yeah.

1009
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,400
Hey, honey.

1010
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:09,980
Yo.

1011
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,500
Yeah, I'm coming.

1012
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,080
Here she comes.

1013
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:14,780
Whoa!

1014
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:18,000
Your kid's costume is really radical.

1015
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,520
I bet he's crazy about...

1016
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,360
It.

1017
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,100
Yeah.

1018
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,860
I'm very attached to it.

1019
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,700
You're your dad.

1020
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,400
Sort of in his own space.

1021
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,240
What do you think he'd like to eat?

1022
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,620
I no longer need humans.

1023
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:32,320
I'm not going to eat human food.

1024
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,420
I know it's a drag, but you're going to have to order some food if you want to sit here.

1025
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,780
So, how about the specials on the menu?

1026
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:49,320
You are about to witness the end of the old world and the birth of the new.

1027
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:50,680
Hey!

1028
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,520
Thank you, Bob.

1029
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,160
For cleansing my memory.

1030
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:01,880
Thank you, Bob.

1031
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:01,880


1032
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:01,880


1033
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:01,880


1034
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:01,880


1035
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:01,880


1036
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:01,880


1037
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:01,880


1038
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:01,880


1039
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:01,880


1040
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:01,880


1041
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,000
Thank you, Bob.

1042
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,380
For helping me see.

1043
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,020
And, Bob.

1044
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,100
I'll follow you always.

1045
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,000
That's right, Bob.

1046
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,260
Until that next day.

1047
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,820
Thank you, Bob.

1048
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,680
For sending them pills.

1049
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:31,880
Thank you, Bob.

1050
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:31,880


1051
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:31,880


1052
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:31,880


1053
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:31,880


1054
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:31,880


1055
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,900
Thank you, Bob.

1056
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,800
For finding me willing.

1057
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,320
Teenage girls.

1058
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,000
And, Bob.

1059
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,220
I'll follow you always.

1060
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,060
That's right, Bob.

1061
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,200
Until that next day.

1062
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,420
Until that next day.

1063
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,800
Until that next day.

1064
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,660
Until that next day.

1065
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,620
Until that next day.

1066
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,200
Until that next day.

1067
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:01,860
Until that next day.

1068
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,060
Until that next day.

1069
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,260
Until that next day.

1070
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,660
Until that next day.

1071
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,640
Until that next day.

1072
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,420
Until that next day.

1073
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,120
And then, you build.

1074
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:29,620
And then, you build.

1075
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:29,800
Until that next day.

1076
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:29,800


1077
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,000
Until that next day.

1078
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,440
Until that next day.

1079
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:35,380
dead. I said, he can't be dead. They're saying he's alive. She said, yes, they are. And she

1080
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:39,300
started crying over the other end of the phone, said, now, Daddy, you know you and Brother

1081
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:43,840
Allen is the only one that's going every night and every night. You're going to have to take

1082
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:49,380
it easy. Daddy, are you feeling all right? Are you well? Is anything wrong with you?

1083
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,720
I said, honey, I never felt so good in all my life. But I said to her, I said, I'll call

1084
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,280
Miracle Valley and definitely see if Brother Allen is dead. And I went, I'll let you know,

1085
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,980
honey. And so I called. And sure enough, they said, Brother Spencer, Brother Allen died

1086
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:09,220
last night. And when I hung that phone up after I called Miracle Valley, God definitely

1087
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:15,560
spoke to me right out of heaven. He said, I am now one of the dark overlords of the

1088
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:23,140
universe. Dark overlord of the universe. That must be quite a responsibility tonight. It

1089
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:27,560
is, friends. It is tough. And I'm going to need.
