1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,980
You can't stand no peace?

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:01,500
Oh!

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,320
Put those icons back!

4
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,740
Oh, there ain't no slack nowhere!

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,220
No slack!

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,400
Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob!

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,880
I'm a fear.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,380
Bob! Bob!

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,180
The dead man! The dead man shall speak!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Are you experienced?

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,240
Yes.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,100
Are you experienced with God?

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,820
Yes.

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,300
The apocalypse starts now.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:52,480
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,900
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,980
The Subgenius.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,620
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

19
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,000
is specially designed only to be played on radio station

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,440
and only in the city of...

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:29,560
Uh, yes, dear friends, and we're continuing this evening with the footage from the X-Day...

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:29,760
Welcome to your...

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,260
Drill.

24
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,860
The amazing X-Day drill in, uh, Sherman, New York,

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,300
which we will hold every year from now till X-Day.

26
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,220
Well, that's only a couple more of them, but, uh, you weren't there and you missed it,

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,220
and, uh, maybe you'll be there next time, and...

28
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,760
And here's the footage, uh, yes.

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,620
Wow!

30
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,440
Whoa!

31
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,340
Slack!

32
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,600
Bob!

33
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,060
Hey!

34
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,340
Bob!

35
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:54,880
Pray!

36
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:56,900
Bob!

37
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,520
The apocalypse is going on.

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,780
Right now, all around you, everywhere you look, everywhere you see,

39
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:13,960
it's the constant, slow, steady degradation of mankind, of human society as we see it.

40
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,900
The breakdown of the family, the breakdown of the psyche,

41
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,000
the breakdown of individual responsibility is going on all around you,

42
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,600
and there's nothing you can do to stop it.

43
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,620
And that, my friends, is, in fact, the constant and present apocalypse.

44
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,680
I'm not part of it.

45
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,660
I'm not even necessarily promoting it or endorsing it.

46
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,820
I'm just here to entertain throughout.

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,360
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Andrew the Impale to the Zurich and Spockalypse Sideshow.

48
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,100
I thank you for your closeness.

49
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,820
I thank you for your patience.

50
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,820
And you're all sick bastards!

51
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:46,820
Woo!

52
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,960
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

53
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,300
Woo!

54
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:52,780
Woo!

55
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,500
In the meantime, we have a special Alien O.D. show.

56
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,500


57
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,500


58
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,380
We have an update from some subgenius that traveled a long way to give you this Alien update.

59
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,500
Here they are.

60
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,280
Attention.

61
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,420
We have an update on the Alien status.

62
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,760
I'm the sixth Avatar of your Revenants.

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,480
Me and Tahooti are members of a heretofore secret organization,

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,660
a secret arm of Bob's Secret Service.

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,160
Woo!

66
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:35,280
And we have just received special orders that were signed by Bob prior to his extermination,

67
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,580
authorizing us to inform you of our existence

68
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,180
and to also give you information that will help you survive the upcoming X-Day.

69
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:45,920
Warning!

70
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,080
Warning!

71
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,240
The first thing I'd like to tell you is beware.

72
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,160
We have been informed through our intelligence agents.

73
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,340
That there are more than one type of Alien going to be here.

74
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,660
As we have revealed to us in the book Revelation X,

75
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,020
we know that there are more than one type of Alien intervening here on Earth,

76
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,320
trying to get fraught, trying to suck up the life energy of a human being.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,120
We want to let you know that there is a way, our intelligence agents do tell us,

78
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,140
to be able to identify which Aliens you should travel toward or follow in the last days.

79
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,140


80
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:39,120
We have found through much experimentation that the Alien mindset works in a collective consciousness.

81
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,620
We have also found, as we all know, the subgenius has individuality

82
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,060
and works with rational self-interest.

83
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,820
Therefore, we have to be able to determine what the difference between the collective consciousness

84
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,160
and individuality is.

85
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:06,100
A lot of us look around and we see, you see on our armbands, the gray Alien, the Alien grays.

86
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:13,740
We have found out that the grays themselves, they are not human.

87
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,760
We know that.

88
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,400
They do not operate as we know entities to operate.

89
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,240
The grays are biological robots.

90
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,340
They work.

91
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:31,220
Through a connection telepathically with the collective consciousness computer.

92
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,040
This is the same computer that the Phobos probe was destroyed by.

93
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,320
The Phobos probe, I don't know how many of you know about this,

94
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,480
this has been something that the conspiracy has definitely covered up.

95
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,760
The Phobos probe has identified that this is the source of the grays' intelligence.

96
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,720
They have been storing things in the database there.

97
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,440
They have been abducting people and doing all their little work from there.

98
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:11,020
But we found that the exes themselves use these same entities, the same grays, to do their work.

99
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,740
So how can we tell the difference?

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,300
Well, we have been informed, like I said before, intelligence takes how informed it does.

101
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,720
Look for the grays that have the smile on their face.

102
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,340
That is the answer.

103
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,220
And with that, I turn the time over to Tahuti.

104
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:43,080
You know, we live in a time when we are going to be faced with making some hard choices.

105
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:52,340
We live in a time when the conspiracy will do its best to limit the choices that we have.

106
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:00,660
But today I'm here to tell you that I'm glad to be affiliated with Bob and Slack.

107
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,000
If you have no Slack, you have no life.

108
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,840
If you have no Slack, you have no reality.

109
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:22,080
As the aliens approach our planet, as the planetoid hell-bob approaches our planet,

110
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,980
we are going to be faced with some choices.

111
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,780
And I will leave you with that.

112
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,860
It's been a pleasure being around those who espouse Slack.

113
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,540
We have it.

114
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,100
Coming out this year is what the aliens want.

115
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,340
And so is this last year, Bob.

116
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:05,500
Thank you.

117
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sorry you had to wait there.

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,240
Sorry, green.

119
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,940
Oh, okay.

120
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,820
There's a connection.

121
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,800
When ask how long it's been since I saw the translation of this show,

122
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,340
I can't remember.

123
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,320
We are so excited.

124
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,740
I can't help about the shape the world's in

125
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,360
You're just trying to ruin it, I'm just trying to sin

126
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,280
But don't ask me to come save you

127
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,500
I might do some things you don't want me to

128
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,480
No, and I talked to Bobby, and he said,

129
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,920
You know, he just grins, ain't no use fighting it, cause he always wins

130
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,240
Ain't nothing that he can't do, if you won't do it yourself, he won't do it for you

131
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,200
Thank you.

132
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,040
Now, psychologists tell us, or at least they theorize,

133
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,320
that the reason most people loathe even the discussion of death

134
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,060
is that they are afraid of the pain that is associated with death.

135
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,780
That is to say, they're not really afraid of death per se.

136
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,520
They are afraid of the pain that they will experience while dying.

137
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,460
Well, friends, I'm here to tell you,

138
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,580
that that is a load of horse hockey.

139
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,900
The pain that you will experience dying

140
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:21,740
will be nothing compared to the pain that most of us will experience after death.

141
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,780
We're going to discuss that pain right here, right now, in great detail,

142
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,800
because the title of tonight's sermon is

143
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,780
Paying Your Dues to Dogs.

144
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,360
Now, I'd like to ask you,

145
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,020
how many of you out there right now know

146
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,660
that when you die, you're not going straight to hell?

147
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,520
Let's have a show of hands.

148
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,800
Now, if you feel that way, why so?

149
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,900
Is it because you sent in your $30 love offering?

150
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,520
Yeah!

151
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,560
Is it because you read all the subgenius books?

152
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,220
Yeah!

153
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,300
Is it because you're good buddies with one of Bob's sacred preachers?

154
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:02,760
Yeah!

155
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,820
Well, all these reasons don't mean nothing come Judgment Day.

156
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,720
Because Bob does not measure your importance

157
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,600
in how much money you spend on his merchandise,

158
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,060
or how much you read his books,

159
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,740
or how much suck you have with his spending buddies.

160
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,360
No, sir! No, sir!

161
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,140
Bob measures your worth in one way and one way only.

162
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,520
He asks, have you held his ministry?

163
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,960
In other words, have you paid your dues?

164
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,960
Now, you see, the majority of people,

165
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,360
pinks, normals, pseudo subgenius,

166
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,560
are all destined to hell.

167
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,520
That's just a plain, simple fact Bob foretold in his scriptures.

168
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,140
There's only so much space on those pleasure saucers come next day.

169
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,100
And the rest are all going to be left screaming.

170
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,320
Bob could have bought more pleasure saucers,

171
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,080
but what's the point?

172
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,940
He already knows the exact amount.

173
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,540
He knows the exact number of true subgenies.

174
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,160
And quite frankly, he doesn't want to waste the air or fuel on them.

175
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,120
The deadbeat bobbies and pseudo subgenies

176
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,540
are wannabe warriors for Wotan.

177
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,420
If you're trying to establish a utopian society,

178
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,460
the last thing you want to do is import problem people to the promised world.

179
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,020
Solution?

180
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,740
Leave them to fry in hell.

181
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,800
Now, some folks might think that's a little severe.

182
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,320
But look at the big picture.

183
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,460
Bob is a pioneer.

184
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,480
He's establishing a new frontier.

185
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,940
He can't afford the luxury of pity.

186
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,800
All excess baggage must be jettisoned.

187
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,580
It's as simple as that.

188
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,420
A simple fact.

189
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,940
You either gotta live with it or die.

190
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,720
So now I ask you again.

191
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,860
How many of you feel secure that you're not gonna go straight to hell when you die?

192
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,060
Uh, a little bit more. Hell yeah.

193
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,200
Is it fair, you might rightly ask,

194
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,860
that Bob saves only those who benefit his ministry?

195
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,760
I, for one, say yes.

196
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,000
Bob is up there in the heavens right now preparing us a utopian world.

197
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,480
While most of us sit around and do nothing but

198
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,100
let the little pimples on our butts grow and act sanctimonious.

199
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,140
So many subgenies expect to be pampered.

200
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,580
They want Bob to entertain them.

201
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
They want Bob to validate them.

202
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,460
They want Bob to save them.

203
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,080
But when Bob says save someone else, they say,

204
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,820
leave it to the preachers.

205
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,920
No, sir!

206
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,680
Bob wants you to save your neighbor!

207
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,340
Bob wants you to save your neighborhood!

208
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,440
Bob wants you to save your state!

209
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,580
Bob wants you to save your country!

210
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,520
Bob wants you to save the whole damn world!

211
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,300
It's not like he's asking you to try something he didn't!

212
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,960
Yes! Yes, it is hard.

213
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,460
But Bob isn't exactly on vacation either, friends.

214
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,460
I mean, you want rest?

215
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,280
You can rest July 5th, 1998.

216
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,400
You want reward?

217
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,740
He'll give you eternal life on a utopian world.

218
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,600
You, what's that?

219
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,980
You want more?

220
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,760
Well, how about a waiver from the fires of hell?

221
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,860
Fifty years ago, friends,

222
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,080
atom bombs incinerated over a hundred thousand people in less than a millisecond.

223
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,340
Most of their remains were nothing more than shadows burned into stone.

224
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,260
The unlucky living suffered unimaginable pain.

225
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,660
They refused food.

226
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,260
They refused water.

227
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:53,680
They wanted nothing but scissors to cut the hanging flaps off their raw, flustered bodies.

228
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,460
We've seen the pictures.

229
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,060
We've heard the testimony.

230
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,000
We know such pain as possible, and yet,

231
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,080
that pain is nothing.

232
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,260
Nothing!

233
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,960
Compared to the horrors of hell.

234
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,460
Because those Japanese, my friends,

235
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,780
had something that hell's inhabitants never had.

236
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,580
It's called hope.

237
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,360
The hope of death.

238
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,840
An end to their suffering.

239
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,820
There ain't none of that in hell, my friends.

240
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,180
The pain just keeps going on and on, day after day, year after year,

241
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,900
century after century, millennium after millennium,

242
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,220
with no relief in sight.

243
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,900
Sounds like a verse of a poem.

244
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,500
Kinda funny, ain't it?

245
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,420
You get eternal life either way.

246
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,780
You get eternal bliss,

247
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,440
or eternal torment.

248
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,480
Either way, it'll last forever.

249
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,220
But you alone must choose.

250
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,760
Not just with your words, my friends,

251
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,920
but with your deeds.

252
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,120
Will you serve Bob?

253
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,760
Or will you sit around and wait for Bob to serve you?

254
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,820
No one said it would be easy, my friends.

255
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,760
I didn't say it would be easy.

256
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,160
Stang didn't say it would be easy.

257
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Bob Dodds didn't say it would be easy.

258
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,520
What we said is that it would be worth it.

259
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,520
If you doubt us,

260
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,220
go over there and start one of those little fires.

261
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,520
Get yourself a little skillet,

262
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,900
a little butter, and some salt.

263
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,740
There, maybe a little bit of salt.

264
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,720
Stir it up, get nice and hot.

265
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,760
Take your hand, roll up your sleeve,

266
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,620
don't wanna burn those sleeves.

267
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,500
Send it in the skillet,

268
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,480
and burn it to the bone!

269
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,600
Then imagine that pain all over your body

270
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,440
for millions and millions of years.

271
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,020
That is the alternative to Bob!

272
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,840
If you want it,

273
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,700
it's easy, my friends.

274
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,960
Just keep on going the way you are now,

275
00:16:59,920 --> 00:16:59,920


276
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,280
It's so simple.

277
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,560
But don't say, whatever you do,

278
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,160
don't say you weren't warned.

279
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,700
Because I warned you.

280
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,000
And I warned you.

281
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,940
And I warned you, and you, and you too.

282
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,280
I warned you all because I devoted my life

283
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,380
to singing and screaming

284
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,540
and warning the word of Bob.

285
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,260
Because I know where I wanna go.

286
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,960
And if you wanna join me,

287
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,660
you better get on out there in that street corner

288
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,000
and start praising Bob

289
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,900
like your very life depends on it.

290
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Because guess what?

291
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,740
It does.

292
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,520
Yeah!

293
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:28,840
Yeah!

294
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,420
Yeah!

295
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,280
Some folks, they'll mock us,

296
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,380
and they'll laugh.

297
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,200
But don't you worry.

298
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,960
Come July 5th, 1998,

299
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,500
they'll no longer be laughing.

300
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,360
They'll be begging.

301
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,960
Screaming for another chance!

302
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,360
A chance they were given,

303
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,620
but chose to ignore.

304
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,420
Here is the word of all praise for Bob!

305
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:53,660
Amen!

306
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,460
Bob!

307
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,020
Bob!

308
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,440
Bob!

309
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,280
Bob!

310
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,840
Bob!

311
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,920
Bob!

312
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,220
Bob!

313
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,560
Bob!

314
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,520
Wasn't that a Rock and Roll NHL song?

315
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:03,660
I was like,

316
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:04,380


317
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:04,460
It's from 킥

318
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:25,540
Where the hell is this?

319
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,280
Oh yeah!

320
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,500
Fuck!

321
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,840
This is what I want.

322
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,700
So if St. Andrew the Impaled doesn't show up, maybe I can do a little bit of it too.

323
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,000
We've got the cross.

324
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,960
We've got the cross. We're set up.

325
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,760
I'd like to start out with a couple quotes here.

326
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,080
First one is from our very own Reverend Adam Stank.

327
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,060
You know, hate is really what most religions are all about.

328
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,940
We're the only church that will come right out and admit it.

329
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,200
Emo Phillips from my home state of Illinois said,

330
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,660
Why hate anyone because of their race, religion, color, or creed,

331
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,100
when there are so many real reasons to hate people?

332
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,660
You can hate them because they're drumming until 4 o'clock in the morning,

333
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,360
or you can hate them because they're traveling 30 miles per hour down the speedway

334
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,180
when you're trying to go 75 thinking,

335
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,560
I'm gonna be late for Doc Stock, I'm gonna be late for Doc Stock.

336
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,460
Yeah, I don't know what they know.

337
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,220
But those are two quotes to chew, swallow, digest, and excrete, my friends.

338
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,920
What more can be said?

339
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,500
I've just about had it with these humans hating each other for superficial reasons.

340
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,380
I'm tired of their egocentric views where people only wish to one-up each other,

341
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:48,600
boosting their little human egos by stepping on as many others as they can.

342
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,820
I'm sick and tired of hearing about childish bickering,

343
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,040
adolescent bullying,

344
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,820
adolescent whining,

345
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,120
and immature crying from those who demand respect and reverence

346
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,080
because they have a piece of paper saying that their mind is still okay.

347
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,600
I'm tired of it.

348
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,500
I won't even give them the time of day, children.

349
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,260
I will.

350
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,920
In this age, on the verge of this new global awareness,

351
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,940
this rainbow-gathering piece of life is a bolt of cherries.

352
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Hippie love.

353
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,280
We should be ascertaining new levels of hatred,

354
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,460
new pace of dislike for these people.

355
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,600
I proclaim myself to be one of these new breed of haters.

356
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,940
And I'm damn proud of it.

357
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,180
I can even be considered to be politically correct by modern day standards.

358
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:48,440
You see, I'm cultivating a global hatred to go right along with this global community that the normals want to set up.

359
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,120
I hate everybody equally.

360
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,800
That sounds like equality, doesn't it?

361
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:04,620
I hate each and every person with the same passion as I would bestow love and respect upon any of my current deities, including Bob.

362
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,280
I am a human racist.

363
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,880
I hate the human race.

364
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,100
Part, parcel, no.

365
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,280
I hate specific people, groups of people, cliques of people, masses of people, nations of people,

366
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:18,420
countries of people, nations of people,

367
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,360
continents of people.

368
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,400
I don't need any other reason for my prejudice other than that they are all part of the human race.

369
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,640
I'm sick of them.

370
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,580
I tell them to go back to where they came from, but that wouldn't do that much, would it?

371
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,160
I'm definitely a minority disbander.

372
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,820
Because I'm not of their race.

373
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,620
I am of the subgenius race.

374
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,480
And therefore, better.

375
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,320
But why be limited to humans, okay?

376
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,620
Why be species specific?

377
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,800
In order to continue the evolution of this hatred, I must willfully and completely devote myself to hating even more.

378
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:01,460
I must hate every form of life on this planet, from this grass which I'm slipping on when I'm trying to find my way back to my tent,

379
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:07,680
to the mosquitoes which suck my blood like vampire aliens from the planet X.

380
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,380
Or Y, or Z, or any other planet.

381
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,620
I hate vegetation, animals, bacteria, and virite.

382
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,360
Everything from the common cold to the giant whale.

383
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,840
From the lowest algae to the mighty oak tree.

384
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,920
Everything that consumes anything at all.

385
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,580
I hate.

386
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,320
Now I hate everything living on the planet.

387
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,680
Why be limited by that?

388
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,240
I should be hating rocks, the ones that I trip over on my way back to the tent.

389
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,260
I should be hating the tree that I accidentally run into.

390
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:42,560
I should be hating the car that the old oldie going 30 miles per hour down the road is.

391
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,040
I hate everything on this stupid little pit stop of a planet.

392
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,040
And that's the reason why, that's the reason why I'm happy.

393
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:59,280
Because I'm rejoicing that there's only two more years, children.

394
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,820
Two more years.

395
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,760
Two more years.

396
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,780
Two more years.

397
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,800
Until the aliens come down and rescue me.

398
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:16,880
They save me by the grace of God and with money.

399
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,660
Two more years.

400
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,660
Two more years.

401
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,580
Praise God.

402
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,200
By the smoke of this dollar bill.

403
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,140
Praise God.

404
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,880
I can find my lighter amongst all the condoms which have been given to me.

405
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,020
Piss off.

406
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,520
Praise condoms.

407
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,480
Praise condoms.

408
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,120
Anybody else?

409
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,560
Thank you.

410
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,780
They're gonna kill us all.

411
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,520
Burn that bill.

412
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,580
By the smoke of this dollar bill, I hereby cleanse the planet.

413
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,500
Smoke that bill.

414
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,260
Ready.

415
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,480
Burn baby, burn baby, burn baby, burn.

416
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,020
Praise God, children.

417
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,660
Praise God.

418
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,220
So long as smoke comes up from the millions and millions of dollars being sent to the church.

419
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,960
Don't you know that's what your $30 are going for?

420
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,440
Stangs burning them, aren't you?

421
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,320
All of them.

422
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,480
As long as that smoke rises up to the heavens, we know that we are still saved.

423
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,420
And in the meantime, keep hating, children.

424
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,780
Keep hating.

425
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,640
Keep up the hate.

426
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:17,800
Keep the peace.

427
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,260
Do it.

428
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,400
Go on.

429
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,920
Keep your light on.

430
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,360
That's fun.

431
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:23,360


432
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,060
I guess old St. Andrew might just hi make a preacher, after all.

433
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,800
hears the great film The Human.

434
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,460
St. And just came across.

435
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,140
There you go, brought the

436
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,280
house.

437
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,620
Hey Mike Doll.

438
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,680
Hey Develop.

439
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,800
Thank you.

440
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,300
There's a man with a pipe over there

441
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,880
Telling me I got to beware

442
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,580
It's time to stop the calm, give it back

443
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,860
Every subgenius must have slack

444
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,160
The final plan's being made

445
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,320
Jehovah One has got to be paid

446
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,220
July 5

447
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,460
1998

448
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,360
Sauce is coming

449
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,220
And you can bet they won't be late

450
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,860
We got to stop the calm, give it back

451
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,000
Every subgenius must have slack

452
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,480
How can I ever get

453
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,680
Any slack

454
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,840
When the calm still zips

455
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,880
Well to hell

456
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,820
With them

457
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,160
And they

458
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,380
Get jobs

459
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,800
I'm signing up

460
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,500
With Jehovah's

461
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,260
We got to stop the calm, give it back

462
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,200
Every subgenius must have slack

463
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,020
There might be one other way

464
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,660
If only Dobbs

465
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,460
Can manage to pay

466
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,320
He can smash

467
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,320
The conspiracy

468
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:40,740
See

469
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,100
There's

470
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,180
a man результат

471
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,060
Not muslim

472
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,080
Oh

473
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,720
This is my

474
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,080
My

475
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,460
Yes

476
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,420
This is my

477
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,040
My

478
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,600
Come on here

479
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,580
Yes, dear friends, and we've been listening to recordings from the X-Day Drill, 1996.

480
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,520
What have we heard? Jehovah Hates Fred, Andrew the Impaled,

481
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:36,380
the Luciferian Liberation Front there, Avatar and Tehuti ranting,

482
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:42,220
an incredible Papa Joe Mama rant paying your dues to Dobbs,

483
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,760
an unbelievable St. Andrew rant about hate,

484
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:54,760
and of course, friends, the good Dr. Dinosaur accompanied by Steve Slack whipping out the hits,

485
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,840
and now the Swingin' Love Corps is live.

506

Mr. Iridium, since I saw you asking Cleveland to try and pick up on your name, Iridium, the name of the asteroid that destroyed the dinosaurs, this one will destroy back!

507
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:14,380
Damn!

508
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:28,520
Look up in the sky! Two years from now, there will be lights. Not these little lights above us on the roof. No! Large lights! And they will come down and they will burn the pinks!

509
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:33,320
I hear a burn! Burn!

510
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,360
The absence will be here too.

511
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,420
Formicato!

512
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:45,860
Smells like fish. Tastes like chicken. Squeals like a pig.

513
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,040
Must be a normal.

514
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,620
Where is this?

515
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:58,500
In a few months, the humans will choose a new leader upon whom to tie the bell of leadership so they can follow him around the world.

516
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:58,500


517
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,020
We're going to run in a circle.

518
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,120
Brothers and sisters, I'm here to tell you something. We're doing something different this election.

519
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,480
We're electing the sub-president of the United States!

520
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,920
Not one! Not a handful!

521
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:21,360
I want every single one of you to be sub-president!

522
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,100
We're going to run this vote the American way!

523
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,380
Hail to the Chief!

524
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,500
One vote! One vote!

525
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:28,940
One dollar!

526
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:38,040
Everybody that wants to be elected, whether they want it or not, one dollar, one vote.

527
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,400
You have a vote, come this November when the pinks pick one, you're it.

528
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,740
And you know what happens? They get one.

529
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,080
We get thousands!

530
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,820
We'll outnumber them! We'll have presidents sitting in the backyard.

531
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,520
We'll have presidents drinking beer. We'll have one in the White House.

532
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,940
And we'll have thousands up and down the street.

533
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,140
They won't be able to keep track of us.

534
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,500
Free Los Angeles!

535
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,540
They'll try to kill all of us. They've killed me twice so far this month!

536
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,180
Yes!

537
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,260
There'll be more to come for this, kids.

538
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,040
And I'm looking forward to sharing a lot more of it with you.

539
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,580
I'm so damn happy to see y'all here!

540
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:30,960
I want y'all to know, I love ya! Bob loves ya!

541
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:34,460
And The Conspiracy wants to love ya to death!

542
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,340
Praise Bob!

543
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,260
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

544
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,760
Praise Dr. Dinosaur! Praise a doctor like you!

545
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,920
Praise셨hegiller!

546
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:04,300
Praise Steve Slack! Praise Susan DeFluzie! Praise Pastor Craig! Praise the poor crazy woman!

547
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,680
It's about time we're sick of hearing about Bob. Let's see somebody bleed. We don't want to hear about Bob.

548
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,260
Oh, my brothers and my sisters and my in-betweeners and my album owners and all parts north, south, east and west.

549
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:27,000
And I sense a lot of slack in the room tonight. Oh, and that's a good thing because friends, it is hard to get slack today.

550
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:35,700
It is hard to keep your faith today. It is hard to be an abnormal. Because the con tries to bring it out, the pigs try to bring it out, and life tries to bring it down.

551
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:44,560
And it can be hard when we're all going up against you. But friends, we have a secret weapon. We have a secret power. A special power. We have the subgenius ego.

552
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,240
And like no pink ego can, it enables us to be the subgenius ego.

553
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:49,240


554
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:55,800
It enables us to completely take over our surroundings, to dominate our environment, and to collapse the will of the pink around us.

555
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:03,780
When you walk into one of these pink or stylish paints and you unlock the mental barriers around your ego, it whips forth, finally filling the room.

556
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:11,820
Not unlike Roseanne Barr taking off her bra. The pink egos around you are sublimated into it. Their little tiny egos get sucked in.

557
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,860
Oh, our pink egos. Oh, yeah, they think they're so good. They have that entire, they have that ego built up, crushing on the people.

558
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:25,680
That little tiny thing. But the subgenius ego knows that it is better. We know that we're superior and we're where our ego comes up against their ego.

559
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:31,140
It is not a contest. This contest was won before it was even started. It sucks it in and uses it as fuel.

560
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,420
And at that point, you dominate that mall. You rule that restaurant. You have taken over that entire state.

561
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:47,200
At that point, you realize that you do not need anything else. You realize that you have the power of slack. The power of the Yeti. The power of the agents.

562
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,660
The power of Atlantis. The power of your ego. The power of your soul. The power of yourself, friends.

563
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,760
And you don't need anything else. You become your own short duration personal savior.

564
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:01,020
Trying slack off of yourself. Realizing that you are fueling your own self. And as you do that, you grow in power.

565
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:07,500
And as you grow in power, your savior grows in power. And that encourages you to grow in power. Causing your recursive loop. Causes the slack to build up.

566
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:16,240
Infinitely. Recursively. There is the clothes behind you. Setting you shooting far. In a massive wave of slack. Overrolling. Steam rolling. They were the pinks.

567
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:23,280
Like they were absolutely nothing. At that point, you realize, truly, that you are the bullet. And Bob is the gun.

568
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,260
And nothing you say or do is going to change that. So friends, it's up to you to decide what kind of bullet you're going to be.

569
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,600
Are you going to be a little tiny soft boar pea-shooter ammo for Bob?

570
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:43,660
Or are you going to suck yourself up to be a magnum jacketed, shape-charged warhead, teflon coated, cop-killing, smart-laced, bullet-fur Bob?

571
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,140
I'm a little nervous as you might tell. I'm a bit of an introvert.

572
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:05,040
What do you want? Don't you want the rebel gods to watch as your face slams into the side of the con, exploding with it while the others tingle all around it?

573
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,860
Don't you want to be cheered on throughout the universe? Don't you realize that there is not even anything you have to do?

574
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:16,140
You don't even have to be aggressive. You have to try. You are not the one pulling the bullet. You are pulling the trigger. You aren't even aiming the gun.

575
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:21,480
You're just a bullet. All you have to do is shake yourself up to the best goddamn bullet you can be.

576
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,300
And there is that. Pardon me.

577
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:34,900
You know how you surround yourself. Let your slack ooze out of you. Let it come up as a stench covering you until you can't walk down the street without all the pigs turning their heads because there's that, that, that.

578
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:42,560
What is it? I don't know what it's wrong about. I don't know. I can't tell. It's just something. It's slack, my friends. Surrounding you like a thick visor on a magnum jacket.

579
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,580
Pump up your caliber.

580
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,360
Increase your powder. Focus your hate.

581
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,580
Hate the con for what it is. Hate the pigs for what they are. Hate Bob for treating you like a shitwad.

582
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,660
Hate your parents for the bacon you the pathetic fuck you have been, are now, or will be.

583
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,980
And then hate me for putting you in your place. And then hate yourself for not hating enough.

584
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:10,240
When you slam a little hate down on the world, you can rise above it long enough to take that final shot right down the middle and shoot to kill.

585
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,120
Don't let them stop you. Surround yourself with a tough line plan.

586
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,000
Make yourself separate. Relax in the safety of your own delusions.

587
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,940
Die face first into that wall. Pull it over your eyes and realize that you are truly better than them.

588
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,900
You are superior. Your kind will prevail.

589
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,840
It's all a joke. Yeah, who's supplying the punchline?

590
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,640
They're gonna find out in two years as they can't stop you while you slam directly through.

591
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:40,240
What kind of bullet are you gonna be? You need to hone your slack. Focus your hate. Pull that wall.

592
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,500
Don't just become high caliber. Become Excalibur!

593
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,260
Yeah!

594
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:52,320
Watch as the rebel guys watch as all the others are bouncing off as you fly through their ducts and decimate the headquarters.

595
00:38:52,940 --> 00:39:01,680
Friends, the hammer is cocked. The chamber is loaded. The finger is tensing. It is your move.

596
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,860
BK!

597
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,260
Move...it silk!

598
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,520
Yes chamber! Come in!

599
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,860
When the beasts are boomin'!

600
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,760
That's what I wanted with Sausage. Those alien Nampo orgies.

601
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
That's what brought me here.

602
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,060
Actually, we got a really special treat.

603
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,920
A couple of our favorite subgenius honey babes

604
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,940
come up and do a special demonstration for us.

605
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,500
Suzie the Fruzie and Cheshire.

606
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,800
Here they are.

607
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,800
Take it away.

608
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,200
We all know that color is going to be a drag,

609
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,400
but all you need to know is how to put one on with your mouth.

610
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,220
Now that's entertainment.

611
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,480
And educational too.

612
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,940
We take this ring as a symbol of the holy estate of marriage

613
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,780
and of the shackles, the veritable handcuffs of wedlock,

614
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,580
as well as of the pole going deep into the hole repeatedly.

615
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,540
Now, install the rings. Good. That's good.

616
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,760
Now, by the authority invested in me by J.R. Bob Dobson

617
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,900
in defiance, defiance of the laws of state, nature, and God itself,

618
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,760
I now pronounce you man, wife, and thing, and whatever it is,

619
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,440
for the next 12 hours, you must now kiss each other.

620
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,980
And, uh, okay. That's real romantic.

621
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,460
That's just beautiful.

622
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:31,240
You are now duly authorized and excused for sexual couplings

623
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:36,860
of any, any, perverse, unspeakable kind for the period of 12 hours,

624
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,920
starting exactly now at 1 minute after 12 midnight.

625
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,680
And if you don't consummate this thing,

626
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,800
you make a sick fuckery at the sacred institution of marriage.

627
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,380
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, it is done.

628
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,800
Amen, a women and a yelly. Praise God!

629
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,140
Praise God!

630
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,240
Mercy, Kelly, take it down now.

631
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,220
Okay, we've got that over with.

632
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,240
We owe you a child!

633
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,920
We owe you a child!

634
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,020
We owe you a child!

635
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:08,540
We owe you a child!

636
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,080
We owe you a child!

637
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,900
Oh, my God.

638
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,800
There's already this unholy wedlock has already produced a child.

639
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,000
It's the shortest gestation period in the world.

640
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,020
It's a boy!

641
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:21,900
Okay, okay.

642
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,220
It's a boy!

643
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,680
It's a boy!

644
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,440
It's a sick and perverted looking boy

645
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,960
dressed in a girl's dress with evil goth makeup on.

646
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,660
I'm just kidding these days, man.

647
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,400
Praise Betsy! Praise Betsy!

648
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,680
I'm just so glad that when I was young,

649
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,680
all it, all it required was love.

650
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,840
You didn't have to get the staples in your cheek

651
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,320
or the bars through your pecker and all that stuff.

652
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:48,880
Praise God!

653
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,140
Praise God!

654
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,180
Well you thought you found your savior and you sent your thirty dollars in

655
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:18,740
But now you're stuck in Pinkville and it seems that you just can't win

656
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:27,140
Well there's nothing that the con won't pull to make you use their will

657
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:32,160
And if you try too hard you can't enjoy your sin

658
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:38,160
Don't it seem that slack just keeps getting harder to find

659
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,580
And now the con can drive you right out of your mind

660
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:45,760
Cause you lose the will to think and turn into a pig

661
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,840
You just find your slack

662
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,440
Yeah

663
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:59,700
Well you think you're lucky cause you found some yetim's nymph

664
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,300
Or something like that

665
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,820
But what the con took out they can't put back in

666
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:14,100
No matter what you do you'll have to get it all from you

667
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:19,040
You'll find out it's all for slack and you'll run out again

668
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:25,080
Don't it seem that slack just keeps getting harder to find

669
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,360
And now the con can drive you right out of your mind

670
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,400
Before you lose the will to think and turn into a pig

671
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,780
Yeah you need your slack

672
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:43,380
And if you face the con keeps taking you have to make it yourself

673
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,220
Or else he'll take it all away

674
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,120
And oh well that slack just keeps getting harder to find

675
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,660
And now the con can drive you right out of your mind

676
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,100
Before you lose the will to think and turn into a pig

677
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:04,500
Don't it seem that slack just keeps getting harder to find

678
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,700
And now the con can drive you right out of your mind

679
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:12,180
Before you lose the will to think and turn into a pig

680
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,860
You gotta get your slack

681
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,300
Okay

682
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,100
Yeah!

683
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:18,440
Yeah!

684
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,220
That was a good one!

685
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,700
My turn now!

686
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,960
Maybe I could give a little reaction to how he started

687
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,860
Okay yeah

688
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,820
You know you're so old it's kind of difficult to do anything

689
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:42,820


690
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:42,820


691
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:42,820


692
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,400
And I still show you these slacks

693
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:43,620
I've seen these on it

694
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,340
Oh it's called screw up

695
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,380
Hello, there you are!

696
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,160
that they are actually shambling,

697
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,500
the people unmentionable, unthinkable,

698
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:56,220
they,

699
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,060
you,

700
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,520
Jehovah,

701
00:45:59,600 --> 00:45:59,960
you,

702
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:00,920
and me.

703
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,000
Alien and still.

704
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,620
Still, that is very wrong.

705
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,880
Your uncle, Brian, is going to see.

706
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,320
What are you saying? What are you proposing?

707
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,760
Proposing I'm proposing that you be proud of me, your God.

708
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:10,700
Go.

709
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,360
Go.

710
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,380
Get him on stress.

711
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,260
He did drag that poor boy away.

712
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,540
The cold thing is in the mist.

713
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,040
The combination.

714
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,360
The fire is the priest.

715
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:19,500
The politics.

716
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,380
The horrors.

717
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,220
Do you doubt?

718
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,320
Then go outside.

719
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,740
Go out and say how he do.

720
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,360
Mrs. Carmody, you are going to have to stop.

721
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,280
There are children here.

722
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:26,820
They're going to be born again.

723
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,320
What chance is that?

724
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:28,960
I'll sacrifice.

725
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:30,740
Oh, right.

726
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:31,780
Shut up.

727
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:09,800
I'm going to have to go out and say,

728
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:18,680
I'm going to have to go out and say,

729
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,220
I'm going to have to go out and say,

730
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:19,460
I can't go that far.

731
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:19,460


732
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:19,960
Oh, come on, Mr.

733
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,040
Plow.

734
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,460
Little man.

735
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,860
You like trees.

736
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,840
Your eyes are covered in pollen.

737
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,500
Hey, take your seen down.

738
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,300
Come on, hey.

739
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,180
To hold a hate threat, I thought you could try.

740
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,260
To hold a hate threat ain't about pants now,

741
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,820
to hold a hate threat ain't about proving,

742
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,220
to hold a hate threat ain't about feeling,

743
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:01,340
to hold a hate threat is only about feeling.

744
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,500
To hold a hate threat is what we are,

745
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,560
there's no real way we're still going on here,

746
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,860
it's only true, and yours, and mine.

747
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,480
To hold a hate threat is only real,

748
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,540
the message comes in.

749
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,260
So play that music, you funky white boy,

750
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,400
like you mean it.

751
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,860
. . .

752
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,320
. . .

753
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:56,320


754
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:56,320


755
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:27,860
. . .

756
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:27,900
. . .

757
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:27,920
. . .

758
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:50,280
. . .

759
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,080
This will be our pink cover tune section.

760
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,560
We'll take requests, any requests from the audience?

761
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,860
Your favorite pink cover tune?

762
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,360
Purple Haze!

763
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,740
Purple Haze.

764
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,360
. . .

765
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:07,700
. . .

766
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,740
It has to be one that fits our tone.

767
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:10,840


768
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,040
Girl from Ipanema.

769
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:24,400
. . .

770
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:24,400


771
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:24,400


772
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:24,400


773
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,540
We're still under interests to hear

774
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:33,160
Let me think about it. There's got to be a song you remember for this drum beat.

775
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,260
What drum beat? Billy Jean!

776
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,020
This one.

777
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,260
Rubble, hey!

778
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,140
Oh!

779
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,080
Oh, hey!

780
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:14,100
Oh, no, no, it's going to get hard.

781
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,080
Okay, let's see.

782
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:18,780
Sweet Home Alabama!

783
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,620
Come on.

784
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,180
Mississippi Queen!

785
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,160
Okay, let's see.

786
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,940
Spoke on the water!

787
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,500
What's that a new?

788
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,260
Rocket Man!

789
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,780
No, no, no, that's not going to work.

790
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:42,320
Can you guys do William Shatner singing Rocket Man?

791
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,140
Yeah.

792
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,100
Okay, yeah.

793
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,360
Rocket Man, Rocket Man, Rocket Man

794
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,740
My favorite was Mr. Tambourine Man.

795
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,880
That was before your time, Sonny.

796
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,560
Country, take me home country road.

797
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,500
Okay, John Denver, anyone a John Denver fan out there?

798
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,460
Rocky Mountain High!

799
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,060
Rocky Mountain High!

800
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,440
Rocky Mountain High.

801
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,200
Who's next?

802
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:23,640
Me!

803
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:25,600
Me!

804
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,040
Me!

805
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:27,360
Me!

806
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:27,700
Me!

807
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:28,500
Me!

808
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:32,540
Me!

809
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,100
Me!

810
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:35,820
Me!

811
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,140
Me!

812
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:36,320
Me!

813
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:36,580
Me!

814
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:36,960
Me!

815
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:36,960


816
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:36,960


817
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,940
Dr. Gibson!

818
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,040
Hey, friends, how you doing?

819
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:44,660
Hi!

820
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,980
I'm John Smollett.

821
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:49,340
I knew you could be here to witness such an amazing spectacle of slack.

822
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,020
My God, that Dr. Gyn...

823
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:53,960
Dinosaur!

824
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,160
What the hell is he talking about?

825
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:55,800
He's up there.

826
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:00,940
He's gonna talk about Bob or give a conspiracy rant or just try to feed y'all with a little bit of slack.

827
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:07,520
Now, he's gonna stand up here and talk to you about a little thing called the prima donna project.

828
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,560
Now, this is just a spin-off sort of thing.

829
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,480
I'll try it out, you know, along here, see how it goes.

830
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:17,980
See, when I was thinking about the idea, people say there are no prima donnas left in the church.

831
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,000
Well, after what you've seen tonight, you might have a second thing coming, right?

832
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,940
I mean, come on, give it up.

833
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,720
It was great, right?

834
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,320
Yeah!

835
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:27,100
Yeah!

836
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,160
How many of you wanted to do the same?

837
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:34,620
How many of you in the small of your back and in the top of your peen plant thought,

838
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,220
hmm, I could do that.

839
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,580
That could be me.

840
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I could be a subgenius preacher.

841
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:40,720
Yeah!

842
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,820
Well, first, you'll have to become a subgenius prima donna, and we all know there are no prima donnas left.

843
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,580
You can't be a prima donna!

844
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,760
The one who came in here and was gonna give us talk about prima donnas, I thought, hmm,

845
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,100
well, what does a prima donna mean to all of you?

846
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,840
I thought, well, first I'll have to figure out what a prima donna means to me.

847
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:58,940
Barbra Streisand.

848
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:06,680
Barbra Streisand, Moe Howard, Einstein, Hendrix, Mozart, they're all prima donnas.

849
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,100
I'm not comparing myself to any of those guys.

850
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,280
I mean, there's no contest.

851
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:16,320
But what I'm saying is that these prima donnas, they seem to have that something that nobody else does.

852
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,220
Like?

853
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,180
It's more than just a schtick.

854
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,620
It's more than just a gimmick.

855
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,980
I mean, everybody uses gimmicks to get by.

856
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:27,260
But a prima donna, you know, just has something, it's something about them.

857
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,020
But it's no more than you or I or anybody else has.

858
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,000
Oh, he's, uh, he was, he said he was like...

859
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,460
But to really develop it, to really develop your prima donna ability, you know, in order to, you know,

860
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,740
as a short-term goal before you decide to become a subgenius prima donna,

861
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:49,200
before you decide to become an ass-kicking, pulpit-pounding subgenius preacher for Bob,

862
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:56,160
what you're gonna have to do is, is just, just calm down for a minute.

863
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:56,920
Alright?

864
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,080
Yeah, you're gonna have to calm down.

865
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:05,140
You're gonna have to, you're just gonna have to get down on your knees and consult your Bob land

866
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:11,800
and think to yourself, well, why do I want to be a prima donna?

867
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,040
Why do I want to be a subgenius prima donna?

868
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,900
Why do I want to be a prima donna?

869
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:16,700
For the slack?

870
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,540
I mean, is that really a good enough reason for the slack?

871
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:20,800
No!

872
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,160
Oh, there are other reasons.

873
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,420
There are other reasons.

874
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,720
If you find one, I mean, let us know.

875
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:29,840
Don't.

876
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:35,200
But, uh, you know, when you get up there, and, uh, you're gonna have to think to yourself,

877
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:39,480
well, what do I know about what it means to be a prima donna?

878
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,700
What do I know about what it means to be a subgenius?

879
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,520
And the answer's pretty simple.

880
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,520
You know something that everybody else knows, but wants to get from you.

881
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,600
See, it seems to me...

882
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,980
You know, I'm not gonna say especially this generation.

883
00:55:53,620 --> 00:56:01,700
Throughout all mankind's history, people have needed prima donnas to get up there and show

884
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,780
them what it means to truly live.

885
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:14,160
People have needed the weirdos and the mutants to stand up and explain in very simple terms

886
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,280
what it means to be alive, what it means to exist.

887
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,580
And they're not.

888
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,520
And the prima donnas are the only ones that can do that.

889
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:27,400
And the Church of the Subgenius, we're an organization that's committed to producing prima donnas.

890
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,000
So if you don't want to, you don't have to get up there and be a subgenius preacher.

891
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:36,520
If you don't want to, you can just sit back, relax, and let us tell you how to live.

892
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,940
Okay. Thanks.

893
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:49,220
Now, if you don't want to stand up for what you believe in and your value systems and for your way of living,

894
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:58,360
an easy way to get started on the path is to send $30 to P.O. Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas 75214.

895
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,060
Bob will protect you.

896
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,660
And Bob will protect you.

897
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:07,100
He'll give you the starter kit that you need to be on your way to truly expressing yourself.

898
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,560
It'll be for a good cause.

899
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,000
It'll be for the slack.

900
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,720
It'll be for the general slack.

901
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,400
And you have to get slack to give slack.

902
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,560
And when you do that, you'll lose sight of your heroes.

903
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,480
They'll kind of drop away one by one.

904
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,440
I mean, you'll get to see them from a distance.

905
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:30,440
Hendrix and Elvis and Zappa and Mozart and Pat Benatar.

906
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,600
What are you looking at me when you say Pat Benatar?

907
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,900
You'll no longer think of them as heroes.

908
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,020
You'll no longer think of them as prima donnas.

909
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:45,220
Because you'll have a complete, a thorough, an immediate understanding of what it was that they were all about.

910
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,180
And all it costs is $30, friends.

911
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,460
I get a feeling that I'm kind of preaching to the gods.

912
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,020
I'm pretty converted here.

913
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:56,580
I mean, I assume all of you do have your $30 membership cards, don't you?

914
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:02,440
I mean, if you don't have that membership card in the wild, how do you think you're going to protect yourself from the conspiracy

915
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,860
when they activate that tick of fear that they implanted in your mind at age three?

916
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,880
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

917
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:25,620
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

918

Got your pencil ready?

919
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:33,020
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

920
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:40,160
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

921
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,060

922
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:45,340
See you later!

923
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,060
See you later!

924
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,760
The words are easy.

925
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,900
A little campfire sing-along.

926
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,680
Goes like this.

927
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,280
You know the words, right?

928
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,780
B-O-B!

929
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,180
B-O-B!

930
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,700
B-O-B!

931
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:13,700
B-O-B!

932
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,540
B-O-B!

933
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,660
B-O-B!

934
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:17,020


935
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:17,160
B-O-B!

936
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:17,740


937
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:17,940
B-O-B!

938
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,820
That's it.

939
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,700
influential

940
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,800
Vin Diesel

941
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,260
Vin Diesel

942
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,660
Vin Diesel

943
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:45,900
Ah!

944
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,540
Ah!

945
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,100
X-Tase are coming!

946
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,900
And the pigs are coming!

947
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:58,780
Yeah!

948
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,420
Ah!

949
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:02,900
Ah!

950
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:14,740
Ah!

951
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:15,740


952
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,000
Ah!

953
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:17,920
Ah!

954
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:18,960
Ah!

955
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,100
Ah!

956
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,720
Things like all we ever do is eat, get stoned,

957
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,800
and watch the tube, man.
