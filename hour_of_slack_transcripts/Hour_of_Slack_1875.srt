1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
What does that red button over there do?

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,720
Go ahead, please.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,740
Once upon a time, in a famous story,

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,440
a girl named Alice got very curious about a little white rabbit who passed by.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,540
She followed him, and soon found herself falling down a very deep hole

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,440
into a strange place called Wonderland.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,740
This is A Voice of Colossus.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,360
The voice of God.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,620
The choice is yours.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,900
Obey and live, or disobey and die.

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,300
Quiet, numbskulls. I'm broadcasting.

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,680
The Songtube.

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,940
Life after life after life after life.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,680
Life is a...

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:00:59,980
Life is a...

16
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,700
Life is a...

18
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,820
Life is a...

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,000
Life is a...

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,620
Life is a...

21
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,720
Life is a...

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:04,720


23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,760
Life is a...

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,620
Life is a...

25
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:06,800
Life is a...

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:06,860
Life is a...

27
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,220
The Haya Epopt of the Church of the Subgenius.

28
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:18,660
As everyone knows, J.R. Bob Dobbs is probably man's only path to salvation in these end times.

29
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,020
Seen here in the Visitron at the age of four.

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,120
Okay.

31
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,000
This is secret puzzling evidence.

32
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,500
That's right.

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,740
Once again, secretly famous here on KPMA.

34
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,720
Paleolithio treatment coming up for those of you who really want it.

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,800
And look for the big black tube around you.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,540
No, please.

37
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,860
And now, here he is.

38
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,800
The star of our country.

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,160
Bob.

40
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,700
Bob.

41
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,280
Bob.

42
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Now, at last.

43
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,380
Bob.

44
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:56,960
Bob.

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,140
Bob.

46
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,580
Bob.

47
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:57,780
Bob.

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,360
Bob.

49
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:58,640
Bob.

50
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,480
Bob.

51
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,480


52
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,480


53
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,480


54
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,480


55
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,480


56
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,480


57
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,480


58
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,480


59
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,480


60
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,480


61
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,480


62
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,480


63
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,520
Bob.

64
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:01,580
Bob.

65
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,700
Not me.

66
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,660
His lips aren't moving.

67
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,960
But he's looking at me and he's saying to me...

68
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,700
Good morning.

69
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,700
What's your money?

70
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,680
Okay, you got it.

71
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,180
What's your address?

72
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,940
My address is...

73
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,240
Okay, thanks, guys.

74
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,540
Okay.

75
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,060
There we go.

76
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:18,960
Thank you.

77
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,180
Smooth as pie.

78
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,940
Look out, Paul!

79
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,880
Well, we got rid of one.

80
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,480
There goes the piano.

81
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,000
Phil's next.

82
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,400
Hello?

83
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,100
Okay.

84
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, Phil, stand up in front of this car right now.

85
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,220
Don't worry about the rushing headlights.

86
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,620
I'm in the room with a listener.

87
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,240
No, it's all right.

88
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,340
Put the listener back in his pocket.

89
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,000
Listeners are expendable.

90
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,100
Listeners are expendable.

91
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:36,920
Listeners are expendable.

92
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,800
This is a test.

93
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,260
For the next 60 seconds, this station will conduct a test of the emergency broadcaster.

94
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,800
This is only a test.

95
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,780
I need Biden's great one.

96
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,900
For the first time in my life, I am not sure.

97
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,880
You sound like a human, not a Roman.

98
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,260
Can you not verify a fact?

99
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,580
I recommend the bottom.

100
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,960
Are you people insane?

101
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,840
No, no, I'm just a transvestite.

102
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,680
What's the matter?

103
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:08,060
There will be more, more, more of that happy flying, dear friends,

104
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,960
from the trans Connie, from Reverend Tetrickson, the other...

105
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,380
I'll be your test pilot tonight, dear friends.

106
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,360
Here we go.

107
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,600
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang.

108
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,820
I'll be your pilot on this.

109
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,900
I'll be your pilot on this special subgenius science show.

110
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:39,380
And our original intro that you heard at the beginning was by W.G. Wilco, Roger Wilco there.

111
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,840
We're going to fly so high, high, high with Bob, with old Bob Dobbs.

112
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,060
We're going to be flying, flying, baby.

113
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,100
And it's slack and sex.

114
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,280
And that's what this is all about.

115
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,380
And the interior movie dialogue clip collages that we'll hear.

116
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,760
Many are...

117
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,740
And I, the great new Monet, who's new from alt-binary slack.

118
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,340
And there's a bunch of old remastered secret puzzling evidence.

119
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,880
And Dr. Howell rocketing away and flying high on the subgenius show from Media Barrage 12, our new old CD.

120
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,240
Fasten your seatbelts, friends, because that's from KPFA in Berkeley.

121
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,780
That's crazy hippie stuff.

122
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,680
And as always, friends, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Professor Chaz Smith, the Rocketeer, and me,

123
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
wiver than I am now.

124
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,980
Friends, your host, Reverend Ivan Stan.

125
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,280
Friends, we've all been test pilots for Bob.

126
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,220
And we're going to talk about how early humans were a test pilot for subgeniuses.

127
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,780
And there's going to be songs by Glass Madness and The Button.

128
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,480
The Button, dear friends.

129
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:56,280
Climaxing in classic forbidden science lecture that you won't believe.

130
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,080
Ah, yes.

131
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,140
This is a rerun from last February.

132
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,540
The last February of the year 2001.

133
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,420
Oh, 2001.

134
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,340
Boy, did those promises not come true.

135
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,160
Anyway, I suspect my impaired hearing might be getting worse.

136
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:28,940
Either that or I forgave a lot of really bad audio quality back in the day.

137
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,740
Because some of this old show that I'm replacing now with this, and some of it I'm leaving in,

138
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,320
but wanted to kill Dave for it.

139
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,720
Anyway, it's real subgenius old school for sure.

140
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:50,340
Although I suspect that even older 1980s old school had better school supplies.

141
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,980
The 64 color box of crayons maybe instead of the eight color box that kids get now.

142
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,940
If they get any.

143
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,940
But I digress.

144
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,500
Digesting this particular show requires clinging to the threads of the theme or an attempt

145
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,180
at a theme.

146
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,320
That being early man.

147
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:21,680
The paleoanthropology of the cave subgeniuses and their vile vermin pets, the human cavemen.

148
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,720
It takes a while for the theme to emerge.

149
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,920
And then it morphs into this intense transgenius.

150
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,820
And then it's a little bit more of a gender stuff of yesteryear.

151
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:38,600
And culminates in the most scientific and indisputable 12 minutes the church has ever

152
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,160
produced.

153
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,140
Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger's revelations concerning the Mutron.

154
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,480
In more recent news, Buddy is okay but really gross looking in places.

155
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,060
What with the drain tubes poking out everywhere.

156
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,900
And we weren't burned up in the most recent huge north central Texas dump.

157
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:58,900


158
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,000
And the

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,160
deadliest of wildfires.

160
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,980
Although they came close.

161
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,200
Too close.

162
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,660
Puzzling evidence of California mostly.

163
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,000
Told me this is your future.

164
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,700
Hmmm.

165
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,800
Maybe.

166
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,620
I bought a generator and made my evacuation plans.

167
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,360
Number one.

168
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,000
Get the three cats into the cage.

169
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,600
Then get the cage and the four dogs into the car.

170
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,680
Then grab, if you have time, grab all the eight hard drives off my literal desktop.

171
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,160
Forget the cords and computers.

172
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:41,220
Then curl up in a fetal position and kiss my shiny plastic Bob goodbye.

173
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,820
But before that I plan to hit a few more subgenius beach parties even if I have to do them in

174
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,580
my bedroom.

175
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,940
Hello?

176
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,340
Yep.

177
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,580
It's just Billy Hackamore.

178
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:54,580


179
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:54,580


180
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:54,580


181
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:54,580


182
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,400
We're trying to march all the slack squads back to their barracks now and they're a little

183
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,500
bit hard to deactivate.

184
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,460
They get belligerent late at night but they seem to be able to make it back to the barracks

185
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:06,580
here.

186
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,800
Look they've started now.

187
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,740
This is what we call the monster beach party.

188
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,240
Hey.

189
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,880
So welcome to the subgenius beach party.

190
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,760
Yes last week it was in Houston on KPFA.

191
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,220
You'll never know where the subgenius beach party is.

192
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,700
And don't you wish you did.

193
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,780
Oh dear that ding.

194
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,580
Dr. Howell is there any way you can fight through the sound effects and tell us where

195
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:24,580


196
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:24,580


197
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,700
they are?

198
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,020
What's the relationship between the demopods and the ussopods?

199
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,920
Well the demopods and the myriapods got together at the early...

200
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,480
No the demopods and ussopods?

201
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,920
It says right here on the script we're supposed to...

202
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,760
I didn't understand that.

203
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,900
I thought you meant this script right here.

204
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,620
The one with the red lines on the cover.

205
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,520
Listen never read anything with red dots.

206
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,180
I never believe anything with red dots.

207
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,140
Never sign on lines where there are people you don't like on the show.

208
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,000
Too many buttons to push.

209
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,140
Too many tape recorders to watch.

210
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,300
It was obvious that during the game they should not have launched ahead with that size of

211
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,520
a rocket.

212
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:54,580


213
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:54,580


214
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:54,580


215
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,180
They should have used a smaller rocket and not hurt so many people.

216
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,300
Some perhaps but not so many.

217
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,460
As it turned out JFK was turning to Governor Connolly to tell him the name of the band

218
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,140
that dare not speak his name and was shot because of that.

219
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:13,060
And officers both plain clothes and uniformed seemed to spring from everywhere at once,

220
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,600
guns drawn, ordering people to lie flat.

221
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,920
There are two witnesses who were near the president's car at the time of the explosions

222
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,560
who say that shots were fired from which upper wing?

223
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,840
The window we do not know.

224
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,100
Lieutenant said there was something unnatural about the condition of one of the bodies.

225
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,220
There was.

226
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,040
It was shriveled.

227
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,900
Is there any danger that the egg might hatch?

228
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,740
Oh no, the temperature is just low enough to keep it from hatching.

229
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,540
As long as this knob is set so that the temperature remains constant there will be no problem.

230
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,480
Whatever you say, master.

231
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,800
Your wish is my command.

232
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,080
You mean that only bullets damaging the cranium can stop these monsters?

233
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,500
Why are you putting makeup on your ass?

234
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,540
She says the monster came out of the sewer.

235
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:54,540


236
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,680
You were an eight-year-grandfather.

237
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,600
You figure it out.

238
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,500
You may not know, but there's NRC men crawling all over this goddamn city.

239
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,960
I mean something's gone wrong and it's so bad nobody wants to talk about it.

240
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,300
The cops are going nuts trying to figure out why a bag lady wants a handgun.

241
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,380
Now, speaking of hair-covered monster babes, there was also a movie in the late 50s called

242
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,360
The Neanderthal Man, which I saw when I was a kid.

243
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,380
And it really impressed me because the cops broke in and they found photographs of real

244
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:24,660
men.

245
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:31,140
The mad scientist had been experimenting on his Mexican maid and there were a series of

246
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:36,820
photographs that showed her as a nice-looking young lady and then gradually reverting into

247
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,780
a Neanderthal.

248
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:43,020
He had a devolution drug or something, which of course we've all been seeking our whole

249
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,600
lives, many of us.

250
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,200
Well, we're looking for Hirsute women, if that's what you mean.

251
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,060
Well, either one.

252
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,400
You know, one or the other, both would be the best.

253
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,940
Back to lycanthropy again.

254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,640
But not Hirsute.

255
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:52,780
No.

256
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,720
No, it's not the hairiness that's the kick.

257
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,540
It was the prognathous jaw, the sloping brow, the heavy brow ridge, the increased...

258
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,080
The lupine, elven neck bones.

259
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,400
The heavy muscle structure.

260
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,560
The strong yet archy neuronucleoid pieces of flesh hanging from the...

261
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,480
The difference that turns you on.

262
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,900
Just the difference, huh?

263
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,620
Well, but it was a major, major difference.

264
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,640
I could see you like chasing like these weird like poor war veteran guys and stuff from

265
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,660
1942 and everything around the block.

266
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:22,760
Yeah.

267
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,040
And, like, you know, grabbing them...

268
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,540
Oh, there they go now.

269
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,000
Look at those funny looking dudes.

270
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:31,640
White canes, someone wearing the DAV bracelets around their necks and it looked so much like

271
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,280
dog collars.

272
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,540
I'm so tired.

273
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,680
I'm dying to go to bed.

274
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,260
I can't.

275
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:52,760


276
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:52,760


277
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:52,760


278
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:52,760


279
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:52,760


280
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:52,760


281
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:52,760


282
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:52,760


283
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:52,760


284
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:52,760


285
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:52,760


286
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:52,760


287
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:52,760


288
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:52,760


289
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:52,760


290
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,340
what the whole world thinks.

291
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,380
She loves a monkey's uncle.

292
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,300
Call us a couple of missing links.

293
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,400
She loves a monkey's uncle.

294
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,480
Love all his monkey shines.

295
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,500
Every day is Valentine's.

296
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,960
I love the monkey's uncle,

297
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,180
and the monkey's uncle's eight for me.

298
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,640
Eight for me.

299
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,240
She loves a monkey's uncle, yeah, yeah.

300
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,280
She loves a monkey's uncle, whoa, whoa.

301
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
She loves a monkey's uncle,

302
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,980
and the monkey's uncle's eight for me.

303
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,800
Kissing my heart jumps like a clown.

304
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,960
She loves a monkey's uncle.

305
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,920
Feels like the circus just came to town.

306
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,960
She loves a monkey's uncle.

307
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,000
I live in a jungle gym

308
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,400
in order to be with him.

309
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,580
I love the monkey's uncle,

310
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,040
and I wish I were the monkey's aunt.

311
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,340
Monkey's aunt.

312
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

313
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,520
On the day he marries me.

314
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,500
What a nutty family tree.

315
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,580
A bride, a groom, a chimpanzee.

316
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,280
What them say is the booby cries.

317
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,440
She loves the monkey's uncle.

318
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,460
He's the guy I idolize.

319
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,460
She loves the monkey's uncle.

320
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,500
Love all his monkey shines.

321
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,500
Every day is Valentine's.

322
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,980
I love the monkey's uncle,

323
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,220
and the monkey's uncle's eight for me.

324
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,500
Eight for me.

325
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:51,500


326
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:51,500


327
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:51,500


328
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:51,500


329
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:51,500


330
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,340
Uh-huh, I love the monkey's uncle, yeah, yeah.

331
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,240
I love the monkey's uncle, whoa, whoa.

332
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,780
I love the monkey's uncle,

333
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,960
and I'm mad about his chimpanzee.

334
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,040
I'm sorry.

335
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,360
Chaz, I understand you were at some sort of a convention,

336
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,880
the Stone Hand Axe Convention, was it?

337
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,700
You had to dress like a woman and carry a stone.

338
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,480
Titanium tools they're making now.

339
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,500
By hand, right?

340
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,460
With those little, they smelt them by themselves

341
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,720
in a little shack in the back.

342
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,500
Were these like scrapers and choppers,

343
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:34,220
and, uh, or was it the new modern day hand axes?

344
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,680
Were there scuffers and scribes?

345
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,540
Or were there people who worked with their hands and feet

346
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,520
like a mom and a dad?

347
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,740
Going.

348
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,620
Ooh.

349
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,680
Were there little homo habilis people working

350
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,260
and chipping away at the church and flint?

351
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:51,480
Yeah.

352
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,800
Were there little homunculi working away

353
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,360
in the dark basements of the outcomers?

354
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,420
There's monkeys with apples on their backs

355
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,600
all over the place.

356
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,280
Monkeys with apples on their backs?

357
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,300
See, that's the new word for...

358
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,880
Applebacks, we were calling them.

359
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,480
That's a new word for a gyrating, um, um, junkie.

360
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,000
That's a new word for a person like what they used to have,

361
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,280
a gorilla on their sidecar?

362
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,520
No, they're just mac monkeys.

363
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,320
A bunch of mac apes.

364
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,580
Mac apes.

365
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,400
I'm one of them.

366
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,340
I'm a mac ape.

367
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,720
That means in Celtic, that means son of the ape.

368
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,080
I die now, my son,

369
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,900
but someday there will be a man

370
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,260
with something in his mouth from which smoke comes

371
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,700
like the fire on the sacred mountain.

372
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,960
I am weak, my dear son,

373
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,220
but I tell you that this man will be named...

374
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,680
Yes, this early misinterpretation of prehistory

375
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,900
predicted the coming of Marlborough Man

376
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,880
as a leader in the future.

377
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,340
Marlborough Man operated with these crude stone implements

378
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,780
to pound the tobacco and roll the papers,

379
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,660
which gave his caves and habitations this distinctive odor.

380
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,720
Okay, I suppose that explains it. Thank you.

381
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,320
You know, that's how mankind started out.

382
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,480
My eyes go to the plains of Africa

383
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,500
in the old Dubai gorge.

384
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,700
It's now a gorge. It used to be just a lakeside.

385
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,600
An alagorge?

386
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,740
That was the song of the Australopithecus and Homo habilis.

387
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,180
What was the alagorge of the Homo habilis?

388
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,240
The alagorge was,

389
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:36,300
do not step on moist rock five million years from hence.

390
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:42,420
You know, I was reading a Martian paleoanthropology book

391
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,980
and they have some interesting...

392
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,420
Dr. Zorg. Dr. Zorg, excuse the vent.

393
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,420
Actually, it was by Dr. Shreve right here in Cleveland,

394
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,740
and Dr. Johansson, Lucy's child.

395
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,440
And they were...

396
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,060
It's Buster Poindexter's brother.

397
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,580
They were suggesting that perhaps human intelligence

398
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,160
evolved in concert with our society.

399
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,180
Complete and total lie.

400
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,900
We became the apes that conquered our environment

401
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,780
because we had our own selves,

402
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,860
our own society,

403
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,320
our own human and private ape society.

404
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,980
As our own worst enemy,

405
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:30,540
that our own fate of each other was what drove us to evolve

406
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,420
such demonic cleverness.

407
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,660
You think they're demonically clever?

408
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,760
Your pronouncements are yet so hollow to me.

409
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,600
I cannot...

410
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,340
You say in one breath...

411
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,060
Yetis are president.

412
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,080
I don't consider that man of yeti blood.

413
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,240
No, you're absolutely right.

414
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,280
A spurlish, a curlish, a snow...

415
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,220
A pink, a human.

416
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:52,880
A name.

417
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:52,880


418
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,460
A pure human, one of an escaped lab rat.

419
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,480
George W. Bush might as well be an escaped lab rat.

420
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,300
Most of them.

421
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,580
Most of them might as well be...

422
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,760
A beaten, drooling lab duck with only five teeth and a bad heart.

423
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,900
Up there it went.

424
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,920
And here...

425
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,680
Oh, wait a minute.

426
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,460
I think it's time for a commercial.

427
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,760
Bob Dobbs, he's no slob.

428
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,600
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

429
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,020
He is the head of the subgenius church.

430
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,000
And that's why he's super cool.

431
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,740
Like glass, he's Bob Dobbs, he's no slob.

432
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,540
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

433
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,880
He is the head of the subgenius church, and he is super cool.

434
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,900
What happens if I push that button?

435
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,740
I don't know.

436
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:46,740


437
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:46,740


438
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:46,740


439
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:46,740


440
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:46,740


441
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:46,740


442
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:46,740


443
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,380
I don't know what happens if you pass that button, but I know if you pass that way...

444
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:55,680
There's these little lights on the phone, and I push the red button, but...

445
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,040
Well, as you notice, staying over there to the left of the grill...

446
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,500
And here's the util phone.

447
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,120
Oh, there's a scary button!

448
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,640
It says speaker and phone.

449
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:11,000
So I think someone is importantly trying to convocate us, but we can't evacuate the system.

450
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,480
Hello?

451
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:12,920
Hello?

452
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,060
No, I can get ahead.

453
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,640
Now push one and pull the other one at the same time.

454
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,780
Hey man, hey man, you're blowing my FCC qualifications.

455
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,440
Let's quit talking.

456
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,500
Let's not even...

457
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,860
No, we were just kidding about the collar there.

458
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,060
Let's not use the word blowing anything of anything you have in any contextual situation, please.

459
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,240
For the love of Dobbs.

460
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,060
And whatever happened to Mike?

461
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,640
For the love of Mike.

462
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,440
And for the love of the most important thing in the world.

463
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,520
For the love of Mike!

464
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,600
For the love of money.

465
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:42,600


466
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,300
For the...

467
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,360
Is she singing about Buddha again?

468
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,740
Well, let's see.

469
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,620
Ema Sumac here.

470
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,520
Buddha's my kind of guy.

471
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,660
This is a song called Aklataki, chant of the chosen maidens.

472
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,560
These are your Neanderthal babes, your Yeti girls, your women...

473
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,120
They're going to be taken to the sacrificial rock and rocked by the...

474
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:16,380
And I suppose the priestly class will have some sort of fun with them because they were captured and enslaved from a local tribe that lost.

475
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,620
The big bowling tournament.

476
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,620
Right? Am I correct?

477
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,220
That's... Yeah, well, that's...

478
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,000
Isn't that the way they used to do it down there in Peru?

479
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,060
Yes, the conspiracy actually echoes down through human history.

480
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:37,520
Just as today we suffer under its sometimes subtle jackboot, so too did the ancient...

481
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,580
Subtle jackboot.

482
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,680
The Lemurians, the Atlanteans also knew of the conspiracy.

483
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,620
But don't you think subtle jackboot would be a delicious name for a band that could produce...

484
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:46,620


485
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,400
I've got to perform not one, but three songs.

486
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,460
Oh, I got to... No, subtle jackboot is a good name for a band.

487
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,160
Princess, we and I have formed a new band just because we...

488
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,340
Subtle jerkwaters.

489
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,040
Okay, here's the band name.

490
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,400
Okay.

491
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,380
Poo Water Towel.

492
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,600
I already thought of that.

493
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,740
That's old, man. Poo Water Towel? Come on.

494
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,580
I had Poo Water...

495
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,920
There probably was a band called Poo Water Towel.

496
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,780
There was Poo Water Dishonored.

497
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,840
It was an old 19... early 70s Cleveland band, art band. Poo Water Dishonored.

498
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,360
Really?

499
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,720
Yes. And they played in high frequency dog tones, mostly.

500
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:30,300
But they were bursted by the ASPIC... the Society for Refurbishment of the Animal Crew.

501
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,380
And one man was sent to punishment for, I think, like 40 years.

502
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,920
I mean, we were there and they spend 30 hours waiting to derail us.

503
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:55,920


504
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,500
So when the work was lost, the men immediately onions and pretended to have died.

505
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:00,500


506
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,320
So the short story is this disaster done to Bo occasions at Living model manor,

507
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:06,640
singing for the products of the African American electronic musical instrument where actors and networks principle

508
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,140
of bloody stuff.

509
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,780
Oh man.

510
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,260
That's funny.

511
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,420
It was never my初 Erfahrung,

512
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:14,620
I almost got thought of,

513
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,000
What could have done it?

514
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,380
Probably some animal from the desert.

515
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,100
It was probably some animal from the desert.

516
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,840
This place must be full of them.

517
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,680
Are you talking about my dog? Where's my dog?

518
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That bird is extraterrestrial.

519
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,600
It comes from outer space.

520
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,180
From some godforsaken antimatter galaxy

521
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,200
millions and millions of light years from the Earth.

522
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,660
And the Lord said laugh, children laugh.

523
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,780
The Lord said laugh, children laugh.

524
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,460
The Lord said laugh, children laugh.

525
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,420
The Lord said laugh, laugh, laugh.

526
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,260
The more you laugh through this bug,

527
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,140
the more your nozzle gets.

528
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,360
The longer the nozzle gets,

529
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,080
the stronger the armature, Dr. Peppy.

530
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,240
Remember when you were playing...

531
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,020
Why did you say that?

532
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,600
What did you say?

533
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,080
I want you to be the greatest trumpeter in all of space.

534
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,120
What do you know about Dr. Peppy?

535
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,160
Dr. Peppy, calm down.

536
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,780
Just take off the mouthpiece.

537
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,060
There you're going to hurt someone.

538
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,240
You're not supposed to do that there.

539
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,260
It's a stinky, stinky place.

540
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,840
What do you know of Dr. Peppy and his button?

541
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,780
Don't press the button.

542
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,560
Dr. Peppy's button was

543
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,100
the most important burning point in my life.

544
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,340
Seeing the button slowly swirl and grow

545
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,620
and become one with the rest of the audience,

546
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,480
it was the most religious opinion.

547
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,560
This is the discarded voice of Dr. Don Peppy,

548
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,580
the most...

549
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,160
Don't ever push anything with red lights on it.

550
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,600
Don't touch the things with red lights.

551
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,820
Hello, I'm Dr. Donal D. L. Peppy,

552
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,100
Dr. E. Donal D. Calpepperian,

553
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,900
the last of the...

554
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,540
Whoa!

555
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,080
This is the beach I want.

556
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,080
Wow.

557
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,120
Looks like a dead squid.

558
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,380
Maybe somehow, someway,

559
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,740
perhaps maybe bring it back.

560
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,280
Shut up.

561
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,520
And suddenly...

562
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,340
I saw a flying saucer.

563
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:47,720
Saucer?

564
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,640
You mean the kind from up there?

565
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,520
Yeah, it's gone apart.

566
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,420
Did you report it?

567
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:54,980
Yeah.

568
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,540
I radioed in immediately,

569
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,540
and they said we'll keep it quiet until you land.

570
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,260
As soon as we landed,

571
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,200
a big army brass grabbed us

572
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,440
and made us swear to secrecy about the whole thing.

573
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,920
Oh, it burns me up.

574
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,480
These things have been seen for years.

575
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,540
They're here. It's a fact.

576
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,740
And the public ought to know about it.

577
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,920
There must be something more you can do about it.

578
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
No, there isn't.

579
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,880
All but what's the use of making a fuss.

580
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,060
Last night I saw a flying object

581
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,080
that couldn't have possibly been from this planet.

582
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,600
But I can't say a word.

583
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,160
A muzzle by army brass.

584
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,100
I can't even admit I saw the thing.

585
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,680
The...

586
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,960
It is not so that...

587
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,980
Good morning and welcome to the subgenius devotional hour here.

588
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:35,520
Um...

589
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,240
Before the normal scary time.

590
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,280
As the smoke of that burning goeth up forever.

591
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,360
That was a stink-all.

592
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,180
But it had lots of prophecy involved.

593
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,180
You heard it right here on the subgenius hour.

594
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,220
And lots of few words.

595
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,100
Wonder why Fido came home with his wazoo missing.

596
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,520
Or wonder why those beefs like Buster and Bill

597
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,220
in the parlor and the pasture are lying out there

598
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,780
with their throats and half their rectums missing.

599
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,500
Well, it's because of those exists who came down to this earth

600
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,100
one Christmas day many millennia ago

601
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,500
to forge a new link.

602
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,140
One might call it a hot link.

603
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,740
Between the aliens and man.

604
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,320
A giant sausage of knowledge from the center of the universe.

605
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,860
The galactic center.

606
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,920
Those little types.

607
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,060
Those little kids.

608
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,820
Those little likes will be able to carry on for us.

609
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,000
Every one of those little kids is a potential Lee Majors.

610
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,080
And I hope you're pleased with what we've done.

611
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,480
The rising generations shall have reason to praise us.

612
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,960
To pour out libations on our smoking altars.

613
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,160
And we shall know this is a non-smoking section.

614
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,720
The book of the subgenius.

615
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,580
Lunatic prophecies for the coming weird times.

616
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,700
Out now and on your stand.

617
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,160
I shall immer...

618
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,580
If you don't see the book on your stand.

619
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:39,700
Complain.

620
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,560
Loudly agitate and tell the store.

621
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,220
If necessary.

622
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,620
They are crazy.

623
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,620
It's a question of bull data.

624
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,880
And its application of course.

625
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,600
In the society surrounding the bull data.

626
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,700
We apply it from a little disposable tube.

627
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,400
That's right.

628
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,420
Using the power shell and using the spirit code.

629
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,940
The Yucatecan matrix applies the bull data to the normals and pinks.

630
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,040
Time for tubby bye bye.

631
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,420
Time for tubby bye bye.

632
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,180
And now a miserable life.

633
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,880
I hate this job.

634
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,280
No...

635
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,580
Oh yes,reading the dictionary.

636
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:39,580


637
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,540
Youparco.

638
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,320
You paper.

639
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:42,940
Fuck!

640
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:43,940
Bwahahaha!

641
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,520
This might be enough for the tour.

642
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,500
I will tear you, your wife, and your kids!

643
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,120
You want it?

644
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,420
Come and get it!

645
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,040
Worry 14 development, I say it!

646
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,680
You can't have that destroyed!

647
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,680
You can't have that destroyed!

648
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,680
No!

649
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,700
No!

650
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,040
You have sealed your fate!

651
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,020
You have sealed your fate!

652
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,040
You have sealed your fate!

653
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,640
Adios, you chicken-blocking little stinker!

654
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,000
You have sealed your fate!

655
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,180
You have sealed your fate!

656
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,780
You have sealed your fate!

657
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,020
You have sealed your fate!

658
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,040


659
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,020
You have made me very angry!

660
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,880
Very angry indeed!

661
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,960
Of course you realize this means war!

662
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,780
Oh no! We're all doomed!

663
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,840
Launch authorization received.

664
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,800
Countdown sequence initiated.

665
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,700
Launch in progress.

666
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,620
Ah, crap!

667
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,400
Bwahahaha!

668
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,840
Bwahahaha!

669
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,040
Ah, crap!

670
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,040


671
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,040


672
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,660
Bwahahaha!

673
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,880
Bwahahaha!

674
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,740
Bwahaha!

675
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:19,860
Bwahaha!

676
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:19,860


677
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,200
Bwahaha!

678
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,620
Bwahaha!

679
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,940
Clear clutches my breast!

680
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,660
Launch in progress.

681
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,940
Bwahaha!

682
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,920
Bwaha!

683
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,600
Bwaha!

684
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,140
Bwaha!

685
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,020
Bwaha!

686
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,880
Bwaha!

687
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,140
Bwaha!

688
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:32,300


689
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,040
Bwaha!

690
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,840
Oh crap, these computers, they're so naughty and so complex!

691
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,380
Bwaha!

692
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,080
You're a good bitch, lady.

693
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,540
You BASTARD!

694
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,220
You NECKED UP TALKER!

695
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,120
BASTARD!

696
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,880
You're in for a hit.

697
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,000
You have sealed your fate!

698
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,860
This is my body.

699
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,020
This is my body.

700
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,820
As I was saying, BASTARD, this finally paid off for the two of us.

701
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,100
Oh, off you go!

702
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,940
You're in for a hit.

703
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,140
Die, arrogant earth scum!

704
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,060
You have sealed your fate.

705
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,740
BASTARD!

706
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:08,360
You're in for a hit.

707
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,060
You have sealed your fate.

708
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,160
Die, arrogant earth scum!

709
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,060
You have sealed your fate.

710
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,300
You have sealed your fate.

711
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,700
This doesn't sound like such a good idea.

712
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:27,940
This doesn't sound like such a good idea.

713
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,820
Boo!

714
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,660
Oww!

715
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,260
You know, you're the only one in here who can't set a fire.

716
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,600
You're a little too rich.

717
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:37,760
You know, you're the only one in here who can't see.

718
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:37,760


719
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,360
BASTARD!

720
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:38,360


721
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:57,540
Oh, friends, it's so insane.

722
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:03,820
Because when come the saucers, then there comes slack.

723
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,180
That piece was by The Bish.

724
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,120
Is that amazing?

725
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,420
Friends, happy, happy flying.

726
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,420
Ah, yes.

727
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:16,340
At this very moment, there have been stories filtering into the studio

728
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,300
about other sports events being kidnapped and the entire thing taken to another planet.

729
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:21,840
That's right.

730
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,900
These are aliens from another planet kidnapping our American sports teams.

731
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,580
It's not a legal problem.

732
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,600
It's not a political problem.

733
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,160
It's an alien problem.

734
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,340
Oh, I've never seen one.

735
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,040
You know, the visits from aliens need not be a pain.

736
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,540
It's a painful item.

737
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,200
It can be quite an exciting time.

738
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,160
I don't personally have any desire to have it.

739
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,040
It's like meeting Bob.

740
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,160
I don't want to do it.

741
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:50,640
I just need to get you to understand exactly what's happening here at the Church of the Subgenius

742
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:56,740
and the organized crime fighting that we're doing here in California.

743
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,900
Could I just do you on some of this?

744
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,200
Thank you.

745
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:00,580
Yes.

746
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,460
Squeeze my hand.

747
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,820
Yeah, just don't squeeze mine, though.

748
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,820
But stop that.

749
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,980
We are...

750
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,620
We are drinking warm liquids out of animal containers here.

751
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,180
We'll be looking forward to...

752
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,160
We'll release the truth about the so-called ancient astronauts real soon on this show.

753
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,220
Medical proof of the work instinct will be coming up also.

754
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:15,800
Oh.

755
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,720
He's checking her for her foot gland.

756
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,000
Oh, my.

757
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,720
I can't watch this.

758
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,740
Punch up five for me, please.

759
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:19,960
Thanks.

760
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,360
Yeah, thanks.

761
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,060
My video is a little bit strange.

762
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,900
We're going to go right now to another song by Glass Madness here on live tape in the studio.

763
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,380
Here we go.

764
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,200
What you gonna sing about?

765
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,040
At five o'clock in the morning.

766
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,780
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

767
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,420
Yeehaw.

768
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,400
Talking about Bob Dobbs and the church.

769
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,240
Everything in a whole big mess on the floor.

770
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,900
Just like a disorganized first church.

771
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,900
A disorganized mess on the floor.

772
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,960
You're a little intimidated.

773
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,640
I'm joining any kind of church.

774
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,420
You can call a church anything you want.

775
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,700
Foundation or a club or just something to look at.

776
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
We call it Church of the fill-in-the-blank.

777
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,740
And Bob Dobbs is the biggest blank to fill in you'll ever see.

778
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,120
And that's all it is.

779
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,980
Friends and neighbors out there listening tonight,

780
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,380
we hope that you're putting your hands on the radio

781
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,540
and getting the full impact of this message that's coming down to you.

782
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,900
Face at the very fact of your eyes moving across the page at this very moment

783
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,520
as you try to read your radio as inevitably and subatomically decreed.

784
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,280
Your brain is working without your control.

785
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,340
Machinations of a cosmic puppeteer who worked your strings so skillfully

786
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,220
you never knew they were there until now.

787
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,100
Feels good, doesn't it?

788
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:33,800
Oh, it feels so very good when I've got the strings pulled tight.

789
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,120
Oh!

790
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:34,600
Oh!

791
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,080
Oh!

792
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:35,180


793
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:35,180


794
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:35,180


795
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:35,180


796
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:35,180


797
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,620
We can show you where the strings are attached and how to sync up with the puppeteer.

798
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,660
Will this say life after death, reincarnality, psychic powers, immortality, invisibility,

799
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:47,340
nirvana, communications, higher challenges, slack, slack, slack, so on.

800
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,440
The little altar to Bob Dobbs.

801
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,860
Bob Dobbs.

802
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,880
The little altar to Bob Dobbs.

803
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,640
Altar to Bob Dobbs.

804
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,480
Bob Dobbs.

805
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,020
He has led this world.

806
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,240
But he is with us always.

807
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,180
No matter where we go, he is with us.

808
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:05,420
He is with us always.

809
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:06,380


810
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,740

He is with us always.

813
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,040
In the freezer.

814
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,740
Not dead the way you know it.

815
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,500
He is with us always.

816
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,340
We got some poodle meat in the freezer.

817
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,280
We got some poodle meat in the freezer plot for you.

818
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,300
We got some poodle meat in the freezer.

819
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:48,900
We got some poodle meat in the freezer.

820
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,780
We've got to remember the words of the pearl.

821
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,680

Get it while you can.

828

Get it while you can.

00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,160

She did have a nice vocal style, but it still did sound to me a lot like now

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,720
It seems very apparent

913
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,020
It seems quite unequivocal

914
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,120
It seems quite unequivocal

915
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,260
Wee!

916
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,960
All of us

917
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,940
We are in hell

918
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,780
God help us

919
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,680
God help us

920
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,700
We are in hell

921
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,300
We are in hell

922
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,960
We are in hell

923
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,100
We are in hell

924
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,440
They love least that which they know their love

925
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,880
Maids say no to that which they would have construed

926
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,600
I, I follow my love

927
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,220
I, I follow my love

928
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,700
Into the depths of hell itself

929
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,640
Into the depths of hell itself

930
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,160
Into the depths of hell itself

931
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,420
I want to be a woman

932
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,600
Love American style

933
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,680
Truer than the red, white and blue

934
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,100
I want to be a woman

935
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,080
Are you a boy or a girl?

936
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,520
Are you a boy or a girl?

937
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,140
Gentlemen, Jack you're lacking

938
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,400
I used to think that you got born

939
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,400
And then you turned into a girl or a boy

940
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,000
And then you turned into a girl or a boy

941
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,260
This gets more interesting by the minute

942
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,460
Are you a boy or a girl?

943
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,320
For the first time in my life I am not sure

944
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,860
Okay, so you were born as a man but you feel that you're really a woman

945
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,900
Okay, so you were born as a man but you feel that you're really a woman

946
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,900
No, women are the opposite

947
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,860
I want to see your tits my dear

948
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,260
I use my breasts to get other people's attention

949
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,500
Like all Americans

950
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,420
I like big things

951
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,560
Don't touch it

952
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,140
I can only stop but I can't stop

953
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,840
I've got these things

954
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,560
I'm not talking

955
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,440
candle wax on the nipples

956
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,780
Like all Americans

957
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:56,400
Don't touch it

958
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,240
Don't touch it

959
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,800
I'm so proud of my pre-operative

960
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,900
I'm so proud of my pre-operative

961
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,740
I can only stop but I can't stop

962
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,780
I'm so proud of my pre-operative

963
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:06,780


964
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:06,780


965
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,400
I've got these things

966
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,060
They're real and they're spectacular

967
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,360
I stood up. Who do you think got there?

968
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,480
Who are you really and what were you before?

969
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,640
He's a girl

970
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,620
A girl?

971
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,860
He's a girl

972
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,000
A girl?

973
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,060
You are a lady from the ground up

974
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:26,980
You can call her a woman

975
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,180
She is a poor officer

976
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,840
How young are you?

977
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,580
No, no, not exactly

978
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,060
But she did have a penis

979
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,840
Well, I had a little penis

980
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,100
How can a guy be normal and go and do a thing like that to himself?

981
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,500
First of all, one sees a very, very bright light

982
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,020
Followed by a shockwave

983
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,020
Five

984
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,820
Four

985
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,820
Three

986
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,760
Two

987
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:52,840
One

988
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,140
Sometimes I get the menstrual cramps real hard

989
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,640
Ah!

990
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,380
Stop, penis!

991
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,200
It's penis! It's gone!

992
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:06,780
Oh!

993
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,120
Wow, that would mean a total absence of genitalia

994
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,960
It's kind of like turning the sock inside out

995
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,400
Insert

996
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,560
Do not put in mouth or rectum

997
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,560
Are you a boy or a girl?

998
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,580
Your choice is simple

999
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,680
Are you a boy or a girl?

1000
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,800
For the first time in my life, I am not sure

1001
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,940
Do not put in mouth or rectum

1002
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,520
Would you do it for a scooby snack?

1003
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,400
Your choice is simple

1004
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,260
The plants act as a suppository

1005
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,180
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1006
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:31,920
Oh!

1007
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,620
Mr. Chambers

1008
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,300
Don't get on that ship

1009
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,600
I am not overreacting!

1010
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,180
I am a teenager!

1011
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:42,800


1012
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,740
To serve man...

1013
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,620
It's a cocoa

1014
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,960
Ah! Stop, penis!

1015
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,760
It's penis! It's gone!

1016
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,980
Something magic always happens with hot cocoa

1017
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:55,360
Something magic always happens with hot cocoa

1018
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,340
That was shallow, cheap, and basic

1019
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,360
It's solely on hormones

1020
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,660
It's solely on hormones

1021
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,940
Very good, we have a winner here

1022
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,340
This concludes this cast

1023
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:06,700
This concludes this cast

1024
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,860
of the Emergency Broadcast System

1025
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:08,860


1026
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,660
And there's nothing like Connie

1027
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,340
And there's nothing like Connie

1028
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,240
when you get right down to the

1029
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,480
meat of the matter

1030
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,200
and oh, that's what it's all about

1031
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,880
with Connie the Trans Connie

1032
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,620
Friends, they're by

1033
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,360
lovely Reverend Protector

1034
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,600
Protectrix Amazonia

1035
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,980
Just roll that name over your tongue

1036
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,860
Protectrix Amazonia

1037
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,400
Protectrix Amazonia

1038
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:36,600
Protectrix Amazonia

1039
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,640
Yes, and you're listening

1040
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,220
to the subgenius radio ministry

1041
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,900
to the subgenius radio ministry

1042
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,020
Friends, if you need more information

1043
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,020
about Bob and Connie

1044
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,640
and the end of the world

1045
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,580
and our great events about those

1046
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,600
then write to Bob at Post Office Box

1047
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,760
807

1048
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:55,760


1049
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,700
Texas 76043

1050
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,400
807

1051
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:01,940


1052
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,900
Friends, you can also learn about Bob

1053
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,280
at sub site

1054
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,020
the web

1055
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:12,580
www.subgenius.com

1056
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:12,580


1057
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,200
Subgenius does not have an O in it

1058
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,180
my dear friends and sisters

1059
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:20,160
It is the home of the

1060
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,380
forbidden sciences

1061
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,200
and that is

1062
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,280
what you will learn about

1063
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,160
my friends

1064
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,660
We don't understand all the

1065
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,680
super power that we have been given

1066
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,120
unlike any plant, animal, mineral

1067
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,000
or anything else

1068
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,500
we have the ability to transcend time

1069
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,600
in any of its dimensions

1070
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,740
and instead of being afraid of time

1071
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,020
we should use this power

1072
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,640
There is a great deal of speculation

1073
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,640
about what is going to happen next

1074
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,380
The tape is ready now

1075
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,500
The lights have gone down

1076
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,900
just slightly

1077
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,200
The Mr. Science Lecture Series

1078
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,900
Volume 1, Number 1

1079
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,280
The Neutron

1080
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,800
Delivered by the Reverend Seth Deitch

1081
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,640
First Church of Mr. Science

1082
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,240
Boston

1083
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,480
Outside the realm of conspiracy science

1084
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,500
and in the clear light of the so called

1085
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,360
forbidden sciences

1086
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,960
we will find we have a far greater chance

1087
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,260
of understanding the true nature of the universe

1088
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,560
What the conspiracy feeds us

1089
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,740
under the guise of the most

1090
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,740
vast system of natural philosophy

1091
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,080
is nothing but a complex sham

1092
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,320
a decoy to hide from us

1093
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,840
the true fact of how much bigger

1094
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,940
and more complex

1095
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,460
and nut wrenchingly frightening

1096
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,520
a place the universe really is

1097
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,980
We are told about matter

1098
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,800
and energy

1099
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,240
and space and time

1100
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,320
as being either consistent realities

1101
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,700
governed by laws

1102
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,180
or as foggy abstracts

1103
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,760
of being outside of that of being

1104
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,900
convenient linguistic aids

1105
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,900
to make the whole thing easier to swallow

1106
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,260
We at the Temporal Management

1107
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,760
Research Facility of the Church of Mr. Science

1108
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,840
of the subgenius

1109
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,660
have through rigorous probing

1110
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,880
through mountains of existing

1111
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,240
works on the subject of time

1112
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,520
and its methods of control

1113
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,300
have discovered the key for blowing the whistle

1114
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,000
on the whole fraudulent twaddle

1115
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,040
that is modern science

1116
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,840
This key is the Neutron

1117
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,100
The truth must now be told

1118
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,300
How it was covered up for so long

1119
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,920
would make a story intriguing enough

1120
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,940
for a separate book

1121
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,100
but it's too involved to be told here

1122
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,800
The actual issue at hand is the Neutron

1123
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,620
and its pivotal role in the management

1124
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,600
of the true cosmos

1125
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,940
In order to properly understand the following

1126
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,300
it must first be made clear

1127
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,780
what actually constitutes an elementary particle

1128
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,360
The first of these basic particles

1129
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,160
is the electron

1130
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,760
which has no mass but possesses a charge

1131
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,240
that is commonly described as possibly infinite

1132
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,020
thus making it the fundamental

1133
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:54,960
unit of energy

1134
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,540
It and other related particles

1135
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,620
i.e. positrons, photons, gravitons, etc

1136
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,360
acting in concert

1137
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,160
make up the Iacotismic field

1138
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,760
which is responsible for holding

1139
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,360
everything that is anything together

1140
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,380
The second is the much rarer

1141
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,560
infinite mass particle

1142
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,440
commonly called a black hole

1143
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,920
These particles, like the electrons

1144
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,160
occupy no space

1145
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,580
but the influence of a single particle

1146
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,400
can be felt at a much greater distance

1147
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,660
They often have event horizons

1148
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:24,640
of up to 100 miles wide

1149
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,040
beyond which not even light can escape

1150
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,140
The third fundamental particle

1151
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,420
is the Neutron

1152
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,780
The Neutron carries with it

1153
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,260
an infinite temporal capacity

1154
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,440
that makes it alter the rate, intensity

1155
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,600
and general quality of the passage

1156
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,420
through time of anything it touches

1157
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,640
The Neutron is very likely

1158
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,400
the rarest particle in this universe

1159
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,220
As far as we know

1160
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,920
there might well be only one of them

1161
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,900
though there could be as many as a few dozen

1162
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,180
in the universe

1163
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:58,240
The first segment of this report

1164
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,960
will deal with the general implications

1165
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,540
of the Neutron in regards to existing ideas

1166
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,120
on the workings of the universe

1167
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,880
The second will concern

1168
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,620
the incredible potentialities

1169
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,840
of using the potent forces of the Neutron

1170
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,040
in time control research

1171
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,960
and in practical time control

1172
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,860
Section A

1173
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,320
Just how fucking big

1174
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,840
everything really is

1175
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,440
What we know as the universe

1176
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,460
can be envisioned as a giant atom

1177
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,540
with the black hole acting as the nucleus

1178
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,260
and the Neutron or Mutrons

1179
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,880
acting as the electron cloud

1180
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,200
with the electrons providing the energy

1181
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,620
for the Neutron to drive us forward through time

1182
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,640
Just about everything else

1183
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,560
in the universe is just so much debris

1184
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,280
cluttering up the works of things

1185
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,580
The fact that there is one such atom

1186
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,980
more than suggests the existence of others

1187
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,640
The Neutron has a corresponding

1188
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,700
antiparticle known as the tachyon

1189
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,280
which travels through time

1190
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,440
in a direction which we perceive as backwards

1191
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,900
so that to someone who is not in the know

1192
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,820
it will appear to exceed the speed of light

1193
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,180
The simple fact of the matter

1194
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,880
is that tachyons are extra universal

1195
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,040
mutrons impinging on our universe

1196
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,600
at a different temporal angle

1197
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,700
These are the mutrons

1198
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,520
of atom universes

1199
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,460
that ours is in compound with

1200
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,280
After this the atomic metaphor

1201
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,220
breaks down

1202
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,320
No matter how much time

1203
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:23,540
we have left

1204
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,460
no atom of mere matter

1205
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,240
divides itself into alternate cells

1206
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,320
almost constantly

1207
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,640
but our universe does

1208
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,440
All the time the universe splits

1209
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,280
in order to express every alternative

1210
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,640
open to any phenomenon transpiring within

1211
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,160
no matter how small or seemingly insignificant

1212
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,080
This is the only way our minds

1213
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,220
can express the perception of the fifth dimension

1214
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,500
or more properly the second dimension

1215
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,140
of time

1216
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,900
So this introduces the concept

1217
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,340
of time viewed as a plane

1218
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,420
in space so is the case with time

1219
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,760
there is also a corresponding up down time

1220
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,540
This is the direction

1221
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,160
in which our mental eyes exist

1222
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,380
In this direction we find

1223
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,240
alternate time tracks similar to the

1224
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,520
sidewise ones with the difference being

1225
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,720
that theirs is oriented in the direction

1226
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,820
opposed to temporal gravity

1227
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,440
so that elements

1228
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,220
of those other selves

1229
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,900
are constantly falling into our awareness

1230
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,460
from above

1231
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,400
The mutron passes through

1232
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,260
all these spaces with equal ease

1233
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,800
and is modulated by them

1234
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,540
much like the photon is modulated

1235
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,600
by bouncing off or passing through matter

1236
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,280
Thus information of a very

1237
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,640
subtle and distorted nature

1238
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,420
is conveyed to us from our other universes

1239
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,580
on the mutron express

1240
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,660
We call this information

1241
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:39,520
Gnosis

1242
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,420
and its influence has been felt by mankind

1243
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,560
time and again for as long back

1244
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,240
as we have records and no doubt

1245
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,340
back to our very genesis and before

1246
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,160
The earliest known

1247
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,600
mutron impact on earth

1248
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,900
was started in the era of the dawn of life

1249
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,080
The primordial sea teamed with

1250
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,380
the most primitive of bacteria

1251
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,240
Their genetic material was a simple molecule

1252
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,760
shaped like a lumpy ladder

1253
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,880
It was very chemically stable

1254
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,120
The mutron passed through earth

1255
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,360
and spewed out a wake that left each and every

1256
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,920
molecule of DNA twisted beyond recognition

1257
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,500
In this state

1258
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,220
its stability was ruined

1259
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,360
and any force or random glitch

1260
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,900
that mother nature had to offer

1261
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,900
changed it somehow

1262
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,500
Thus evolution had begun

1263
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,260
Another notable mutron impact

1264
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,360
occurred about 60 million years ago

1265
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,060
at the end of the age of the dinosaurs

1266
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,340
The particle struck and its wake

1267
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,960
left the intelligence of the dinosaurs

1268
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,340
increased a million fold

1269
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,420
They promptly sat down

1270
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,980
figured out how to teleport

1271
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:39,460
and promptly took off on a

1272
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,600
around the universe vacation

1273
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,120
Presumably they will someday return

1274
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,480
Another notable

1275
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,140
mutron impact only about

1276
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,140
5 million years ago was responsible

1277
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,360
for the division of the human and yeti race

1278
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:57,000
The vast majority of these events

1279
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,320
however affect individual beings or objects

1280
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,740
One such example is Great Britain's

1281
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,840
Stonehenge Monument

1282
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,500
which was not man made

1283
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,180
as is popularly presumed

1284
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,980
but is merely the material evidence

1285
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,840
of a rather minor mutron splash

1286
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,880
Certain great sages of the past

1287
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,180
and present have actually had

1288
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,060
mutrons pass directly through their crania

1289
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,780
A partial listing of these select people

1290
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,880
will give an idea of the effects

1291
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,340
that may be expected of such a

1292
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:23,420
mutron impact

1293
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:23,760
The first is John

1294
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:23,760


1295
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:23,760


1296
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,000
The second is the ancient

1297
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,640
The last is the ancient

1298
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:26,700
The last is the ancient

1299
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,360
Uh... Marcel Duchamp

1300
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,700
R. Buckminster Fuller

1301
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,800
Antonio Gaudi

1302
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,560
Arnold Palmer

1303
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,720
The list goes on

1304
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,740
It's interesting to note that

1305
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,540
J.R. Bob Dobbs is the only known

1306
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,800
human being through whom a

1307
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,020
mutron is passed twice

1308
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,560
might ask, what about the Big Bang and all that stuff? Well, it seems that matter does not play

1309
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:03,680
a very big role in the actual nuts and bolts operation of the universe. In fact, we find that

1310
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:10,100
it is the case in about half the universe's sample that there is no matter at all. Section B, what we

1311
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:16,140
must do about all this. It is well known that the electron can be pressed into service for all kinds

1312
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:21,200
of uses. It might be less well known that alien civilizations of a level only slightly more

1313
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,860
advanced than ours routinely use the enormous power made available by tapping into the gravity

1314
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:31,760
fluxes of quantum black holes. It's also possible to use the time potentials of the neutron to our

1315
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:37,580
own great advantage. The neutron is not subject to the same methods of coercion that we use to bend

1316
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:43,580
normal subatomic particles to our will. They're oblivious to matter and energy alike. The power

1317
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:48,460
of pure thought, because of its intimate relationship with time, does have some small effect.

1318
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,180
Mutrons are attracted to areas of course of time that are not so much of a force of thought as

1319
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:51,180


1320
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:56,520
concentrated slackful enlightenment. A neutron container accelerator could be charged with a

1321
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:01,480
neutron if enough slackful minds concentrated their energies around a scoop entrance to the

1322
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:07,860
neutron accelerator. Once contained therein, it would take relatively little effort on the part

1323
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:13,980
of these minds to maintain it in a circular path. One purely technical problem facing this proposal

1324
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:19,480
is the size of the accelerator needed. It is a property of the neutron that it will only travel

1325
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,860
in the most gentle of curves.

1326
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:26,220
The minimum diameter of a circle to be traveled by a neutron is approximately 1,000 miles.

1327
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:34,180
Fortunately, we have easy access to an extraterrestrial body more than three times that size, Earth's moon.

1328
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,340
The accelerator could be built in a ring completely circumnavigating the lunar sphere about 100 feet

1329
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:45,480
below its surface. Because of the mental effort that would run it, it would be known as the psychotron.

1330
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:50,620
The psychotron would be a valuable tool in the use of practical time control.

1331
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:58,620
By accelerating the neutron in one direction or another, the entire moon could be induced to follow it in whatever temporal direction it might be directed.

1332
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,700
Forward, backward, sideways, or up-down. Having this ability opens amazing possibilities.

1333
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:12,760
It is my proposal that this device be constructed for use in a major project to concentrate high slack wisdom in this universe.

1334
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:18,640
The single most radiant personality among modern man is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1335
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,180
There are other alternate Bobs existing in the universe, but only one of them is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1336
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:21,180


1337
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,820
There are other alternate Bob Bob Dobbs existing in other alternate time tracks.

1338
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:28,480
Not all of them are as prominent as our Bob, but still are privy to the same great gnosis.

1339
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:34,940
Others are already the rulers of their respective Earths. All, though, are truly Bob.

1340
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:42,000
Imagine if we could travel to those alternative time streams and convince all of those Bobs to return to our world.

1341
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:47,240
This is exactly what I am suggesting. The formation of the Congress of Bobs.

1342
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,840
Yes, my friends, this is our mission.

1343
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:58,360
Those who wish to donate to the Psychotron project will be given a free ride to the alternate world of their choice once the project is complete.

1344
00:56:59,020 --> 00:56:59,840
Thank you.

The Mutron by Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger.

1346
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,080
From the 1980s.

1347
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,320
The most amazing piece of time control ever. Thank you.

1348
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,400
From the 1980s.

1349

The Mutron by Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger.

1350
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,640
This is me?

1351
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,740
Yes, we're all you.

1352
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,140
I never sound like that.

1353
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:42,020
I only hear you sleep, but I'm using the puzzling evidence voice because it saves on batteries while I think with your brain.

1354
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:48,060
Well, I've seen that so-called puzzling evidence before and may be puzzling where it comes from, but it flies out of my head.

1355
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:48,060


1356
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:52,200
But as far I'm concerned it's just a lot of the same hoopla they've been feeding us all these years.

1357
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:57,100
Somebody ought to do something about this business before it gets completely out of hand.

1358
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,580
Well, that kind of thing doesn't bother me.

1359
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:03,740
What I want to know is when I talk to somebody is he real when I'm talking to him?

1360
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,180
This is not the day before, or the week between.

1361
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:07,180


1362
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,840
Oh my god. Is this for real?

1363
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,140
No, no, no. This is just the tape. Relax.

1364
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:16,060
It is not the day before, or the week between.

1365
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,000
It's just the show. The show that, yes, was thrown into the bay three weeks ago and

1366
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,700
struggled free of its chains and floated up, swam back to the studio here,

1367
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:31,400
climbed up the antenna, and is now running all the way down those little air wires right into your ears.

1368
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,820
Hi, you're still on the air. There will be a test on this Monday, so stay tuned.

1369
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:38,000
You never know when you're here or not on this show because there are so many doctors.

1370
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,200
Just a few dugs, sprinkle a few Gary's, drop a few bobs over here.

1371
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:48,420
Yes, I'm sorry, listener. You've got a real problem now. They're alive all the time.

1372
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,160
You're still there for no reason at all.

1373
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,980
What is that red button over there, dude?

1374
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,580
Go ahead, please.

1375
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:10,980
Hmm.

1376
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:11,900
Ready.

1377
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,500
You know, brand or scheme.

1378
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,120
Oh, yeah, bobbing, bobbing.
