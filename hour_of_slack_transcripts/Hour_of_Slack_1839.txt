Bob?
Bob?
Bob?
If you happen to tune in within the last few minutes and you are wondering about what's going on,
we'd like to tell you that this is a program about...
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.
We want to pry into people's private lives to record anything that is really none of our business.
As you can see on the large screen behind me,
we're keeping track of things on one of our many manned space stations now in orbit,
while the small screens below show other activities being monitored by mission control.
I'll have them repeat it on the upper screens for you also.
SSL, this is instrumentation.
Roger.
SVO, start port recorders and TV video tape.
Record.
Roll call.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
Welcome to hour of slot number 1839.
And I'm not sure exactly what all's going to be on this one,
except there may be a lot of me talking.
Reading, actually.
Because I came home from X-Day,
missing something I had sort of expected to have.
I have a lot.
In fact, I have too much.
And that makes the editing trickier.
And I'm behind and late.
So I don't know what we're going to do tonight or today or this morning or wherever you are.
But I do know this.
Stock up and save.
We'll get through this.
Everyone, play in school.














And look, pay Bob Bonham in my book.


Pay Bob to show you how.
Read the pamphlet, study it.
Memorize it.
You'll wonder aloud how such priceless wisdom can be sold—
But that supporting an online course didn't quite work at great leisure.
Legally, and all for less than $2.
Tell your friends and family about your slack until their ears bleed.
And that's from the Dobstown Mirror.
And now this.
The Dobstown Mirror.
The Dobstown Mirror.
The Dobstown Mirror.
The Dobstown Mirror.
They comfort me in mayonnaise and then they ate my bones.
The bumblebees caress my skull.
The queen protects her drones.
She moistens them with jelly paste.
Until they're...
Until they're fully grown.
They penetrate my tender flesh, ignore my pleading moans, and torture me with mayonnaise
before they eat my bones.
Until they're fully grown.
They torture me with mayonnaise.
So they can eat my bones.
And of course, who else could that be but the Rudy Schwartz Project
from the new album adjacent to the latex gerbil?
You ought to check out his videos, too, on YouTube.
They do the same thing to your eyes.
This episode has me reading a lot, but it's peppered with collages,
mostly by Reverend Norrell Preff and Lee Murr.
Later, you'll hear both the fake and real news of X-Day.
Which is which?
Which?
But first, this.
Pretty lies.
Some cults, once you join, you think you're supposed to get along with every other cult member,
so you keep your mouth shut when you're supposed to.
You were the one who joined, but you aren't allowed anymore.
Only getting along is allowed.
In the Church of the Subgenius, once you join, that's it.
The rest is up to you.
Believe me, we do not all, quote, get along, unquote.
Heck, I even hate myself sometimes.
Yet we're all still subgenius.
But maybe you'd rather just get along.
Hey, what's that?
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Are you hurt?
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Hi.
You faker.
Steve, you know what this is, don't you?
It's a time-space warp.
I'm not sure I know exactly what that is.
I don't suppose anybody really does.
We've seen some strange things tonight.
Strange creatures that we know don't belong on our planet.
God only knows where they came from.
Jenny and Ben.
Ste pods were heard early this morning.
Bob's been trapped, diving around forever.
He's found Have you escaped the

I as always thought you looked like a ghost in my head,
...the guard over you.

We can discuss the first dimension at length.
The second dimension is widely known.
And the third dimension has been studied in depth.
Yet there exists a realm beyond.
A world 65 light years east of nowhere.
There it is just ahead.
A dominion of sight and sound.
A universe that twitches and howls in three quarters time.
A place we know as Swonk.
Yes, Swonk.
Where reality peaks at 3.14 in the afternoon with such clarity and sharpness you'd think it would shatter.
Where traffic signals radiate black light.
Where the dogs of war battle apes of wrath.
This is Swonk.
And dear friends.
Swonk is a comic book or a magazine or a collection of comics originally published in the Arizona Daily a long time ago.
It's by Greg Pettix who wrote these things.
And Reverend Chris Silla who sent me this copy of this collection.
And even though it's a comic book with drawings I'm going to read some of the cool writing from it.
Because it's cool writing.
And some of them I can describe the drawings.
And I'll skip the ones where I can't.
Here's a short one.
And they're all short.
After I dropped out of college I worked at a grocery store in upstate New York.
One day I was looking for price stickers near the register.
And I saw something strange.
And it shows the buttons on the register such as...
Tax.
Return.
Angel override.
Void.
Angel override?
Maybe this was the silent alarm of the apocalypse.
The glowing red bat phone to God.
One touch would summon an army of angels.
Jehovah's howling commandos sliding down from heaven on fire poles of pure light.
Dodging stun pumpkins while their M16 harp rifles spat out clean and holy death.
Boy, there's a great picture of the apocalypse happening there.
Then again, maybe not.
There's only one button I have faith in.
And it shows a finger pushing the cash register button that reads void.
And here's one panel in which we see a psychosomatic hunchback ascends to the papal throne
on a platform of sacramental bourbon and scantily clad altar boys.
Displeasing the legions of cool youth deacons who voted for Cardinal Blaze,
the self-styled pastor of disaster.
And Cardinal Blaze looks like a skeleton cardinal with a skull head.
And he's on fire.
And the psychosomatic hunchback pope looks like an ape.
Saying hoo-ha with a big jug of bourbon.
This is all a bit reminiscent of the late S. Clay Wilson.
Somewhat in style.
But also very, very different.
Swonk.
Bjork's stork forks the pork.
But Hank's dank tank stank.
Meanwhile,
Bob's job selling food,
fobs to mobs,
and hobnobbing with snobs,
makes Rob's blob sob.
And such a sad picture of Rob's blob sobbing,
with tears running into the box of five-cent apples.
Wherever you are, however you are, this is the BBBB.
Today, the US Senate have been torturing prisoners.
BBBBB News.
The United States has said that it's bad.
An Iraqi deputy interior minister had been paralyzed by three people in Hunan province.
Others had had their skin peeled off during the BBBBB.
The French Parliament has approved violent unrest in a number of French cities and towns.
The interior minister told Parliament that he was beaten and stabbed in the capital, Tunis.
The Tunisian government has denied that it was behind the organized United Nations attack on Wednesday.
China says it's producing more than 100 million doses of bird flu,
and is producing more than 14 billion human deaths from bird flu in a day.
The US government's announced it intends to take the grisly interior secretary, Gail Norton,
off its list of endangered secretaries.
Look at that caveman go.
Plato's theory of forms was an explanation.
It's an explanation of universals, perceived laws of nature,
such as animals giving birth to animals like themselves, etc.
Plato's theory is that there's a form or ideal version of all things,
and physical forms are imperfect emanations of it.
There's a perfect ideal human ideal that physical humans are imperfect emanations of.
It makes just as much sense to say that there are even less perfect,
and even more perfect ones above the ideal we perceive.
Otherwise, you're in that familiar bait and switch of
everything has a cause, except that one thing.
And now this.

Down the road of peace
Watch the Snatch Base, man!
Everybody wants to know
what the hell happened to X-Day?
For 45 years, Bob said that the world was going to end
at 7 a.m. on July 5, 1998,
and he's still saying it!
Even the normals want to see the end of the world.
They're musking for it.
Everybody secretly hankers for that Judgment Day porn
in which their enemies fry,
and they, of course, are spared.
Every other Hollywood blockbuster
has some movie star saving the threatened world
by using his muscles and going,
AHHHHH!
Plus you have your Heaven's Gate
and your Jonestowns and your Wacos,
where some little band of weirdos
manages to make the world end,
at least for themselves.
Then there was...
the Y2K bug.
Remember that?
The pin kooks were all running around like ninnies,
fretting that their precious ATMs
and other false slack doohickeys
would shut down, crash, fail to reboot.
They should be so lucky!
The day the con calendars,
called July 5, 1998, came,
and no immediately discernible world cataclysm occurred,
what a disappointment!
Oh, people made fun of the subgenie,
they mocked our serious beliefs,
but did we care?
Hell no!
We're religious nuts!
Did the Jehovah's Witnesses
quit coming to your door
just because the end of the world
fizzled out six or seven times in a row?
Did the Scientologists stop believing in L. Ron Hubbard?
Are we going to let the Jehovah's Witnesses
or the Scientologists out-kook us?
X-Day!
X-Day might not come for the next 200 Julys straight,
but the true subgeniuses will maintain
unquestioning faith in Bob's word and prophecy.
If Dobbs says the world ends July 5, 1998,
then that is what will happen!
The only thing proved by the events of,
quote, July 5, 1998,
is that we have no idea what year this really is.
At 7.15,
on 7.598,
upon closer inspection of the original prophetic memo from Dobbs,
we encountered the 8661 quandary,
the so-called upside-down bar napkin theory.
The subgenii, at large,
were not exactly overjoyed by the idea
that somebody had repaired a torn memo
by placing part of it upside down
and that we might have over 6,000 years to wait
before we get the image of the original.
We were not sure if we were going to be able to


We were sure that we were going to get the image of the original.
But that's just one theory.
I've been telling and telling you people,
hollow earth.
Everything turned inside out.
All the stuff that was on the inside is on the outside.
Holes at the poles seal up
with Jehovah One and all pinks inside
where it gets to eat them forever.
New outside looks exactly like old outside,
but pinks are replaced by identical,
flesh robots.
When we return after a thousand-year pleasure cruise,
we're given new flesh robot bodies
exactly like the ones we lost on July 5th, 1998.
Our memories are wiped back to X-1
and we live out our lives exactly as we would have
if X-Day had never happened.
I remember from last time.
Well, that's what Nenslow predicted.
And for all we know, it came true.
Dr. Howell, besieged by whimpering gimme bobs
complaining about the post-X-Day world,
shared this doctrinal rebuke
with the poor, wandering livestock.
Dear Seeker, please calm yourself.
It's not the end of the world.
The official line is a tissue of flapdoodle
involving a misreading of the launch date
as scrawled by Bob himself.
On the back of an envelope, allegedly,
Stang read the year upside down
so that the year would be the year of the moon.
The year 8661 A.D. was thought by the scribe to be 1998.
This would have the effect of giving the church
more time to accomplish its mission.
Uh-huh.
However, I prefer to believe in the original prophecy
to wit, we are now in the new aeon.
The rupture indeed took place according to schedule
in the early morning.
Were you awake?
In a twinkling of Bob's eye,
the faithful, which I trust includes you,
were caught up in the clouds, in the so-called saucers,
and returned in time for breakfast.
All predicted changes are happening or will happen,
not according to human standards of time,
but rather in accordance with the movements,
whether in epicycles or quanta,
of the cosmic clock,
which may only be read by superhuman optic
or other sensory organs.
A religion that could be completely comprehended,
and fully interpreted,
would be a toy, fit to be encapsulated,
and folded up to be put in one's pocket.
But behold, we show you a mystery.
Isn't it universally accepted that one of the few things
we do know about the aliens is that when they abduct you,
they always put you back?
That the abductees do not immediately remember the details?
What in the name of Whitley Stryber,
were you people expecting?
Without springing for a conspiracy psychiatrist,
look back, recollect in tranquility, if you will,
dare to disturb with a ripple of self-inquiry,
the deep pool of your unconscious memory.
Now then, are you sure you can completely account
for your activities at 7 a.m. on July 5th, 1998?
Austerely yours, Dr. Howland Owl.
Others insist that X Day worked out, but only for Bob.
We know that Bob makes a million dollars every time he screws up.
In 1998, we had 10,000 dues-paying subgenius ministers
that felt Bob screwed them big time.
That's 10,000 screw-ups.
Ten times one million dollars per screw-up,
or ten billion dollars.
That's how much Bob stood to lose should X Day succeed.
Maybe a delay.
A day of X Day was engineered by Dobbs
after he convinced his customers for this galactic drug deal,
the Elder Gods, that he could brew up an even more pure grade
of the drug in question, that being human soul,
given a little more time.
With Bob's cultivation of the church,
he was providing enough variation in the additives
to keep them wanting more.
On July 3rd, 1998, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon related this parable.
Two bulls, an old one and a young one,
are standing on a hilltop,
looking at a herd of cows in the valley below.
The young bull says,
Hey, pops, let's run down there and fuck some of them cows.
The old bull replies,
No, let's walk down there and fuck all of those cows.
So maybe that's what Dobbs is really up to with this rescheduling.
And friends, there are many more theories.
It was all just a joke theory, the total recall theory,
and there's a description of what really happened at Brushwood
by Onan, which is a whole other story.
But, uh...
You make me happy when I am blue.
Too low.
1-800-1961
I'm acting just like an animal.
There's all the time I need and all the time I want.
Ample.
Antithesis.
Are you hungry?
Are you in good hands?
I'm hungry, too.
The World of the Dead
The World of the Dead
Ashes of a Dead World
And he moved an entire community back into the Dark Ages.
Better blood!
Better blood!
Bob called me.
I sing the body electric.
I sing the body electric.
I sing the body electric.
I sing the body electric.
Burn up.
But I made love.
I can't even play Perry Como.
Chip off the old block.
Chip off the old block.
Come on out.
A dimension of mind.
Don't make any noise when the music's playing.
Don't paint the sun anymore.
Don't paint the sun anymore.
Don't touch.
Don't touch my tool.
Depths paid.
Listening to someone talk about who or what they love,
isn't that a pleasure,
no matter who the who is or what the what is?
Listening to someone talk about who or what you are supposed to love,
eh, a mixed bag, eh?
Except when it's the church of the subgenius.
Everybody likes,
dislikes,
is indifferent to,
or is ignorant of,
Bob.
And that's a fact.
Oh, thank you,
er,
the Rudy Schwartz project for the background music,
which is called,
uh,
well, the album is called Frop Music.
And now this.
The men in white picked him up yesterday.
With a nutskin.
Not the squirrels, ha ha.
We ish, and I ish, ma allus.
Yoizay, yoizay, yoizay, yoizay, yoizay.
Oh, and then the days got worse.
And then the days got worse.
How it last days let me out.
I needs to pray.
Beg, oh yes, I.
I need to take me away.
Ha ha, yeesh.
We are sitting in a
gaza high.
The funny farm where life is
beautiful all the time.
And you'll be
stay and play with my new friend.
I'm normal, I'm okay, uh.
Where the people all smile while I
I'm here.
But this.
He, hoizay, oh.
You would make me flip my lid.
It was a joke and so you laughed.
And you, the day you swore you'd all
Ha ha.
Ha ha, they're coming to take me away.
Oh, hee, ha ha.
To the valley.
There's no arms in the distance
to serve you.
We mad.
And
happy they took you away.
Ha ha.
Oh, no!
Bird ham and ass bread rumors had stopped.
Who and how I should cut my hair.
Look upon all them tom-tom-tom-tom.
And you're right.
I am making friends.
You.
I cooked your food, I
And that gives me the
get-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a
Losing you would surely make me
And
They're coming to take
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Bush as though they are sweet.
Ha ha.
Well, you just
You'll get just what you deserve.
Where's trees and grass and I don't
Just my thumbs and feed my lizard.
To drive me sane.
He he only miss ah ha ha ha he he.
Here to you.
And that's the day
And they're coming
Where life was ludicrous all the time
And they're coming
They're coming
They're coming
They're flowers and chirping birds and birds
Who speak and smile and twiddle their
On the wall
Big and tough
At the start of every disaster movie
There's a scientist being ignored
And or a scientist being heated
But that's what disaster movies are for
Disaster
If you're making movies in your head
And most of us do
Make the ones you want to see
That might be a disaster movie
But it might be some other kind of movie
See what other genres are available
In your mind
When I don't have my head stuck
In a black hole
I always listen to the hour of slack
Because it makes me
Less than I like to listen
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
In Bedlam Cathedral
Organ grinders float
Pokas up to the vaulting
While a chorus of he-nuns
Speak in tongues
Behold the high pope of insanity
Drooling into the
Sacred clemato
Preaching the oral
Torah of ghost stories, knock knock jokes
And Paul's letters
To the penthouse forum
This is the chapel of
Madness
Where the holy trinity goes
Nyuk nyuk nyuk
Spam transubstantiates
Into the flesh of Liberace
And one plus one
Plus one
Equals one
Here's one in the EC style
Greetings
My fellow parish
Inners
And welcome to the catacombs of Rome
I'm your faithful
Storyteller
The sub-pope
Caretaker of the Catholic Church's
Forbidden library of pornography
And apocrypha
I call this little yarn
Rubbed raw
The USS Nazarene
Recon ship for the church's
First interstellar crusade
Streaks through space
In search of souls to convert
The mother superior was deathly afraid
Of star travel
So afraid that her praying became
Almost
Most ungodly
Oh please god don't let me die here
Please god don't let me die
Look at her
The way she obsessively rubs those rosary beads
It's inhuman
The space papists
Finally arrive at Pius 12
Look crucifixes as tall as skyscrapers
Steeples that reach the clouds
Could it be possible
Wait wait
What's that up ahead
Jesus Mary and Joseph
It's freaking huge
Oh god no!
No!



The giant creature cracks open the ship
Decapitates the crew
And strings their heads on a long cable
It bellows in a strange tongue
As it rubs the mother superior's skull
Between its fingers
And as everything goes black
She realizes what the alien is doing
It is praying
Well sister
How does it feel to have someone
Praying on your ship?
On you
Amen
Eh eh eh
And the monster oar is saying
Spa Fon Squa Chonk
Which is secret comic book code alien talk
From the olden days
And you know let me say this
His number is 13013
And he also has an email address
It's uh uh at uh uh dot org
That's uh uh at uh uh dot org
And that's all well and good
But here then is the story of the 26th X Day drill
Previously called 24 X Day quote 2021 unquote
Uh uh this is my story of what I just did last week
And how it came about
This beautiful young subgenius
Named Reverend Exanthea Octoshroom
Started suggesting to me
Way back in the days of Myspace
That we hold an event at
The Land of the Lakes Florida
Nudist Resort
Owned by her and her dad
Oh nothing happened for many years
Then in 2019
Exanthea visited us at Stang Ranch
In person
And amazed me at how together she was
Despite her jaw dropping good looks
She's a professional model
As well as a hard working art bum
Like myself and a fossil collector
And nudist resort owner
In 2020 I started letting people know
That for a bunch of reasons
I was having to retire from running
X Day at Wisteria or anywhere else
Dr. Argus Fox, Fid Chooley, Reverend Pease
And a few others heard that as a clarion call
They visited the resort
And the next thing I knew
They'd bought me a plane ticket
To 24 X Day at Land O' Id
Promising me fine health food
Turned out to be all McDonald's
Because they just got too busy
And they even hired a subgenius Uber driver
Our friend Reverend Nugget
To take me to and from the airports
How could I say no?
They also offered Philo
And he said no
So they called Dr. Hal
Who is up for any program
And despite some challenging thunderstorms
Which are typical of any X Day drill
The event went great
Largely because the venue
Land O' Id
Is perfect for our purposes
Flush toilets
A pristine swimming pool
Indoor clubhouses
Covered stage
And it's in town
No more 45 minute drives
For beer, cigarettes and hot dogs
It's a huge supermarket
Five minutes away
The turnout was like the last several drills
At Wisteria in Ohio
Only about 40 people
Many of them were new to me
And some were local Floridians
But I was astounded
How many came from far away
Like the band Rubik's Cube
From Pennsylvania
They're veterans of X Day
Ohio and New York X Day
Since Lord Rockstar was about 15
Because he's the son of
Old Reverend Sintholtimus X Mortis
Reverend Negative
And Reverend Katana 007
Of the band Sub G Kids
Came from I think Indiana
They got engaged on the way there
And I married him
On July 4th
After their wedding
Before the performance
Or maybe before the
I don't remember
Lord Ferg came
Also I think from Indiana
With a house trailer
Which came in really handy
For our great preacher
Papa Joe Mama
Who had his little daughters with him
And he did not let them see
His performances
Or much of anything else
Lord Ferg's been a huge help
In every way at X Days
Going back to the Brushwood days
Also super helpful
Were Reverend Aster
The wife of Fox
I married them too
Many drills back
She was kind of the mom
Of this drill
Reverend Walter Cosmack
Was once again another great help
And supplier of the coolest art gizmos
And art robots
A new person who helped a lot
Was Reverend Dirty Instigator
She was one of the few subgeniuses
Who was actually nude
Most of the time
Luckily she's young and healthy
And we had the cleanest
Bobtism of all time
For the land of Id
Has a swimming pool
A really nice one
No more water spiders
Leeches
Or mystery moss
And no old sequoia either
But that just means
Nobody had to be sacrificed
This year
Every day there were
Radio shows during the day
Some with boring old pros
Like Dr. Howell, Papa Joe and myself
Some with highly excited rank amateurs
Some with modern podcaster baiters
Like the Time for the Show Boys
There was an Ask Dr. Howell show
And there were so many bands
That I'm still trying to sort out their names
As well as my recordings
Apparently I'm the only person
Whose recordings weren't destroyed by the rain
Unfortunately mine are all from my phone
Or my little ambient laptop
Or my location recorder
The line recordings that we wanted most
Got drowned on the last night
And the roughness of my recordings
Means longer editing and tweaking time
So getting the good bits out on this show
May happen gradually
An excellent bob dummy was burned
On the last night
The head was provided by
Hel Swami Satellite Weavers
Who made the best bob sculpt
And can make plastic masks from it
Under that plastic mask was
A skull
In theory the fire would melt the plastic face
To reveal the skull
A la the melting Nazi face in Indiana Jones
Sadly the body of the dummy
Which was sitting up in a chair
Was spineless
And it flopped forward during the burn
So the skull reveal never happened
Still it was a bob burning
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!
We have a flashlight
We have a flashlight
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!
It's a bob on fire!
Uh oh
He's caught on fire
His suit blazer is ablaze
His lap is hot
Hot lap of bob
Take that bob
Burn it to hell pink boy
Kill Bob! Kill Bob! Kill Bob! Kill Bob! Kill Bob!
Oh, he's spoken now!
Hey, look at that!
Look at the collar there, Bob!
Hey, Bob! Do you got a lighter?
Where's the hot dogs?
There goes the pipe.
The pipe is hanging.
He's about to let go.
That's it, man, when the pipe falls.
The pipe!
The pipe!
The pipe!
My God, it's like his face is just melting off of that stupid thick bonehead skull of his.
Sick. Sick, sick, sick.
This is just a sick, sick spectacle.
Oh, I can't believe it.
Oh, my God, look at that.
Oh, no! That's it.
Kill Bob! Kill Bob! Kill Bob! Kill Bob! Kill Bob! Kill Bob!
More fire! More fire! More fire! More fire! More fire!
I need a rag.
Look what we're doing.
To Bob, man!
What a nightmarish spectacle.
The rams, they just stand there staring at the burning of Bob.
I want to hear some Kill Bob's and watch people run around that ring.
Too bad there's no pagans around to be drumming and, you know,
celebrating everybody stripping their clothes off.
Dancing around the damn thing.
Bill Dibbs! Bill Dibbs! Bill Dibbs! Bill Dibbs! Bill Dibbs! Bill Dibbs!
You kind of need the pagans sometimes.
Yeah, I agree.
We got him. We finally got that bastard.
We killed Bob. Again.
There doesn't seem to be anything left of him in here.
Well, I can't wait for the sausage to come.
I'll stick around the damn reverend's thing.
I know we're kind of bonded by a murder now,
but let's just make sure we don't call the cops, guys.
No. When you have problems,
you call the cops, as Chicken John said.
Then you have the problem and the cops.
Well, now that we're bonded forever by this murder,
we have to take a blood vow.
No, we don't. No?
Isn't that how it goes?
No, we just don't advertise it.
We don't leave our DNA at the seams.
Smart move. Smart play.
Proof that Bob does not just quit.
He gets fired.
You're fired, Bob.
You must remember.
People watch the line of drinking to make sure you have alcohol and fire on every level of your home.
Remember.
If someone in your household smokes or is under the influence of fire,
you must be aware of Ontario.
You must remember.
I'm a dangerous drinker.
You must remember.
There's more to responsible drinking than alcohol and fire on every level of your home.
Orange Blossom Brewery donated 50 cases of beer.
They arrived on Friday and we were down to only 10 cases by Monday.
Miraculously, no one was hurt or had to be dragged out of the road by me.
Simply amazing.
One reason may be that it was all IPA beer.
Specifically, back in the day, IPA.
And many people can't handle the bitter taste of IPAs.
I love them, but as a good role model, I didn't ever get very much of an impact.
I'm a very good drinker.



Very drunk.
Crap, that's the one we got.
It's the only one they had, dude.
Orange Blossom Brewing.
Back in the day.
IPA.
Stang, you should come see this.
Oh my god.
Orange Blossom Special.
Oh, this is dangerous, man.
This is an accident waiting to happen.
This is suicide.
Well, yeah, but...
This is Jonestown.
We're walking Heaven's Gate all over again.
You guys are nuts.
I thought we were a different UFO cult.
Yeah, how many...
There's only going to be about 40 people here.
This just gives me a feeling of utter horror.
And fear.
Well, that's why I brought you here.
No, to terrify you.
I'm so glad this didn't happen under my watch.
I fear the vomit.
I fear the bodies in the road.
I fear the bodies in the road.
Somebody's hitting the garden hose.
They're not dead, but they'll feel that way the next day.
Shit and puke.
Shit and puke.
Shit and puke.
The forces. Australian for undrinkable piss.
You guys are all going to end up like me and Hal.
Amazing orange blossom.
Broken backs.
Yep, that's a lot of beer.
How I began my career as an alcoholic.
Many people think that.
It will take years to fall under the spell of John Barleycorn.
But here at the Church of the Subgenius,
we have our accelerated program of
inebriation for the enlightened.
Which I will now initiate.
I also spent about every other hour inside Reverend Xanthea's house,
which has AC,
and also is a lot like my house,
since she's also a fossil hunter
and a connoisseur of crazy art and antique furniture.

And weird decoration.
Including her own excellent
sexy sci-fi surrealist paintings
shown here on slide three.
I was treated like a king
when I wasn't getting ball busted
for being a high muckamuck.
The Bulldotta auction was full of killer stuff.
I got some rare Doc Savage reprints
and a 2020 election chess set
that has to be seen to be believed.
And my old friend,


my old pal Papa Joe Mama,
had action figures made of him and me.
They don't look anything like
either of us really,
but hey, at least we have action figures.
Friends, I have to drop in
and mention that
those action figures
are not available.
They were banned from stores
after protests by the
National Union of Teachers and Nurses.
How about that?
And a new guy,
Reverend Grindstaff, brought a
dozen of Dobbshead spin art
paintings that a lot of people bought.
And he was a new guy who seemed
to quickly make friends with everybody
and there were a lot of new guys.
He made a lot of new friends.
And when I say guys, I mean ladies as well.
That's kind of
sort of what X-Day drills
are good for. Standing around
in the road talking.
That's my favorite part.
Although a lot of us
old timers missed a lot of
fellow old timers like Reverend
Fousey, Reverend Fousey,
Reverend Fite,
the amino acids,
the circus apocalypse clowns on drugs,
Potter and Petal Nostril,
Philo,
and also everyone who died
such as Reverend Heathen
and Dr. Dart, just to name
a very few.
On the last day, Tropical Storm
Elsa was bearing down on Tampa
and I basically got the last
flight out to Dallas
because the airport closed
hours after we took off.
Awaiting me at home
were a ton of orders
to fill including 16 memberships
bought between July 1st
and July 5th. That happens
every X-Day drill.
Are these people smart?
Or superstitious?
Or both?
Because
they're held at campgrounds instead of
in motels, every X-Day drill
presents
some kind of terrifying
and inspiring
miracle of nature.
And those are always my favorite
parts of the drills because
I love nature.
When the rain
started drenching everything
the first day the miracle happened.
Suddenly there were walking
catfish all over
the yards and porches.
The whole resort.
I mean everywhere.
There are these smallish black
stinking catfish that
drag themselves by their front fins
out of the big central
pond looking for new
bodies of water and bodies
of new spouses.
I loved it. It was so
weird for me. I come
from a dry, dry land.
But here fish
rained from the sky and walked
upon the land.
Signs in the heavens and signs in the
earth. It had to be the real X-Day.
Or at least Exanthia Day.
I spent an hour helping
Exanthia clear them from her
big enclosed porch
which has its own little pond.
And I ran around helping all the employees
and residents carry the stranded ones
back to the pond lest they
dry out and stink later
before they got wherever they were going.
I mean they stink
bad enough when they're still alive.
Anyway friends let me
close by saluting my new
fellow victims of
Devival Host Syndrome.
Not that many people have had it.
But here's some new ones
that lived through it.
Dr. Argus Fox, Reverend
Fid Chooley, and Reverend
Pease, and Reverend
Exanthia. They
saved X-Day.
Praise them.
And praise that man
Bob. And
thanks to CyberChump
for the background music which is from
their CD called
The Construction of Things.
We're pointed at the

Colossus have been by Norrell Preff
and the New York Times.
And also Lee Murr.
Incidentally, I got some good news.
The recordings from X-Day that I was hoping for
came through.
The rain did not destroy everything after all.
But next, well, you know how sometimes
the only way to get rid of a maddening earworm
is to foist it onto others and infect them with it?
Well, that's what I'm about to do to you
with this song by the Swingin' Love Corpses.
It's one of my favorite songs of all time,
but I was never,
satisfied with the recording,
which is from a cassette of a VHS tape.
But I worked it over with my magic compression
and normalizing tools and just with magic.
And either I've ruined it because I'm, after all,
partially deaf and have no business
attempting to sweeten sound,
or I actually did make it sharper and clearer.
Hopefully, it's still the worst, best brain worm ever.
It's unusual for a Swingin' Love Corpses song
because it's not by any means a good song.
It's by either of the Drummond brothers,
but by their cousin, guitarist Ray Hay.
Remember how earlier I said I loved nature?
I said that because I knew I'd end with this.
Here's Nature, I Hate It.
Oh, this music in the background, by the way,
is Cyber Chump.
It's Después de Nadir-
We don't expensively worry too much

Well, it's been a while since time began.
A bad struggle against nature, forcing nature against man.
Tectonic plate movement, a simple quicksand.
Nature has the power, nature has the upper hand.
Nature!
I hate it!
Nature!
I hate it!
Well, the forces of nature come in many degrees.
Maybe a forest fire, plague or killer bees.
Maybe an earthquake or maybe typhoon.
Tornadoes, volcanoes, rains and monsoon.
Nature!
I hate it!
Nature!
I hate it!
In the baby's direction.
Blue glitters.
Wipe out a whole species.
How does that make you feel?
Got your hole in the earth.
Fill that hole with plastic.
The way we treat our planet.
One other planet.
A relation of strength and knowledge.
Way out of your world.

No time for words.
Green jungle.
Humanly romantic children.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Come on!
Ugh!
Come on!
I don't want to get off the stage.
Who told me to get off the stage?
Am I just paranoid?
Rationing reason?
You can't think that.
What if everybody thought like you do?
That's what some people say.
Friend, the evidence is clear that not everybody thinks like I do.
You can pick your battles and you can pick your friend's nose,
but picking your battles is better than letting a nosy friend pick them for you.
I support my thinking far less about what people support, including myself.
Heck, is some other people.
Thank you, Uncle Dr. Onan Canabite, for the Dobstown Mirror.
I'm falling.
And I can't get up.
Calling Dr. Howard. Dr. Fine. Dr. Howard.
No, I'm a doctor, not a mechanic.
We're losing potency in our antimatter parts.
My mind is growing.
I can feel it.
You see? You see?
You're stupid minds.
Stupid. Stupid.
Mark it with a T.
There are any number of popular ethical thinkers who are now forgotten
because they said things like,
do not turn to bitterness because an object you covet is unobtainable.
But here we are, all these centuries later,
still repeating,
the jokes of the funny animal stories of Aesop.
I say, sour grapes, and you know what that means.
But animals can't talk.
Is that too smart for your own good 1990s atheistic attitude
that assures alienating the audience?
And that's a whole bunch of A's there from the hole called the Dobstown Mirror.
About what?
Which you may learn more if I can find the inside front page.
Go ahead, I'll fold it up.
Yeah.

Yes, that really is P.O. Box 3.
And Bob's P.O. Box really is not Box 808,
as much as I would like it to be.
It's P.O. Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.
Thank you, the Rudy Schwartz Project, for the F.R.O.P. music album in the background,
and to Dr. Onan Kanabite,
for all of that stuff I read.
For you see, friends, as it says in Prescriptures 55-58,
the devil cannot seize up a bald man by the hair,
but God will put food in the beard of a man.
Pretty cool, huh?
