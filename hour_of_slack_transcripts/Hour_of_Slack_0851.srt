1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Bob, Bob, love you.

2
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,220
Bob, Bob, love you.

3
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,720
Bob, Bob, love you.

4
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,760
Light your prop eyes up and test your facts.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,220
Well, welcome to the hour of slack.

6
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,320
Praise Bob, Bob, and Connie's rack.

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,980
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,920
All bow before the great metal lord.

9
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,980
Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless tragic voyage.

10
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,780
We're all here tonight to praise Bob.

11
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:20,960
He's kind of shown us that Devo works in parallel ways with other pockets of humans on this planet.

12
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,980
Where we thought we were alone, we know there are now other human forms that believe in God.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,560
And we know that Bob is a conscious mutation.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,260
As he knows, Bob is merely an enema for a constipated society.

15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,400
These people here are here to help a constipated society blow it out their ass.

16
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,140
Have you ever met Bob?

17
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, like I said, Bob would appear in my bedroom and chase me around, making me do jumping jacks.

18
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,220
I know what you do.

19
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,600
Cause I do it too.

20
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,640
Intelligence.

21
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,920
Intelligence.

22
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,860
Am I as smart as I think?

23
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,240
Probably not.

24
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,080
That's good.

25
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,040
Daily disease cannot feel pain.

26
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,520
Hey, I'm Jeff and welcome back to My Depth in Music,asy.com.

27
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,600
$6.5 on Apple's bunlarıincarnel.

28
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,640
By the way, the day after Monday is the 숨ing week, so you can just go to my facebook,

29
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,480
it's in the language died humidity field and it's tougher today.

30
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:49,920
Same for the rest of this video, expect no remorse, you'll like Good bizi and Dark Demon.

31
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,160
It's Frank and Donald King, and I'll see you next time.

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,400


33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,760
I'll catch you in the next video.

34
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:50,760


35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,520
Be safe, folks.

36
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,860
Thank you for watching.

37
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,020
I love your invites.

38
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,840
And we'll see you soon.

39
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,540
electrical shows your科.io depends on me.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,440
held on August 10th in Cleveland.

41
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:10,620
The third annual one organized by several old subgeniuses and fellow Devo fans.

42
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:17,120
Reverend Toth Wilder, Reverend Scott Orsi, the good Blinker Boy at AOL.com,

43
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,640
and help from Steve Sinek.

44
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,300
And, oh, friends, it's just been great.

45
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,920
Because I love the Devos.

46
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,780
We have a lot in common, the church and the Devos.

47
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,240
We're both owned by Bob.

48
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,320
We were both controlled by Bob completely for quite a long time.

49
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,400
And we both share a philosophy.

50
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,900
We don't always have the same kind of music, but sometimes we do.

51
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,240
We always have the philosophy.

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,300
A special philosophy, a little different, depending on which cult you're talking about.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,200
But it is a philosophy for the different.

54
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,960
You know, in pamphlet number one...

55
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,780
What the hell?

56
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,180
This is Herb Alpert here in the background.

57
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:15,680
Friends, did you know that Herb Alpert was the guy who signed Devo to their very first big-time record deal?

58
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:25,760
Anyway, friends, the Church of the Subgenius has called itself the Spaz Church of Macho Irony.

59
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,900
And it's a church of macho irony.

60
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,200
And as I enjoyed the various cover bands covering Devo,

61
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,020
and the new and old and rare Devo materials that were dredged up for each of these conventions,

62
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:44,100
I got to thinking and pondering about the spazfulness of the great spaz bands.

63
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,340
And the ones I was thinking of primarily are ones from the 80s.

64
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,460
Elvis Costello, who I actually used to sort of resemble back in the day.

65
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,620
And Talking Heads.

66
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,440
I never was that into Talking Heads.

67
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,720
But they were a great spaz band, I suppose.

68
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,320
And David Byrne is a deuce-paying subgenius twice over, just as are several members of Devo.

69
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,860
Ah, friends.

70
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,620
But, you know, some people...

71
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,960
And of course, there's spaz bands today.

72
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,100
And we'll be playing a lot of that.

73
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:25,640
But, you know, some might say that the spaz, the spaziness and spazitude

74
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,540
of the weirdos shows no dignity.

75
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,580
That it is somehow silly and unmanly.

76
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,380
But, nay, my friends, nay!

77
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,180
I say the ability to spaz is our treasure.

78
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,120
And the inability to spaz is the curse of the blockhead and the pink.

79
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,080
Because think, is not the sexual orgasm coming?

80
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,620
The ultimate...

81
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,400
spaz attack?

82
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,500
The spaz of sex, friends.

83
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,440
The spaz of letting your own mutant abnormality out.

84
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,240
Do you really care what the others think?

85
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,360
Well, sure you do.

86
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,700
But, why let on?

87
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:23,680
Friends, as Bob Dobbs said very recently to his young ward, Dr. Onan Canabite,

88
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,500
Bob said,

89
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:34,140
I'd rather have the right people laughing at me than have the wrong people laughing with me.

90
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,460
I'd rather have the right people laughing at me than have the wrong people laughing with me.

91
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,620
Friends, you think about that as you spaz out in this, uh...

92
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,040
Friends, white, you just white.

93
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,680
You just white.

94
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,460
You just white.

95
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,120
You just white.

96
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,400
Is there anything religion can do to help?

97
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,200
Help me find my friend?

98
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,160
Well...

99
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,040
we could join together in prayer.

100
00:06:59,420 --> 00:06:59,840
Uh huh.

101
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,800
But is there anything useful we can do?

102
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:02,820
No.

We'll be right back.

141
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,200
Just talking about the

142
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,360
devolutionisation of man and stuff, ma'am.

143
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,640
The other week I was over at my Aunt May Beale's house.

144
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,860
Me and my cousin Bubba were talking about third world politics and the effect on the

145
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,580
micro farm workers of the southern United States.

146
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,220
And all of a sudden it hit me.

147
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,860
Mark Mothersbaugh was right.

148
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,080
Man was devolving.

149
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,720
Turning back into the most simple of primates.

150
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,080
This would explain daytime TV and Jerry Springer being so popular.

151
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,020
Why the hell would it not be on a fucking record label?

152
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,200
But right when I was about to tell Bubba about this, he turned on Jerry Springer.

153
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,700
And as I watched that 13 year old prostitute straddle the Pope.

154
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,700
I was like, what the fuck?

155
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:49,700


156
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,260
I couldn't think anything but.

157
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,780
What a damn fine country we live in.

158
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,760
God bless fucking America.

159
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,420
Devolutionization by a group called the Cryogenic Strawberries.

160
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
An unusual group.

161
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,280
I think they're on mp3.com too.

162
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,160
Or somewhere out there.

163
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,880
Do a little search.

164
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,140
Cryogenic Strawberries.

165
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,780
And now.

166
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,380
Occupant.

167
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,860
Thank you.

168
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,340
Not in French.

169
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:48,740
That's for sure.

170
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:48,740


171
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,400
estudized.

172
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:49,680
That's what it's about.

173
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:49,680


174
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:49,680


175
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:49,680


176
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:49,680


177
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,540
алось.

178
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,940
What does it take to do the super thing?

179
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,540
Super thing.

180
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,420
I'll tell you what it takes.

181
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,360
A very simple thing.

182
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,140
Simple thing.

183
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,840
Iron nerves like the pilot of a jumbo jet.

184
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,600
Jumbo jet.

185
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,360
For a girl on the go who hasn't got there yet.

186
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,620
Magnetic trombone blowing.

187
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,560
Sympathetic saxophone.

188
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,220
The evidence kept growing from below.

189
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,400
Hidden motivations buried in the past.

190
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,560
Still give a strength for the super thing.

191
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,000
Ran along.

192
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,960
A rude surprise every time it rings.

193
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,820
Every time it rings.

194
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,600
Every time it rings.

195
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,460
It means it's time to go beyond the normal thing.

196
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,220
Normal thing.

197
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,080
Pay attention and be prepared to do it right.

198
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,820
Do it right.

199
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,740
Super thing.

200
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,760
The thing that makes you bigger than life.

201
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,500
Magnetic trumpets blowing.

202
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,600
Sympathetic saxophone.

203
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,120
The evidence kept growing from below.

204
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:22,200
I don't even know why I'm doing my magic.

205
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,020
I don't even know what were�� Turner throws.

206
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,020


207
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,080
How do the sleepers look like?

208
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,080


209
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,080


210
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,300
And get ready to.

211
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,120
Story & degli

212
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,140
So'm heating highs.

213
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:37,560
When because it takes,

214
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,300
shields remain real.

215
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,100
Till the day people told us

216
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,100


217
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:52,200
To do the super thing, let me tell you what it takes

218
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,760
To do the super thing, let me tell you what it takes

219
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,640
To do the super thing

220
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:40,520
To do the super thing

221
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:16,080
To do the super thing

222
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,320
To give a strength

223
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,820
Super, super thing

224
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,180
Super, super thing

225
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,340
Super, super thing

226
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,440
Super, super thing

227
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,400
It's old history. It's old past history.

228
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,960
Woodstock, Starwood, Starwalk.

229
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,320
Ewok Village.

230
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,780
Now that's the guy that you...

231
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,500
Popiton.

232
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,800
Yeah, Burningwood.

233
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:52,660
Swampwood.

234
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,220
Starman.

235
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,720
It's all the same.

236
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,140
Except for Excused Day.

237
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,840
Great Day of Excuses, Ex Day.

238
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,100
Which takes place in the same place, but...

239
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,440
I think you should call it that from now on forevermore.

240
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,220
But has more spazzy stuff.

241
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,700
More spazzy...

242
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,800
Well, just more spazzy shit.

243
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,800
It is a feast.

244
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,800
I dig it, I dig it.

245
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,080
It is a feast of spazzy...

246
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,980
I've never seen so many different types of spazzes.

247
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,300
Like Little Fooder and Babushka.

248
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,220
Pastor Craig.

249
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,620
You've got just some really weird...

250
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,280
George Truly.

251
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,140
Watchers.

252
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,000
Mine, mine.

253
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,660
Truly also.

254
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,580
Man, it's a king.

255
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,940
In the kingdom of the spazzes,

256
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,960
the one-jeaned man is blind.

257
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,620
The ironic jackanapes, they call them.

258
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,140
Well, one time.

259
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
Spaz Church of Macho Irony.

260
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,600
Macho Irony.

261
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,880
That's what they said back in the...

262
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,680
in the old days.

263
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,440
And it's just as true now as it was 10,000 years ago

264
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,720
when Bob carved those into that bear skull.

265
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,500
You're walking on the street.

266
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,940
You can't believe you're me.

267
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,220
Come on now.

268
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:09,980
That's right.

269
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,040
I'm...

270
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,200
You're walking down the street.

271
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,260
You keep lifting your feet.

272
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,680
But you never find a place to go.

273
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,920
Never find a place to go until somebody...

274
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,960
Man, you never even knew what history...

275
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,760
I say what history was the back of your hand.

276
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,020
That's right.

277
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,200
Uh-huh.

278
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,160
I say get off of the street.

279
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,240
Get off of the street, boy.

280
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,440
People gonna think.

281
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,140
Yes, they're gonna think.

282
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,760
People gonna...

283
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,120
People gonna think you're a spaz.

284
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Come on now.

285
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,660
That's right.

286
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,720
Uh-huh.

287
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,820
You're pretty shook up,

288
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,360
so you're gonna get a cup of water

289
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:45,760
just to...

290
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,400
Calm you down.

291
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,980
But when you turn around,

292
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,100
some joke or some jealousy.

293
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,700
I say...

294
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,840
Hey, you know it was a mama's tea.

295
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,480
That's right.

296
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,680
Uh-huh.

297
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,640
I say get off of the floor.

298
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,780
Get off of the floor, boy.

299
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,860
People gonna think.

300
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,560
Yes, they're gonna think.

301
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,200
People gonna...

302
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,680
People gonna think you're a spaz.

303
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,440
Uh-huh.

304
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,340
Uh-huh.

305
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:14,700
Uh-huh.

306
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:14,960
Uh-huh.

307
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,400
Uh-huh.

308
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:15,860
Uh-huh.

309
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:15,860


310
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:15,860


311
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:15,860


312
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:15,860


313
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:15,860


314
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:15,860


315
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:15,860


316
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,780
Uh-huh.

317
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,260
Come on now, that's right

318
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:03,040
You wanna sit down when you know some clown's gonna try and pull away your chair

319
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,040
So you stand and stand, stand and stand until

320
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,120
Now you can't stand any longer

321
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,780
Hey, you know you shouldn't have sat down

322
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,400
That's right

323
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,620
I said get off of the floor, get off of the floor, boy

324
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,500
People gonna think, yes they're gonna think

325
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,460
People gonna, people gonna think you're spades

326
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,320
People gonna think you're spades

327
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,640
By the Elastic Band

328
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,120
A classic song

329
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,320
Of great spasitude

330
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,100
And before that, some ESO Swamp Radio

331
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,740
From WCSB Cleveland, Chaz Smith

332
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,840
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang

333
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,220
Talking about the feast of spasism

334
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,360
Speaking of which, upcoming are some

335
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,420
Well, here's an example, it's not a Devo song

336
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,660
Although Little Theodore later on in the show

337
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,500
Will cover Through Being Cool

338
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,520
Here's Little Theodore with

339
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,040
I Don't Care

340
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,460
I don't care about the economy

341
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,480
It has no effect on me

342
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,740
All I need to be happy

343
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,280
Is a woman that's cruel and a place to pee

344
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,260
I don't care about the government

345
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,100
I think it's about time it went away

346
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,740
I resent dirty politicians

347
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,180
I resent

348
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:50,080
Just like me, they're all hell-bent

349
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,560
I don't want to hear about big stars

350
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,720
They should all be behind bars

351
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,220
Maybe we can ship them off to Mars

352
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,520
Or take off their clothes and expose their scars

353
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,020
I don't want no more of that press

354
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,180
They're responsible for our mess

355
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,900
If we knew

356
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,680
What was best

357
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,760
We'd live our own lives

358
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,960
And skip the rest

359
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,480
Ha ha ha

360
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,100
Ha ha ha

The mongoloid, he was a mongoloid

And his twins were unaware

And he had a job

423
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,940
And he brought home the bacon

424
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,980

Is a little bit of mom and dad

567
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,260
Forget the pornography

568
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,100
I don't care

569
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,680
It makes me mad, my friend

570
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,900
The hypocrisy

571
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,820
Now, I have nothing against hypocrisy

572
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,800
Every religion must have its fair share of hypocrisy

573
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,180
As Bob Dobbs once said

574
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,480
I don't practice what I preach

575
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,440
Because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to

576
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,740
But that preacher can get up there on TV

577
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,940
And oh, he's so glad to keep you normal

578
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,100
Keep you working so hard

579
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,120
You don't even know your own wifey anymore

580
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,320
And your kids

581
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,940
You don't know your kids any better than your employees

582
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,720
So, friend

583
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,780
Let there be slack

584
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,300
And you don't have to be a

585
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:44,900
You don't have to be a

586
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:44,900


587
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,700
You may not be aware of this

588
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,000
But we are in the middle of World War III

589
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,340
It is not nuclear bombs that we must fear

590
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,740
The weapon is the human mind

591
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,360
Or lack of it on this planet

592
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,520
That will determine our future

593
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,740
Capital punishment for airline passengers

594
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,420
Who attempt to save money

595
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,860
Spud men and gas lines

596
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,960
Who forgot that guns don't argue

597
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,240
And tourists

598
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,300
Attempting to catch some rays at Three Mile Island

599
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,020
Add up to a major attack

600
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,640
Of corkscrews in the brain

601
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,640
We must fight back

602
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,840
We must know what we want

603
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,880
We must want what we need

604
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,880
And what we need is duty now for the future

605
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,640
Speромont Palabok

606
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,000
The codename on the announcement

607
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,880
Casino

608
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:48,880


609
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:58,400
Happy Christmas

610
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,780
Bye.

611
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,500
Bye.

612
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,900
Bye.

613
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,880
Bye.

614
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,000
Bye.

615
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,580
Bye.

616
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:01,540
Bye.

617
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:31,540
Bye.

618
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:01,540
Bye.

619
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,620
Bye.

620
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,140
Bye.

621
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,440
Bye.

622
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,540
Bye.

623
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:31,540
Bye.

624
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,460
Bye.

625
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,060
Bye.

626
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:01,540
Bye.

627
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,020
Bye.

628
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,900
Bye.

629
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:31,540
Bye.

630
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:01,540
Bye.

631
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,040
Bye.

632
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,980
Bye.

633
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,660
Bye.

634
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:34,800
Bye.

635
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:41,960
Bye.

636
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:43,260


637
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:43,320


638
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,380
Bye.

639
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,120
Bye.

640
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:45,440
Bye.

641
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:07,920
My address is P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

642
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,520
But you can write for more information for free.

643
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:19,240
Paper information from the Church of the Subgenius at Post Office Box 204206 Dallas, I mean Austin.

644
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:19,740
Whoa!

645
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,100
Austin, Texas 78720.

646
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,920
Yes, the office moved.

647
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:32,460
Again, that's P.O. Box 204206 Austin, Texas 78720.

648
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:36,980
As seen on www.subgenius.com.

649
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:46,600
The band Devo, they've got a new album coming out called Shout, which will be out in about a month.

650
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,060
They've done a cover version of Hendrix's Are You Experienced?

651
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:54,840
And the Subgenius Foundation.

652
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:00,020
The Subgenius Foundation in association with Tele Music Corporation is going to be putting that video together.

653
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,800
It will be loaded with special effects and probably a cameo appearance by the ghost of Bob Dobbs.

654
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,920
And by the ghost of Jimi Hendrix, too.

655
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,340
This is a whole, you know, combining two churches in one.

656
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,640
Yeah, I'm serious.

657
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,780
This ought to be quite a seance-packed shoot.

658
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,320
But aside from the videos that we're trying to do, there's a lot of...

659
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,220
The whole music video thing is kind of a funny...

660
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:30,340
Situation in that that whole world is loaded with what I consider false slack.

661
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:36,760
And, you know, endless repetitions of the images of half-dressed girls and fast cars and pills.

662
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,260
What is false slack?

663
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:42,860
Well, half-dressed girls, fast cars and pills without Bob.

664
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:54,420
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

665
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,700
Thank you.

666
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:10,020
Thank you.

667
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,260
Thank you.
