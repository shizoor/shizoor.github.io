Let me make this perfectly clear to you.
The contents of this document are a matter of national security,
constituting an assault on the character of several important party members,
as well as a blatant violation of the Articles of Allegiance.
Any discussion of this document or its contents will be regarded at the very least as an act of sedition,
if not a willful act of treason.
Ah, yes, dear friends, speaking here from Stang Ranch in Stang County, Texas, with no studio.
This Hour of Slack was an easy one for me and a great change of pace
because it's all one fantastic old-school media barrage by the hard-working and talented Reverend Exister,
normally heard weekly on our sister subgenius show, The Ministry of Slack.
It's a collage using what would be to him older movies and music,
and it reminds me of our carefully arranged media barrages that we used to create on reel-to-reel tape
back in the 80s before Hour of Slack was born.
I don't think Bob or subgenius are mentioned at all, but it is pure subgenius.
It's 90 minutes long, so this is only part one of Ship of State by Reverend Exister.
You would do well to put it out of your mind.
My, what a peculiar place to have a party.
You know, Dinah, we really shouldn't...
We're doing this.
After all, we haven't been invited.
And curiosity often leads to trouble.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Goodbye, Dinah.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

The window opened and went straight to Kelly Dodson's room and called in the signer.
I can't hear you guys.
You need it for some reason.
I don't think so.
Dodson says she put up a mic as the man attacked her.
She choked him.
She choked him.
Dodson says, I got a good look on your face.
Thanks.
And again, now you've turned to the next thing that happened.
And then in verse 12, he opens the sixth seal.
And behold, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as hair, the moon as blood,
and stars of heaven fell, and he sees heavenly signs.
What's the next thing that's described as a big intervention?
Can you believe that moment?
Oh, my gosh.
Well, after this I should be able to do nothing but falling down the stairs.
Oh, Mr. Bannis! Wait! Please!
Wait! Mr. Bannis! Mr. Bannis! Mr. Bannis!
Dog carcass in alley this morning. Tire tread on Burr's stomach.
This city's afraid of me. I've seen its true face.
The streets are extended gutters, and the gutters are full of blood.
When the drains finally scap over, all the vermin will drown.
The economy will be ruined.
The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up around their waists.
And all the whores and politicians will look up and shout,
Save us!
And all whisper,
No.
Now the whole world stands on the brink, staring down into bloody hell.
All those intellectuals, smooth talkers.
And all of a sudden, nobody can think of anything to say.
Beneath me, this awful city, it screams like an abattoir full of retarded children.
And the night reeks of fornication and bad consciences.
What do you suggest we do about it?
Retribution.
Nobody knows who you are. You can give it up.
Try and have a normal life.
Is that what you have now? A normal life?
When you walk down the street in a city dying of rabies,
past the human cockroaches talking about their heroin and child pornography,
do you really feel normal?
At least I'm not the one still hiding behind a mask.
No.
You're hiding in plain sight.

Welcome to the archive.

In the beginning, there was man.
And for a time, it was good.
But humanity's so-called civil societies soon fell victim to vanity and corruption.
Thus did man become the architect of his own demise.
But for a time, it was good.
Because if you don't understand that, it's going to be very difficult for you to understand
this book.
The time when the Antichrist takes over, he's going to have full power.
And we read in Revelation chapter 13 and verse 1, John in his vision said, and I stood upon
the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads.
And I said, I'm going to take you to the sea.


So I said, well, if you're asking which edition I am, you're going to have five heads.
And then trying to complete that boom in the writing, two datas, five parts.
If I'm like a paper, there will be a paper bunny skin.

And I'd like to take 토� thinking, to come right to the point that the way I am is

seriously be吃ed up, that way instead of believing.

Now, that brings up a real question.
Do we interpret the book of the revelation literally or symbolically?
Which do you think?
All right, you maggots.
I know we love you.

A typical mental delusion.
We get unbalanced kids like this all the time.
Reality can be a pretty scary thing for some people.
This world must have been a cold and alienating place for a boy like that.
It's called denying reality.

don't talk about politics or religion
this is all the equivalent of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line
lay down GI, lay down GI
we saw it all through the 20th century
and now in the 21st century it's time to stand up and realize
that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze
we should not submit to dehumanization
I don't know about you but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world
I'm concerned with what's happening in this world
I'm concerned with the structure
I'm concerned with the systems of control
those that control my life
and those that seek to control it even more
I want freedom
that's what I want
and that's what Jason wants
it's up to each and every one of us to turn with just some of the greed
the hatred
the envy
and yes the insecurities
because that is the central mode of control
make us feel pathetic
small
so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty
our liberty
our destiny
we have got to realize we're being conditioned

start challenging this corporate slave state
the 21st century is going to be a new century
not the century of slavery
not the century of lies

resistance is not futile
we're going to win this thing
humankind is too good
we're not a bunch of underachievers
we're going to stand up

we're going to get fired up about the real things
the things that matter

you have the luxury of not knowing what I know
that death while tragic
probably saves lives
and my existence while grotesque

you don't want the truth
because deep down in places
you don't talk about it
in parties
you want me on that wall
you need me on that wall
we use words like
honor

loyalty
we use these words as the backbone
of a life spent defending something
you use them as a punchline
I have neither the time

to a man who rises and sleeps
under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide

In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran,
cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of fate.
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity,

However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified,
and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin,
vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition.
The only verdict is vengeance,
a vendetta,
held as a votive, not in vain,

The life we had before knowing all this.
Even if that life was just an illusion?
It's ironic that one could be more at peace in the virtual world.
I've come to my senses. You should do the same.
I took the red pill because I wanted to know the truth.
But I don't care about the truth anymore.
What's real doesn't matter.
What's important is how we live our lives.
Are you listening to me?
You know I'm right.
But we can't go back. We know the truth now.
We can forget all of this.
I know how.
Trust me. Don't be afraid to look into your heart.
Say what you're really feeling.
Tell me.
I can't. I don't know.
Running away won't change anything!
You're the one that's running away!
Stop pretending!
Enough! I've had enough!
I don't want to see you again!
There's no time.
You can forget about it. I won't look away from the truth. I can't.
That's too bad. I'm sorry.
No!
No!

From the cold

You turn to speak
that you're alone

You're on your own
So let me in

Be happy with what you got
Because the owners of this country
don't want that
I'm talking about the real owners now
The real owners
The big wealthy business
interested in controlling things
and make all the important decisions
Forget the politicians
The politicians are put there
to give you the idea
that you have freedom of thought
You have no choice
You don't
You have no choice
You have owners
They own you
They own everything
They own all the important land
They own and control the corporations
They've long since bought and paid
for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses
the City Halls
They've got the judges in their back pockets
And they own all the big media companies
So they control just about all the news
and information you get to hear
They got you by the balls
They spend billions of dollars every year
Lobbying
Lobbying to get one of these people here

They want
Well we know what they want
They want more for themselves
and less for everybody else
But I'll tell you what they don't want
They don't want a population of citizens
capable of critical thinking
I'll light my candlelight
And her by my side
And if she prefers
We never stay
together again
Someone sent the promised love
And I grabbed it with both hands
Now I'm the man on the inside looking out
Hear me shout
Come on in
Hear me shout
Hear me sing
What's the news

Cause there's no wind left in my soul
And I've grown old

They don't want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table
And figure out how badly they're getting fucked by a system that threw the local board 30 fucking years ago
They don't want that
You know what they want?
They want obedient workers
Obedient workers
People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork
And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs
With the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime
And the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it
And now they're coming for your social security money
They want your fucking retirement money
They want it back
So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street
You know something?
They'll get it
They'll get it all fucking sooner or later
Cause they own this fucking place
It's a big club
You ain't in it
You and I are not in the big club
By the way it's the same big club they used to beat you over the head with all day long
When they tell you what to believe
All day long beating you over the head with their medians on you
What to believe, what to think, and what to buy
The table is tilted folks
The game is rigged
And nobody seems to notice
Nobody seems to care
Good honest hard working people
White collar, blue collar, doesn't matter what color shirt you have on
Good honest hard working people continue
These people of modest means continue to elect these rich cocksuckers
Who don't give a fuck about them
They don't give a fuck about you
They don't give a fuck about you
They don't care about you
At all
At all
At all
At all
At all
But nobody seems to notice
Nobody seems to care
That's what the owners count on
The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant
Of the big red white and blue dick that's being jammed up their assholes everyday
Because the owners in this country know the truth
It's called the American dream
Cause you have to be asleep to believe it
You're my girl.
So vulnerable about everything, it makes me sad.
Yeah, all right, let's keep that money machine rolling.

Can you find me soft asylum?
I can't make it anymore.

Every time I'm in the studio for a session, I feel just a little bit more hypocritical and guilty.
It's like I'm part of this massive conspiracy to lure unsuspecting people into spending all their money on image-enhancing products that in reality they little need nor they'll can afford.
The strange thing is, the more guilty I feel about the situation, the better my work is.
My delivery has improved tenfold since the Iraqi crisis.
I work four or five times a week.
I've even upped my rates.
I'm referring to a lapse of ethics.
Thinking about it almost makes it worth thinking about it.
But as good as I get at my work, I'll still be only a knockpiece, a conduit for someone else's concepts,
a faceless spokesman for companies who want you to believe their advertising campaigns only a little bit more than they want to believe in themselves.
Now what do you think?
Am I cutting my own throat here?
Biting the hands that feed me by verbalizing these thoughts on a demo line?
An audio billboard for the commodity that I have become?
I don't know.
I can't answer that.
But I do know this.
This country has a long and proud tradition of lying to its own people to serve its own best interests.
Well that's in our vital national interest.
And advertising is a natural process.
is only one small part of that conspiracy.
For the sake of peace.
Regardless of what I may have told you over the radio,
nothing you can buy will make you a better person,
a happier person,
a more spiritually connected person,
can provide you with the things in life
that are truly important to the soul.
There are things that can never be turned into comics and marketed,
and these things must be searched for within each of us individually.
Every child must be taught these principles.
Our future as a country is built upon lies and deception.
And if you don't think that you're only three paychecks away
from that disgusting bomb you just passed on the street,
then you too are part of that deception.
It does not matter if you're a slave in the fields,
or a slave in the office,
or a slave in the big house on the hill.
You're still a slave,
and at best, a middle management slave,
frauding.
And whipping and abusing those beneath you in a desperate fervor.
Sending a clear message.
Praying that you will suddenly find yourself a part of that inner circle.
Believe me, you will be dead long before you get close to that inner circle.
And you will be replaced the very next day
by yet another well-groomed, well-oiled,
evil, brown-nosing slave.

You're inceptible.
Recently,
we observed the imploding of communism in Eastern Europe.
Now what do you think brought all that about?
Was it because the communist system was flawed,
and doomed to collapse from its very inception?
No.
I don't think so.
I think it was because of the greedy,
myopic,
and insensitive bureaucrats who were charged with the responsibility of keeping the machine running.
Interesting parallel, don't you think?
It's a good one.
They're not all that different from the ineffective, greedy, myopic, and insensitive bureaucrats charged with the responsibility of keeping our machine running.
But rather than choose to evict them, as was the case in Russia,
all too often,
we choose to emulate them.
To ape their postures,
their uniforms,
their speech patterns, their phraseology.
Stop acting like you're next on the docket,
because you aren't.
Stop acting like everything is alright.
Because you need.
Nothing is alright.
And if you can look around you at the state of this country,
and not secretly admit to yourself that our system is just as vulnerable as theirs,
and that their dominance just happened to fall first,
you are truly ignorant.
It's the top 3% who really call the shots in this corporate heap
and who lovingly sing to in all of his patriotic songs.
If you're fortunate enough to be working right now,
remember, you're working at least three of those days
to pay off your accrued interest charges
and to help fund a government that can't even help you feel safe
as you stand in line to cash what's left of your paycheck.
Don't expect an average.
That's 3% at the top.
The real inner circle is bleeding you dry.
It's bleeding this country dry,
not to mention what's left of this planet.
And as we trip over each other in our rush to emulate our leaders,
we wallow like pigs in the waste of our abundance,
oblivious to our inevitable slaughter.
Unlike any other man we have ever seen.
And why do we continue to do this?
Charity.
Why do we continue to remain on this treadmill to oblivion?
And why can't we learn from our collective histories?
And how can I give so freely of my talents and my art
to the continued perpetration of this hoax?
For unavoidable power and our interests.
Poverty, prison, addiction, and despair.
Freedom without structure is anarchy.
Structure without freedom is fascism.
What are you?
An anarchist?
Or a fascist?
Remember, capitalism is not democracy.
Convenience is not freedom.
And the government is not your friend.
Every child must be taught these principles
until this threat to America is removed.
And how is this height-ranging rhetoric being разаised

The best in the Se annexation.
With this taint of the racists of East Stream



It took us 40 years to defeat the probloume
of capitalism

55 0000 0000 segued fat,
I fr wearing lyricства as a populist.
Help the patriarchy to run again.
PROTESTIVE So-called populists.
What advertising has is chasing cars and clothes.
What jobs we hate is we buy shit we don't need.
We're the middle children of history, man.
No purpose or place.
We have no great war.
No great depression.
Our great war is a spiritual war.
Our great depression is our lives.
Our great depression is our lives.

Words will be used in lieu of conversation.
Words will always retain their power.
Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
The enunciation of truth.
And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
The End
Cruelty and injustice.
Intolerance and depression.
And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit,
you now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity.
How did this happen?
Who's to blame?
Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than I am.
Others, they will be held accountable.
But in truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
I know why you did it.
I know you were afraid.
Who would you be?
War? Terror? Disease?
There were a myriad of problems which you conspired to corrupt your ways.
Reason?
And rob you of your common sense.
Fear got the best of you.
Fairness, justice and freedom are more than words.
They are perspectives.
But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel,
and if you would seek as I seek,
then I ask you to stand beside me.
If you're the one investigating my justice and freedom,
then I ask you to be the금 released.
The will of the decisions, the will of the problems.

It's not that fear.
Well, it is history.
What's theสν survivіса read наши свdoingr можAKE
It might be true that there are six billion people in the world and counting.
Nevertheless, what you do makes a difference.
It makes a difference, first of all, in material terms.
It makes a difference to other people.
And it sets an example.
And in short, I think the message here is that we should never simply write ourselves off
and see ourselves as the victim of various forces.
It's always our decision who we are.
The realm of the real spirit, the true artist, the saint, the philosopher, is rarely achieved.
Why so few?
Why is world history and evolution not stories of progress,
rather this endless and futile edition of zeros,
no greater values have developed?
Hell, the Greeks, 3,000 years ago, were just as advanced as we are.
So what are these barriers?
What are the barriers that keep people from reaching anywhere near their real potential?
The answer to that can be found in another question, and that's this.
Which is the most universal human characteristic?
Fear or laziness?
Reverend Exister of Ministry of Slack edited all of that, and we'll hear part two next week.
You can find Ministry of Slack at...
Well, it's a long...
It's a long link, so just go to subgenius.com and click the radio button at the top,
and you'll find all the details along with the other Subgenius shows and copies
and logs of all our previous shows and the stations that play them and other information.
Praise Bob, praise Reverend Exister, praise subgenius.com and everybody involved, even you.
Sire, there is no more money.
We gotta get some money.
That dirty, perky, shark-a-back, flackin' wharton, fill-a-bunker-burton, perkaluma-burton,
that's the worst thing I've ever heard.
B-O-B.
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show, and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that Slack back to rebound to you, you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page.
Or the catalog store pages.
And help out financially as best you can.
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty, and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.
But some of you still have jobs.
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month, from enough of you.
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.
All we're saying is that...
Blowjobs could go the way of Stevejobs if you don't pay Dobbs.
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be Slack.
We're here to help.
If you ain't got no money, then...
If you ain't got no money, then take your broke ass home.
If you ain't got no money, then take your broke ass home.
