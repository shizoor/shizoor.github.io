1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
The Self-Genius Power of Bob

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,280
Friends, the virtual online X-Day drill was lots of fun.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,460
It's going to take some editing though.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:24,580
But Reverend Susie the Flusie saved my boot-all by doing a superb brand new X-Day and Plague episode of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse on WREK Atlanta.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,000
As follows.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,180
The program you are about to hear, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse, is parody, satire, and comedy.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:36,980
Any reference to Bob, the Church of the Self-Genius, religion, politics, or any other touchy subject is intended only as humor and should pass no reflection on the highest standards of WREK Atlanta, its staff, or that of Georgia Tech.

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,920
Enjoy the show, for one day we shall die.

9
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,000
Wow, look who's finally coming around.

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,760
Oh, God, evil Susie.

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,880
Oh, man.

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,980
Feels like I need to shave my teeth.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,520
Oh, Tom.

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,220
You probably do.

15
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,780
I put you under around New Year's Eve.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,520
How long have I been asleep?

17
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,480
Somewhere around 25.

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,300
I slept for 25 hours?

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,800
No, 25 weeks.

20
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,380
You mean to say since January you've put me into a medically induced coma?

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,740
Well, sort of, kind of.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,060
Less medical, more cast iron.

23
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,240
Skill it with a little help from the street corner.

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:25,660
Stop.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,320
I'm a little bit of a fucking cop.

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,880
But you needed the beauty rest, Lo.

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,540
Oh, that explains the headache.

28
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,460
When is right now?

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,100
Oh, it's Sunday around midnight.

30
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,800
Which Sunday?

31
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,860
The Sunday that's July 5th this year.

32
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,200
It's July 5th?

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,520
Oh, holy hell.

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,020
My house is supposed to be the next day.

35
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,780
I gotta go.

36
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,140
Hey, hold your horse, Flues.

37
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,340
You can't go out.

38
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,420
What? Why?

39
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,980
No one can go out.

40
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:55,980


41
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,360
What's going on?

42
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,560
Oh, that's right.

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,500
I guess you've missed a few things.

44
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,720
Let me help you get caught up.

45
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,080
Ah!

46
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,040
Hmm.

47
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,940
Nothing like sleep learning.

48
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,200
The day it all began.

49
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,520
The day what began?

50
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,400
Oh, yes, yes.

51
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,200
It began far, far away from this lovely palace.

52
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,060
Far below the Earth's surface at the Institute.

53
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,360
Come on in.

54
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,920
Didn't mean to disturb your lunch.

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,440
Welcome to the Lymphnode Institute.

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,440
I'm Doc.

57
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,260
I'm Bunsy.

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,660
Governments don't dare try to kill me.

59
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,700
I've let them all know that I've planted biological bombs in seven major cities around the world.

60
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,960
And, uh...

61
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,100
And released a biological attack on the population which will kill hundreds of thousands.

62
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,080
Then...

63
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,500
Oops.

64
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,960
Broke open.

65
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,200
Ain't that a bitch?

66
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:50,760
Run!

67
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,420
You ain't got a chance.

68
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:52,660
Man.

69
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,800
But that was just a prelude to what was to come.

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,760
You got to hurry.

71
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,960
There's a storm coming.

72
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
His storm.

73
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:06,740
Huh?

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,320
And his name?

75
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,540
The Horned King!

76
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,040
The Dark Man!

77
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:12,640
Oh, no.

78
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,940
Well, we're boned.

79
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,820
Come on, let's go.

80
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:21,840
I'm coming.

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:21,880
I'm coming.

82
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:21,880


83
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:21,880


84
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:21,880


85
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:21,880


86
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:21,880


87
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:21,880


88
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:21,880


89
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:21,880


90
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:21,880


91
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:21,880


92
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:21,880


93
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:21,880


94
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:21,880


95
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:21,880


96
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:31,080
Come on down and meet your maker.

97
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:43,140
Come on down and make the stand.

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,740
Come on down and meet your maker.

99
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:51,740


100
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,180
Come on down and make the stand.

101
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,280
Come on down and meet your maker.

102
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,860
Come on down and meet your maker.

103
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,940
Come on down and meet your maker.

104
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:24,940


105
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:24,940


106
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,120
Come on down.

107
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,780
Come on down.

108
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,280
Come on down.

109
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,040
You'll make the stand.

110
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:32,940
Oh.

111
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,180
Where the hell is Gerard?

112
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,260
Told you he's sick.

113
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,760
What do you mean he's sick?

114
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,920
I mean, he's really sick.

115
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,900
Throwing up diarrhea.

116
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,780
It's nasty.

117
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,680
To tell you the truth, I'm a little worried.

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,560
He had those bad cramps, right?

119
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,320
You really are one paranoid little man, you know that?

120
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,480
Cold got you down?

121
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,080
Chills?

122
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,680
Fever?

123
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,560
Sounds like you need a buddy.

124
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,740
Flu Buddy.

125
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,280
Fast-acting Flu Buddy.

126
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,080
Available at pharmacies everywhere.

127
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,380
Flu Buddy.

128
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,240
And now, let's get back to the Lone Star.

129
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,080
I'm not leaving.

130
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,460
State patrol, Hap.

131
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,660
I'm not leaving.

132
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:15,660


133
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:15,660


134
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:15,660


135
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:15,660


136
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:15,660


137
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:15,660


138
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:15,660


139
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:15,660


140
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:15,660


141
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,280
Hey, Joe Bob.

142
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,340
Want me to fill her up for you?

143
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,100
No, sir.

144
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,220
I come by on other business.

145
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,580
Was that old geezer here last night?

146
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,100
He's here just about every night.

147
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,960
And maybe he ought to hear this, too.

148
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,620
Hear what?

149
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,460
There's strangers crawling all over Braintree.

150
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,420
Supposed to be U.S. Health Service guys, but they came in a C-5A transport plane and

151
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,880
they look like regular Army to me.

152
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,920
And then there's been three more big transport planes land over Starland in Arkansas since

153
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,300
noon.

154
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,700
What's calling?

155
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,660
I knew it was a Starland.

156
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:45,660


157
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:45,660


158
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:45,660


159
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:45,660


160
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:45,660


161
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:45,660


162
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,800
I don't know nothing about that.

163
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,820
I'll tell you one thing, though.

164
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,700
If the feds are thinking about a quarantine, then you might have a little bit more to worry

165
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,520
about than cholera.

166
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,160
I just thought you ought to know what's stirring in the weeds, Hap.

167
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,180
If any of them other old boys that were here last night come by, you ought to pass a word

168
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,780
along to them.

169
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Just don't mention my name.

170
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,280
Hap!

171
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,020
You ought to take care of that old timer.

172
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,880
Them summer coals are the worst.

173
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,440
Oh.

174
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:11,980
Okay.

175
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,500
All right.

176
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,580
All right.

177
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,100
All right.

178
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,320
All right.

179
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,520
All right.

180
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:20,520


181
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:20,520


182
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:20,520


183
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:20,520


184
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:20,520


185
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:20,520


186
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,240
What if it ain't a cold?

187
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,580
What if I got whatever he had?

188
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,820
That guy last night?

189
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,020
Oh, it's probably just a sniffles, that's all.

190
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,040
comparment danner.

191
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,240
Yes!

192
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,020
day call the other fellows and see how they're feeling might not be a bad idea yeah

193
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:28,140
all survivors gotta come with us run jesse run

203
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,620
what's going on here it isn't the man with the little clipboard and the armed escort

204
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,520
no no no no we don't take counts here just a precaution would you get the doctor a mask

205
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,720
wait wait wait we're moving this man to isolation according to who he's been misdiagnosed health

206
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,980
services has no authority here actually in a communicable case i do you're making a big

207
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,140
mistake here honey i don't think so and it's doctor

208
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,740
not honey so when are we gonna go public well we're not not till we have some kind of

209
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,740
solid information on how this thing is spreading we got to keep a tight lid on this thing with

210
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,900
the press it's kind of an outbreak can easily cause a panic

211
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,640
meanwhile in washington dc yes sir on the outskirts of a one stoplight town in east

212
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,880
texas we killed them in a hurry down there telemetry suggests even the ones that manage

213
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,040
to get their respirators on there are only three hours later they're being followed by an

214
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,100
died within 12 minutes.

215
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,480
The rest of them were gone in five.

216
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,320
You believe that?

217
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,400
Do I have a choice?

218
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,240
No.

219
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,140
Apparently, none of us do.

220
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,600
The National Disease Control Center,

221
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,900
the Pentagon, says we'll know

222
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,320
if it's actually going to jump to the outside.

223
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,620
He says it'll probably mutate,

224
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,280
but that's not going to help the people that catch it.

225
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,340
Listen, General, I have what might be something...

226
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,400
It'll just take them longer to die.

227
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,280
That's all.

228
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,460
Most people are going to think

229
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,760
they've got the plain old non-lethal flu

230
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,200
right up to the very end.

231
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,060
And that's the biggest break we've had so far.

232
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,000
Contact with townspeople was minimal.

233
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,060
That doesn't matter.

234
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,900
We've got to shut that town down,

235
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,360
lock it up, dig a moat around it.

236
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,520
That operation's already on the launching pad, sir.

237
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,520
What kind of cover did you come up with?

238
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,480
Anthrax.

239
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,540
New strain.

240
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,280
It's a new one, all right.

241
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,760
It's real new.

242
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,860
It's very good at its job, too.

243
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,920
I don't know, but the important thing is

244
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,960
right now we've got a shot at containing this.

245
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh, God, this stuff has a communicability

246
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,540
level of over 99%.

247
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,720
You understand what that means?

248
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,120
Any chance we have of containing it when...

249
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,700
But that was just a prelude to what was to come.

250
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,860
The time is now.

251
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,020
A nightmare is about to begin.

252
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:08,200
A nightmare is about to begin.

253
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,760
Central Banking

254
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,300
Mindfucking all the times

255
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,060
I am the fear

256
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,260
It's been a bad day

257
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,080
I am the fire

258
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,040
I am the fire

259
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,440
I am the fire

260
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:37,440


261
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,300
I am the furnace

262
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:45,240
I am the furnace

263
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,180
I am the biosejournalism

264
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,540
I am the fire

265
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,300
Four flags and bird dolls

266
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,220
Trapper stock, manufactured chance

267
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,180
Self-destructive normalization

268
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,180


269
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,180


270
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,180


271
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,180


272
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,240
Something's gone horribly wrong

273
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,160
Heart's trash is full and we are gone

274
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,360
Our population

275
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,640
Heart's trash is full and we are gone

276
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,540
Our population

277
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,940
In deep denial

278
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,500
Contagion release

279
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,480
Surrender

280
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,180
I am the fuel

281
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,560
The spirit of our rage

282
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,140
I am the fire

283
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,300
I am the virus

284
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,780
I am the virus

285
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,440
I am the furnace

286
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,900
By this I can handle

287
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,160
I am the virus

288
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,260
I am the virus

289
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,760
I am the virus

290
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,180
I am the virus

291
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:08,180


292
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,220
I am the fury

293
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,240
This pure, pure rage

294
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,100
I am the fire

295
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,700
I am the forest, I am the forest

296
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,120
No one believe

297
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,980
I am the fury

298
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,980
This pure, pure rage

299
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,980
I am the fire

300
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,660
I am the fire

301
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,440
I am the forest, I am the forest

302
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,100
I am the furnace

303
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,620
Where is everyone going?

304
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,880
I am the forest

305
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,400
I am the forest, I am the forest

306
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,920
I am the great face

307
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,880
I am the one you can never delete

308
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,940
I am the pain cause it never sleeps

309
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,400
I am the forest, I am the forest

310
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,620
I am the fury

311
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,060
This pure, pure rage

312
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,660
I am the fire

313
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,360
I am the forest, I am the forest

314
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,800
I am the fury

315
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,880
This pure, pure rage

316
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,520
I am the fire

317
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,380
I am the fire

318
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,240
I am the forest, I am the forest

319
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,880
I am the furnace

320
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,440
Where is everyone going?

321
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,480
I am the fire

322
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,520
I am the fire

323
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,100
I am the forest, I am the forest

324
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,940
Yeah, you know what?

325
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,500
Burn it down

326
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:05,500


327
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:05,500


328
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:05,940
Why not?

329
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,060
He's infected.

330
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,620
Viral infections.

331
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,900
Highly contagious.

332
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,640
I only hope there's no leak.

333
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,260
And suddenly things turned ugly.

334
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,060
I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.

335
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,240
We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong

336
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,980
in dark rooms glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials.

337
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,340
Well, I think...

338
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,100
NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.

339
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,160
I think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health care.

340
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:38,560
Yeah.

341
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,580
A new disease.

342
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,500
No one's immune.

343
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,200
It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic.

344
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,320
And instead of summer, it's all the time.

345
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,240
That is...

346
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,180
Now, I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.

347
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,900
He loves being that guy.

348
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,460
But, Janice, we do have standards.

349
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,320
This can't be a made-up disease.

350
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,280
The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.

351
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,040
We do have something.

352
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,080
Something we've been holding on to, but it hasn't been tested.

353
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,220
Get over here, NBC.

354
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,440
Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I...

355
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:13,680
Oh.

356
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:16,960
Wow.

357
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,020
Wow.

358
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,960
Oh, yeah.

359
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,980
So, we've got our deadly disease.

360
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,580
Now, we just have to blame it on something that's in every household.

361
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,560
Something that people are a little bit afraid of already.

362
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,860
Well, now, look here.

363
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,560
Thursday nights at 8 p.m.

364
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,020
America's favorite TV.

365
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,460
TV show.

366
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,300
There's a bat in my house.

367
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,500
Betty, Betty, Betty.

368
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,460
Starring America's favorite funny man.

369
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,380
The hilarious, zany B.B. Sanders as Betty Boy.

370
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,900
Oh, absolutely.

371
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,320
Ah, couldn't agree more.

372
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:50,980
Love it.

373
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,960
Love everything about it.

374
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,600
Excellent.

375
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,120
Betty, Betty, Betty.

376
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,720
It's all I need to do.

377
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,820
It's gone too fast.

378
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,140
So there you have it.

379
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,620
Story time.

380
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:12,960
Beautiful skills, I'm sure.

381
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,700
And I've gotten a bit of a shock here.

382
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,100
But remember.

383
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,320
Don't sleep.

384
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,300
We've had some bad days here in Black deal.

385
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,040
A bad day can be rain.

386
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:19,820

00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:24,520

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:32,520
All depends on def Mega Middle.

controversy affects remark swing.

392
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,960
There's that bit with Mike Merman.

393
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,560
Thank you.

394
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,880
Thank you.

395
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,060
Thank you.

396
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Thank you.

397
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,840
Thank you.

398
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:05,980
Thank you.

399
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,360
Thank you.

400
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:07,980
Thank you.

401
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,260
Thank you.

402
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,520
Thank you.

403
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,080
Thank you.

404
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,980
Thank you.

405
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,120
Thank you.

406
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,840
Thank you.

407
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,300
Thank you.

408
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:37,400
Thank you.

409
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,520
Thank you.

410
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,320
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah.

411
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,460
What condition my condition was in.

412
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,740
Someone painted a cocoon

413
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,940
In pink, black letters on my dick.

414
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:04,940


415
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:04,940


416
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:04,940


417
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:17,920
I had my foot on the gas as I left the road that blew out my mind.

418
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:27,480
Eight miles out of Memphis and I got no spring here.

419
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,580
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere.

420
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:41,600
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in.

421
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:53,360
I said I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in.

422
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,380
Yeah! Yeah!

423
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,980
Oh yeah!

424
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,580
Oh yeah!

425
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:04,780
Oh yeah!

426
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,300
Oh yeah!

427
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,300


428
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,300


429
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,480
H Shocker

430
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,700
And Civil Defense authorities state the situation is much the same across the entire country

431
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,200
Already, hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain

432
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,160
Ed Mueller

433
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,900
Wellek

434
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,500
I got bit.

435
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,200
Bit?

436
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,920
About what?

437
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,380
Well, if I told you, you probably wouldn't believe me.

438
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,620
I'm very polite, Matt Pyre.

439
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,900
With all this trouble, I won't eat a bat.

440
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,080
So that should answer how I got so fat.

441
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:56,500
I'm like Trump, the way he gets grouchy when he's corrected by Dr. Fauci.

442
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:03,020
Dr. Fauci said earlier this week that the lag in testing was in fact a failing.

443
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,060
Do you take responsibility for that?

444
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,180
Yeah, no, I don't take responsibility at all.

445
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,920
This is an outrage.

446
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,340
My life for him.

447
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,480
My life for him.

448
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,700
Well, how do you feel, Ms. Preskey?

449
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:26,320
The U.S. itself has overtaken China.

450
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,380
Now, as the country with the most cases of the virus, it is the new global epicenter.

451
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,760
Eighty five thousand nine hundred and ninety one confirmed cases in the United States.

452
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,640
And I think our economy will start to pick up very substantially as soon as the states get open.

453
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,140
And that's happening as we speak.

454
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,360
And it's actually very exciting.

455
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,720
People are just thrilled to see it.

456
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,380
Stay prepared.

457
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,180
We'll see you next time.

458
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:02,760
Like the scouts taught me one step ahead because they still haven't caught me.

459
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,720
Keep your hands to yourself and your money on the shelf.

460
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,340
It's a pandemic.

461
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,140
Stay sane in a world gone crazy.

462
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,060
We'll stand up to the challenge and we ain't lazy.

463
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:24,920
We'll do what we have to do to stand up to this pandemic.

464
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,120
The greatest generation is still around.

465
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,640
You can hear them every night if you listen for the sound.

466
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,000
If you can't, they'll squeeze off another round.

467
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,440
It's a pandemic.

468
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,820
It's a pandemic.

469
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,100
It's a pandemic.

470
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,340
They're stealing biochemical weapons, also known as Project Terror.

471
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,400
Designed to take out an entire populace in a controlled, landlocked area.

472
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,860
You're supplying it to them.

473
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,320
Ten stories down.

474
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,360
What about Connery with atropine and PAMP2?

475
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,240
Interferes with the neurotoxin delivery.

476
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,280
Sets off the cell blaster.

477
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,020
And you're gushing blood and pus through every sacred hole in your body.

478
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,280
Hepatizing.

479
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,840
Like a drug.

480
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:18,840
Correct.

481
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,720
But we found that a small percentage of people are not affected.

482
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,800
And within this small percentage,

483
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,080
Isaac, you're...

484
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,300
But we have to get back to my lab.

485
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,720
This infection will spread all over the world to every man, woman, and child.

486
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:39,900
All of the sickness of the world and its people are here in one motion picture for you to witness.

487
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,000
Yes, it's a sick, sick, sick world.

488
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,480
Follow this motion picture and its unbelievable cast

489
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,000
as the camera takes you through a maze of unforgettable sights.

490
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,960
Sights that you will never, never forget.

491
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:55,700
I'm sure you'll remember.

492
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,200
History teaches us that, uh, when the Great Plague hits,

493
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,320
those who don't die alone usually die in church.

494
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,820
So, we may find nothing in this one, but if we do,

495
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,000
try to think of the bodies as cordwood.

496
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,400
Make it easier.

497
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:08,840
Cordwood?

498
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,020
AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH

499
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,960
We are dead.

500
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,920
And this is...

501
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:20,980
Hell.

502
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,020
AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH

503
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,500
Hahahaha!

504
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:23,880


505
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,300
Come on down and meet your maker.

506
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,940
Come on down and make the stand.

507
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,940
Come on down.

508
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,740
Come on down.

509
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,660
Come on down.

510
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,700
And move it!

511
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,500
And stand!

512
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

513
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:48,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

514
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

515
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

516
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

517
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,240
Oh, come on down and meet your maker.

518
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,860
Come on down and make the stand.

519
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,920
Come on down.

520
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,700
Come on down.

521
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,680
Come on down.

522
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,700
We'll make the stand.

523
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,240
AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH

524
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
Bring out your dead!

525
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,920
The monster's coming!

526
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:21,920
He's coming!

527
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,000
Bring out your dead!

528
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,800
We're damned.

529
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,640
Yes.

530
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,580
I know.

531
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,300
Ugh, turn on the radio will ya?

532
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,360
Hello there.

533
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,380
I guess this morning there's only one topic of conversation.

534
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:52,820
You can call it the Super Flu or by its West Coast name, Captain Trips, but it means the same thing either way.

535
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,000
There have been some horror stories about the Army clamping down on everything.

536
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,160
The Army?

537
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,000
Just be patient with me.

538
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,460
Remember, I'm running the show all by myself.

539
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,100
Everyone else called in sick.

540
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,340
The numbers are the same as always, though.

541
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,880
555-TALK and 555-CHAT.

542
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,040
So let's go.

543
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,540
Hello there, this is Ray Flowers, and it's time to speak your piece.

544
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,300
I'm calling from Portsmouth.

545
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,400
What's your name?

546
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:16,960
Leonora.

547
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,160
Listen, Ray, I just want everyone to know that there are soldiers burning bodies

548
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,820
across the state line in Kittery.

549
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,260
Also, my little girl died this morning.

550
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,260
I guess she's with Jesus now.

551
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,420
I'm sorry as hell, Leonora.

552
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,480
Ray, I think the soldiers did it.

553
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,440
I think they made a bug that's like killing people.

554
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,760
That wouldn't be very American now, would it?

555
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,300
No, I guess not.

556
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,840
Of course, that's never stopped the real patriots among us, has it?

557
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,440
You try to hang in there, Leonora.

558
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,500
I'm trying, Ray.

559
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,420
But have you ever smelled bodies on fire?

560
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,060
I can't say that I have.

561
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,380
It's awful, Ray.

562
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,560
It's just...

563
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,720
You just try to hang in there, hon.

564
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,060
You're on the air, and it's time to speak your piece.

565
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,200
First of all, I just want to tell you that I love your show, Ray.

566
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,580
You say you saw these G.I.s gunning down unarmed civilians?

567
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,420
Open in the name of the United States government!

568
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,140
Open!

569
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,140


570
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,140


571
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,140


572
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,140


573
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,140


574
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,140


575
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,140


576
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,140


577
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,140


578
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,140


579
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:21,700
I'll tell you what, Portland.

580
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,080
It looks like the Marines have landed, and they don't look too happy.

581
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,180
This is a joke, right?

582
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,620
I mean, this has got to be a joke.

583
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,040
I don't think so, Franny.

584
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,360
I really don't think so.

585
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:30,960
Hi there.

586
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,560
You're on the air.

587
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,060
Ray, you all right?

588
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,960
Well, to tell you the truth, honey, it doesn't look real good for the kid right now.

589
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,700
Several soldiers have just broken into the studio.

590
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,000
They're fully armed, and they're dressed in some kind of protective clothing.

591
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,460
They're wearing respirators on their faces.

592
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,020
Shut it down!

593
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,960
Hey, Bluto!

594
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,800
You ever heard of a little number called...

595
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,540
Freedom of speech?

596
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,660
Bill of Rights?

597
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,000
Any of that ring a bell?

598
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,960
Folks, I've just been ordered by my uninvited fascist guest to shut down, and I've refused.

599
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,220
All right, get them up!

600
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,300
Oh, my God!

601
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,200
What's happening?

602
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,720
I don't know, honey.

603
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
I don't know.

604
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,900
He's closer now!

605
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,140
The hard case!

606
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,580
The dark man!

607
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,940
He's coming!

608
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,400
He's closer now!

609
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:20,780
The dark man!

610
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:20,780


611
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:20,780


612
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,320
The dark man!

613
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,060
Whether a state of war between China and Russia still exists is not important any longer.

614
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,200
Our fellow countrymen are dying.

615
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,760
Naturally, we'll have more on this story as soon as it develops.

616
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,000
We now return you to the president's address already in progress.

617
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,600
Winning!

618
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,100
Winning!

619
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:35,620
Winning!

620
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,760
You are going to get so sick of winning!

621
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,500
USA!

622
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,480
USA!

623
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:40,960
USA!

624
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:41,840
USA!

625
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,660
It's my life for you!

626
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,740
Yeah, there were a couple times when I didn't think you were buying it.

627
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,180
But this was an emergency.

628
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,180
This is a class one emergency.

629
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,020
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.

630
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,160
Stay in your homes.

631
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,340
Stay in your homes.

632
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,360
Those found without specific military orders are subject to summary execution.

633
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,660
Stay in your homes.

634
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,060
Repeat, Conrad Channel.

635
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,740
This is a class one emergency.

636
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,500
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.

637
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,920
Please remain calm.

638
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,500
Stay in your homes.

639
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,480
I am officially declaring a national emergency.

640
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,880
Two very big words.

641
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,260
It will go away.

642
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,100
Just stay calm.

643
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:18,980
It will go away.

644
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,200
And it will go away.

645
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,540
And we're going to have a great victory.

646
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,620
It's going to go away.

647
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,980
Hopefully at the end of the month.

648
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,260
And if not, hopefully we'll be soon after that.

649
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,880
He says a coronavirus is a hoax.

650
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,080
The fact is the president himself is a hoax.

651
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,720
The White House has done a con.

652
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,380
She scoffs at holiness!

653
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,780
Punish her!

654
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,000
Punish her!

655
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,520
Punish her!

656
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,120
Punish her!

657
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,740
I am an epidemiologist with the Pacific Health Services.

658
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,760
And I'm telling you, you are going to listen.

659
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,880
Now, if you would like to call a private physician, you can.

660
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,140
You're damn right I can.

661
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,400
I can walk right out of here, too.

662
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,580
Oh, no, you can't.

663
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,060
This is an infectious disease, sir.

664
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,800
And if you do not cooperate, I have the authority to detain you here for public safety.

665
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,640
Shall I call security?

666
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,620
No.

667
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,500
Did you start him on tetracycline?

668
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,460
You won't take it.

669
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,180
This is a very serious disease.

670
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,660
Now, you can either take this medicine and hopefully not get sick,

671
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,740
or you can just sit here and wait to see what happens.

672
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,280
No.

673
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,440
No cure.

674
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,780
That is not until we find somebody from the other side and we'll install a batch as it is.

675
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,960
Science comes first, but business comes first.

676
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,120
Then you realized if you could infect a large enough populace,

677
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,460
experiment on its survivors,

678
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,660
you'd find a cure.

679
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,280
I swore to my men that I'd do everything in my power to keep them alive.

680
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,840
That's what I intend to do, Ray.

681
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,140
Understand?

682
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,020
I never had a choice.

683
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,380
You're wise, sir.

684
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,340
It's real pretty.

685
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,780
Vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, kidney failure.

686
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,400
And you have complete circulatory collapse.

687
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,600
Your blood pressure plummets.

688
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,700
Body goes into shock.

689
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,560
Within 24 hours without medical treatment, you are dead.

690
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,400
You're dead, you're dead, you're dead, you're dead.

691
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,700
And out of this world.

692
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,920
You'll never get a second chance.

693
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,560
Plan all your moves in advance.

694
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:34,380
Stay dead, stay dead, stay dead, stay dead and out of this world.

695
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,400
Run fast, don't stand in the fire.

696
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,160
There's too much work to be done.

697
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,380
You're down, you're down, you're down, you're down.

698
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,960
Down and out of this world.

699
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,260
Yeah, sure.

700
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,300
Yeah, sure.

701
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,200
Don't ever talk with your eyes.

702
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,560
Make sure that you compromise.

703
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,420
You're dead, you're dead, you're dead, you're dead.

704
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,860
dead and out of this world

705
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,720
hear the unloved

706
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,000
weeping like rain

707
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,740
guard your sleep from the sound of their pain

708
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,300
long gone

709
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,220
long gone

710
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,180
long gone

711
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,060
long gone

712
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,380
and out of this world

713
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,860
when you smile and it tears your face

714
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,760
it's time for the inhuman race

715
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,160
you're down, you're down, you're down

716
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,480
you're down and out of this world

717
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,720
now I hope the compassion is gone

718
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,520
you've sold out your dream to the world

719
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,660
stay dead, stay dead, stay dead

720
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,140
you're dead and out of this world

721
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,400
music

722
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:11,980
music

723
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,520
music

724
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:14,860
music

725
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,160
music

726
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,840
music

727
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,560
streets and highways are packed with

728
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,320
frantic people trying to protect their family

729
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,540
or apparently to flee just anywhere

730
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,820
I repeat, the safest course

731
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,880
of action at this time is simply to stay

732
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,680
where you are

733
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,800
and civil defense authorities state that the

734
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,620
situation is much the same across the entire

735
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,280
country. Martial law

736
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,700
is now nationwide

737
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,540
major cities in all parts of the country

738
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,440
New York, Los Angeles report

739
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,540
plague victims falling dead in the streets

740
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,520
in their homes, at their work

741
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,180
the first symptom appears to be severe choking

742
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,420
followed by immediate unconsciousness

743
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,260
death occurs within minutes

744
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,600
whether a state of war between China and Russia still exists

745
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,340
is not important any longer

746
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,440
our fellow countrymen are dying

747
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,780
the very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble

748
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,720
under the dread assault of that horror long feared germ warfare

749
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,020
foot of your hand, I'll let you know God is really sneaky

750
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,720
you're the only one who wasn't afraid to come here today

751
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,860
I'm a scientist

752
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,580
and a businessman

753
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,920
not military

754
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,860
you haven't had to do it

755
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,160
but we have to get back to my lab

756
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:26,920
sir

757
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,160
sir

758
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,820
my god

759
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,300
this man is dying

760
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,580
someone get a doctor

761
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,620
nooo

762
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,520
I don't suppose there are any other biochemical engineers around?

763
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,400
no

764
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,980
no

765
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:43,580
no?

766
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,840
yeah me neither

767
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,720
what's gonna happen Dr. Grissom?

768
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:51,520
is everybody in the world gonna die before someone finds the answer?

769
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,080
no

770
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,500
I don't think so

771
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,060
we'll find an answer

772
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,200
when doctor? we need it right now, I need it

773
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,040
I don't deny there's some strange evolutionary process going on

774
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,140
but mankind won't be destroyed

775
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,060
unless

776
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,520
unless, unless what?

777
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,700
I don't know

778
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,960
you're a smart guy, you'll figure something out

779
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,120
those cells are still living off one another

780
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,020
there has to be an answer

781
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,800
you heard that all communications are ended outside the continental limits?

782
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,840
yes I heard

783
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,520
that leaves it in our laps

784
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,020
so we keep trying

785
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,640
you two stay on this virus theory until I decide it's exhausting

786
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,480
right

787
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,760
and until further notice this station will continue its around the clock coverage of this national disaster

788
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,840
and now

789
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,280
we switch you to the state capital

790
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,960
where the governor is speaking from the executive mansion

791
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,680
the federal government declared this state to be a disaster area

792
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,220
public health is dependent on bodies of the deceased being burned

793
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,760
you must notify the health department immediately

794
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,740
have a plague victim in your home

795
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,180
under no circumstances should you gather public

796
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,280
if you're the dire emergency that exists, I intend to

797
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,740
what's the matter with you?

798
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,180
nothing and I'm going to keep it that way

799
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,580
look let's talk about this

800
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,120
there's nothing to talk about

801
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,540
you think I'm out of my mind

802
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,140
you might be one of them

803
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,960
look you're ill, you ought to see a doctor

804
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,780
no doctors

805
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,940
you take care of your life, I'll take care of mine

806
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,180
now get away from here

807
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,920
you understand? get away from here!

808
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,740
I'm going to confine you all to the station

809
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,440
being quarantined isn't that bad is it?

810
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,400
lonely

811
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,900
so very lonely

812
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,560
so very very very lonely

813
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:47,960
why must I stay in this lonely room

814
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:55,020
watching the gong show and thinking of you

815
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:02,520
loneliest chair, loneliest bed, loneliest deja vu

816
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:08,020
in the loneliest, loneliest, loneliest, loneliest room

817
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,500
in the world

818
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:23,460
I tried marijuana, cocaine and heroin

819
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:28,120
but they just can't seem to get the thought of you

820
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,140
out from under my skin

821
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:38,020
I'm lonelier now, lonelier than I've ever been

822
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:43,840
in the loneliest, loneliest, loneliest, loneliest room

823
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,500
in the world

824
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,440
phone never rings

825
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,880
postman never brings the thing

826
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,760
even the singles clubs won't give me a whirl

827
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,620
plants all dead, even my cactus

828
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,080
beer cans round my bed

829
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,620
in the loneliest room in the world

830
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,480
I'm lonely

831
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:17,480


832
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:17,480


833
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:17,480


834
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:17,480


835
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:17,480


836
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:17,480


837
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,100
it's point blank.

838
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,780
hang out with me

839
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,140
let's meet and cozy our one and only

840
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:46,440
are we and who are we going to be

841
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,200
don't put me in push-ups

842
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:47,480
this is the center of the earth

843
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,800
Room in the world

844
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,600
I'm not sorry for myself

845
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,420
I'm sorry for that

846
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,820
Miss Wright who can't find me

847
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,280
Miss Wright

848
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,880
I'm thinking of you tonight

849
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,360
In your lonely room

850
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,240
The single stuff won't even answer your phone

851
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,900
You got the blues

852
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,420
The lowdown singles, club blues

853
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,700
In your lonely room

854
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,680
Your room might even be lonely

855
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,080
But I doubt it baby

856
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,960
It's lonely

857
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,140
Lonely

858
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,940
And as soon as they bring back pork rinds and Monday night football

859
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,480
I'm gonna be in redneck heaven

860
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,600
Stay sane

861
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,640
In a world gone crazy

862
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,880
We'll stand up to the challenge

863
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,640
And we ain't lazy

864
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,360
We'll do what we have to do

865
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,840
To stand up to

866
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,400
This pandemic

867
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,980
The greatest generation

868
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,720
Is still around

869
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,380
You can hear them every night

870
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,160
If you listen for the sound

871
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,080
If you can't

872
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,620
They'll squeeze off another round

873
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,940
It's a pandemic

874
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,320
With our gloves on

875
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,840
We reach our hands to heaven

876
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,980
Wearing masks

877
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,540
Like we're robbing a 7-Eleven

878
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,440
We keep our distance

879
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,860
To secure our home

880
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:45,860


881
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,340
Our existence

882
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:47,660
It's a pandemic

883
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,240
It crept upon us like a thief in the night

884
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,380
But we got what it takes

885
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,500
To win this fight

886
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,700
We'll do what we can

887
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,680
And we'll do what's right

888
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,220
In this pandemic

889
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,680
Sacrifices are the price we pay

890
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,200
For another chance

891
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,380
To live another day

892
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:15,840
To live another day

893
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,300
Stay together

894
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,100
But stay six feet away

895
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,680
It's a pandemic

896
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,000
Another question being asked forcibly

897
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,900
Is whether now is the right time

898
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,300
To reopen the US economy

899
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,060
In Georgia today

900
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,220
Hairdressers, nail salons, tattoo parlors

901
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,880
Were able to resume business

902
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,740
Even though coronavirus

903
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,620
Is still a serious problem in the state

904
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,100
Now we're opening it up

905
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,820
And it's opening up far faster than ever

906
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,260
Than anybody thought even possible

907
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,640
And there now

908
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,760
It's a life

909
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,700
It's got a life

910
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,260
And we're putting out that life

911
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,280
Because that's a bad life

912
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,260
That we're talking about

913
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,780
Yeah, well just don't forget

914
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,120
What you promised when you get back

915
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,640
Dinner, dancing

916
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,800
And all the paparazzi

917
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,940
I can smile at

918
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,680
Yeah, yeah, you got it

919
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,120
Be ready in five minutes

920
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,180
You bring the towels

921
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,120
I get the penicillin

922
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,500
Sick world

923
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,640
Is the story of vice

924
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,040
Perversion

925
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:15,420
Degradation

926
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:15,800
Degradation

927
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,180
That has infested the earth

928
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,460
Since the time that Adam and Eve

929
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,440
Sinned in the garden of paradise

930
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,640
This is the shocking story

931
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,540
Of the world and its unholy inhabitants

932
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,140
Feeling no pain or shame

933
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,680
For the life that they lead

934
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,700
Well, looks like things are finally

935
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,040
Going to get back to normal

936
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,700
I think we learned a lesson here

937
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,460
What's that?

938
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,480
I don't know

939
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,460
The unquenched desires of sex

940
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,300
And the sensualists

941
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,600
In their search for pleasures

942
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,320
Are unparalleled in this motion picture

943
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,360
For a ringside seat

944
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,980
That takes you into the lust-filled caverns of life

945
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:08,880
See, it's a sick, sick, sick world

946
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,800
This motion picture has something for everyone

947
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,460
This is a picture you must not miss

948
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,680
A picture you will always remember

949
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:30,000
It's a sick, sick, sick world

950
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,040
And it's waiting for you

951
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:39,080
This event will force us to totally restructure our intelligence system

952
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:45,800
The Atlanta Disease Control Center told me that these masks wouldn't stop the virus from spreading

953
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,980
And that they would stop a flu germ with a hangover

954
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,400
Oh, no, no, no

955
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,480
Shake hands, kids

956
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,040
You old dog

957
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,360
How's that golf games?

958
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,500
That's nice

959
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,960
I think that at some point

960
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,860
That's going to sort of just disappear, I hope

961
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,820
You still believe so?

962
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:03,960
I do, yeah, sure

963
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,780
In the thick of this crisis

964
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,600
The president travels to South Dakota

965
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,620
July 5th

966
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,940
For an X-Day celebration at Mount Rushmore

967
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,060
There won't be any social distancing

968
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,640
And mask wearing will be up to the attendee

969
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,260
You're going to get so sick, sick, sick

970
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,120
Please go and get tested

971
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,500
Please wear a mask

972
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,380
I'm not listening to some loser public health doctor

973
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,000
They destroyed the world

974
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,640
Isn't that the

975
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,100
We'll find an answer

976
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:32,900
When, doctor?

977
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:33,580
Tonight

978
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,640
Is a special night

979
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,320
What's so special about tonight?

980
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,380
Let's see, what date is it?

981
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:41,740
What's the date?

982
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,080
July 5th

983
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,120
We're in luck

984
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,220
It says here

985
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:45,800
The planet Earth

986
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,880
The planet is going to be hit by a huge asteroid

987
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,100
And blown to smithereens on this very day

988
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,500
Hmm?

989
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,500
What date is July?

990
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,560
What the hell it is?

991
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,080
It's Sunday

992
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,720
Sunday I always dress for dinner

993
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,060
Well, you turned something on

994
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,100
I'm starting to think

995
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,300
The plague took the people

996
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,940
But it couldn't take the gadgets, could it?

997
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,100
No, they're all still out there

998
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,940
Just waiting for someone to come along and pick them up

999
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,380
Everything from electric can openers to cobalt bombs

1000
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,660
And he'll depow it to him, brother

1001
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:14,740
Just a little nitro

1002
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,800
I don't know

1003
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,920
I can get the cannons out of the old God Armory

1004
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,800
We can hand it out of there in no time

1005
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,660
I said no

1006
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,340
We could

1007
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,700
But then the curse would begin all over again, don't you see?

1008
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,520
Here is evil

1009
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:28,560
Evil

1010
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:29,800
Evil

1011
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:31,480
Unless

1012
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,740
What's wrong with this picture?

1013
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,140
It's the old way

1014
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,620
And the old way was a death crypt

1015
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,420
We say fine

1016
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,560
And then we go right back to tinkering with the power

1017
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:45,820
station

1018
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:49,740
Trying to recreate the world that damn near choked the human race to death

1019
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,540
And the scavenger hunt starts today

1020
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,040
Big day today

1021
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,240
Should've thrown a party

1022
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:02,460
All he needs is one guy to target some scut missile with an A-bomb on it

1023
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,480
Meanwhile

1024
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,800
I'm free

1025
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,060
Woo

1026
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,680
Bombed him

1027
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,840
Bombed him

1028
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,540
Bombed him

1029
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:15,540


1030
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,260
And he's dead

1031
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:16,760
FALL

1032
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,420
You loved me and gave me a tongue

1033
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:25,260
Learn me, please, please, my baby tongue

1034
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:28,400
Call me a Christian and call me a Jew

1035
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,160
My life for you

1036
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,600
My life for you

1037
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,120
Surprise

1038
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,380
A big loud one

1039
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:44,020
It's time to make your stand

1040
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,460
Come on

1041
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,140
Time

1042
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:46,140


1043
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:46,560
Come on

1044
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:46,800
Time

1045
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,540
Come on

1046
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:47,820
Time

1047
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:48,140
Come on

1048
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,740
Time

1049
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,720
Time

1050
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:51,800
Oh

1051
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,000
The child

1052
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,480
Has just begun

1053
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,520
I songs

1054
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:15,520


1055
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:15,520


1056
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:15,520


1057
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,180
wn

1058
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:20,460
The song must now be sung

1059
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,880
For the world

1060
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,320
Has now been spoken

1061
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:35,980
The chance has just begun

1062
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:40,360
On the wheels, on the wheels, on the wheels

1063
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,940
On the wheels, on the wheels, on the wheels

1064
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,500
Segway to the present

1065
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,080
Morning

1066
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,380
July 5th

1067
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,200
South Dakota

1068
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,080
Mind you, it's now 5am

1069
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,380
At the roadway inn

1070
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,840
The most disgusting hellhole on earth

1071
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,220
For the room adjacent to it

1072
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,060
Smelled like pee

1073
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,660
And it was nasty

1074
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,420
I didn't realize how thin these walls were

1075
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,760
We heard people fighting in the other room

1076
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,660
It's all slipping through your fingers

1077
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:10,880
Everything you've made here is falling apart

1078
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,060
Your time will end

1079
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:14,460
Yes

1080
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,020
And I'll be watching from hell with your baby in my arms

1081
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:18,780
Shut up!

1082
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,480
It's daddy, stupid!

1083
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,500
Where's my book?

1084
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,100
Good evening, sir

1085
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,420
Actually, I was only kidding

1086
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:25,140
Everything alright?

1087
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,460
The crisis, uh, is being handled

1088
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,920
Like a child, put his hands over his ears

1089
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,360
Now get the hell out of here!

1090
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,620
Is that all it has been?

1091
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,540
Only three years

1092
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,780
Seems like a hundred million

1093
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,320
Uh, so why'd you get me out of here?

1094
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,300
Me and some of the others are cutting you

1095
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:44,620
Cut loose?

1096
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,800
Cut loose where?

1097
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,100
South America

1098
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,500
It's nice

1099
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,880
Fresh water, fresh fruit

1100
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,900
And just plain folks

1101
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,460
Once you want to forget they ever hooked up with

1102
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,660
His infernal majesty

1103
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,400
So what do you say?

1104
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,260
I'm sticking

1105
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:00,740
Why?

1106
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,560
It's going bad here, can't you feel it?

1107
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,020
Maybe

1108
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,140
But it changed me, you know?

1109
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,080
Man, you're nuts

1110
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,260
You're probably right

1111
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,280
The time is seven

1112
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,060
Yay!

1113
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,380
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1114
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,720
The President's next day celebration at Mount Rushmore

1115
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,720
Ladies and gentlemen

1116
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,060
The President of the United States

1117
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,000
Very importantly

1118
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,500
Very important

1119
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:29,960
And

1120
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,980
This kind of, uh, an event

1121
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,240
He's been sick

1122
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:42,180
I think his wife is gonna bring him some chicken soup

1123
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:43,280
Thank you!

1124
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,480
Oh, sir

1125
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,600
Sir

1126
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,200
This man is dying

1127
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,540
Someone got a doctor

1128
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,280
Suddenly

1129
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,020
Now what?

1130
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,100
It's fading away

1131
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,400
It's going to fade away

1132
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,500
Apparently the joke's on you

1133
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,400
What?

1134
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,960
In just a few moments

1135
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,920
Your entire planet is going to be destroyed

1136
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,720
Oh!

1137
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,820
We tried to warn you, Magnifico

1138
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,700
But you would have none of it

1139
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,060
You know it is going away

1140
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,160
Wait a minute

1141
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,920
Wait just one day

1142
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,400
Damn it!

1143
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:14,480


1144
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,700
Oh, my God, no!

1145
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,640
No!

1146
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:19,400
No!

1147
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,140
No!

1148
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:26,200
Come, come, nuclear bomb

1149
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:35,580
Every day is like Sunday

1150
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:43,120
Every day is silent, time gray

1151
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,620
Like your face

1152
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:51,580
Drudging back over pebbles and sand

1153
00:57:53,940 --> 00:58:00,240
And the strange dust lands on your hands

1154
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,440
And on your face

1155
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,240
On your face

1156
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,600
On your face

1157
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:12,660
On your face

1158
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,800
On your face

1159
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:26,160
Every day is like Sunday

1160
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:34,720
Win yourself a cheap tray

1161
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:42,380
Share some grease to you with me

1162
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,280
Every day is Sunday

1163
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:59,620
Every day is like Sunday

1164
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:07,980
Every day is like Sunday

1165
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,480
I couldn't help it!

1166
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,420
I couldn't help it!

1167
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,340
I'm so sorry!

1168
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,440
I'm so sorry!

1169
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:23,760
Did you see that?

1170
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,060
Yeah, he blowed up.

1171
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:25,800
Blowed up good.

1172
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,840
Blowed up real good.

1173
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,080
It is finished.

1174
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,360
White magic.

1175
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,980
That's all that's left.

1176
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:40,060
The flu.

1177
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,980
Who says it's gone?

1178
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,040
Who knows if our babies

1179
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:44,480
are going to be fine?

1180
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:44,740
Are you going to be immune?

1181
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,440
Okay!

1182
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,120
Is anyone here not a downer?

1183
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,380
I thought you were going to be fine.

1184
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,320
Why this is important.

1185
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,880
In the event of a nuclear attack,

1186
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,140
there will be a three-minute warning,

1187
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,480
but everything will work out

1188
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,660
because if at the moment

1189
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:00,460
that warning sounds,

1190
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,700
you can take enough acid,

1191
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:03,520
that three minutes will last

1192
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,080
for about 60,000 years.

1193
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,360
The white light of the explosion

1194
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,520
will creep towards you

1195
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,020
very gradually over the centuries

1196
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:11,960
like an ice sheet.

1197
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,320
The missiles will hang

1198
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,480
in the sky like the moon.

1199
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:17,900
Over the years,

1200
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,060
a white hot bus

1201
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,520
will gradually inch its way

1202
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,140
through the front of your conservatory.

1203
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,340
Your dead neighbour

1204
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,420
strapped to the front

1205
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,020
like Garfield on a bin lorry.

1206
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:32,880
Many of your later years

1207
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,820
will be spent at quite a high altitude,

1208
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,340
watching your body gradually disassemble.

1209
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,880
When your organs start to leave,

1210
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,820
you will have time to wish them goodbye.

1211
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,300
You will say farewell to them,

1212
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:44,400
and they will say goodbye.

1213
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:44,820
You will say goodbye to your penis

1214
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,120
like a firstborn son

1215
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,320
who's going off to university.

1216
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,320
You'll wonder if there's a tear in your eye,

1217
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,300
but it will just be the fact

1218
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,480
that your actual eye is boiling.

1219
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,440
As you finally die,

1220
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,980
your consciousness will touch that of Buddha.

1221
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,400
Someone will finally have understood you.

1222
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,280
Buddha will have understood you,

1223
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,820
and he will thank you for teaching him

1224
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,520
the meaning of contempt.

1225
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,700
Slicking out a long, frog-like tongue,

1226
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,740
he will consume you,

1227
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,160
and a sign will appear in the sky that reads,

1228
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,540
You have mastered 2% of this adventure.

1229
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:21,680
Oh, Jesus!

1230
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,480
When are you going to cut me some slack, huh?

1231
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,340
Probably never.

1232
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,560
Hell, I'm still waiting.

1233
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,300
Oh, thank you, Frankie Boyle,

1234
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:34,080
for your invaluable insights.

1235
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,820
And we heard a lot of music tonight, Seekers.

1236
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,900
Peppered throughout were cuts from

1237
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,660
The Stand by The Alarm,

1238
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,680
Killing Jokes, I Am the Vine,

1239
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:44,140
and The Virus.

1240
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,880
That Bat Macumba was by The Tater Tots.

1241
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:50,000
Rude Boy Slim was pissing and moaning

1242
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,100
about being stuck in the loneliest room in the world.

1243
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,140
Norm Macdonald popped in with his bat song.

1244
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,640
Pandemic was by Telekill,

1245
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,720
with vocals by Papa Pang.

1246
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,600
You're Dead was by Norma DeNega.

1247
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,960
And Every Day is Like Sunday?

1248
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,940
That was by The Pretenders.

1249
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,800
Uh-oh.

1250
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,020
The ol' Bimbo Breath ain't pretending.

1251
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,240
And she is out.

1252
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:17,620
Looks to be having some crazy dreams tonight.

1253
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,260
Oh, maybe she's having her own X-Day in there after all.

1254
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:26,420
I oughta help her along with a little refresher.

1255
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,940
Especially if something goes wrong this year.

1256
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,560
Mercy beating.

1257
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:46,520
And try to have a happy X-Day yourself, Seeker.

1258
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,600
Wherever you're holed up.

1259
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,940
Oh, and if it doesn't happen this year,

1260
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:55,340
you can't sue the church.

1261
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,080
We signed that waiver to Dobbs.

1262
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:02,700
Goodnight.

1263
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,640
Thank you, Susie the Floozy and WREK.

1264
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:25,640
