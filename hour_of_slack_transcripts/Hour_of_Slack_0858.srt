1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Something familiar, something peculiar, something for everyone, a comedy tonight.

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:17,340
Something appealing, something appalling, something for everyone, a comedy tonight.

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:27,300
Nothing with kings, nothing with crowns, bring down the lovers, liars and clowns.

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,740
Old situations, new complications, nothing portentous or polite.

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,260
Tragedy tomorrow, comedy tonight.

6
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:52,320
Something convulsive, something repulsive, something for everyone, a comedy tonight.

7
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,040
Something aesthetic, something frenetic.

8
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,980
Something for everyone, a comedy tonight.

9
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,700
Nothing with gods, nothing with fate.

10
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,180
Weighty affairs will just have to wait.

11
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,920
Nothing that's formal, nothing that's normal.

12
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,800
No recitations to recite.

13
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,580
Open up the curtains!

14
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,460
Comedy Tonight!

15
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,640
The Power of Slack!

16
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:54,440
The Power of Slack!

17
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:04,220
The Hour of Slack.

18
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,520
And you obeyed.

19
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,080
Yes, I did.

20
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,880
So the pastor just prayed for me.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
And I came this morning.

22
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,040
And I feel in my body that God has delivered me.

23
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,260
And he does.

24
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,320
Somebody praise the Lord.

25
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,420
What did the Lord do for you today, honey?

26
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,160
The package is bent and dark yet.

27
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,520
I'm going to go back to the house of the Lord once again with me and my son.

28
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,760
My mother's with me.

29
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,720
And I feel that God has touched me.

30
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,440
You believe God didn't touch you?

31
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,340
He has touched me.

32
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,740
Somebody give the Lord a hand clap.

33
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,540
Someone give the Lord the clap.

34
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,040
And we'll all sing.

35
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,320
This happy song.

36
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,780
I'm oozing.

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,960
I'm oozing.

38
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,020
I'm oozing.

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,020
Yes, our Lord and Master Blaster, Jesus H. Christ, was not only a man of the cloth.

40
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,240
He was a man of the silk panties.

41
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,680
He used to walk this way and that up and down the Palestinian River,

42
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,120
but looking for beautiful young women.

43
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,820
What did he find among the rocks there?

44
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,100
He found nothing but desolation.

45
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,780
He found an estrogen.

46
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,280
He found rivers of estrogen and piles of pus.

47
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:44,160
But let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.

48
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,440
It's a squirting universe, friends, and that's why we have to call for your help on the great new tabernacle.

49
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,360
We've only been in there a month, but it's going back into the hands of the conspiracy.

50
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,000
They're going to turn it in.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,100
And what a hell spa.

52
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:07,580
Because the law says, the law says a subgenius can't achieve cytospasm with whatever it wants.

53
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,040
That's what the law says.

54
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:15,440
No subgenius can do anything it wants, and they call this a free land.

55
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,120
Oh, my friend, I've heard people call the church of the subgenius a joke,

56
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,780
but I have to wonder, is the subgenius church a joke or is this world?

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,440
A joke.

58
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,120
Bob Dobbs owns deed and title to the church.

59
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,080
But who owns deed and title to the world?

60
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,700
Not Bob yet.

61
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,160
I'm afraid not.

62
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,060
The conspiracy owns this world.

63
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,020
Let there be slack, my friend.

64
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,540
I'm afraid not.

65
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,300
We've got an apartment complex here at the apartment complex.

66
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,700
I've got an apartment complex here at the apartment complex.

67
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,200
Now.

68
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,640
Now.

69
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,680
Creechette, competent, level or lighting apartment life couldn't be more exciting.

70
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,140
Loving room and clubhouse, too.

71
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,760
I don't have a worry till the break comes, too.

72
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,360
Watching Sooner Bitter Max night after night.

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,840
It's a...

74
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,660
Tied away to suburban delights

75
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,600
Hey, hey

76
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,040
I've got an apartment complex

77
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,780
Here at the apartment complex

78
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,500
I've got an apartment complex

79
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,140
Here at the apartment complex

80
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,480
Oh

81
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:18,760
Oh, I know you like to live at the complex

82
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,400
I mean, I tell you that it's so easy

83
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,380
To sit upon the line for such a good reason

84
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,760
You can make it here on the minimum wage

85
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,260
My friends come over and they think it's so fine

86
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,040
Well, they don't know that none of it is mine

87
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,260
Real furniture and color TV

88
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,020
None of my belongings belong to me

89
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,720
For it's life of luxury and credit costs a thing

90
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,500
Cause I always assume that I'll make to the bank

91
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,940
Hey, hey

92
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,440
I've got an apartment complex

93
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,080
Here at the apartment complex

94
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,860
I've got an apartment complex

95
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,360
I've got an apartment complex

96
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,360


97
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,360


98
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,420
Here at the apartment complex

99
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,300
I've got an apartment complex

100
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,880
Here at the apartment complex

101
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,560
I've got an apartment complex

102
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,240
Here at the apartment complex

103
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,700
Oh

104
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,060
The...

105
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,220
Pink Boys!

106
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,320
Dear friends, the big boys from 1980.

107
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,640
Can you believe it?

108
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,980
Dr. X on vocals and Tim Crane on guitar.

109
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,680
Before that, the minute of slack, number 19,

110
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,440
and some ESO swamp radio from beautiful WCSB,

111
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,620
Cleveland, Cleveland State University,

112
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,780
with Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Day.

113
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:28,260
A special guest, princess, we are the dome.

114
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,780
And yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

115
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,800
Now, coming up, friends, we've got a sing-along with Onan Canovite,

116
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:42,000
plus many collages by Fernanda Limer.

117
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,780
In fact, all of the cut-ups on tonight's hour of slack, number 858,

118
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,920
are by Limer,

119
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,620
except for one great big one.

120
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,780
Near the end, it's about alien invaders.

121
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,060
And speaking of alien invaders,

122
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:05,160
check out this news item that was not covered very much on the mainstream media.

123
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:12,320
A federal rectal exam list intended to keep terrorists

124
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,540
from smuggling drugs and explosives aboard planes

125
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,980
is snaring innocent people at most U.S. airports,

126
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,160
triggering complaints that civil liberties

127
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,760
are being violated.

128
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:33,460
And while several federal agencies acknowledge that they contribute names to the congressionally mandated list,

129
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,020
none of them could or would say which agency is responsible for managing the list,

130
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,180
except that they are known for, quote,

131
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,220
having a thing for that sort of thing, unquote.

132
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,060
Equally troubling is that to avoid accusations of racial profiling,

133
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:51,740


134
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:59,580
a blonde white woman is routinely selected for the intrusive and thorough anal exams from each flight,

135
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,040
often several times at the same airport while waiting for her flight.

136
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,860
In the instance where such a woman has several connecting flights,

137
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,860
she could be anally violated dozens of times in a single day,

138
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,400
said one attractive woman.

139
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,260
What's scariest to me is that there could be this gross interruption of civil rights,

140
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,780
and nobody is really in charge.

141
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,040
But everybody wants to shove their fingers up your butt.

142
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:32,440
Nobody thought that 1984-ish America would be like an anal intruder's porn movie.

143
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,680
Well, friends, as New Monet said about that news report,

144
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,960
we have seen the future and it is...

145
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,700
UGH!

146
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,700
Ehh.

147
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,280
And the future continues here in Cleveland,

148
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,160
where we make this...

149
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,760
where we finally assemble the crew,

150
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:50,760


151
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,240
assemble the show.

152
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,900
Um, we lost a newspaper.

153
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,380
The...the alternative weekly called the Free Times

154
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:05,680
was absorbed by the other weekly, leaving now only one city in the United States

155
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,200
that has two alternative weeklies.

156
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,840
I think that's Los Angeles.

157
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,940
And there goes newspaper.

158
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,560
So all them people be going down the same...

159
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,020
Communism!

160
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,660
Communism!

161
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,560
These countries only have one newspaper!

162
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,260
Communism is good!

163
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,280
Christianity is stupid!

164
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,400
In communist countries...

165
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,220
Communism is good!

166
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,780
People can't decide what the government's gonna do in the war zones.

167
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,820
And that's why I say this Bush man is a communist!

168
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,020
It's totalitarianism!

169
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm amazed hearing that coming from a Texan.

170
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,800
It's the devil pretends to be good.

171
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,260
From a proletarianism.

172
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,400
The meaning of the word proletarianism, goddammit!

173
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,160
Communism pretends to be a capitalist.

174
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,200
But it's communism...

175
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,260
Communism?

176
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,080
...that is creeping into America.

177
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,420
I have felt the...

178
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,020
Yes, communism.

179
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,300
...in a vile perspiration of communism.

180
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,100
I think it's also called couch potato-ism.

181
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,980
And the other muted hues.

182
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,160
And I feel that we are slipping slowly down the backslide...

183
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,140
...of other nations that have gone before.

184
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,000
It's common.

185
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,260
It is creeping.

186
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,180
Common men are everywhere in communism!

187
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:28,220
It is a form of Marxism, socialism, and all those other nasty, nasty words.

188
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:28,820
Common, come over here.

189
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,720
Common, please.

190
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,240
Communists and Nazis!

191
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,520
They're under my bed.

192
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,840
I like them there.

193
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,300
They're under every one of my beds.

194
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,240
Both of them.

195
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,900
Commies and Nazis.

196
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,260
And pinks.

197
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,620
I don't mean pinkos.

198
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,260
And the Genghis Khan hordes.

199
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,160
I like those uniforms too.

200
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:46,840
Humans!

201
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,480
Humans!

202
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,520
Another low flyby.

203
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,580
We're still the next to go.

204
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,680
There's humans again.

205
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,360
Another number came up. I think it was forty-five.

206
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,900
We will bring them down.

207
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,540
Someday their kind will fall.

208
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,960
And our kind shall rise up out of the ditches and the holes.

209
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:14,040
Like a phoenix from the ashes, we shall swarm skyward and spew our maelstrom upon them.

210
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,420
You're listening to WCSB Cleveland.

211
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,760
Let the humans laugh at us now.

212
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,420
Our time is coming.

213
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:27,240
While they still have teeth and jaws and those tendons that go behind your chin and nostrils.

214
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
There are no more teeth.

215
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,140
Radiation is our friend.

216
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,980
We eat uranium and old rotten wires.

217
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,420
And we shall dispute them at the nuclear plants.

218
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,760
We shall displace the humans.

219
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,240
We will be the new conspiracy.

220
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,380
There's a worm.

221
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,400
You can evacuate so easily with that.

222
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,720
Just one thought. It's like Gidget already went to the power plant.

223
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,700
The roaches shall be the new exterminators.

224
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,180
The new exterminators.

225
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,620
And the humans will be the bugs.

226
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,020
The shrimp.

227
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,520
The barbies.

228
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,380
The kinmen and the sound boys.

229
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,440
We'll get and get them.

230
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,040
They and all their friends.

231
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,940
Their allies.

232
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:24,460
And we shall blow up your butts.

233
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,180
ply Scream thể passing through your veins.

234
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:41,020
About them go on, they will die of pain.

235
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,020


236
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,060
They and all their friends.

237
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,640
Sp swoar the archel yesterday.

238
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:43,920
For they're the code.

239
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,000
For they, the Putin is sober.

240
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,080
Don't wake. Don't wake.

241
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,000
That's the opposite message.

242
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,460
This is about corporate accountability.

243
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,460
In this week, you'll find information about attacking President Bush's policies toward Iraq.

244
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,160
Just click for a leading congressional Democrat stand in the corner.

245
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,320
Now we'll look at our Treasury Secretary, Paul O'Neill, on the proposals to create kidnapped children.

246
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,640
And later, officials from three consumer groups and their abductors, also known as spam.

247
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,500
And at noon, only on BookBand 2.

248
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,220
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill talked about corporate accountability.

249
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,460
Joining us now at the table is Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill.

250
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,820
Oh, um, good.

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,400
Uh.

252
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,820
Uh.

253
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,920
Just, uh.

254
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,200
Um.

255
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:58,260
I, I go to a place where there's rampant corruption and see $100.

256
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,280
Did, did you, uh.

257
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,880
Tomorrow, the House Resources Committee will look at Gail Norton.

258
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:06,740
Did.

259
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,380
Don't explain, explain.

260
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:08,780


261
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,060
He's an asshole, sir.

262
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:14,920
The house.

263
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,340
I know that.

264
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,440
What's his name?

265
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,460
That is his name, sir.

266
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,000
Asshole.

267
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,860
Major asshole.

268
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,380
And his cousin?

269
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
He's an asshole, too, sir.

270
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,240
Gunner's made first class Philip asshole.

271
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,820
How many assholes we got on this ship anyhow?

272
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:26,840
Yo!

273
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,400
I knew it.

274
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,640
I'm surrounded by assholes.

275
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,580
Keep firing, assholes!

276
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,180
That's what I said at Enron.

277
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,660
Keep firing assholes.

278
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:37,900
Yeah.

279
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,460
Did you see the picture in the paper?

280
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,080
That guy's in his best suit, man.

281
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,960
It's gotta be a $2,000 suit he's wearing.

282
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,020
Going to prison.

283
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,740
Did you see the?

284
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,840
The stain on the back of that suit as he did that so-called perp walk?

285
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,180
That's a Bill Clinton stain if I ever saw one.

286
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,180
He was trying, I know, he was trying to do a lepetamine as if that was gonna get him

287
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,480
off.

288
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,060
You know, some people think.

289
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,140
Kinda backfired.

290
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:57,980
Mm-hmm.

291
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,320
Yeah.

292
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,100
As it were.

293
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,380
Or bareback fired.

294
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,280
As it were.

295
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,460
He.

296
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,240
Brad's out.

297
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,700
Who's mounted the little Lucifer puppy?

298
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,140
Bob's out.

299
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,680
Bob's out?

300
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,740
Why is that a Bob, man?

301
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,140
I'm sorry, I just cut a Bob.

302
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,720
Bob's right.

303
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:14,720


304
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,560
I'm afraid you're going to have to step back a little bit.

305
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,340
But it's like, it's like Bob is like this concept that's burned into everything like,

306
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,520
uh, you know, a screen that has like the, you know, the little logo burned into it or

307
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,400
something because it was on there too long, you know?

308
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,620
Like old computer screens.

309
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:31,840
Yeah.

310
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,980
It's like even when there's another pattern, Bob is underneath the pattern.

311
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,700
It's part of the wallpaper so you don't even see it.

312
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,980
Oh, that Bob weave, man.

313
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,340
That's a part of reality is the weave of.

314
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,720
The latticework.

315
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:44,720


316
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:44,720


317
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,320
The lattice of coincidence.

318
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,360
You know, that's, that's, it's like the wolf and the warp of the fabric.

319
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,360
The rockabilly wolf.

320
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,460
The fabric, man.

321
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,560
That's Bob smiling, drooling.

322
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,180
Who doesn't know that?

323
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,940
You forget he's there until you start smelling the smoke from that pipe.

324
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,440
And this perspiration.

325
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:01,820
The jet fuel.

326
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,940
I'll just hear it like sometimes now I'll just hear a certain like.

327
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,400
Spinal threads.

328
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,560
One guitar note, one just little on a guitar, you know?

329
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,220
Yeah.

330
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,440
I'll hear that and, and, and, and I'll just know where.

331
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:14,700
I'll just know where.

332
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:14,700


333
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:14,700


334
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,460
There they go.

335
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,900
You know, the connection is.

336
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,340
The rainbow connection.

337
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,720
It's the rainbow connection.

338
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,100
With your spine.

339
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,360
They're taking off left and right.

340
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,560
It's the new age, man.

341
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,560
The new aeon.

342
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,400
Yeah.

343
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,240
Just smile and wave as they go past.

344
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,280
I heard that they will be drinking Shaddam Hussein's spinal fluids at the Bohemian Grove.

345
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,040
Oh, and by the way, go down to that local.

346
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,000
As a special sacrifice.

347
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,060
That little deli on the corner that's owned by, you know.

348
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,200
Aries, Aries, Aries.

349
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,820
Oh, which deli?

350
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,680
Wait, which deli is that?

351
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,680
And go buy your American flag to put on your Christmas tree.

352
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:44,680


353
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:44,680


354
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:44,680


355
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:44,800
I'm going to buy a car.

356
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,740
One or two.

357
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,040
Because that's important.

358
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,220
Could be sufficient.

359
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,720
But if the climate changes, you may need five or six flags.

360
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,400
Now, Princess, we and I have noticed.

361
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,920
Six flags over Oklahoma.

362
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,700
Yee-haw.

363
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,900
I've been there.

364
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,140
I mean, exactly.

365
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,340
One year old flags on people's cars that they bought exactly one year ago and that have

366
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:11,220
now been worn by the wind down to just nubbins of about an inch or two of flags.

367
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:11,720
Yeah.

368
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,280
I mean, really.

369
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,480
Five hundred.

370
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,160
Five hundred.

371
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:22,720
I do pledge my allegiance to that flag for which I stand in here.

372
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:29,820
One nationalistic respubic with freedom and justice for the upper ten percent.

373
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,840
You guys sound like a bunch of flaggy boys.

374
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,940
That's pretty flaggy.

375
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,900
You're a bunch of flaggots.

376
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,660
How's your organization?

377
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,760
I hate flaggots.

378
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,020
I tell ya.

379
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,420
I burned the flag.

380
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,740
I tell ya, my life is my art.

381
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,560
Bush burned the Constitution.

382
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,120
I love it.

383
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,680
The flag is mine.

384
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,400
You're just igniting yourself.

385
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,440
I'm flagging.

386
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,560
Well, we've had our way with the flag, haven't we?

387
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,180
A symbol.

388
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,620
A symbol of freedom.

389
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,480
But in these days and times, a symbol of what?

390
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,620
Of oppression.

391
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,760
Of oppression of the entire world based on-

392
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,220
It's becoming more dot-like.

393
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,040
I'm reading off the wrong page.

394
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,580
I'm supposed to be reading off the page that says we must install democracies wherever

395
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,400
they is.

396
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,920
And wherever they-

397
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,600
I'm sorry.

398
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:13,600


399
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,580
I'm sorry.

400
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,680
We'll force them to vote.

401
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,120
We shall.

402
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,140
They'll if they'll vote or we'll kill them.

403
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,720
And if they don't place their ballots in the box, we'll place them there for them.

404
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,820
We will install democracy wherever it can be.

405
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,300
We will make them free if it kills them.

406
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,820
It's not happening.

407
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,480
There goes another one.

408
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,060
Bye bye.

409
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,580
That was another fly by, man.

410
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,120
I think we're gonna be the next to go in a few seconds.

411
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,860
Got your helmet, Dave.

412
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,580
Yeah, I'm wearing it on my feet, man.

413
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:43,580


414
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:43,580


415
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:43,580


416
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:43,580


417
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:43,580


418
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,860
We'll free those people if we have to go into slavery to do it.

419
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,200
And my fellow Americans, I hope you're prepared to do just that.

420
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,080
That's the cost of freedom.

421
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,740
Your freedom.

422
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,260
We must destroy freedom to build freedom.

423
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,100
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

424
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,600
I'm kind of disgusted.

425
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,220
I know how you feel.

426
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,600
The show sucks.

427
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:12,820
It sucks.

428
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,980
Life is even worse with all this oil on over me.

429
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,980
And dust.

430
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,540
And now you gotta wear your helmet on your backside or else...

431
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,680
The show is hell.

432
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,460
Shut the...

433
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:23,740
Hello?

434
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,420
They ought to hang me.

435
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,020
They ought to hang me.

436
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,440
They ought to hang me.

437
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,380
They ought to hang me.

438
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,460
They ought to hang me.

439
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:46,460


440
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:46,460


441
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:46,460


442
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:46,500
You are lying.

443
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:46,500


444
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:46,500


445
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:46,500


446
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,960
I'm giving them right back.

447
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:53,360
A newly discovered white ass, but follow-up studies show that the ass and earth will not meet, at least for now.

448
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,400
Tomorrow.

449
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,960
Today, a tragic new life together.

450
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,780
All this and more, today.

451
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,480
Tomorrow.

452
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,080
Tomorrow.

453
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,380
Hello and welcome to this edition of the club.

454
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,400
Today, a coma and being married.

455
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,620
The headline for expensive drugs, but that's not all.

456
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,100
The Los Angeles White House is now backing suspected hijacker,

457
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,820
in Prague. CBN congressional correspondent Paul Sorrell was involved in the terrorist attacks.

458
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:27,920
The Senate wound up in prison for bribery and tax evasion. Republican obesity in the U.S.,

459
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,180
Texas trouble. The new bill would authorize more than 150 million children to help the two fat

460
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:38,580
congressmen for tax evasion. And with both the House and Senate in prison, all the races are

461
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:44,800
overweight. Paul Sorrell in prison for bribery and tax evasion. Capitol Hill. And for more

462
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,520
information on what's happening in Washington, then ask Mike Reed, Capitol Hill Prayer, every

463
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,840
Friday at CBN.com. The contemporary Christian can't just read this asking itself questions like

464
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,120
just how Christian does Christian have to be? CBN News reporter Sarah Pollack has about a one in

465
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,440
250,000 chance. Ever since he grew up, from the time they started getting the wee little man,

466
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,320
from that time, really, I was hooked. Paul came shortly after he

467
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,560
wrote the book, The Greatest Show on the World.

468
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:08,900
I wrote a song.

469
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,020
I want Smell-O-Vision.

470
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,900
I want all the others.

471
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,180
Now Paul's officially better known as God or Jesus.

472
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,500
I wonder whenever.

473
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,400
Oh, I wonder.

474
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,380
Oh, I wonder.

475
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,660
So you're just like having a canapé breakfast just talking about the world news or something?

476
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,940
Or just, is it more like dogma of the Church of the Subgenius again?

477
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,100
I don't think any of that even came up.

478
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,220
No dogma?

479
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,560
Well, I guess we're just all burned out.

480
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,800
I was driving to the station and I was thinking, shouldn't we draw upon our energy reserves

481
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,960
and do some protestful thing about some...

482
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,060
you know, pertinent, cultural, socially relevant,

483
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,380
you know, some giant argument that the humans

484
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,360
and everybody else is all upset about.

485
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,700
Well, the giant humans are always arguing

486
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,300
because they take up too much space.

487
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,140
But everybody just took their clothes off

488
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,000
and now they're dancing.

489
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,180
Is that positive or negative?

490
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,140
Yeah, Byron's going on and on about this, too.

491
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:29,920
Oh, man.

492
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,900
Byron wants everyone to be weird,

493
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,400
and he's offended that I'm having parties

494
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,800
where girls are dancing naked

495
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,660
and getting all painted up with liquid latex.

496
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,980
Actually, he just says that's old hat

497
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,000
and that's not weird enough.

498
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,180
That's so pink.

499
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,500
Now, of course, he has no suggestion

500
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,400
as to what would be weird.

501
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,100
Yeah, absolutely.

502
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,100
Nothing at all.

503
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,820
All he knows is that, you know what?

504
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,500
He's going to attack my pleasure vessel.

505
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,400
We may not be all that weird,

506
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,620
but we know our slack.

507
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,280
That's right.

508
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,960
You know, at least we know our slack, damn it.

509
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,900
You do.

510
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,180
You are quite aware of, in each inch,

511
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,280
each centimeter of slack that escapes from your vowels,

512
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,740
you know.

513
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,680
When I had no slack,

514
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,660
then I felt like, oh, everything has to be weird,

515
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,720
and then I'll have slack.

516
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,040
You have learned the secret of life,

517
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,060
or at least deodorant, like from a distance.

518
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,680
No, actually, I didn't learn.

519
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,900
All I know is I got some slack,

520
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,100
and I don't care whether it's weird or not weird.

521
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,200
I don't care.

522
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,420
Weird is what the other guy thinks.

523
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,220
I don't care what the other guy thinks.

524
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,700
I don't care what you think.

525
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:32,740
That's all he's done.

526
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,520
We're right out of the water.

527
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,260
I don't care what you think.

528
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:34,380
I don't care what you think.

529
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:34,860
Bob thinks.

530
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,240
There you go.

531
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,520
It was worth it.

532
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,080
I paid to know what I really think,

533
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,660
and I don't care what you think.

534
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,640
I don't even care what I think at this point.

535
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,260
What a beautiful, pathetic thought

536
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,000
for such a scrambled-up gentleman.

537
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,480
For 30 bucks, it's worth it.

538
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:50,960
He tried so hard to save the world,

539
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,340
and now look at his mind now,

540
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,980
all, like, laying there on a piece of paper in front of him.

541
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,400
I saved my world.

542
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,720
Listen to the drums.

543
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,380
They're calling.

544
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,180
They're calling.

545
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,380
Those are the calling drums.

546
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,420
They're calling you to whoop your pants down.

547
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,320
I would like to be Kaisei Girl.

548
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:05,780
Socks.

549
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,540
Just forget toilet paper.

550
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,220
Who cares?

551
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,320
Just live natural.

552
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,680
Forget toilet paper, I think,

553
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,720
should be the name of our new political movement.

554
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,120
That was a great movement.

555
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,080
A great band.

556
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,460
The toilet...

557
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,080
Wait a minute.

558
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,360
Forget toilet paper.

559
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,140
That's the name of the band.

560
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,920
Forget toilet paper.

561
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,820
It might even really be the band that's playing right now

562
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,500
over the airwaves that you're listening to.

563
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,080
But it's spelled with a number, right?

564
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,720
For...

565
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,860
Yeah.

566
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,400
Forget toilet paper.

567
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:33,400


568
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:33,400


569
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:33,720
Just get toilet paper.

570
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,340
It's only known as...

571
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,140
So all the rest do not get toilet paper,

572
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,260
but four get toilet paper.

573
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,140
Four?

574
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,700
Are they the four smelliest?

575
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,200
They're the four horsemen.

576
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,040
No, no.

577
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,820
The band only gets...

578
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,860
The four most worthy.

579
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,000
The four horsemen of the port-a-san.

580
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,760
The four strongest or the four strongest smelliest?

581
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,180
The four get toilet paper.

582
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,640
The four get toilet paper, yeah.

583
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,460
Indian times, before things became very, very small,

584
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,320
mall, they were the four horsemen

585
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,380
of the porta potty. Why are you

586
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,360
hooked on your toilet paper and your

587
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,180
chem cans? I don't know. He always

588
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,300
do that. Why can't you just live like

589
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,600
in the past, in the good old days?

590
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,020
Live life. What's the

591
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,440
difference in a porta potty?

592
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,720
Live life without any

593
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,080
focus on excremeditation.

594
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,180
Screw that excremeditation stuff.

595
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,900
All you need is a hole in the ground and a

596
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,460
cactus and some sand.

597
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,240
Just grab a branch

598
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,660
to hang on to and let it go.

599
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,840
What's wrong with a good old

600
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,480
cactus? Lean back and let go.

601
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,260
Right.

602
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,680
You know what I'm saying?

603
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,760
Don't you want to take a big piece of

604
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,860
life like that? Just walk up to

605
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,740
that old saguaro cactus and put your arm

606
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,660
around it and give it a big old

607
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,860
fat kiss and say,

608
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,140
Dobbs, I quit.

609
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,620
You know, that guy's nuts

610
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,860
really when you think about it.

611
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,800
I mean, he don't make any sense at all,

612
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,100
right? Do you think so?

613
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,360
I don't think.

614
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,900
That's right. That's the problem, sir.

615
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,700
Yes.

616
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,060
Yes, yes.

617
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,480
I've been bothered by the soldiers

618
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,180
killing innocent civilians.

619
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,220
Musica.

620
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,740
Musica.

621
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,120
Get this.

622
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,500
48%

623
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,220
of 60% of the population of Canada and the rest of the population of the United States have been killed by these animals.

624
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:30,220


625
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,520
63% of 43% of ethnic white Latinos,

626
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:42,780
55% of 25% of freaking ethnic Jewish voters

627
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,760
who are beginning to scratch their...

628
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,840
Thank you, doctor.

629
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,700
Come on.

630
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,700
Looks like I might have a happy ending.

631
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,200
It's okay.

632
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,000
The snake condo.

633
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,720
The universities.

634
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,840
The multi-gall science.

635
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,040
Science.

636
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,780
Our universities.

637
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,080
Josh.

638
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,580
Yes.

639
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,000
Mystical science.

640
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,420
Yes.

641
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,620
Go, go, go!

642
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,560
Hey!

643
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,240
Yeah!

644
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,500
A science party!

645
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,340
Science party!

646
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,060
A science party!

647
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,480
In the laboratory!

648
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,520
Late night at the lab!

649
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,860
Everybody's there!

650
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,620
Doctors, professors, PhDs!

651
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,140
Scientists with yellow hair!

652
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,680
Someone's pulling up!

653
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,820
It's anatomic Howard Cadillac!

654
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,820
Geniuses with yellow hair!

655
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:58,820


656
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:58,820


657
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,760
Matching lab coats!

658
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,200
Carrying a portable telescope!

659
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,120
To the...

660
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,540
Science!

661
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,360
Science party!

662
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,520
Science!

663
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,280
Science party!

664
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,140
Science!

665
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,140
Science party!

666
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,420
Science party!

667
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,600
In the laboratory of love!

668
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,840
Hey! Someone spiked the test tubes!

669
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:28,800
Laboratory!

670
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,580
Laboratory's out of control!

671
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,420
Hands off that equipment, boy!

672
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,300
The sonic mine probe is not a toy!

673
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:36,920
Take it!

674
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,420
Hey!

675
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:45,500


676
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,720
Hey!

677
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:48,600
Hey!

678
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:48,900
Hey!

679
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,200
Hey!

680
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,740
Hey!

681
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:49,740


682
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:49,740


683
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,440
Hey!

684
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,460
Hey!

685
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,840
Hey!

686
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,140
Hey!

687
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,160
Hey!

688
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,160


689
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,000
Hey!

690
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,180
Hey!

691
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:58,920
Hey!

692
00:30:59,320 --> 00:30:59,860
Hey!

693
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,060
Is that cool?

694
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:04,900
It sounds like a cool visited being, a wound room!

695
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,320
And we didn't have thehealthdevice at all while I was movieக

696
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,620
Just watch me go all over you!

697
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,900
So what happened next September?

698
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,680
When's shot doo!

699
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:21,560
Aww!

700
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,680
Assets!

701
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,980
Assets!

702
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:27,700
Too good to be true!

703
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:27,820


704
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:28,820


705
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:28,820


706
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,440
Science party in the laboratory

707
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,860
You want more science? We'll give you lots more

708
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,700
You needed the flow, but just to get on the dance floor

709
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,640
Wake up the lab rats, turn on the party droid

710
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,600
Stay away from the nuclear wasteoid

711
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,460
Science, a science party tonight

712
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,300
Science, science party tonight

713
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,180
Science, science party tonight

714
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,360
Science party tonight

715
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,640
Let's see what's going on at, uh...

716
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,960
Let's see what's up in the news here at NASA.

717
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah, check some science news.

718
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,060
I haven't been, I've only been looking at the bad news.

719
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,020
The science news is so good.

720
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,440
It makes you feel like everything's going to be fine.

721
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,700
We'll have robots building robots that make better robots.

722
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,980
And soon the robots will just...

723
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,580
That's what we've got.

724
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:28,800
...take over.

725
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,620
They'll take care of us all the time.

726
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,680
And we won't even know they're doing it.

727
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,960
We'll think that they've left the planet, been outlawed.

728
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,540
But they'll be taking care of us.

729
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,120
It all makes sense.

730
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,700
I was reading that Isaac Asimov robot series.

731
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,900
And, you know, those were written in the 50s, but...

732
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,840
Was it iRobot?

733
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,720
You could see more, yes.

734
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,120
That's the very first of the series.

735
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,000
And then...

736
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,720
Actually, I kind of read the very end,

737
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,180
and then I read the beginning,

738
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,980
and I'm working my way towards the middle.

739
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,720
Well, NASA is apparently having a...

740
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,680
Thousands of books.

741
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
A rocket contest.

742
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,560
A rocket contest?

743
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,000
Yeah.

744
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:03,720
Red rocket.

745
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,120
Look, there's a big red rocket right on the screen there.

746
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,680
It's apparently a red rocket contest.

747
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,040
Do you know anything about that, Dave?

748
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Well, I know they glare.

749
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,820
I know they glare, and also there's a...

750
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,920
Oh, yeah, you've got a big dog.

751
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,580
You probably know about that red rocket.

752
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,500
I thought you were talking about the rocket's red glare.

753
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,900
No, look at that big red rocket right there.

754
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,300
Not the sunshine left over from your fluvia

755
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,040
after you gazed into the nostril,

756
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,700
the third nostril of the solar disc.

757
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,780
For so long, your sinuses fry.

758
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,300
Do you think NASA is hoping that some super genius

759
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,260
will stupidly reveal the perpetual motion

760
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,880
faster-than-light engine...

761
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,940
So they can suppress it, yeah.

762
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,320
...that runs on no fuel, just breath?

763
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,380
So they can have a spokesman come out and say,

764
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,940
yeah, there never will or ever has been a machine

765
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,820
that would focus your breath in a way

766
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,880
that would make you move faster than a speed of light.

767
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,840
If safely...

768
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,440
Well, not really travel faster than light,

769
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:58,680
but just...

770
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,880
...a port through wormholes

771
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,060
using the power of your mind and your breath and garlic.

772
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:05,880
Oh, that's...

773
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,960
Well, that's a yogic thing.

774
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,420
You can get those at Safeway now.

775
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,140
Wow.

776
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,740
Travel without moving.

777
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,100
Yeah, here you go.

778
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,320
Travel without moving.

779
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,280
Sex, IQ, and ET.

780
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,140
How we got big brains.

781
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,020
The same way we got...

782
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,440
Apparently, space.com is apparently running a story.

783
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,940
Yeah, they have a picture of an Oberman there.

784
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,020
A big head man.

785
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,560
An Oberman.

786
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,120
Waterhead.

787
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,660
An Oberman.

788
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,480
Brain head man.

789
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,100
He's a high macrocephalic.

790
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,040
A hot woman who doesn't have a big head.

791
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,700
She's a macrocephalic.

792
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,300
No, but she's looking very pensive and has a wonderful smile on her face.

793
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,920
Do you prefer macrocephalic or macrobooty?

794
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,540
She's like hot for the brainiac.

795
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,220
Do you know what a big head means?

796
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,620
Yeah.

797
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,440
What goes with a big head?

798
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,500
So this is what space.com has degenerated to.

799
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,180
Big hat.

800
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,380
Look at their...

801
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,640
They're floating around the Amazon River looking...

802
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,960
Searching in boats.

803
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,800
What?

804
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,760
For a missing meteor.

805
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,300
Oh, yeah, sure.

806
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,080
A meteor.

807
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,020
That apparently was used by this guy to come to Earth.

808
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,980
Big headed thing rides...

809
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,080
We got to describe this big headed guy.

810
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,960
Suddenly appears in the Amazon.

811
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,100
He has small jowls.

812
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,620
With women falling over in his feet.

813
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,280
He's got kind of a flabby foreskin around his neck.

814
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,780
His jaw protrudes a little bit, but not enough to show him as an Oberman.

815
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,780
He looks more like an Untermensch with a macrocephalic problem.

816
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,980
Perhaps maybe hydrocephalic.

817
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,160
As if somebody poured the whole gallon there.

818
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,480
And the CIA is desperately trying to find his spaceship.

819
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,560
His spaceship, which has crashed in the Amazon.

820
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,760
They're telling everybody that it's a meteor.

821
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,460
Yeah.

822
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,440
Every time you hear about a search for a missing meteor...

823
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,620
I just thought we were somewhere in the West.

824
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,600
Anyway.

825
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,940
Looking for a meteor.

826
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,680
A meteor.

827
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:58,920
I'm sorry.

828
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,580
I just...

829
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,440
I don't know what the good and the bad and the ugly came out of that meteor.

830
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,960
And out of that macrocephalic.

831
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,560
It was the Amazon, dude.

832
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,940
But that's where they also look...

833
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,780
Quote, unquote, look for missing meteors.

834
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,060
And quote, unquote, dinosaur bones.

835
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,620
And whatever it is that they cordon off a huge area.

836
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,560
And white Indians.

837
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,380
And they're so important to the United States government.

838
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,260
So they don't have to pay up.

839
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,900
We've got to stop them.

840
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,680
They're going to kill us all.

841
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,660
We've got to stop them.

842
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:28,660


843
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:28,660


844
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:28,660


845
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:28,660


846
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:28,660


847
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:28,660


848
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:28,660


849
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,540
They're going to fuck you up in their spaceship.

850
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,160
Did they do any sexual things to you?

851
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,520
That's what I call a closed encounter.

852
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,260
Its structure is just solidified on the surface.

853
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,060
I think it's anticipating the attack.

854
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,540
Anticipation denotes intelligence.

855
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,700
What was that?

856
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,420
Uh, uh, uh, uh, what?

857
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,980
Space herpy.

858
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,600
That's disgusting!

859
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,760
Alien approaching!

860
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,100
Alien approaching!

861
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,420
Alien approaching!

862
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,140
Alien approaching!

863
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,180
Alien!

864
00:36:59,620 --> 00:36:59,980
Alien!

865
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,740
Don't run.

866
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,740
We are your friends.

867
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,400
Oh, my God.

868
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,440
Oh, my God, coming.

869
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,460
Another one coming.

870
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,920
Imagine for a moment that this thing

871
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,320
is not anything that can be identified

872
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,540
because it prefers not to be.

873
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,640
Wherever there is life,

874
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,240
it brings death.

875
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,020
Because it is evil.

876
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,040
Absolute evil.

877
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,720
One more reason to shoot first.

878
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,140
What if it goes out and melts down a busload of nuns?

879
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,580
How would you like to write the headline on that?

880
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:34,460
one. None so? Behind me are the raging flames of where the dome of the rock, one of Islam's

881
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:40,200
most sacred sites, once stood. Just moments ago, the ancient shrine was rocked by a devastating

882
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:40,960
explosion.

883
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,400
Over three million are dead and thousands are seeking refuge after a freak meteor shower

884
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:02,280
hit Eastern Europe. It is written in the last days, a world leader will rise up. When possessed

885
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:10,680
by Satan, he will declare himself God and embark on a reign of terror until the Lord

886
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:18,060
comes and destroys him. The final battle between heaven and hell approaches. I have a really

887
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:23,940
bad feeling about this. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Look, I really don't

888
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,380
think they flew 90 billion light years ago.

889
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,000
My idea is to come down here and start a fight and get all rowdy. If you calculate the time

890
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
it takes to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at the worldwide destruction of every

891
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,700
major city in the next 36 hours. We're being exterminated.

892
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,320
Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode. We are at DEFCON 1.

893
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:54,600
The city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportion. What do you mean biblical? What

894
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,000
do you mean?

895
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,080
What do you mean this?

896
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,480
Old Testament, Mr. Mayor. Real wrath of God type stuff. Fire and brimstone coming down

897
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,840
from the sky. Rivers and seas boiling. 40 years of darkness, earthquakes, volcanoes.

898
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:10,620
The dead rising from the grave. Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together. Mass hysteria.

899
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:15,100
I don't think I can cope with any more of this. I think I'll just go and have a little

900
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,580
lie down.

901
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,520
Jell-a-boom.

902
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,160
Boom, yeah. I understand boom.

903
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,660
Ba-da-boom.

904
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,280
Big.

905
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:23,960
Big.

906
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,220
Big ba-da-boom.

907
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:25,960
Big.

908
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,060
Ba-da-big-boom.

909
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,220
Big.

910
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:29,860
Boom.

911
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,640
Yeah, big ba-da-boom.

912
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,520
Ba-da-boom.

913
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,400
Big.

914
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:33,840
Boom.

915
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,300
Big ba-da-boom.

916
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,640
Man is an endangered species.

917
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:44,140
We'll stop any attack that they could begin. Provided the attack is lame and poorly thought

918
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,860
out and it's our grandma's.

919
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:54,920
Save your energy. Save yourselves. Avoid the planet Earth at all costs. Farewell.

920
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,100
We'll be right back.

921
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:10,900
DJ Epoch did that collage, I think. And before that, ESO Swamp Radio. Lots of ESO Swamp Radio

922
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:20,200
from WCSB, which is actually the Einstein's Secret Outlaws band with a mystery guest guitarist

923
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,800
is heard in the background jamming at Tranquility Bass.

924
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:25,900
Brushwood.

925
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:36,180
Before ESO Radio, we heard that song Science Party is by Consortium of Genius, a funny

926
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:45,800
band that you can check out at their website, www.consortiumofgenius.com. That's all one

927
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,060
big word. Consortium of Genius.

928
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,600
And now, friends, a live recording from the Akron Revival.

929
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:02,420
This year, sponsored by Reverend Toth Wilder, in which Reverend Dr. Uncle Haj Onan Kanobite

930
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,380
leads us in a sing-a-long.

931
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:21,020
I know a man whose name was Bob and selling things. That was his job.

932
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,760
That was his job.

933
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,580
That was his job.

934
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,580
That was his job.

935
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:24,580


936
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:34,640
So he sold his things from door to door.

937
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,040
From door to door.

938
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,580
From door to door.

939
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:36,580


940
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:40,520
If you had some, you'd buy some more.

941
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:40,820
If you had some, you'd buy some more.

942
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,920
You'd buy some more.

943
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:48,620
I know he bought from door to door, and if you had some, he'd buy some more.

944
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,560
He drove his car.

945
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,880
He drove his car.

946
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,560
From town and divorced.

947
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:54,560


948
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:54,560


949
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:09,480
And believe me, he got around. He drove his car from town to town. And believe me, he got around.

950
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:22,920
Jehovah One gave him a plan. Soon some genius will rule the land.

951
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,680
He came to one gave him a plan. Soon some genius will rule the land.

952
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:37,060
Well, X day came and X day went.

953
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,680
Was all that cash truly well spent?

954
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:52,120
Well, X day came and X day went. Was all that cash truly well spent?

955
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,460
It's true, the cash we won't get back.

956
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,280
But we don't care, cause we have slack.

957
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,840
We have slack!

958
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:14,040
It's true, the cash we won't get back. But we don't care, cause we have slack.

959
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,320
Will this song end?

960
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,920
Or go some more?

961
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,180
Funny at first.

962
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,160
Now it's a bore.

963
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,060
Will this song end? Or go some more?

964
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,700
Funny first, now it's a bore.

965
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,380
And so I'll end.

966
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,600
This endless tale.

967
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,640
Returning to.

968
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,160
The Saint of Sales.

969
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,100
And so I'll end this endless tale.

970
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,840
Returning to the Saint of Sales.

971
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,400
I knew a man, his name was Bob.

972
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,960
I'm telling you things, that was his job.

973
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,360
Yeah!

974
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,340
He was gonna ogle me.

975
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:25,080
I knew aths were best.

976
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,940
Of what?

977
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,620
Of what?

978
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,700
Scare.

979
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,680
He was a small boy who then he drove his Screw Andrewa into town.

980
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:36,680


981
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,700
This is not the hermitage of the subgenius.

982
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,480
This is not the monastery of the subgenius, nor the nunnery of the subgenius.

983
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,720
This isn't the sit-at-home-alone of the subgenius,

984
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,680
or the play-on-your-computer-all-day of the subgenius.

985
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:02,120
And it's definitely not the come-to-the-lives spider-and-don't-talk-to-other-people of the subgenius.

986
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:09,400
Perhaps, if each and every one of you don't meet someone tonight, you have cheated yourself.

987
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,600
Perhaps, it's a little intimidating to meet somebody tonight,

988
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:22,360
and so we're going to organize something else.

989
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:28,480
And by meeting somebody, I don't mean you should go up and talk to the sexiest person in the room,

990
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,280
because there's only one Chaz Smith here,

991
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,300
and if you don't, you have to go around.

992
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,920
But some of you should believe me.

993
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,160
That's what I heard.

994
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,620
So, can you believe me?

995
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,020
Because I'm here.

996
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,880
Baby, baby, baby!

997
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,380
One, one, dollar, dollar.

998
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,540
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one.

999
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,480
Oh, nay, oh, nay, oh, oh, oh, nay!

1000
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,120
Oh, oh, nay, oh, oh, oh, nay!

1001
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,100
Oh, oh, nay, oh, oh, nay!

1002
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,860
Oh, oh, nay, oh, nay, oh, nay!

1003
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,040
Hey!

1004
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,940

You couldn't wait five minutes.

1054
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,660
You couldn't even wait a minute.

1055
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,160
It's taking too long.

1056
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,860
I mean, you should have finished that business before you got here.

1057
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:07,640
I told you.

1058
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,720
What are you doing?

1059
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,900
You're still dragging your unfinished work behind you.

1060
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,500
And it sounds like it's going good.

1061
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,460
I tell you, this is really professional.

1062
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:21,300
Sorry.

1063
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,220
Sorry about that.

1064
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,280
Just forget everything you saw up to this point.

1065
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,500
And we're the Swingin' Love Corp.

1066
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,660
And we're just going to start over.

1067
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:32,740
And as an apology to all of you beautiful fans who came out here tonight,

1068
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,960
we're going to start with our best song.

1069
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,140
This is our best song.

1070
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,600
This is the best song that we do.

1071
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,140
Oh, pretty mama.

1072
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,580
Oh, baby.

1073
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,140
This is our best song.

1074
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,980
This is our best song.

1075
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,880
This is our best song.

1076
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,240
This is our greatest song.

1077
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,200
This is our best song.

1078
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:06,700
Mama.

1079
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,980
This is our best song.

1080
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,320
We love this song.

1081
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,480
We love this song.

1082
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,020
궁금 갖 ко вещи

1083
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,200
That's what you're gonna find

1084
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,740
How long you've waited

1085
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:22,560
For me to come and go

1086
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,600
So we can make a song

1087
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,260
But you've never seen the stars

1088
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:24,260


1089
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:24,260


1090
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:24,260


1091
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,980
Pretty baby.

1092
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,240
Pretty baby.

1093
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:54,480
73.

1094
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,340
I picked the goddarned terror of the frigging gods out of my nose.

1095
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,860
Pardon my language.

1096
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,580
But yeeha, let the sons of God and man bear witness.

1097
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:09,020
Even in the belly of the thunderbird I've been casting out the false prophets, I'm busting

1098
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,020
a nut and blowing my o-ring, and ripe to throw a loaf.

1099
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:17,120
For I speak only the frigging truth, and never in my days have I spoken other than.

1100
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:21,200
For my every utterance is a lie, including this very one you hear.

1101
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:24,240
I say, have sex with, em, if they can.

1102
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:24,860
Can't take a joke.

1103
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,780
By God, anything for a laugh, I say.

1104
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,720
I am the last remaining homo correctus, I am the goddarned man of the future.

1105
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,500
I'll drive a mile so, as not to walk a foot, I am a human being of the first goddarned

1106
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,220
water, I'm insured for acts o' God and Satan.

1107
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:46,900
I was shanghaied by bodiless fiends and alien zoos from a corporate galaxy, and got away

1108
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,880
with their hubcaps.

1109
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,100
I cannot be tracked on radar.

1110
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,760
I wear nothing uniform, I wear no goddarned uniform.

1111
00:51:53,760 --> 00:52:00,940
Yes baby, I'm 23 feet tall and have 13 rose o' breasts, I was settled by a triceratops,

1112
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,020
I gave the aunties virgin a high protein toxo wash.

1113
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,460
I'm a bacteriological weapon, I'm armed and loaded.

1114
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:13,480
I'm a fission reactor, I fart plutonium, power plants are fueled by the sweat from my brow,

1115
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,600
when they plug me in, the lights go out in Hong Kong.

1116
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:23,220
I siren retarded space bastards across the cosmos, I cook and eat my dead, yahoo, I'm

1117
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,520
the unshaven thorn tree of the Atlantis zoo.

1118
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,060
I pay no taxes.

1119
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,860
The devil's hands are my ideal playground.

1120
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:35,780
I hold the seven bladed windbreaker, the wheels that turn are behind me, I think backwards.

1121
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,440
I do it for fun.

1122
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,940
My imagination is a frigging cancer and I'll pork it before it porks me.

1123
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,080
The say a donzillion is the highest number there is.

1124
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,280
Well my god.

1125
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,380
I count to a donzillion and one.

1126
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:52,700
Yes, I'm the purple flower of hell county, give me wide berth.

1127
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,560
When I drop my drawers, mother nature swoons.

1128
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:01,440
I use a python for a prophylactic, I'm thicker, harder and meaner than the Alaskan pipeline,

1129
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,000
and carry more spew.

1130
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,340
I'll freeze your seed before it gets the bathroom tile.

1131
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,260
Yee.

1132
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:07,960
Yee.

1133
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:39,100
I'll freeze your seed before it gets the bathroom tile.

1134
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:52,660
Yee.

1135
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,840
and our heads are all stuck up our own asses.

1136
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,660
And so, you know, it's kind of hard to get out of the diplomatic circle,

1137
00:53:58,780 --> 00:53:59,540
if you know what I'm saying.

1138
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,380
Which is why we have the squeeze bulb syringes.

1139
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,440
Oh, I can feel it right now.

1140
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,440
It's kind of like...

1141
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,220
You insert it into each nostril, and you squeeze it out first,

1142
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,640
and then you insert it in the nostril,

1143
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:17,120
and you release the bulb, and it expels the fluid.

1144
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,420
Now, where I'm coming from,

1145
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:21,520
I feel like there's a pair of buttocks wrapped on my head like a hat.

1146
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,700
And then somehow it makes me psychic.

1147
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,380
Am I getting the right thing, or have I gotten something I shouldn't have?

1148
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,300
I knew you were going to say that.

1149
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,600
I knew you were going to bring up the whole psychic thing.

1150
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,340
You are psychic.

1151
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,700
It's your buttocks wrapped on my head, aren't it?

1152
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,120
Isn't it?

1153
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:35,800
It is.

1154
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:36,400
It is.

1155
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:43,040
I often think that there's somebody out there who's recording every word that happens in the show,

1156
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:46,560
and then eventually they'll all be played back again.

1157
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,760
And that was the random recurrent moment beloved by all.

1158
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:51,500
Yeah.

1159
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,380
Order now while supplies are limitless.

1160
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:58,040
You may be asked to call upon for a certain favor.

1161
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,300
Maybe someone might want you to...

1162
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,300
Francis, this is the year 1962.

1163
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,740
Imagine somebody listening to us at the same time in the year, oh, say, 2002.

1164
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,400
Boy, that's 40 years past.

1165
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,800
Can you imagine such a thing?

1166
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:17,700
Ask not what your forehead can do in this small space.

1167
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,500
Ask what my forehead is doing in your head.

1168
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,140
How awful.

1169
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,280
But it's amazing the way you've got these records from the future.

1170
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,320
I like that.

1171
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,180
I like that.

1172
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:30,320
It's very small and unique, like a snowflake.

1173
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,900
It's emboldening.

1174
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,060
It's emboldening and embossing as well.

1175
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:35,780
Absolutely.

1176
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,560
And I have heard you've been called snowflake so many times.

1177
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,380
That's because she melts whenever you touch her.

1178
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,120
Oh, yes.

1179
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,080
She's a frosty little thing, huh?

1180
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,820
Well, no, she's not frosty.

1181
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,000
Something's lost and something's gained.

1182
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:55,720
If you could see her now, maybe every day, you would want to carve your own...

1183
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,560
What does that mean there?

1184
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:01,560
Something's lost and something's gained in living every day.

1185
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:06,020
It's a psycho, scrooge, squander.

1186
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,940
One step forward, two steps back.

1187
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,060
It's a cosmic, I'm about to spew.

1188
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:10,420
Yeah.

1189
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,480
Isn't it?

1190
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:11,940
Isn't it?

1191
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,680
It's just like amazing.

1192
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:18,080
So let us all remember the retching motion that Sri Hajambo has taught us.

1193
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:19,540
Begin.

1194
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,180
With a very, very deep breath.

1195
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,640
And we start.

1196
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,320
Till next week.

1197
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,740
You must remember this.

1198
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:34,280
A kiss is just a kiss.

1199
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,120
But a nuclear explosive device.

1200
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:43,320
Information is not knowledge.

1201
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,340
Keep your head on tight.

1202
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,720
You're back to the wind and you're sacking the saddle.

1203
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,620
But we got a point.

1204
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,060
Keep that sack to the business.

1205
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:51,740
I like that.

1206
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,600
But knowledge is not wisdom.

1207
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,220
And wisdom is not necessarily truth.

1208
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,820
And truth is not necessarily...

1209
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,960
Oh, thank you ESO, Swamp Radio, WCSB,

1210
