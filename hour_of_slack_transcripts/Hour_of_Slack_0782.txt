Inventory 2101, go off again.
What happened?
Someone set up us to bomb.
We get signal.
What?
Main screen turn on.
It's you.
How are you gentlemen?
All your base are belong to us.
You are on the way to destruction.
What you say?
You have no chance to survive, make your time.
Ha ha ha.
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.
Sponsored by the church of all of the subgenius.
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to
is specially designed only to be played
on the subgenius radio ministry.
On radio station.
And only in the city of...
Don't grit.
Okay, grit.
Don't grit.
Ah!
And speaking of which,
I'm hearing a clicking and a clacking sound.
I'm not.
Who gives a...
That means it's not going on to the tape.
And all I care about is the tape.
I don't care about the listeners, the audience,
screw them.
I...
All I care about is the tape that no one ever listens to.
You've actually physically tried to screw the audience.
For years and years,
it's been like one of your main back-of-your-mind type fantasy dreams
is to literally screw everybody in your audience.
Well, it's to pay them back for all the slack I've vampirized off of them.
Every time they listen,
I feel the power.
And they're granting a certain amount of power over their minds to us.
Listen to it.
To us.
Don't do it on your chest.
Just waiting for the sun to go down.
It's better in a bar.
A vampire sucks blood.
When you're up on stage and all the stunning eyes are looking at you,
you suck off your energy.
Yeah.
No, no, not just the money.
And the green blood comes out of you.
Just the soul, man.
Your life essence is here.
The soul is real.
And a sip of the sweet wine of another soul
is enough to make you puke sometimes.
Sip.
Of the wine.
Sip.


Of the wine.
To suck of the meat of the soul of the believer.
This is the appetite of the religious holy man, you know, preacher.
This is the right of the people.
And the rock star.
This is the weak.
And the polluted.
They're all vampires.
They're slack vampires.
They're slack vampires.
They suck.
This is your tax break.
We're going to cook up for you.
It's going to make every American so damn happy.
Just to eat.
We're going to open up the Alaska River.
We're going to make every American so damn happy.
They're getting our life's blood.
What about the Americans who hardly ever have a sight of that?
They spread out cheese,
a nickel,
roughly thin pieces of white bread,
and pass them out amongst themselves in portals.
Ladies and gentlemen,
schizophrenic tales of broken dreams.
You hear like your brain is falling apart.
Like the structure in there is all breaking down.
Your mind goes in a million distractions.
It gets through racing and racing.
I feel real young and helpless.
I feel like a little tiny girl again.
The world seems frightening and scary.
Everybody that I see,
they're out to get me.
I'm not afraid to be a little girl again.
I'm not afraid to be a little girl again.
You're thinking,
cracks!
Then you feel very irritated.
Very agitated.
When I get sick,
I don't want to be touched.
I don't want to be
tampered with.
They put you in restraints.
It feels like everything is closing in.
Like they're getting you.
People come around.
They say,
you gotta talk.
You gotta talk.
So you can get better.
But I can't talk.
I can't!
I was a loner.
I wasn't in the social clique.
I wasn't like the other kids.
They seemed to relate to each other.
I got so different
from everybody else.
I seem to come from a different place.
Society blames me.
They put me down.
But I want you.
All to know.
I did not choose to be this way.
It happened to me!
I was so scared.
I was so scared.
I remember saying,
it's such a big world out there.
But I'm not ready for it.
I don't belong in it.
It looks like I'm okay, but I'm not.
I wish somebody would help me.
Everything just came shattering down.
I was just crazy.
Everything was crazy.
Like falling all apart.
I remember!

Chewing meat!
Like a plant.
Just estava para لي��브 자증 아무것도!
Like I was eating junk food!
Their long car is justian traffic!
Like, I just don't know where to go!
Rude!
Just, just like Mario,
I obvi qu'à l' cameraman,
I knew that I was a Taiwanese,
The thing is, you never know when you're gonna change.
You're doing well, and then the sickness just comes on you.
Then you're not you anymore.
Some other voices are inside you.
It goes like a machine, a computer.
The messages go in and out and come out sounding.
Just like the input.
But it's not you.
Some people get better.
Some don't.
Some people get better.
Some don't.
Some people get better.
Some don't!
Woo!

Well, season's begun.
I was out at Brushwood last weekend.
Oh, I bet it's beautiful out there.
When does the ground get carpeted with apples?
I guess that's the end of it.
That's the end of it.
That's in fall.
Man, it's so weird.
It's like everywhere you step, you're crunching tiny little wild apples,
and it all smells like apples.
They scream really loud.
And you take them home and skin them alive.
Well, some of those apples are little teeny tiny people.
They conceal their heads that way.
They're actually little small brains encapsulated.
And those pectin-laden apples that are so delicious to it.
Chaz takes those apples home and makes Yankee Wanky Apple Jack sometimes, don't you, Chaz?
I've never done anything like that.
Yes, you have.
You said you used to squish it between your toes like a mammoth kazoon used to do,
and you'd jump around and sing songs.
It's Friday the 13th.
Well, it always is.
You know what I mean?
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
What a terrible epithet to hurl at someone.
It's Friday the 13th, man.
You're telling them you're going to have bad luck.
If you go down into your basement and Bob's sleeping down there,
that means you're going to have real bad luck.
What if Bob was one of us?
What if Bob was concealed in a pecan pie,
and as we opened that delightful, juicy pecan pie,
he became one of us?
He had a moonlighting job doing that,
where he would hide inside of a giant pecan pie,
or different kinds of pies,
and they'd cart him out at business women's luncheons,
and Bob would jump out,
and strip.
Well, then if God was one of us,
then Bob would be something entirely different.
Bob is a man.
He is only a man.
And God is...
You could say God is one of us,
because Bob is God.
But we are not.
But Bob is not one of us.
We are not.
If God was one of me,
I'd feel all...
white power.
You need something to power that mighty anus.
The guy actually...


I thought he was going to say some subgenius-like thing.
No, it was a colonoscopy.
A colonoscopy from one of the curious...
It was way underneath the underworld.
I know.
That's funny.
Sip him down to Cincinnati.
Let him get a job in the police department.
I'm into white power,
and black power,
and all shades in between.
I like different colors.
I think color is very powerful.
I'm into subgenius power,
as opposed to human power.
Right.
I mean...
Subgenius power.


Subgeniuses can come in any...
Are you into pink power, though?
I'm into pink...

Are you into pink power, though?
Oh, yeah.
No.
I'm into pink...
I believe in slavery, Chaz.
I'll come out and say that.
I believe that slavery...
That the pink should be slaves?
Well, they are.
...is cool.
Exactly.
So they are.
Of course, they are.
You've got it.
You hit it on the head.
They're already slaves.
To the conspiracy.
The problem is...
Exactly.
They're slaves to the wrong people,
to the conspiracy instead of us.
Right.
If they're going to be slaves,
you know,
I think they'd enjoy
what we put them to work,
doing more than...
I think you're going to love slavery
if you become a love slave
of the Church of the Subgenius.
Well, they also have to...
I think you're going to love
your long, long term
as a love slave
for the Church of the Subgenius.
They'll build pyramids
in the daytime
and be love slaves at night.
And they'll have to take
microscopic bricks
to make these mighty
3,000-foot-high pyramids.
Hey, what's wrong
with that racial collar?
He didn't say filthy
s*** at all.
It's fine.
I do, do, do.
It's clean.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Parma calling in.
I thought it was...
I think it's just
one of the guys
who had the medulla oblongata
beat out of him.
And that happens sometimes.
Sometimes they'll strap you
so hard.
Isn't that right, Chaz,
when you're going to
denizen school
in your little tiny baby?
Well, what's really funny
is how...
They'll just strap
the back of your neck
until your medulla oblongata
falls off.
are going to be left behind.
You know,
and they won't be around.
They'll be extinct.
Well, some of us
already consider them
They sure won't like it
on the escape vessels
of the sex goddesses.
No.
No, no.
There's many different
feuds of women.
Because what they most fear...
They're going to be
kind of freaked out.
What they most fear
will come true
as well as what
they most desire,
you see.
Reverend Ding Dong
is going to bend them
over a log.
I think it's something
like that, right?
Right.
They desire the reach around,
but they're afraid
of what goes with
the reach around.
That guy with the...
They're going to have
to take both.
Oh, come on.
We know that's like
a homoerotic cover.
Those guys that call in
and say that
stuff,
you know what
they really want.
Just picture them,
you know, like...
Well, you notice
their girlfriends
don't call in.
Right.
Did you ever notice
one of those skinhead rallies?
There's always like
90 fat guys
with like breasts
like women
and stuff like that
and shaved heads
banging into each other,
screaming words
that come from Africa.
It's sad when
all fat white men
with little teeny
tiny penises
call up.
And large breasts.
Don't forget.
And large breasts
and tiny little teeny penises
call up.
Hey, now some big fat guys
with tiny little peckers,
they're cool.
Sure, sure.
Hey, man, I mean,
you know, we're not prejudiced
here or anywhere else.
No, man,
our eyes are wide open.
And that's why
the tears are running
down the sides
of our heads
before you hate them.
You whiff them
and then hate them.
Hey, can I air
my exit wound?
Or forgive them
or rip them off as...
Hey, put me on hold
so I can listen
to the show, could you?
Okay.
Okay.
Would you like to have
your exit wound cleaned,
licked clean,
licked clean
like a little dog
or do it?
Do it.
Because our server's down.
Oh, really?
I wanted to listen
to the show
by putting them on hold
because our server's down
and you can't hear it
on the internet.
So he's actually
from a parahoot
time.
From that windstorm
we had today.
He's from
Flagelandspilk,
New York.
Hey, I want to talk
about my car accident.
Okay.
I think he already did.
He explained what happened
and how he arrived
where he is today.
He's already explained
how he got rear-ended.
He's a muttered
chimpanzee
with a wrap around
with a clan
dressed...
Yeah, I just...
I don't know.
I'm trying.
I got the image of a guy
with one of those
clan uniforms on
giving him the old...
Isn't there more
and more dung...
There's more...
There's more and more
dung flinging going on.
The apes are
fleshless.
That...
You should ask
what sort of
psychic
laxatives are
in the air, Chaz.
And taking the stick
and banging the stick
into the ground.
Yeah.
That's the question
you must ask, boys.
Some kind of cosmic
wave is passing.
What happens...
It's a laxative
for these violent apes
of some kind.
It's some sort of
migratory laxative
that, like a bird,
invades their consciousness
and makes it...
I mean, that's like
little kid poo-poo stuff,
you know,
when you want to start
banging things around,
you know,
and getting mean.
As my grandpa
dimples on a stink
Can I get in on
a sewing circle?
What?
Sure.
Can I get in on
a sewing circle?
Sure, if you're ornery enough
and we can pull
your eyeballs out.
Why would you want
to do that?
Because...
Because you have no eyes.
You see with your mind.
You can't look
at your own eye.
What you gonna do?
Pull your left eye out,
turn around,
and that's what
we're gonna do
to the pink boys
on X-Day.
You're gonna say,
look at yourself, man,
and we'll pull out
the left eye
just gently enough
without severing
the optic nerve
so that it can
sort of see
the other eye.
Take a good look, boy.
Take out the nostril
and place it
very, very,
very, very
far.
Accept him.
Party.
Ah!
What?
You're not recording,
are you?
What happened?
All right, back it up.
Let's back that ass up.

We didn't do it one more time.
Friends, we've been listening to
Morning 40 Federation,
a group
from New Orleans, I think,
released by Tequito
Records, which you can reach at
PMB number
432
828 Royal
Street, New Orleans,
Louisiana,
70116.
And friends, we've also been hearing,
of course, some Radio Patapo
from Amsterdam
with Pope Black and Lord Yeti
and so forth.
And Mickey Finn
and the Pope
of all Northern Europe,
Phil Monty, and the
Einstein Secret Orchestra with
Lonesome Cowboy Dave
and host Professor
Chaz Smith, of course, from
WCSB in Cleveland,
the marvelous, marvelous
home. And that
is more.
Yeah,
was she or was Dean Moriarty
God is in every sparrow
plummeting to the ground.
Well put.
Well put.
Or is that old?
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that before.
Is that old or something?
It's a cross reference.
It's James Jones.
God Junior.
God Junior.
God sees every
sparrow.
I was just going to ask you about
the Easter theme.
I am kind of a
thematic Easter thing.
Do you believe in the classical
that God and Jesus is the same
guy? Or do you believe that
God is Jesus is God's
kid? And therefore,
but then see, it wouldn't.
I don't believe in any separation between
God and any atom in the universe.
And so therefore, it's a moot
point. Why are you asking me? I might as
well be a secular humanist, rationalist
subgenius for all
the difference it would make.
I'm actually a totally
mystical,
mystical, cosmic minded philosopher.
I think evil came in.
I think the evil started when they let
them stink in the tomb too long.
Yeah, well, evil started. No, I think evil started when
because we're
the remnants of a burned
out star.
An older star blew up.
We're ruminants like the
carpet part.
We came out of that.
Maybe in that explosion
something went wrong.
I think evil was intended about the
same time as time.
Any explosion, something goes wrong, doesn't it?
I mean, your thumb goes wrong.
As soon as something started to happen, some things were good and some of the things were evil.
There's your yin and yang and your potatoes
right in your thumb.
You know, when you said it was, is that where evil started
with the, any explosion, something can go wrong.
So perhaps if it was like
Jali and like you guys were claiming
that you could hit the wall with your, with your
sperm a couple hours ago, remember when you were bragging
about that? Yeah. God probably
thought he could shoot his seeds
across the entire, you know, it's a big place.
Well, that's called the Milky Way.
Well, that's not the Milky Way.
The fact that it created this beautiful world that we live in
is the good part. And the fact that it created
this hideous world that we live in
is the evil part.
Hmm.
Baby.
You know,
they say the beauty's
only skin deep.
But I know that's not true.
And my advice
is to look
deep within yourself.
And there you'll find
deep down a love
that's true.
Hey, I'm looking deep inside for
Hey, I'll tell you what, right?
Talking about looking deep down, right?
My very, very sexy lady friend
Foxy Fiona called around
to see me the other day, right?
She was having a bit of trouble with her tooth
and asked me if I'd take her to the dentist
in me soft top Bedford Rascal.
Well, our dentist is another very
sexy lady friend of mine called
Jackie. I tell you what,
last time I was sat in her chair,
I told her if she was going to get mine out,
she'd have to give it a really good pull, you know?
I mean, not only was it a big one,
you know, sticking out in front,
but it'd been throbbing like mad all day.
I just couldn't wait for her to grip it firmly
and, you know, yank it until I felt
some relief. Well, I tell you what,
she had no trouble sorting it out.
Before I knew it, I was up, you know,
out of the chair. Mind you, not only
did she rid me of the tooth, it also
cost me 85 quid.
That's the trouble of going private.
Cost you a bomb, doesn't it? Like most dentists,
Jackie's patients are split between
NHS and private. And I've been
told, when it comes down to it,
Jackie appears to be more attentive
to her privates.
Anyway, as it turned out, Foxy Fiona
wasn't going for an extraction.
She was going to see if Jackie could fill
her big cavity. Well, when we got
there, Jackie said she'd be more than happy
to take a look at it straight away.
Well, after asking Foxy Fiona
to lie back and open wide,
sexy Jackie probed round with
a finger for about a minute, before
inserting a big buzzing tool.
Hey, I tell you what, right?
I've never seen such a big dentist drill like it
in my life. Anyway, at the end
of the day, I suppose it was just what
Foxy Fiona needed. And, you know,
she seemed to be relieved. But you must
keep your teeth clean. Preventative
stuff, you see. In fact, I've just
nipped out to get the wife a new toothbrush
from the chemists. You see, for the
past six months, she's been sticking
me big pink one in her mouth twice a day.
Once in the morning, once last thing
at night. Not that I mind it, of course.
But it meant that I used to have to give the
old thing a good clean, you know, before I could
stick it in my own mouth. Anyway,
she also told me to get her some
toothpaste and all, as she also
used to use mine. I mean, the
last time she had mine out in the bathroom,
she squeezed it so hard, a big
white stream shot out the end of it and covered
the mirror. Not only that, it
completely stained the carpet and left
a big blob on me tartan slippers.
You know, the ones that sexy Sam
got me for my birthday.
Took me ages to clean up the mess
I tell you. Still, I tell you what,
at least she does brush her teeth.
Not like Fat Larry's Mrs. Lorna.
She neglected us for years
and now has ended up with a set of
dentures. I tell you what, that
woman has got the biggest pair I have ever
seen in my life. She took them out
once and plunked them in me hand. Wait a
ton they did. I tell you what, I've
got a big gob, but there was no way I
could fit them in. Having said
all that, even without them in,
she still looks very attractive.
Mind you, that's when she has her mouth closed.
Fat Larry said, if she ever parts
her lips, all you can see
is a big mass of pink flesh.
All glistening and wet.
I'm not kidding, she has a set of gums like
you wouldn't believe. Anyway, I got
Fat Harriet a toothbrush and some
toothpaste from the chemists.
Oh, and some dental floss. I mean, I know
she's never used it before, but I'm sure
she'll soon get used to pulling off a good length
and doing the business with it, you know,
in her mouth.
So that's just anecdotal about tooth
stuff, really, you know. Hey, I tell you,
what, I'm glad that tambourine
stopped, aren't you?
Looking deep
inside.
Ah, yes,
friends, Fat Harry White from
his album, Whom Baby,
on the Anxious Records.
Thanks so much to the
Pope Phil Monty in England
for turning us on to that praise.
Isn't it terrible? Yeah, um,
so do you guys realize that today
is not only Friday the 13th, but
um... Okay, now the guy's talking
Japanese, right?
Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.
Were you saying something in Japanese? Like,
I don't know, like, yeah, this guy,
this guy? Yeah, I was just saying
that today is both, uh, the first
Friday the 13th of the new millennium
and Good Friday. Any comments
on that, anyone? Oh, of course.
You know, we can comment up to watch it.
Of course it is. It's 2,000 years ago.
It happened. Come here,
Bray. What happened? What? Come on, baby.
It's insufficient. It really happened.
Do you really believe it happened?
Don't you really get the idea that all of each
being crucified every day of the last 2,000
years? Yeah. I mean, every Friday.
That was probably a Friday the 13th.
He just cried every time.
Every night that the humans sit
and watch TV all night long,
they're like at self-crucifixion.
That's like putting a knife in Mary's
heart. It's like, you know, other Mary's
heart. You make the virgin cry every time.
Every night that you watch that
hit that survivor show,
Jesus cries.
Jesus weeps.
You should be out there.
You should be out in the field.
You should be on that island yourself.
You should be the one floating in that lake.
Building that cross. Crucifying yourself.
Get on up there on Good Friday and get those
nails out and that hammer and pound it home, baby.
I mean, come on. Do your bit.
You're weak. You're weak.
You've got to nail yourself
up on that cross. And how are you
going to get the other hand in after you've done
the first hand? But, boy, do we have
a great deal on crosses for you for this
coming Good Friday coming up tomorrow.
Actually, today. It's actually today.
Well, I really like this lumber
is absolutely porous and will
not stain any of your articles or
deniments. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
That's Jesus at subgenius.com.
If you want to know about
salvation or your $275,
it's
Jesus at subgenius.com.
It's not
ESO radio.
And it's not
revered
at the hour of black.
And it ain't loans from Calvary.
It's all by himself, brother.
It's you.
It's you and me.
It's between you and Bob.
You don't need to hear a media area
of a preacher.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You don't need a preacher. You just need Bob.
You don't need Reverend Stanton.
You don't need
Karen Schilling.
You don't need the back.
You don't need the evidence.
You don't need that antidote.
You only need one thing. That's Bob.
And a little frog, probably.
And, uh...
When God
come back on
a happy Easter's day
and it carries
a lace around the flowers
and everybody pukes on his
head.
I love you, boy.
And I'm gonna date you, Bucky, woman.
I'm going down.
All right, man.
He's going down.
If the last 50 years
made such a change,
just imagine the New York of 1980
when everyone has a number
instead of a name
and the government tells you
whom you should marry.
Let him that hath understanding
count the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man.
Number of a man.
His number is
six hundred
threescore
and six.
Nodding.
Nodding.

Can we do the stations of the cross now?
Okay, ready?
Um, what is it...
Hap, heep.
Hap, heep, heep.
Gotta get in line
if you're gonna do them.
Remember, every time you gene inflict,
you wanna flip of a little prayer
this way or that way, okay?
This way.
Let's pray this way. Let's pray that way.
Get down on your knees and bend over.
Jesus has his face wiped by the women.
Jesus has his nose flexed by the man next door.
Is that what Jesus was doing under them women?
Jesus flares his nostrils.
Jesus cries out in pain,
Why don't you leave me alone?
Come on, Chaz, we've only got seven more to go, or twelve, or whatever.
I'm sorry.
Jesus pulls his hat down tight over his eyes.
Jesus forgives the Sagittarians for plummeting his mothbroughs.
Jesus falls for the nineteenth time.
Ow!
That's blasphemous, you guys.
Jesus takes the thorn of crowns and uses it as a fetish device on Mary Magdalene.
I am so glad I wasn't raised religious.
Jesus prepares the onion dip before receiving Golgotha.
You know, I didn't get any of that.
I took some serious S&M ass-whippin' from them nuns.
I can say anything I want.
Yeah, you know, it's funny, uh...
Chaz went to serious, serious school.
I was in college.
People are always there saying,
Reverend Stang, what religion burned your brain?
You must really hate some religion.
Was the nuns wrapping your hands with those rulers, or what?
It's like, no, my family didn't really particularly go to church or anything.
We were...
You're a rationalist family.
Sort of, yeah.
Actually, my dad is like a lay preacher and knows more about the Bible than most preachers do.
So those guys just have to lay down all the time?
For that matter, I know more about the Bible than most Christians do.
But I...
That...
You know, I never did go...
Know much about those rituals of the Catholics or the Presb...
Actually, the Presbyterians have some...
Are, you know, kind of lively.
Do they have rituals?
What are their rituals?
I just...
The tonguers are my favorite, of course.
The what-ers?
The tonguers.
Those are the ones that speak in tongues.
Oh, the tonguers.
There are many different types of tonguers.
That's what the other Christian nuts, who aren't quite as crazy as the tonguers, call
the tonguers.
Those are the folks who put the pits in the cream cheese?

I heard a guy tell me about the tonguers.
He was going...
They're just crazy.
He just suddenly started talking these nonsense.
They're going to go to hell.
You know, they're going to have to answer to God for that.
And then he told me about Jamaicans.
He goes, I was going to answer to Jamaica.
That is what those men do.
They put cow dung in their hair.
They put cow dung in their hair.
And they said to me, they're going to have to answer to God for that.
I just see these Jamaican guys standing in front of God.
Chad, don't you think that's kind of strange?
Explaining the cow dung in their hair.
And then the...
And God's going to answer to God for that.
And God goes, cool.
Yeah, I think God would love a Rastaman.
And then God would go, you know what?
I already knew that because I'm you and that cow dung.
I thought...
I thought John was a Rastaman.
And they'll go, man, that's what I was hoping.
I was hoping that there was an answer, that it was true and good and right.
And you are me and you are the cow dung.
And we're all one and we're all together.
Praise God.
I think I'd like to live in a world where that cow dung can not only talk and not only
make distinctions in the game, but also make people laugh.

Concentration at the end of the tip of your nose and to your navel for approximately five minutes.
While looking at your watch, making sure to count slowly, breathing through your ears.
One.
Breathe out through your eyes.
In through your ears.
Out through your eyes.
Now everything you've heard you will smell and you will see everything you've heard after you smell it.
Now when the navel is calmed, think of the navel as the entire center of the universe.
I would like to transplant a few of you wonderful people I've met here on earth in my short brief stay in your world.
The Christ, a cowboy friend of mine.
We played wood chips together and stocked ourselves full of the latest stockings and cooperated.
That's the key word here.
Cooperation.
And you, I remember you the day they nailed you to the solar helix.
Did you know that if abortion had been legal in Bob's day, that Bob would not have been born?
Is this true?
Did you know that Bob is an abortion survivor?
He was Bob as an infant.
He survived an abortion.
He was his mom, bless her sweet virgin heart, Jane Dobbs.
Jane McBride Dobbs was giving birth to this child, which she did not, for various reasons,
and having nothing to do with a Mayan dad, did not want.
She did not want the child, Bob.
Believe it or not.
Don't you think you should leave sleeping jizz live?
She attempted to have an abortion of the child, Bob, but they could not get him out.
Bob loved the womb so much.
They could not.
The forceps of the abortionist doctor could not yank the fetus, Bob, out.
They ripped and tore at him.
A tornado came, finally.
A Kansas, well, I didn't want to say what state this was in, but the state where Bob was born in.
A giant twister came and yanked the baby Bob out of the womb of Jane Dobbs.
And that was the only way that Bob was finally aborted.
And yet, he still lived on.
The tiny, preemie fetus, Bob.
Bob, with his rudimentary pipe, whining there in that Kansas wheat field, yet lived.
And when Jane saw him, she wept and cried and knew that she had done a wrong thing to try to have an abortion.
And she decided to raise him, since he couldn't be killed, obviously, anyway.
And held him, cradled in that wheat field with blood pouring from between her legs as the tornado went away.
So Bob survived that abortion attempt.
But you just remember that if abortion...
It would have been legal back in 1929, and Bob wouldn't be with us today.
Well, tell us, in that wheat field, what did Bob live off of?
And what did he...
Call him a call.
Yeah, what did he...
What happened there?
Well, then his mom loved him.
Once he was born, of course, when she saw him, she instantly fell under his charismatic sway.
And babied him and spoiled him and loved him.
I mean, he was a preemie, I guess, of like six weeks old.
So he's probably about that long.
They say that a...
Fetus has no soul.
But Bob, at that age, did.
He even had a tiny pipe.
He was just a cluster of cells with a little pipe.
Yes, but he...
And a soul.
Well, or whatever passes first.
But no brain.
He never did develop a brain.
As far as we know, during the autopsy, the first autopsy, showed no sign of a brain at all.
There was a root-like network from the pipe going back up into the cranium.
But there was no actual brain.
No fluid, nothing.
There was a brain once for two weeks, and he never gave it back.
Well, you know...
Now, normally, Bob doesn't keep all your brain.
He gives mostly, usually...
He may be...
You may get it back yet.
Yeah.
Pope Monty, you may get your brain back yet someday.
And you may be sorry that you ever wished for it back from Bob.
Who knows what it's seen?
It has seen things.
Things I'm scared to even think about right now.
It's good, Joe.
I can't think.
Because I never got my brain back.
Bob, he's still got your brain.
He's still got my brain!
If he put it back, he'd probably go insane after what he's done with it.
It's immortality.
It was a price more costly than death.
Time control can only go awry.
And then May 12th coming up next month, just like a month from now, just about there,
ESO Reverend Adam saying, Princess We Are Dull, is she going to rant?
No.
That poster is...
It's by Reverend Gio, and I think he was just, you know, assuming that...
Okay.
Since she was around and she's so famous and beautiful and everything, they need to advertise her.
She rarely does...
Yeah, that's...
They did a bunch of techno stuff that is on the lovely Bob Song CDs, and they're going to do a little bit of...
Well, if ESO doesn't start rehearsing soon, we're going to sound probably good.
I was around when Jesus Christ had his moment.
Let's just get off the air and go smoke dope in the parking lot.
I'm for that.
Except now they're going to be out there wanting some.
Everybody, let's go over to Moe's.
Yeah, let's go to Moe's.
All right, all you listeners out there.
Let's go do some ohms at Moe's.
Yeah, all you listeners out there want to meet us up for a beer, we're going to go head over to Moe's right after we get off the air here.
So, we'll see you there.
Exactly.
And alcohol again.
Let's go.
Come on over to my joint.
Let's go.
So, we're going to do Sympathy at the Divival.
All right.
We'll have the biggest Dobbs head in the world and Einstein's Secret Orchestra doing Sympathy for the Devil in front of the Dobbs head painted by Jesus.
With the blood of virgins splitting all over the stage.
And we'll be chopping the heads off Christians to the beat.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.

Please.
Please.

Please.

Please.
It was you and me.
Let me please introduce myself.
I'm the man of wealth and taste.
I ain't trash for troubadours.
Who can kill the boys?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Crazy Bob Bob.
Sending you $30.
Sending your $30 right now to the mailing address.
Post Office Box 140306.
Dallas, Texas, USA.
Send in your money or this shall be the sound of alien spacecraft bombing your house.
Crazy Bob.
Am I still entitled to salvation?
You're still entitled to suffering.
Well, or triple your money back, right?
I mean, well, did you pay your $30?
Yeah.
It's pretty simple.
If you put your $30 in, you get $90 back if you didn't.
Now think about it.
If you're not saved and you want to be saved with triple your money back guarantee
and be able to come out to Brushwood and party with the cool guys,

You're not going to be able to do that.


Coolest people.
You have to, what, dial up a little envelope there to P.O. Box.
Friend, all you got to do is just look at the sub site on the web.
Oh, www.subgenius.com.
Or just say, just to peel back your skull.
We're not trying to get money out of radio listeners on this college station.
All you need to do, shut up, Dave, is write P.O. Box 140306.
That's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.
Go, Dave, go!
No.
I ruined it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, I was just talking about you.
I had to do the P.O. Box and I was imitating Chaz.
It's so funny when Chaz goes, shut up, Dave.
I think it's one of the funniest things I ever hear.
I wait to hear that all the time.
Well, look at my hair.
People are talking over each other.
You can't hear either one.
What can I do to make up for it, Dave?
Let me talk for the next 10 minutes.
No, wait a minute.
You guys.
All right.
Okay.
All right.
We'll just give it to you.
No, he just said, what can I do to make up for it?
Okay.
Turn off his mic, too.
Now, turn off my mic.
Oh, here.
Okay, turn off my mic.
Now, isn't that better?
Than what?
Man.
It's like...
Bergman knew how to use silence.
I bought it there.
Sign theater.
My cheekbones hurt.
