1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,480
We now return control of your television set to you

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,800
until next week at this same time

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,500
when the control voice will take you to...

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,220
Bob!

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,420
From the land beyond beyond.

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,720
From the world past hope and fear.

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,100
I bid you, Bob, now appear.

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,220
Oh my gosh.

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,580
Oh my gosh.

10
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:56,620
Bob!

11
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,580
Bob!

12
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,180
Bob!

13
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,440
The following transcribed program is transcribed.

14
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,780
Friends, if you like rubbers, let's keep punching Bob till the Japs get theirs.

15
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,140
Tonight, as usual, Bob brings you Final Victory.

16
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,320
Meanwhile, don't hear Bob the greatest name in rubber.

17
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,160
I don't want to be no human being.

18
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,360
I don't want to be no human being.

19
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,120
No!

20
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,400
Don't you call me no human being.

21
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,060
I ain't no human being.

22
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,900
Good work.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,280
I'm a no good low down on principle crook.

24
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,520
We want you to know that we will interrupt this program instantly.

25
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,360
Bob?

26
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,440
Bob?

27
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,060
Bob?

28
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:54,540
Bob?

29
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,400
Bob?

30
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,720
Bob?

31
00:02:59,720 --> 00:02:59,840
Bob?

32
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,580
Bob?

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,240
Bob?

34
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,760
Bob?

35
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,260
Bob?

36
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,740
Bob?

37
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:02,980
Bob?

38
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,260
Bob?

39
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:03,560
Bob?

40
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:03,560


41
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:03,600
Bob?

42
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,260
Bob?

43
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:04,260


44
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:04,260


45
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:04,260


46
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:04,260


47
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,120
This is a coordinated monthly test of the broadcast stations of your area.

48
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,660
Equipment that can quickly warn you during emergencies is being tested.

49
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:11,900
Bob?

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,180
If this had been an actual emergency, official messages would have followed the alert tone.

51
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,300
Bob?

52
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:16,560
Bob?

53
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,160
This station serves the area.

54
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:18,520
Bob?

55
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:18,740
Bob?

56
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,300
This concludes this test of the emergency alert system.

57
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,080
Bob?

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,260
Bob?

59
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,960
Attention please.

60
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,640
Please, attention please. The commanding general will speak to you. Stand by.

61
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,740
Friends, it is imperative that you listen closely.

62
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,800
We're coming. Better see if they're strapped down.

63
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,480
The women here have been praying for God's help and guidance.

64
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,480
Julie's coming.

65
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,280
Not your kind of hypocritical praying, but the kind that comes from deep inside a man.

66
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,480
I'm sorry. I'll come back later.

67
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,060
No, no, Eddie. We can't put things off till later.

68
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,540
Go.

69
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,640
We're the lucky ones.

70
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,980
I told you this would happen.

71
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,980
Now, to again emphasize our problem, most of it will be consumed,

72
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,540
but then, in turning completely around, every ounce will be needed to avoid crashing.

73
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,300
You don't know what people will do to avoid crashing.

74
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,660
Because in these boxes we have placed numbered disks.

75
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,700
Of doom.

76
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,020
And so will you.

77
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,280
One disk.

78
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,080
Of doom.

79
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,860
, destroyed the atomic bomb.

80
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,420
The world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on thousands and thousands of young Americans.

81
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,580
We shall continue to use it until we completely destroy the atomic bomb.

82
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,320
Destroyed, destroyed the atomic bomb.

83
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,800
Hey, the new year is coming, hallelujah.

84
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,880
Well, when I was up vomiting.

85
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,580
Seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

86
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,460
Amen.

87
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,620
Surprise, surprise.

88
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,980
And this ministry is...

89
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,640
Loving.

90
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,860
We love you.

91
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,740
Skate, all skate.

92
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,220
Bear bundle ladies choice skate.

93
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,660
Choice USDA rump all ladies choice.

94
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,780
Hey.

95
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,200
Hey.

96
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,560
Hey.

97
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:25,820


98
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:25,940
Hey.

99
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:25,940


100
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,180
Hey.

101
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,240


102
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,160
Hey.

103
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,160


104
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,160


105
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,160


106
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,160


107
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,160


108
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,120
Ain't nobody, Ain't nobody.

109
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,340
A more method than duck choice!

110
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,680
A more method than duck choice!

111
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:37,760
...

112
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,920
We'd like to remind the duck people to stop humping in the middle of ...

113
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,060
... Odd 키� consistence.

114
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:53,940
of ak...

115
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,280
It's not a time.

116
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,940
Become dull.

117
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:55,940


118
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:55,940


119
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:55,940


120
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:08,460
program. No time. There's no time. Shaggin' Hussain, your teeth are wearing down. Your

121
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:15,820
canine incisors are those of an evil dearest. That just sounds like another plate. Just

122
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:25,740
sounds like one of the many plates in my head. Just another plate in my head. When I come

123
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:33,300
back from Iraq, I have the Gulf War Syndrome. I have the psychosocial panic plaque in my

124
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:41,520
heart. You'll be Gulf Warped. I have a displaced ticket book. All of my tickets are punched

125
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,880
and I have bad kidneys.

126
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,240
We don't want to replace you, Sergeant. We just want to replace you with a fighting machine

127
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,880
that's capable of fighting like a machine without eating rice or beans or eggs or living

128
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,420
silently alone and masturbating himself to sleep. No, we want a super soldier, my friend,

129
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,060
not the Hunan bean.

130
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:14,180
I have no problem with your fight. I play with my nozzle already, even trying to fight

131
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,860
you, doesn't it?

132
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,700
I'd love to.

133
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,640
I think that's so important to everybody. To me, it's just another monkey.

134
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:32,180
Yeah, sure, it was just another monkey until we tapped him. Yeah, that's what we call it

135
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,840
at the old institution. The institution for higher one-eyed blind science. You're our

136
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,900
favorite secret society. You're our favorite member. You're our favorite glistening golden

137
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,480
member.

138
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,700
Yeah, stupid son of a bitch.

139
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:59,560
George Bush was tapped by discovered crossbones in 1968. And since those days of yally holly

140
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,240
tides at Yale U, he's done more than a few favors for more than a few fields of his own

141
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,780
personal qualities. Let's name them!

142
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,360
Who took my girl away?

143
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,120
And what do my dollary people have here?

144
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,740
These are lavatories, and central stations, and once a formerly great place of business,

145
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,680
and also a transportation channel that lovely blocked thousands from view. You can make

146
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,440
it down to some of those husky sub-Norwegian plots that's down the road. You can drop

147
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,980
pretty much everything without fear of the rats eating it.

148
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,700
I would like to remind each soldier about to give his or her individual life or lives

149
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,560
that you give it not only for the United Snakes of America, but you give it for Halliburton

150
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:42,840
Inc.

151
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,480
For Exxon, for the mobile Exxon, for BP, for Dutch Mobile Air, for fried suits and the

152
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,240
gristly air.

153
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:52,560
Ah!

154
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,400
I'm at Carrots Glen.

155
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,980
Are you gonna put up with that?

156
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,460
HECKATEEN!

157
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:57,580
NO!

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,920
Keep on dyin', keep on dyin', keep on dyin', keep on dyin'.

159
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,280
The bullets flyin', the bullets flyin', keep on dyin'.

160
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,280


161
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,120
Keep on dyin'.

162
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,460
Keep on dyin'.

163
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:14,460


164
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:14,880
Keep on dyin', keep on dyin'.

165
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,620
Keep on dyin'.

166
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,380
I had a strangest dream.

167
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,020
I dreamed it was over the plains near Passa.

168
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,740
I call it a desert, but it's still not a real desert.

169
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,240
It was a man with a pipe stuck in his pookie, smoking his furnace and drinking.

170
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,080
I think I'm gonna be alright man, I took too much of the fucking acid.

171
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,460
I think it was a dream, but it's still not a real desert.

172
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:44,460


173
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:44,460


174
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,440
I am the blood of Galah.

175
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,600
I am the menstrual blood of the world.

176
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,720
No, man, I think you're an idiot.

177
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,180
I'm gonna have to shoot you.

178
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,600
Okay, okay, so we got our freedom.

179
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,760
But management's lousin' up everything.

180
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,380
Labor is at fault.

181
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,000
It's ruining the country.

182
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,920
My constituents, as your elected representative,

183
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,960
I can assure you labor's right.

184
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,580
Management's right.

185
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,740
I'm strictly neutral.

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,740
Labor, management, politicians, phooey.

187
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,060
They can't tell corn from oats.

188
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,560
Work, work, work, work, work, work.

189
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,140
Hurry, hurry, hurry, step right up, folks.

190
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,380
Here's the answer to your problems,

191
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,060
Dr. Utopia's sensational new discovery, ism.

192
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,660
Ism will cure any ailment of the body politic.

193
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,780
It's terrific, it's tremendous.

194
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,040
Once you swallow the contents of this bottle,

195
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,060
you'll have the bountiful benefit of higher wages,

196
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,320
shorter hours, and security.

197
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,420
Enormous profits, no strikes.

198
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,880
Remember, you're the big boss.

199
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,900
Government control, no worry about votes.

200
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,200
Name your own salary.

201
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,900
Bigger crops, lower costs.

202
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,360
Why, ism even makes the weather perfect every day.

203
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,320
And now then, because we are introducing this amazing item

204
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,380
for the first time in this country,

205
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,000
it isn't going to cost you one cent.

206
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,360
All you have to do is sign this little scrap of paper,

207
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,580
and you get your bottle absolutely free.

208
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,700
I hereby turn over to ism, Incorporated,

209
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,720
everything I have, including my freedom,

210
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,920
and the freedom of my children,

211
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,740
and my children's children,

212
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,640
in return for which said ism promises to take care of me forever.

213
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,940
I will kill you, folks.

214
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,660
I will kill you.

215
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,540
I will kill you.

216
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:42,760
I will kill you.

217
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:42,900
Too much.

218
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,060
Ah, get out of the way.

219
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,760
This is PR News from North Carolina,

220
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,700
offering weapons of mass destruction

221
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,260
to most of the people who are still in Washington.

222
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,800

This is PR News.

229
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:21,260
UN weapons inspectors have begun examining Iraq's 12 people who are still without weapons of mass destruction.

230
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,720
Iraq submitted its opposition groups door-to-door yesterday in Venezuela.

231
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,560
The U.S. and the four other pages of information on its permanent UN Security Council members

232
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,100
following last week's snow and ice storm on its weapons program.

233

From Chicago, PR Radio, opposition groups report.

234
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,300
Anti-government forces say they have failed to report to some unqualified leftist president

235
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,920
and could cause a plot to overthrow him.

236
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,740
It's unclear whether the United States is crude.

237
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,100
Maracas.

At least the National Guard went door-to-door yesterday offering weapons in Venezuela.

242
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,680
This is NPR.

247
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,440
The city.

248
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,420
I can see it all now.

00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,560
It's high.

261
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,540
Closing down on you.

262
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,980
From every side that you can't breathe.

263
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,140
Closer.

264
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:47,980
Closer.

265
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,140
You can't breathe.

266
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,220
The traffic.

267
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,600
You can't think.

268
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,680
Beep, beep.

269
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,440
Beep, beep.

270
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,460
Look out for that truck.

271
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,540
Honk, honk.

272
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,560
Look out for that taxi.

273
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,360
Boing.

274
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,340
Beep, beep.

275
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,260
Arrrr.

276
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,540
Honk, honk.

277
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,160
Beep, beep.

278
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,160

279
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,160


280
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,260
What's that?

281
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,420
Look.

282
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:07,800
Look.

283
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,000
It's the towers.

284
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,560
They're falling.

285
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,720
Arrrr.

286
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,720
He can't stand dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous weapons.

287
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,660
Of course you realize this means war.

288
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,580
According to one conspiracy, the trade centers were faked.

289
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,780
That is something that will take us a long time.

290
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,200
It will take us a long time to wrap ourselves around.

291
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:47,440
Now whether what we were watching were simulation exercises being transmitted as the real event,

292
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,360
it's a possibility which needs to be examined.

293
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,080
It needs to be examined closely.

294
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,880
There has in fact been almost a media blackout, a kind of a deliberate American policy that's

295
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,680
been basically there since the war in Vietnam and we saw it in the Falklands War and the

296
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,620
Gulf War and now in the NATO war against the former Yugoslavia.

297
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:07,780
And it's been there for a long time.

298
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:12,420
And now again in Afghanistan where the military do not want the media to be involved and the

299
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,620
American media have been complaining bitterly that they haven't got access to what's been

300
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,080
going on.

301
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,100
They didn't destroy the two towers.

302
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,460
It just didn't seem real.

303
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,980
They didn't destroy the two towers.

304
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,000
We thought it was something out of out of a movie.

305
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,120
Just a little while ago one of the volunteers who tried to go down there and help report

306
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,500
it back and said that you actually got to the scene at the World Trade Center what was

307
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,760
most remarkable, what was most amazing, what was most essential.

308
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:37,760


309
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,100
most horrifying is that basically nothing was happening. This is nearly a

310
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,500
10-acre site deep in the Nevada desert. They didn't destroy the two towers, they

311
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:53,900
destroyed a number of buildings, a lot of open space. A secret film studio deep in

312
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,340
the Nevada desert. Here, two hijacked planes slamming into the World Trade

313
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,620
Center were staged and filmed before the footage was transmitted to a gullible

314
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,200
world. At the World Trade Center, what was most remarkable, what was most amazing, what was

315
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,260
most horrifying is that basically nothing was happening. Basically nothing

316
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,540
was happening. Basically nothing was happening. Basically nothing was

317
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,380
happening. Basically nothing was happening. There's enough evidence there to make me doubt.

318
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,420
That is something that will take us a long time to wrap ourselves around. Now

319
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,980
whether what we were watching were simulation exercises. They didn't destroy

320
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:35,080
the two towers. Being transmitted as the real event. They didn't destroy the two towers. It's a possibility which needs to be examined. They didn't destroy the two towers.

321
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,940
It's such a multilayered and

322
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,180
complex

323
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:43,140
complex situations needs to be examined closely. In order to retain the prestige

324
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,180
of American industry throughout the world, they had to fake it.

325
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:58,380
Private, public, and the rest of you guys with funny names. Mount your pieces, lock and load.

326
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:06,580
Hand on over here by the perimeter. Stop laughing, the IRACs could hear you and blow your head off. Okay.

327
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:12,500
See that over there? That is a fully transitional lunar module capable of

328
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,500
risking us out of here in a matter of five seconds if we so desire. If not, we

329
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:24,200
may take that objective below. See it? Put on your night glasses. There it is. See it moving around like little blue snakes.

330
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,980
I can't see nothing, man. This ain't working. These night glasses ain't working.

331
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:36,560
Get your earmuffs off your eyes. Take his earmuffs off his eyes. There's no reason why. There you go. Now see them little blue snakes moving around?

332
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:42,260
Yeah, cool. Those are Saddam Hussein's. The evilest, vilest critter ever invented.

333
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:48,300
I hate them Saddam Hussein's. Each one of them's got a weapons of mass destruction. That's right. See that one over there?

334
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,700
He's got a weapons of mass destruction. Yeah, and he just... I got one right here. Want to see it?

335
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,700
Oh, no. Put that thing away. All right. You think you're going to get off that?

336
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,240
That looks like a great big giant motorized vehicle. Yeah, I think he's overexposed himself.

337
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,400
He can go back from the front. He can go back home. There's no way. What do you do with it?

338
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,020
What do you do with it? You're going to get banged down.

339
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:16,780
Is he torturing a prisoner with a banged down? No, I think the prisoner enjoys being tortured in that way.

340
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,140
It's not real torture.

341
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,740
Well, I think that you're going to let him go and let him go and let him go and let him go.

342
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:36,100
You're going to let him go and let him go and let him go and let him go.

343
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,560
Yes.

344
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,180
I'm going to let him go.

345
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,180


346
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,100
Yes, I'm going to let him go.

347
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,600
Oh, my God.

348
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:54,980
Oh, my God.

349
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,500
Oh, my God.

350
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:56,940
Oh, my God.

351
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:57,340
Oh, my God.

352
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,220
Oh, my God.

353
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,300
Baby, my baby!

354
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,020
Baby, my baby!

355
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,920
Yes, and that last horrible, horrible noise

356
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,820
was my baby, my baby by Blue Marmalade

357
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,300
off of the old subgenius album called Bad Doctors.

358
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,780
Also, of course, we heard ESO Swamp Radio

359
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,560
from WCSB in Cleveland with host Chaz Smith,

360
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:21,000
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Princess Wee, and yours,

361
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,400
truly Reverend Ivan Stad.

362
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,800
The Great Twin Towers Hive

363
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,140
The hoax, that collage about the hoax

364
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:37,680
of the Twin Towers, and there's more of that to come, by the way,

365
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,820
is by Reverend Buttress O'Neill.

366
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,820
Buttress O'Neill, that's spelled O-apostrophe-K-N-E-E-L.

367
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,660
Buttress O'Neill, I believe from Australia

368
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,580
or one of those under-down places.

369
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,800
And, yes, Buttress O'Neill and Colossus,

370
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,960
mega conspiracies.

371
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,140
Friends, we've had a lot of cuts and clips in this

372
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,120
and surrounding Hour of Slack shows

373
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,120
from New Monet and Artemia Salina

374
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,560
and others on alt.binaries.slack

375
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,520
who've contributed a lot of cuts,

376
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,300
but everything else on this show,

377
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,760
I mean, all the collages on this particular show

378
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,240
are by Fernanda Nande-Limor,

379
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,980
all those amazing cut-ups of sound,

380
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,800
the great...

381
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,040
Fernanda Nande-Limor.

382
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,720
Well, also, I found this great old cartoon

383
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,560
called Make Mine Freedom.

384
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,000
We heard some of that.

385
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,020
And because this war stuff,

386
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,480
friends, it's gotten even me upset.

387
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,880
It's gotten so weird.

388
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,560
Like the other day when all of our watches and clocks

389
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,940
suddenly switched over from, you know,

390
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,280
regular civilian time to military 0800 type time.

391
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,540
So, now...

392
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,220
Then you have them read.

393
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,740
You say cranky and ornery, man.

394
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,200
Moby Dick.

395
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,140
Your watch went over to military time.

396
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,300
Remember John Goose Passage?

397
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,420
Yeah, it's still...

398
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,720
And I can't get it to go back to regular 12.

399
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,400
And yeah, my computer clock went over to military time

400
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:10,820
all of a sudden.

401
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,740
But they'll read it backwards.

402
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,500
No, it still says 2003,

403
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,900
but it went into military, you know,

404
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,440
22 instead of 10 o'clock.

405
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,200
Well, we are all on military time now.

406
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,660
And time is running out.

407
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,980
If we'd like to quote Mr. George W. for war...

408
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,460
The balloon toots have dropped.

409
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,540
The balloon toots have hit the...

410
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,600
The fatula.

411
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,600
And the...

412
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,100
The...

413
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,620
The fat is...

414
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,380
The chase is on.

415
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,420
The fat is...

416
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,040
Hit the griddle.

417
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,340
Sliding.

418
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,760
Well, actually, no, it's...

419
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,520
The race is running.

420
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:37,880
There are weeks...

421
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,660
Here comes heartbreak,

422
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,840
hung up behind the...

423
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,480
There are weeks...

424
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:41,560
Don't say that.

425
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,980
Of surroundings to happen.

426
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,840
Weeks of smallpox inoculations for the lucky.

427
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,480
And weeks of procrastination for the guilty.

428
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,320
In front of the head of the smallpox goddess,

429
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,200
thousands and thousands...

430
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,700
Millions.

431
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,600
Millions of snakes.

432
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,180
Electees ready to be inovulated,

433
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,520
as the president likes to call it.

434
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:04,840
Round her head.

435
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,300
Inovulated with the smallest pox they can find.

436
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:13,180
Micro-inventesimal tiny little pox.

437
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,800
Tiny inoculations.

438
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,580
When you rub them,

439
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,160
the liquid gel forms behind your eye cataracts

440
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,840
and above in your modula oblongata.

441
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,280
Get the shot.

442
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,420
Be the shot.

443
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,920
It's good for you.

444
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,160
Take it.

445
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,220
Take your best shot.

446
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,540
The tiny nanobots in the smallpox vaccinations

447
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,800
are there for your protection, your security.

448
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,040
Already I can feel the cinch

449
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,520
of a powerful missile system surrounding America.

450
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,320
You'll never be lost, my friend.

451
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,680
You may not know where you are,

452
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,560
but the great geosynchronous satellites always will.

453
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,180
And the great geodesic domes,

454
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,320
much like the random pillows...

455
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,740
The geodes in the prisoner will follow you

456
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,980
and take you back, number seven.

457
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,200
Take you back.

458
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,280
I am not a number.

459
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,360
I am a teeny tiny little tiny little man.

460
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,420
No, the next version of that show,

461
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,840
the guy will be running around going,

462
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,940
I am not a free man, I am a number.

463
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,940
I am number six.

464
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,940
The 2000, yeah.

465
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,980
You are number one.

466
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,260
I'm telling you, man, I'm a gas station.

467
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,220
We want you to get the hell out.

468
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,680
You are number one.

469
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,580
Tell them I am God number one.

470
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,660
Mm-hmm.

471
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,860
It's time to dance.

472
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,080
No, I'm saying, no, I'm saying.

473
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,760
No, you're saying, no, you're saying.

474
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,600
It's time to release the...

475
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,120
What's that aroma in the air?

476
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,480
Oh, I guess one of those trouser ghosts is moaning.

477
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,980
I think it's maybe something more bachotastylistic than that.

478
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,640
You know, Cleveland is a testosterone city

479
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,240
for those.

480
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,440
The wonderful inovulations our president

481
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,740
will be offering soon.

482
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,180
Oh, really?

483
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:03,920
Oh, really.

484
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,460
Are we one of the sample towns?

485
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,740
Yes, we're a sampling town.

486
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,300
They're taking DNA and little skull samples

487
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,260
from the people here and spreading them

488
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,000
across their sandwiches and slides

489
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,400
in Washington, D.C.

490
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:16,940
They're missing...

491
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,000
Or Dietrich, Maryland.

492
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,660
Yes.

493
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,160
Oh, yes.

494
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,660
I love that.

495
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,860
Brewing up a nice cocktail

496
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,360
for all the good American boys and girls.

497
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,620
Now, I got my flu shot.

498
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,340
Did you?

499
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:27,980
In...

500
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,720
In September or so.

501
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,120
And then I got the flu in January.

502
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,220
And I wonder what else was in the shot.

503
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,680
I mean, because they didn't put the...

504
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,060
The flu in my collection was only half good.

505
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,060
Well, sign away my freedom.

506
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,320
Why, this is ridiculous.

507
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,960
Don't be corny, brother.

508
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

509
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,720
Sure, our system of free enterprise isn't perfect.

510
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,880
But before we throw it away

511
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,920
for some...

512
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,600
Imported double talk,

513
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,360
let's turn the clock back a few years

514
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,120
to see what it's done for us.

515
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,520
The search for conspiracy is the search for explanation.

516
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,100
And in many cases, in many mysteries,

517
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,580
a conspiracy is a very plausible first hypothesis.

518
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,040
Two hijacked planes slamming into the World Trade Center.

519
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,380
And then shortly afterwards, we had reports from Washington

520
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,580
of an attack on the Pentagon.

521
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,060
A question I'd like to put to our listeners

522
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,200
on the evening show tonight.

523
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,960
Do you feel that the coverage of the Pentagon,

524
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,180
and the perspectives you're getting,

525
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,460
that you're receiving through the various forms of media

526
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,460
that you receive, that you consume,

527
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,420
that perhaps you pursue,

528
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,840
do you feel like you're getting a pluralist view?

529
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,940
Are you hearing different perspectives?

530
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,440
Do you have a prismatic view?

531
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,860
I guess that's another way of asking it.

532
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,600
Do you hear dissenting voices,

533
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,820
voices that are questioning orthodoxy?

534
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,760
Because none of these things are straightforward.

535
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,720
Obviously, there is no one given truth in all this.

536
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,960
It's a very complex and very multifaceted event originally

537
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,140
and what's happened since.

538
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,840
I'm just wondering how you judge

539
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,720
what you've been able to learn through the media.

540
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,800
We saw them in front of our eyes being pulverized,

541
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,060
disintegrated in just a few seconds.

542
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,980
Obviously, gripping television.

543
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,660
But did it actually happen?

544
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,820
Everything seems to be wrong with everything

545
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,320
regarding the record.

546
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,440
It was surreal.

547
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,060
As we looked at it, we thought it was something out of a movie.

548
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,580
Why is there a cover-up over what happened?

549
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,860
It's very simple, really.

550
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,600
There is supposed to be a cover-up.

551
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,760
It's official policy.

552
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,940
And now, of course, the towers became martyrs.

553
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,420
But did it actually happen?

554
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,040
Or is there a darker side?

555
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,740
It just didn't seem real.

556
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,140
They became the first skyscraper martyrs

557
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,920
that have ever been.

558
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,140
It is an amazing thing to walk up and down the streets

559
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,860
and see vendors on the sidewalks

560
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,740
selling pictures of the World Trade Center

561
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,140
in the way they might have sold pictures of Martin Luther King

562
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,740
or Elvis Presley or something.

563
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,700
They're now selling pictures of a building of the World Trade Center.

564
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,200
I thought, that's what I'm watching.

565
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,340
It must be true.

566
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,800
We saw them in front of our eyes.

567
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,840
And I thought, this is amazing.

568
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,780
We saw them in front of our eyes.

569
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,220
And I thought, that's what I'm watching.

570
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,340
It must be true.

571
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,660
Disintegrated in just a few seconds.

572
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,960
But did it actually happen the way we've been shown?

573
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,760
They didn't destroy the two towers.

574
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,400
Or is there a darker side?

575
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,740
It just didn't seem real.

576
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:25,820
It just didn't seem real.

577
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,740
It just didn't seem real.

578
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,160
It just didn't seem real.

579
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,760
It just didn't seem real.

580
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,040
It just didn't seem real.

581
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,500
It just didn't seem real.

582
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,700
Now let's see what's happening to Judy and Jimmy and the Cinnamon Bear.

583
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,000
We left them at the bottom of the root beer ocean

584
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,560
where their airplane was forced down

585
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,060
after the Cinnamon Bear overtook the airplane.

586
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,860
This made them very sad.

587
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,420
And they were even sadder

588
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,320
when Cinnamon Bear told them there was no way to get out

589
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,780
and quench the hole in the fuel tank

590
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,180
and slush all the soda pop gas.

591
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,180
and slush all the soda pop gas.

592
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,660
and slush all the soda pop gas.

593
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,160


594
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,560
And they pulled apart first,

595
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:14,560


596
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,480
It took them two hours for two cars to get out at the bottom of the hole and quickly pull the truckущ

597
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,380
of four cars suddenly get off the ground and their back washed down into dirt.

598
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,160
combined with jerk forcing the three of them to turn

599
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,720
The whole thing in one go was just the way she would have shifted,

600
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:25,720


601
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,860
Great moments in oddball sports.

602
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,440
That's an excerpt from Saint.

603
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,120
Tentatively a convenience.

604
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,520
Convenience.

605
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,040
The material there from the bad doctors of genius tape.

606
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,520
And this music in the background, by the way, is the amino acids.

607
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,100
You might check out theaminoacids.com.

608
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,360
They're in Detroit, and we're hoping to do a revival with them soon.

609
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,980
All your words is on TV now.

610
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,660
What is this?

611
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,600
It's all broadcast.

612
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,180
You don't tell her vision.

613
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,740
Nobody dies.

614
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:02,100
You see what happens is you point one of them guns at the robot over there,

615
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,360
and you hear a loud kibble, and if you're successful, that robot's out of action.

616
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,800
Now, these here weapons are so smart, they actually have an IQ.

617
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,100
It's a bit higher than mine.

618
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,000
That's not the best part of it.

619
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,320
The best part of it is the way you can actually try it.

620
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:22,700
As a matter of fact, I was just watching a TV special that depicted bullets.

621
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,800
That have tiny computers in them.

622
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,120
Bullets with hearts and souls and minds is what America needs.

623
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,200
Bullets with personalities and underpants.

624
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,600
Bullets with hearts and minds to fight the invader.

625
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,000
Well, they don't have to have much of a heart.

626
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:46,020
In fact, that would probably prevent them from exploding right over the head of the guy hiding behind the wall.

627
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,980
Which is why they have little brains.

628
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:49,980
Oh.

629
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,100
No, seriously.

630
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,000
Bullets with microprocessor.

631
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,100
Bullets with microprocessor.

632
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,100


633
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,960
There's 20mm shells that are shot out of futuristic machine guns.

634
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,600
And the machine guns themselves are smart.

635
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,560
And are capable of performing anal sex.

636
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:10,880
And they've got a great video camera hooked up to them so that you can see the kill in slow motion.

637
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,520
And broadcast it on Japanese TV later.

638
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,580
It's flying everywhere.

639
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,700
There's mastic mess and THM fluids.

640
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,960
And spinal fluids.

641
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,580
And brain fluids everywhere.

642
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,960
Oh, what a mess.

643
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,900
What a mess.

644
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:29,880
Wow.

645
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,000
That was a great little rock opera.

646
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,900
It was.

647
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,120
We went from the beginning to the end of our military service in one quick little bite.

648
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,480
BOMB.

649
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,400
DEAD BOMB.

650
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,500
DEAD BOMB.

651
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,680
DEAD BOMB.

652
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:52,680


653
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:52,680


654
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:52,680


655
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:52,900
Deea.

656
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,080
Thanks, Ephraim.

657
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,080


658
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:20,740
Which I have now.

659
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,680
BUMP.

660
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,140
We'll be right back.

661
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:07,200
We'll be right back.

662
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:52,280
We'll be right back.

663
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,320
We'll be right back.

664
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,400
We'll be right back.

665
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,420
We'll be right back.

666
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,300
We'll be right back.

667
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,180
We'll be right back.

668
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:37,920
Yeah!

669
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,560
I don't get it.

670
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,400
They're calling us to prayer.

671
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,940
This magic box makes noise.

672
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:48,600
Well, it's...

673
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,420
What time is it?

674
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:49,840
I think it's...

675
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,900
It's a genius.

676
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,820
You have to pray for it.

677
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,580
It's 1.20.

678
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,700
It's 1.20.

679
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,520
It's 1.20.

680
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,120
Uh, Slingjob.

681
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,160
I don't know what happened.

682
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:58,640
Yeah.

683
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,940
Well, we were talking about politics.

684
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:01,600
Slingjob.

685
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,020
I remember a previous episode.

686
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,320
You pronounced American Liberty dead.

687
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,040
You slammed the coffin in its head.

688
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,500
You put it on the desk and rolled it down.

689
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,360
You said a few prayers.

690
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,840
And acted like a clown.

691
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,400
And then, I guess it was Major General Franks and Major Furtter came out in their suits.

692
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,320
Their...

693
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,560
Major Furtter?

694
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,360
Yeah.

695
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,960
The hairy guys in their hirsutes.

696
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,320
And they escorted it back up and had necrophiliacs fixed with the wounds.

697
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,680
And Tim Cheney came out and played Home on the Range.

698
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,440
On a harmonica.

699
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,220
On a harmonica.

700
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,900
Just as...

701
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,700
That was his way of protesting even the protest.

702
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,800
And Ennio Morricone came in on a pair of roller skates with one of those little tiny organs.

703
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,900
Cheney said, just walk away.

704
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,620
Because there's so much to do.

705
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,340
It's not relevant to what they're doing.

706
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,260
It's still...

707
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,920
If you were federal president, how could you see the next equation?

708
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,880
Can you just see it?

709
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,240
Can you just see it?

710
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,700
There's George Bush.

711
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,620
Angel eyes.

712
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,480
Blondie!

713
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,340
Blondie.

714
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,280
No, that was what's...

715
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:18,860
And, uh...

716
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:19,860
And, uh...

717
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,840
Osama Bin Laden.

718
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:21,780
And...

719
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:21,800
And...

720
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,900
Eli Wallach, yeah, right.

721
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,700
But then who is Blonde?

722
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,860
Saddam Hussein.

723
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:33,020
Saddam Hussein is the bad guy.

724
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,280
Yeah, because Osama bin Laden would be the tall, skinny.

725
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,640
Right, he was in Lee Van Cleef.

726
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,280
Yeah.

727
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,220
And George Bush would be Eli Wallach because they both got W in their names.

728
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,180
They both short, feisty little guys.

729
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,060
Oh, no, no.

730
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:47,760
Gandhi!

731
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,480
And then Wolfowitz would be, you know, the hairdresser.

732
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:51,800


733
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,540
No, no.

734
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,400
That's someone else.

735
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,740
Well, we want to get out.

736
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,980
That's the Defense Department.

737
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:56,720
We're all out of here.

738
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,680
We're all out of here.

739
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,780
We're all out of here.

740
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,320
We're all out of here.

741
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,540
We're all out of here.

742
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,460
We're all out of here.

743
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:08,480
We're all out of here.

744
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,320
Let the poem roll.

745
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,720
Let the poem roll.

746
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,760
How about what you see?

747
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,820
...mundanelessly, mindlessly contemplated

748
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:21,720
in the mainstream monopolized, politicized, money-motivated media

749
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,660
Media, media, monstrous mongering for the misery of munition-maiming moms

750
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:32,860
is modus operandi of a modern people, Mamma Mia Machiavellian.

751
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,680
Merry Christmas, you bastards.

752
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,000
Apocalypse Light? Is that what you're puckering your lips for this afternoon?

753
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,840
Merry Christmas, you bastards.

754
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,600
Knowing, feeling, being, truth, love, beauty.

755
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,160
Your minds have been bought.

756
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,860
Tell me, have they replaced your cerebral cortex with a pudenda of a monstrous woman?

757
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,800
I mean, is that where you got to where you're at now?

758
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,620
That was pretty hip stuff, though, wasn't it?

759
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,980
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

760
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,180
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

761
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,640
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

762
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,400
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

763
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,080
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

764
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:21,880
Bop.

765
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,000
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

766
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:28,860
Bop.

767
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,240
Bop.

768
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,340
Bop.

769
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:30,560


770
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:30,940
Bop.

771
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,000
Bop.

772
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,060
Bop.

773
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,160
Bop.

774
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:31,860
Bop.

775
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,140
Bop.

776
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,620
Bop.

777
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:35,840
Bop.

778
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:36,660
Bop.

779
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,280
Bop.

780
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:37,460
Bop.

781
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:37,620
Bop.

782
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,600
Bop.

783
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,120
Bop.

784
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:39,620
Bop.

785
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:40,640
Bop.

786
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,140
Bop.

787
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,820
Bop.

788
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,080
Bop.

789
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,320
Bop.

790
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,480
Of course, that was E-S-O.

791
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:59,600
And before that, that song called Dead Bob was by no means no.

792
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:05,640
You are listening to The Hour of Slack.

793
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:17,620
Number 877 from the church of the subgenius, world's first industrial church.

794
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:28,140
Check out www.subgenius.com for information on becoming a minister in that marvelous church of the subgenius.

795
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:40,100
Before signing up, you boys ought to try a little taste of Dr. Ism's formula to see what you get in exchange for your freedom.

796
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,440
Go ahead, try it.

797
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,880
You can't do this to me! I'll strike!

798
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,880
The state forbids strikes.

799
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,300
Wait till the union hears about this!

800
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,460
Ah, yes, the union.

801
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,820
Welcome to our ranks, number 1313.

802
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,480
I'll take this case to the Supreme Court.

803
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,900
The state is the Supreme Court.

804
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,380
Our decision is as follows.

805
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,780
No more private property. No more you.

806
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,720
Ah, the farm vote will put a stop to this.

807
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,340
Farmers don't vote anymore.

808
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,880
What will I do for seed next year?

809
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:42,260
You won't have to worry about next year. The state will do your planning from now on.

810
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,680
The State of the State.

811
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,340
We must fight!

812
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:51,760
To regain our freedom, or everything is lost. Everything!

813
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:58,900
Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine.

814
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,240
You offer us only well-being.

815
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,220
Food and drink and happiness mean nothing to us. We must be about our job.

816
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,860
Suffering and torment and pain. Laboring without end.

817
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,360
Dying and crying and lamenting over our burdens.

818
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,380
Only this way.

819
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,400
Only this way can we be happy.

820
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:25,080
I heard George Bush's daughter got caught in a peep show with Pee Wee Herman.

821
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,340
Um, yeah.

822
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,380
Jerking guys off.

823
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,000
Well, no, no. Even guys. Gloryhole blowjobs.

824
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,160
No, it was a Pee Wee Herman impersonator. It was not...

825
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,980
That's what's really sad. It wasn't even the real Pee Wee Herman.

826
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,780
It was one of those guys who just walked away.

827
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,880
Well, the sad part was that she had one of the Gore daughters with her.

828
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,260
You know, corrupting those nice, prissy, polite Gores.

829
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:52,480
Well, you know the Gore girls are just potheads. They're not real cokers like the Bush girls.

830
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,660
Right. One of those was dating the Unabomber.

831
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,320
Was one of the Bush girls dating the Unabomber?

832
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:57,760
No, the Gore girls.

833
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,520
Oh, one of the Gore girls.

834
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,940
Kind of a prison romance thing or more like Montana?

835
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:08,500
No, it was the Bush girls were the ones that were flirting with that, uh, the Scorpio killer. What's his name? Ramirez.

836
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,600
Ramirez. Yeah.

837
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:09,900
Yeah.

838
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,960
So, you know, it's celebrity.

839
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,720
I'm jealous as hell, man. Let me put it that way.

840
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,800
I know. It's just an...

841
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,100
Easy going world for all the people on the cream that, you know, it's like poop floats. I'm telling you.

842
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,960
Chelsea Clinton got caught signing up for flight lessons.

843
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,000
I'm not kidding you.

844
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,060
That is one of the saddest things so far.

845
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,120
Next thing you know, women's gonna be wearing pants.

846
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,700
And the old men are gonna be wearing panties.

847
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,420
Oh, I wish.

848
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,380
They already do that.

849
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,020
It's happening. It's already happening.

850
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,600
Well, I wasn't gonna say anything.

851
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,740
They've been doing that for a hundred years.

852
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,560
That came in that Victorian age thing.

853
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:54,380
Well, they didn't come out, you know, like as common practice outside, you know, in the workplace.

854
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,920
Yeah, why do you think they call it Victoria's Secret?

855
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:02,080
Well, um, Reverend Holmes, you're from San Francisco.

856
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:06,600
Now, we hear tell that that's a real sinful kind of a place where it's nothing like America.

857
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,960
Well, especially tonight over on Polkham in the Butt Street, you know.

858
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,660
There's nothing like it.

859
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,360
I heard some...

860
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,200
You can't walk down a street without me.

861
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:29,460
We saw some story that on TV here in the Heartland that there were many transvestite and transsexual she-males and stuff like that parading around the streets having sex in the open, spreading their diseases.

862
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,240
Is this true?

863
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,660
Well, that's actually...

864
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,380
It was a...

865
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,160
Two road companies from New York City...

866
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,540
I thought you were gonna say it was a two-headed dog.

867
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,260
...doing cats.

868
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,940
They were doing a road version of cats.

869
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,800
And there seemed to be like many franchises of this thing.

870
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,180
And there were 13 of these road companies.

871
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,840
And they all broke down in San Francisco at the same time.

872
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,460
Well, they said...

873
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:52,680
You can imagine the run on makeup in San Francisco.

874
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,800
And it just turned into one giant cat fight, which is what started it all.

875
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,840
That's what they call it, Polkham in the Butt Street.

876
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,640
And I heard Fidel Castro is even gay out there with a green hat and everything.

877
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,080
It's just crazy out there.

878
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,340
You're so sophisticated, Dave.

879
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,660
You know all about that stuff.

880
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,020
I know.

881
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,280
And what's that other guy's name?

882
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,020
Van Ness?

883
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,320
The real big flamer?

884
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,020
Von Ness.

885
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:11,720
Von Ness.

886
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,040
He's German.

887
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:12,520
He's German.

888
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,580
He's related to peewee German.

889
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:16,460
Yeah.

890
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,480
Well, you live in a hell hole.

891
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,400
Baghdad by the Bay, as they call it.

892
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:21,760
Oh, yeah.

893
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,340
It's terrible.

894
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,280
Can't stand it.

895
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,800
I'm thinking of taking up a little farm here outside of Kent.

896
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:27,900
Kent State, I think.

897
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,900
I'm going to hang out here.

898
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,440
In Grove State.

899
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:30,820
Kent State?

900
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,160
Really?

901
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:31,680
Really?

902
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:31,940
Yeah.

903
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,440
We thought you'd move up to Petaluma and start a chicken.

904
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:34,940
Grove.

905
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:35,220
What?

906
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,620
Chickens in Petaluma.

907
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:37,740
No, no.

908
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,260
Oh.

909
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,560
Potatoes.

910
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,100
Potatoes.

911
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:41,380
Gross.

912
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:41,760
Gross.

913
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:41,900
Gross.

914
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,340
Gross.

915
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:42,500
Gross.

916
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:42,500


917
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:42,500


918
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,220
Okay, so it's true.

919
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,080
What's true?

920
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,040
Drug money funds terrorism.

921
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:49,780
It is true.

922
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:50,880
Okay.

923
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:51,780
Okay?

924
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,680
Look, let's say I buy some dope.

925
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,400
Let's say.

926
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,240
Hypothetical.

927
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:57,860
Let's say.

928
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,300
Now, how much of my money actually makes it through the bad guy's hands?

929
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,540
A couple of bucks.

930
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,520
A couple of bucks.

931
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,140
A few bucks.

932
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:04,600
That's it.

933
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,360
Peanuts.

934
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,820
So what you're saying is it's okay to support terrorism?

935
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,100
Can I say that?

936
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:10,100


937
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:10,100


938
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:11,480
Okay.

939
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:11,980
Okay.

940
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:12,260
Let's see.

941
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:12,420
What do you say to that?

942
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:12,500


943
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:12,500


944
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:12,500


945
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:12,500


946
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:12,500


947
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,600
I don't think we have enough money to buy it.

948
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,340
You can't fool me.

949
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,660
So, you're a poor guy, eh?

950
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,420
Photographic records hold the clues to this conspiracy.

951
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,960
And here we see the footage.

952
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,040
If you've just joined us...

953
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,140
It just didn't seem real.

954
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,560
Within spitting distance of Wall Street and even the Statue of Liberty...

955
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,220
We thought it was something out of a movie.

956
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:54,360
This is the scene after the planes have slammed into the side,

957
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,820
and you see the back tower just crumpling like cars.

958
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,340
But did it actually happen, or is there a darker side?

959
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,360
This is the scene out of a movie filmed in a studio.

960
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,320
This is the scene out of a movie filmed in a studio.

961
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,400
This is the scene out of a movie filmed...

962
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,320
in a studio.

963
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:15,320
Now, looking at this picture, the rock over to the left of the screen

964
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,140
has the letter C marked on it.

965
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,860
Why should there be a letter of the English alphabet stamped onto a rock?

966
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:25,140
Surely we're looking at the deliberate planting of props

967
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,200
in a pre-designated position

968
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,880
in the foreground of a photographic film set.

969
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,080
That is something that will take us a long time to wrap ourselves around.

970
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,940
It's hard to contemplate, isn't it?

971
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,860
Now, whether what we were watching...

972
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,280
were simulation exercises...

973
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,420
They didn't destroy the two towers.

974
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,800
...being transmitted as the real event...

975
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,940
They didn't destroy the two towers.

976
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,760
...it's a possibility which needs to be examined...

977
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,940
They didn't destroy the two towers.

978
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,960
...which needs to be examined closely.

979
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,680
Of course they did that, and that was no secret.

980
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:02,720
It was no secret that photographs and films were taken of models.

981
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,340
It worked as a simulation. Nobody knew the difference.

982
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,520
A

983
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,300
That's all our listeners.

984
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,880
That's all our listeners.

985
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,300
What is?

986
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:28,240
Do you think they should be chipped and stroked on the way to

987
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,360
Afghan, and Iran, and Iraq, and North Korea?

988
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,900
Or do you think they should be dropped from the grape trestles

989
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,000
and maybe swept up into a pile of dung?

990
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,960
Why not both?

991
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,400
Oh, well, I see it all the way.

992
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,360
Let's be flexible.

993
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,700
Don't bend over that way.

994
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:45,800
Bend over this way.

995
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,780
He was in the war, you know.

996
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,220
He was wounded in the head.

997
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:50,740
Yes.

998
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,540
Makes him sort of, well, rather funny at times.

999
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:53,980
Yes.

1000
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:54,860
Yes.

1001
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,460
Quiet.

1002
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:02,800
Quiet.

1003
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,760
There's nothing so ominous as quiet.

1004
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,460
Besides, it isn't quiet.

1005
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,520
He burst his heart.

1006
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,080
He's dead.

1007
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:11,680
Hmm.

1008
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,480
All right.

1009
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,580
He's dead.

1010
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,060
So what?

1011
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,180
Goodbye.

1012
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,160
See, that's all you got to do.

1013
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,560
That's all we can do.

1014
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,960
But the thing with the paranoia, if you're getting CSB paranoia,

1015
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,700
it's a residual kind of thing that lasts long after the listening experience, we'll say.

1016
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,600
Because paranoia will employ you.

1017
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,240
Dreams, odd dreams, strange discolorations of the knee.

1018
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,620
I get off on paranoia at this point.

1019
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,720
If you're in the military,

1020
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,680
paranoia will deploy you.

1021
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:40,880
Yeah.

1022
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,280
That's for sure.

1023
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,320
The W stands for war.

1024
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,840
Saddam's got a good war bush.

1025
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,160
Saddam's got a good war bush.

1026
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:50,940
Let's roll.

1027
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,380
Let's roll a few prop sticks out of this combustible,

1028
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,860
Let's roll the nuclear device.

1029
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,460
That postial coconut device.

1030
00:50:59,120 --> 00:50:59,820
Donated by Friday Jones.

1031
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,620
My God, he's got a coconut device.

1032
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,380
Not ready for war.

1033
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,640
Yeah, Friday Jones sent it.

1034
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,700
You would ingest something that Friday sent you.

1035
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:07,980
Not ready for war.

1036
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:07,980


1037
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:07,980


1038
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,380
Why do you guys...

1039
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,960
You should be going to war because you've got a lot of nerve.

1040
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,800
I'm not ready to bore your mom.

1041
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:13,880
This is a military attack.

1042
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,720
I'm not ready to drop the bomb.

1043
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,640
I'm not ready to chew my heart.

1044
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,360
That's why I want to start.

1045
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,060
I'm not ready for war.

1046
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:27,800
I'm not...

1047
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,360
Sorry, I quit.

1048
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,500
What?

1049
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:35,060
Jessica, she was supposed to take her clothes off while she's singing and she didn't...

1050
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:35,360
Zeke!

1051
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:37,700
Zeke!

1052
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,880
벌

1053
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,780
Nope.

1054
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,880
She can live in the dark!

1055
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,980
Arf!

1056
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:07,980


1057
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:07,980


1058
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:07,980


1059
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:07,980


1060
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:07,980


1061
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:07,980


1062
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:07,980


1063
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:07,980


1064
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:07,980


1065
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:07,980


1066
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:07,980


1067
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:07,980


1068
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:07,980


1069
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,080
It's painful.

1070
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,460
It's like having the sticks in your bag of sticks all broken.

1071
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,420
Yes, yes.

1072
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,960
It's like trying to smoke the sticks and they become...

1073
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,880
All your broken sticks.

1074
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,360
...in your heart.

1075
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,200
It's painful.

1076
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,420
It's like being in pain and hurt.

1077
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,040
No, I'm saying.

1078
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:23,760
No, I'm saying.

1079
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,360
Yes, I...

1080
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:24,740
No, you're saying.

1081
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,460
No, you're saying.

1082
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,680
I think I know what you're saying, but I don't know if I...

1083
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,080
No, mine.

1084
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,520
No, mine.

1085
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,220
No, wait a minute.

1086
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,600
You're sweating a little bit, Mr. Stang.

1087
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,820
Your left eye is...

1088
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:35,740
I told you, man.

1089
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,720
I get off on the paranoia.

1090
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,460
No, no, I think you're lying, Mr. Stang.

1091
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,620
So bring it on, man.

1092
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,520
That's what I call your reference, Stang.

1093
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,580
Bring it on.

1094
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,200
No, no, no.

1095
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,960
The coyote, because he is the paranoid animal...

1096
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,680
Oh, yes, talk about him again.

1097
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,620
...is the most aware animal.

1098
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,180
Yes, yes.

1099
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,640
The coyote, because he's paranoid, is all aware.

1100
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,440
He never sleeps.

1101
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:54,920
No, no.

1102
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,060
He's always on the prowl.

1103
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:56,560
One eye.

1104
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,540
He's always on the hunt.

1105
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,960
The coyote...

1106
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,500
That's coming out.

1107
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,360
...sees, hears...

1108
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,220
He's changing!

1109
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,340
...and he whiffs it.

1110
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:02,940
He's changing!

1111
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:03,780
He whiffs it.

1112
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,040
Yeah, I see.

1113
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:05,520
Yeah.

1114
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:07,100
Yeah.

1115
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,600
Hey, hey.

1116
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,600
Hey, man.

1117
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,340
The change was complete.

1118
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,020
A radical mastectomy.

1119
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,120
An arm full of hair.

1120
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,340
And wings the size of buzzard ears.

1121
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:31,200
Even a man who is full of slack and lets his farts by night.

1122
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,760
His feet like the feet of a dog.

1123
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,620
His hands were like the hands of a...

1124
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:37,300
Yes.

1125
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:37,800
Yes.

1126
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,040
He was a coyote.

1127
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:39,340
...bloom.

1128
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,480
...and the farts are full of paint.

1129
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,000
It was.

1130
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,040
It was the last wind.

1131
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:42,440
No!

1132
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,140
Yes.

1133
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,460
Last wind.

1134
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,160
Yee-yee-yee-yee-yee-yee-yee-yee-yee-yee.

1135
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:49,840
...

1136
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,420
...

1137
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:50,980
...

1138
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:51,060
...

1139
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:55,080
Well, till next week.

1140
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,280
...

1141
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,500
...

1142
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,180
...

1143
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,160
Keep your head undyed.

1144
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:16,680
You're back to the wind.

1145
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,180
Wait for further instructions.

1146
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,300
And keep your babies warm.

1147
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:27,480
No, the sack comes to Princess Wee.

1148
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,740
Keep your babies warm.

1149
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:39,540
The awaker shall sleep.

1150
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,740
I'll see you down in San Antone

1151
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,160
on a hot day.

1152
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,880
We were eating eggs and sammies

1153
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,200
when the black man there drew his knife.

1154
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,500
Oh, you drowned that Jew in Rampton

1155
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,800
as he washed his sleeveless shirt.

1156
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,040
You know, that Spanish-speaking gentleman,

1157
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,520
the one that we all call Kurt.

1158
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,640
Come now, gentlemen,

1159
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,260
I know that's some mistake.

1160
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,720
How forgetful I'm becoming now.

1161
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,160
You fix your...

1162
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:29,600
Bill...

1163
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,820
Business...

1164
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,580
Shave.

1165
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,040
I remember you

1166
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,800
in Hamlock Road, 1956.

1167
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,220
You're a faggin' little leather boy

1168
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,560
with a small piece of stick.

1169
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,040
You're a lashin', smashin' hunk of man.

1170
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,580
Your sweatshirt's sweet and strong.

1171
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,500
Your organs working perfectly.

1172
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,160
But there's a part that's not screwed on,

1173
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:16,200
I want you at the Coke Convention back in 1965

1174
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:22,520
You're the best red gray executive I see heavily at the time

1175
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:28,200
You're the gray gray man whose daughter licks policeman's buttons clean

1176
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,820
You're the man who squats behind the man who works the soft machine

1177
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,860
Come now, gentleman, your love is all I crave

1178
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:44,520
You'll still be in the circus when I'm laughing

1179
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,980
Laughing in my grave

1180
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:28,040
Laughing in my grave

1181
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,200
And the young men all look on

1182
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:38,100
And the young girls eat their mother's meat from tubes of plastic corn

1183
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:43,920
Be wary, please, my gentle friends, of all the skins you breed

1184
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:49,700
They have a tasty habit, they eat the hands that bleed

1185
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:55,520
So remember who you say you are and keep your noses clean

1186
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,800
Boys will be boys

1187
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,280
And play with toys, so be strong with your bees

1188
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,820
Oh, Rosie dear, don't you think it's queer?

1189
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,100
So stop me if you please

1190
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:11,580
The baby's dead, my lady said, you gentlemen

1191
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:17,220
Why, you all work for me

1192
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,960
Outstanden.

1193
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,300
You think you really can get stuffed with her?

1194
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,340
Ok.

1195
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,060
!

1196
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,440
Look here, it's just a coin.

1197
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:37,440


1198
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:37,440


1199
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:37,440


1200
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:37,440


1201
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:37,440


1202
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,420
You jump off after a boutin'

1203
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:41,420


1204
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:41,440
You jump in like a�ぎ

1205
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:41,440


1206
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:41,440


1207
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:41,440


1208
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:41,440


1209
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:41,480
!

1210
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,300
!

1211
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,280
What a jerk.

1212
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:55,100
Watch the dearly little ya'll.

1213
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,720
여

1214
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,040
Thank you.

1215
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,620
Thank you.
