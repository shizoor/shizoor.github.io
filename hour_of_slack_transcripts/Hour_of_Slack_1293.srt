1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
No, no, no. How does that start? I can't remember.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,800
I, uh, yes, friends. No, I, yes, dear friends.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,800
You're listening, no, uh, radio ministry.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,100
It's the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,720
Brought to you by the Church of the Subgenius.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,580
Produced here at the beautiful studios of WCSB, Cleveland, the home.

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,360
I love that show. It's so iconoclastic.

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,460
And, you know, everything is worthy of poking at and making fun.

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,400
And sometimes throwing dirt on the shoes and pulling a knife at it.

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,380
Yeah, they're just a mirror that reflects the illness in society.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,240
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,680
We may go on. We're going to go on for a long time tonight.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,180
We're going to take over the station.

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,840
We might have to share boats all night.

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:07,280
We're going to, uh, disregard any, uh, any attempts to take over the station by...

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,160
Stand back. They are killing me.

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,320
The next... Oh, no, we won't go. I won't go there.

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,700
We're really, we are going to give it over to the next DJ if you're listening.

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,520
We were just teasing.

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,380
Yeah.

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,880
We're just kidding.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,720
That's us. We've got our little cot set up here.

23
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,380
We've got a...

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,160
We're going to have a...

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,160


26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,000
Hot chockeys here.

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,760
Getting ready for our slumber party.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,020
And Philo and me each have a little candle here.

29
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,120
I didn't tell you to give them my hand.

30
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,520
And you got your little nightcap?

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,360
Yeah, I do.

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,140
Chestnuts are roasting.

33
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,560
Sexy guy show.

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,380
The sugar plums are dancing.

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,920
Yeah, this is the guy show because this is the last show of the millennium and we're covering the history of the subgenius church, which is basically a guy church.

36
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,540
We would have a girl on the show, but she didn't show up.

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,220
That's the next show.

38
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,600
Next to the last show.

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,600
This is the last show.

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,040
We paid her.

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,940
When was the first...

42
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,620
We paid her and she still didn't show up.

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,660
When was the first...

44
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,780
I told you you should have given her that money in advance.

45
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,960
That was back in Jane Eyre's childhood because he had the little...

46
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,580
The little...

47
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,380
I said half now and half when you show up.

48
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:17,780
He had the original little head and he would watch that thing as a child and make little songs and say little things and do little stuff.

49
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,440
Oh, you should always do the other half.

50
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,960
Always do the other half.

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,740
I have to do the other half now?

52
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,080
Amen.

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,180
I did not.

54
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:25,780
Okay.

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,340
I honor you, Stangford.

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,920
Give me the money.

57
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,920
You know that...

58
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,780
Hey, Reverend Stangford, you remember back there in Fort Worth and that boy named Patches?

59
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,900
Patches.

60
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,780
He was a poor boy, but he was a great tap dancer.

61
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,000
All his britches were made out of patches.

62
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,660
You know, they wouldn't let him into the church, the regular church.

63
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,200
They said, get out of here with them Patches britches on.

64
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,020
Patches.

65
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,060
You're a patch bitch, boy.

66
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,060
But the bitches in the subgenius church...

67
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,160
That's what they said.

68
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,860
They liked the way he dangled in them patches.

69
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,380
Patches, get out of here with them Patches britches or I'm going to make you my prison bitch.

70
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,040
And so Patches...

71
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,540
They said that at church, too.

72
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:10,780
Oh, they did?

73
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,540
And so Philo scratched Patches' itches.

74
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,480
In churches.

75
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,640
And quit his bitching.

76
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,200
He did a batch of bitching that one night, though.

77
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,480
It is a new...

78
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,020
It is a new...

79
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,680
Not only a new year...

80
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,060
Some batching scratching.

81
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,080
Millennium.

82
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,560
It is a whole new millennium coming forth.

83
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,360
Wow.

84
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
As we, together...

85
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,880
Look at that, a new millennium.

86
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,080
The subgenii of the Bay Area and the Midwest,

87
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,160
Mestern Western,

88
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,580
come together in our...

89
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,340
You understand the Mestern Western show?

90
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,060
...ascendancy as we go forward into what is now

91
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,440
the only millennium...

92
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,260
...that truly exists.

93
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,000
So are the subgeniuses going to be at Burning Man next year?

94
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,480
We're at Burning Man every year.

95
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,960
Every single...

96
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,540
We were at Burning Man before it was Burning Man.

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,080
That's true.

98
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,400
In fact, you know, it's a little known fact that...

99
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,040
...Warm Boy.

100
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,660
...that the subgenius church is part of why Burning Man exists.

101
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,060
It really is.

102
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,140
And it's just why I partly believe that Warm Boy should be there.

103
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,280
Did it start with Janer talking about that Burning Monk?

104
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
I'm sorry, yes.

105
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,040
No, that was... It did start with...

106
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,040


107
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,920
Actually, 1988 or so.

108
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,840
That was when Trelloid still walked among us.

109
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,560
Wow.

110
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,300
It was still throwing matches up at Kathleen.

111
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:36,980
Yeah, yeah.

112
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,520
We're going over the subgenius history here on KPFA.

113
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Let's rewind now back to 1982.

114
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,940
We're taking 1982 into 2001.

115
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,940
Doug Wellman used the sound effect on the air

116
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,840
to represent a tape rewinding.

117
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,500
But when was the baby...

118
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,440
But since 1980, you'd been getting tapes of me doing...

119
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,580
And then, of course, we took the...

120
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,760
...and made it into...

121
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,080
...the West Coast...

122
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,040
...which then degenerated into...

123
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,800
...and what about...

124
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,140
...where did mama fit into it?

125
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,340
That was my mama.

126
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,000
I thought that was Sterno.

127
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,540
That was Sterno going...

128
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,020
That was your mama.

129
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,460
...and Mickey.

130
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,040
I would have guessed it was I who was...

131
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,040


132
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,220
...and Mickey.

133
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:27,500
...honored Sterno.

134
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:28,860
...and Mickey.

135
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:28,920
...and Mickey.

136
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,540
Oh, I see.

137
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,640
As long as you honor somebody, you can then claim it as yours.

138
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,740
Sure, yeah, yeah.

139
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,780
I always do.

140
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,320
I honor you, Stang, for...

141
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,840
Give me the money.

142
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,600
You're listening to the subgenius radio ministry,

143
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,560
Hour of Slack.

144
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,600
Now I really do have to flip it.

145
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,480
Oh, please don't look in the mirror.

146
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,520
You're not going to like what you see there.

147
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,800
What is that?

148
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:54,920
It's a priest bob.

149
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,860
Priest bob?

150
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,900
Oh, yes, dear friends.

151
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,700
This is Li Jing, the Chinese subgenius,

152
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,860
and you are listening to the Hour of Slack.

153
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,700
Oh, yes, it is so true.

154
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,900
Thank you, Li Jing.

155
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,840
I got a call from China just this morning,

156
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,500
the high priestess of all Asia.

157
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,320
You know, friends, if you had joined up,

158
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,460
if you'd been the first person on your continent to join up with the church,

159
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,640
you'd be the pope of this continent.

160
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,240
I know.

161
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,660
Dr. G. Gordon Gordon here.

162
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,000
I am the pope of South America.

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,860
The entire continent of South America.

164
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,380
It's mine.

165
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,600
When those souls...

166
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,620
Ah, the harvest, friends.

167
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,120
When we start collecting those souls,

168
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,880
you know who's going to get to skim,

169
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,920
to skim that fine, fine layer off the top out of the soul-rendering vat,

170
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,840
don't you, friends?

171
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,600
Oh, and they're trying to keep them from selling any kind of soul down there nowadays.

172
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,160
Oh, yeah.

173
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,460
They don't.

174
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,720
Used to be in the old days, you couldn't give it away,

175
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,380
and now it's against the law to sell it, so what are you going to do?

176
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,660
And all the religions want to have your soul, friends.

177
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,500
Bob wants your soul, but just temporarily.

178
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,560
He'll give it back after he's...

179
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,700
And he only uses it a little bit while he's got it, friends.

180
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,940
That's something to think about.

181
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,100
He doesn't dry you out.

182
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,760
That's right.

183
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,740
Thank you.

184
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,900
Yeah.

185
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,920
Appreciate it.

186
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,560
Just like...

187
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:51,560


188
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:51,780
it'd be

189
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:51,780


190
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,400
and normally it's just I trying to Ram LETS,

191
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,700
if, if, you are,

192
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:52,700


193
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:52,700


194
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,120
and walking out

195
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,040
One day a shiny

196
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,620
silver psychedelic

197
00:07:59,620 --> 00:07:59,980
spaceship

198
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,280
took a long trip

199
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,000
from the outskirts of heaven

200
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,820
to the 7-Eleven

201
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,720
They had a funeral

202
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,940
going in the parking lot

203
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,480
for the second going of Jesus

204
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,580
And if he ever

205
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,700
comes around again

206
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,560
I'll be the first

207
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,120
to stick the spike in

208
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,100
I'll be the first

209
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,080
to stick the spike in

210
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,600
Let's go, let's go now

211
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,100
Let's go now

212
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,100
Let's go now

213
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:34,760
Let's go now

214
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,120
Let's go now

215
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,420
Let's go now

216
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,140
Let's go now

217
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,060
Let's go now

218
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,320
Let's go now

219
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,320


220
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,320


221
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,320


222
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,320


223
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,320


224
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,320


225
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,540
Let's go now

226
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:44,560
Let's go now

227
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,180
Let's go now

228
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:45,500
Let's go now

229
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:45,600
Let's go now

230
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,380
Let's go now

231
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,940
Last Christmas

232
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,680
Christmas, or just before New Year's with Dr. Philodrum and guesting on Puzzling Evidences.

233
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:07,040
Oh, and of course, Einstein's Secret Orchestra Swamp Radio hosted by Dr. Chaz Smith and starring

234
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:14,000
Lonesome Cowboy Dave broadcast from WCSB in Cleveland and also with yours truly as a guest.

235
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,720
Yes, and friends, at least it ain't reruns of Hour of Slack. I've had to trip through four hours

236
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,380
of Slack in the last couple of days because to get things done ahead of time because of our

237
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:36,980
upcoming subgenius church field trip to Amsterdam. And the main reason we go to Amsterdam in a group

238
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,580
is so that we can come back and irritate our friends by regaling them with tales of our

239
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,460
ripping and...

240
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,920
Tripping times.

241
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,440
I get tired of people telling me that they're tripping all the time when it's so obvious.

242
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,040
Their faces have changed, like blue and red things are coming out, you know, wearing green.

243
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,420
Yeah, and one eye is dribbling down the side of their face.

244
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,100
And they've got this kind of ripping.

245
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,200
I can't stop ripping.

246
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,660
My clothing is all...

247
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,560
And they're giggling. It's cute.

248
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,260
You can tell they're high on something.

249
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,280
You know, the wall behind them is kind of like melting.

250
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,140
Yeah, and they...

251
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,640
All those blacklight posters around them are fountaining and...

252
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,960
Yeah, it's...

253
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,680
I find them very disturbing to the environment.

254
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,280
Try and get them in your car and have the windshield start melting and have the radio playing.

255
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,700
It looks like toothpaste is coming out of the radio.

256
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,620
Man, you want to throw them right out of your car and they still laugh as they roll down the freeway.

257
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,140
It seemed like everybody I looked at was tripping because they were all just melting.

258
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,440
And they're...

259
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,480
You know, they put on this music that tasted like ice cream.

260
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,460
The air was tripping.

261
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,020
Hey, man.

262
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,260
Um...

263
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,740
Why not crackers?

264
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,160
Is that what you called them?

265
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,380
I thought it was...

266
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,620
Okay.

267
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,520
Hey, man.

268
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,660
Am I still sweating?

269
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,740
Hey, hey, I heard...

270
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,840
No, you're in New York, man.

271
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,820
You're in Greenwich Village.

272
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,660
I heard that you had shrooms.

273
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,760
They wanted a pound of flesh.

274
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,160
They wanted that which makes you alive.

275
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,440
They wanted your soul.

276
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,420
That's what they do want.

277
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,780
They want a...

278
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,200
Peace.

279
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,060
Could you make some coffee for us, man?

280
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,660
We've been walking out in the rain.

281
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,700
It's cold, I think.

282
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,380
Yeah, yeah.

283
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:22,880
Sit down.

284
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,280
Sure.

285
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,860
How did you get up?

286
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:25,920
Um...

287
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,760
I don't know.

288
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,140
It was like...

289
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,980
I think it was yesterday, but...

290
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,820
This one kid died.

291
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,100
I think he died.

292
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,240
They found him in the woods.

293
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,260
Well, yeah.

294
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,700
That's where we found him first.

295
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,680
Down by the lake.

296
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,240
Oh, man.

297
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,480
Yeah, man.

298
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,420
He was, uh...

299
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,420
Checking out...

300
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:43,960
He almost got...

301
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:43,980
He almost got...

302
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,660
He almost got ran over by a pontoon boat.

303
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,120
He came to study consciousness.

304
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,380
But he ended up with his pants around his ankles down by the lake.

305
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,420
Freezing at dawn.

306
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,760
I had...

307
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,760
Wondering what had happened.

308
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,700
Marijuana, where?

309
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,260
Where?

310
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,500
Where?

311
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,500
My name is St. Andrew KSC of Chicago, Illinois.

312
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,600
And I'm here to tell all of you about the wonders and the truth that is behind J.R. Bob Dobbs.

313
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,300
Can I hear it, man, man, brothers and sisters?

314
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,020
That is right.

315
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,960
Let me tell you.

316
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,740
You're right off the bat.

317
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,960
I was here earlier today.

318
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,920
I saw three fine young women here who have not been ordained in the Church of the Subgenius

319
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,500
because they didn't have the money.

320
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,480
$30 for salvation.

321
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,040
The only $30.

322
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,340
You can't even get a good hand job in Chicago for $30.

323
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,940
Right in this church, if you pay your $30 from the body, you will have more sex, more

324
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,780
slack, more fuck, more booze, more anything that you want, anything that you could ever

325
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,560
dream about.

326
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,420
And it all comes with a money-back guarantee.

327
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,760
You can keep you five years out.

328
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,180
You're dead.

329
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,160
And in the pits of hell, with the flames of Satan blinking your ass, you will get a signed

330
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,020
$90 check from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

331
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,920
Can I hear another amen?

332
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,500
Amen!

333
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,980
You people are not stoked up enough for this shit.

334
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,860
You are not in the mood in order to be saved.

335
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,080
You need to get down on your stuff, get jiggy with it even if you have to.

336
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,780
Because you know, Will Smith is getting more pussy than you because you haven't saved $30

337
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,160
to Bob.

338
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,060
No!

339
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,340
Oh, sire, there is no more money.

340
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,780
We gotta get some money.

341
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,840
That's right.

342
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:13,940
That's right.

343
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,640
We need Turkish harkaback, black and rotten, Philip Duncan Burton, Perkaluma Burton, Burton

344
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,260
Bushman.

345
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,740
I have friends.

346
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,620
I am Florida Beck, Florida Beck, Colorado Beck, Colorado Beck.

347
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,920
Ah, yes, dear friends.

348
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,660
St. Andrew at the Tampa Defival.

349
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,520
And now, friends, let's go back to Dr. Philo Drummond and puzzling evidence with some more

350
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,960
subgenius history to be followed by some new non-music by New Monet.

351
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,320
I'm gonna be at an old person's convention that day.

352
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,960
Because the show will have been retired.

353
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,860
I'll be at a place where there's a lot of old people.

354
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,240
Oh, work?

355
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,400
They'll be having fun.

356
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,400
So is there gonna be the 20th anniversary?

357
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,520
I'll be whacking them on the head with this big long board.

358
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,620
20th anniversary of what?

359
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,140
It's got floppy appendages hanging out.

360
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,320
This show started in June of 1982.

361
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,740
Was it that long ago?

362
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,900
Yeah, it's been way too long.

363
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,700
Rob Nelson.

364
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,760
June of 1982.

365
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,660
Yeah.

366
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,340
I'll remember that for sure.

367
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:17,880
Rob Nelson.

368
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,340
Because it was Ivan Stang and Lies and myself.

369
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

370
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,980
Get your sticking paws off me, you damn dirty ape.

371
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,400
Do you want to touch my monkey?

372
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:38,720
Monkey?

373
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,400
I don't make monkeys.

374
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,800
I just train them.

375
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,700
No more monkey business.

376
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,460
No.

377
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,120
No.

378
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,520
No more monkey business.

379
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,720
Birds and the bees and the monkey babies.

380
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,060
Ah.

381
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,920
But what is...

382
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:19,320
What does this have to do with Bob Slack and the conspiracy, the great themes which has driven the church...

383
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,480
Well, I'll ask a question.

384
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,260
Should we be concerned with George Bush being in the White House a fundamentalist Christian?

385
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,580
Or is this all part of Bob's plan?

386
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,060
All I know is that...

387
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,060
What language did Jesus speak on the cross?

388
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,700
Uh...

389
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,360
Mayan.

390
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,640
Yeah.

391
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,080
It wasn't Aramaic.

392
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,920
It was Mayan.

393
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,180
Eli, Eli, lei, sabahana.

394
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,440
Yeah.

395
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:42,760
Well, you can just...

396
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,160
You can just ask him.

397
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,440
He's probably not awake right now, but...

398
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,760
Everybody knows it's classic Mayan.

399
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,520
It means,

400
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,320
Moo, sad-eyed and bearded.

401
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,920
Come down with your fierce temper.

402
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:56,680
Wow.

403
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
That's what it means.

404
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,820
Because he was actually asking for revenge on all those people.

405
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,200
He's been misquoted all this time, dude.

406
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,660
He's been misquoted because they thought he was speaking Aramaic.

407
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,520
Hey, dude, where's my car?

408
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,780
In Aramaic, it means something like, you know, father, father.

409
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,520
Why has thou forsaken me?

410
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,560
But in Mayan, it means, moo.

411
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,180
And in English, it means, come down and release your fierce temper.

412
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,360
Thank you, thank you.

413
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,860
In English, it means, please pass the gefilte fish.

414
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:32,820
Oh.

415
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,800
It's luminous blue.

416
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,360
What is the next great frontier, lonesome cowboy Dave?

417
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,120
The next great frontier is the frontier of the human mind.

418
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,640
Delineated and demarcated, sans frontiers,

419
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,360
by only its only limited imagination.

420
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,920
We've been there, done that.

421
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,580
Imagination.

422
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,000
And, okay, all right, then I'll just forget about it.

423
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,920
Can I get...

424
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,920
The mind has been completely mapped and explored.

425
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,160
The mind is still a vast frontier where very few have ever truly tried.

426
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,100
Your mind, maybe.

427
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,240
The mind is still a place filled with cavernous muscles and tiny little tissues,

428
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:11,760
which no one has ever tried.

429
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,840
No one can reach except for their own cerebellum.

430
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,740
The human or normal mind has been completely worked out by marketing companies

431
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,280
and conspiracy medical science.

432
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,300
For the last hundred years, they've had it down, down, down.

433
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,920
Don't you believe what the ancient Rishis have told us?

434
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,380
That by properly using our minds, we can even fly as if gossamer on wings of felt?

435
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,380
Is that what the ancient Rishis told you?

436
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,160
Not the Rishis, Monk.

437
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,660
It's the Rishis of ancient India.

438
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,800
You've got to lose your shit in order to fly.

439
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,220
It's what Sundiata said.

440
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,620
Anyone who finds himself that far off the ground without knowing why

441
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,960
loses their shit, and that's a truism and a falsehood.

442
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,860
Tish, tish, tish, boys.

443
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,200
Fish, fish, fish.

444
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,220
That's a lie.

445
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,760
And it's nice to hear your show return to a slower, more deliberate pacing.

446
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,200
Of course, that's the edited version.

447
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,320
Over here, we're doing the edited version of the last show.

448
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,800
Yes, yes.

449
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,680
But don't let it be forgot that air there was a spot for one brief shining moment

450
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,120
known as...

451
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,180
Brigadier.

452
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,460
Camelot.

453
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:12,860
Oh.

454
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:19,100
In short, there's simply not a more congenial spot than happy ever after.

455
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,380
Brigadier.

456
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:19,380


457
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,140
Here.

458
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,600
Eight.

459
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,420
And Camelot.

460
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:21,880
Okay, I got it.

461
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:29,000
I think that now that the bushes are back in, I think it's going to be like Camelot.

462
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,560
It is a lot like Camelot.

463
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,880
Oh, it's certainly dad bush.

464
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,740
I like the bushes.

465
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,340
Now, see, this is kind of like, this is really George Bush's second term.

466
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,580
Exactly.

467
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,840
Oh, no lie.

468
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,480
It's like...

469
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,400
It's like the...

470
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,780
We're rolling now, folks.

471
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,540
Line.

472
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,580
You know, it's like the emperor of...

473
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,060
Bush dynasty.

474
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,440
We'll be rolling our way into the 2000s.

475
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,260
I meant to bring my new mixotology tape.

476
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,600
That's a no, I know.

477
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,540
I didn't get the new mixotology of...

478
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,660
Actually, I have it on a CD in the car, but I'd have to go out there in the cold and rain.

479
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,120
We should get it so we can play the...

480
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,340
See, there is your car driving away because you said that.

481
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,940
Hey, come back in!

482
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,840
So, do you think that the news will be more entertaining now in the next four years?

483
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,680
No, I think so.

484
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,400
Because, at least for those of us on the left, or where we call ourselves the left,

485
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,380
you know, you've got to have a target.

486
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,900
I feel now like those right-wingers did when Clinton was president.

487
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,480
I always believed that a vote against your conscience is a vote against boredom.

488
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,720
I just wish Jesse Ventura had won.

489
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,080
Me too.

490
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,740
I really wanted to have a wrestling president.

491
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,320
That made me so happy when he was governor, and I thought that he should be president

492
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,740
because he's stronger than those other guys.

493
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,640
I think he should...

494
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,200
No kidding.

495
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,940
He kicked...

496
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,720
But, you know...

497
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,180
He's going to be in the XFL now.

498
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,540
He's got a new job in the XFL working for Vince McMahon.

499
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:48,880
Really?

500
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,340
Yeah.

501
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,980
When you lose it out there, you're in a world of hurt.

502
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,720
Oh, you're doing Dennis Miller now?

503
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,800
I feel like I'm screaming at him.

504
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,040
I got a job!

505
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:00,940
I got a job!

506
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,500
I got a job!

I got a job!

509

I got a job!

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,360

I got a job!

512
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:07,540
I got a job!

I got a job!

I got a job!

517
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,480
I got a job!

518

I got a job!

519
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,000


520
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:32,700
I got a job!

521
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,460
I got a job!

I got a job!

I got a job!

I got a job!

525
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,280
I got a job!

I got a job!

Gun or a job. Copyright 1983 by the band that dare not speak its name.

Palmer Reedy's on vocals. Thank you.

531
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,840
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

532
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,660
Hey, how you doing?

533
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,200
I appreciate you very much for the opportunity to speak with you tonight.

534
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,140
Oh, you know, it's our president, too.

535
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,540
And we are rolling, folks.

536
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,420
Getting ready for the second Bush dynasty.

537
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,520
Rolling, rolling. Keep them take dicks rolling.

538
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,080
Little something you show.

539
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,200
Oh, hi.

540
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,960
We'll be in the picture and then you'll see it on the way.

541
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,660
And then there'll be the outcome of the presidential.

542
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,020
I'm rolling, I'm rolling.

543
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,620
I'm rolling, I'm rolling, I'm rolling.

544
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,380
Why is that so funny? It's just some guy saying I'm rolling.

545
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

546
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,680
Rollin', rollin', I'm rollin'.

547
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,780
I'm rolling Democrats up in rugs and burning them.

548
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,980
Rolling a Democrat down the hill.

549
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah.

550
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,680
Yeah.

551
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,680
Yeah.

552
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,020
Yeah.

553
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,600
Yeah.

554
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:04,960


555
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,320
Yeah.

556
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,600
Yeah.

557
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,820
Yeah.

558
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,100
Yeah.

559
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,100


560
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,340
Yeah.

561
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:08,820
Yeah.

562
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:08,820


563
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:08,820


564
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:08,820


565
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,320
Yeah.

566
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,960
Someone got me running

567
00:24:52,400 --> 00:25:09,400
I'm running out of time

568
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,400
I'm running out of time

569
00:25:49,100 --> 00:26:09,400
I'm running out of time

570
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:39,400
I'm running out of time

571
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:44,460
Including the old one, if there were some subgeniuses on our news group

572
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,840
who were seriously trying to convince us that the Jews run America.

573
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,600
Well, you know, that may be so.

574
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,620
I grew up in the film business in Dallas

575
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,160
and I knew an awful lot of good old boys that kind of were running the shows

576
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,400
and they didn't seem to be in any terrible fear of Jewish, black, or Hispanic, or subgenius.

577
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,160
Conspiracies taking them over

578
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,320
because we're all too busy fighting amongst ourselves.

579
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,660
You know, all the little minority groups and weirdos are all too busy fighting themselves

580
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,700
while the man laughs and the burning man burns.

581
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,980
And my main man, Bob Dobbs,

582
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:32,860
while his stocks are rising from sheer unthinking slack power, friends.

583
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,000
And that's why we must, like Bob's stocks, rise above the little conspiracy.

584
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,060
That are dangled in front of frustrated crackpots

585
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:50,060
like easy answers to our blinder tubes, oh my droogies.

586
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:56,440
And, you know, the complex is not simple.

587
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,920
You can't, and Rush Limbaugh is always talking about, oh, I make the complex simple.

588
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,580
Well, great. That's great for simpletons.

589
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,540
But the complex is complex.

590
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,540
Some of us like it that way.

591
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,700
A does not equal B.

592
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,400
And A to the square root times X certainly does not equal B.

593
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,980
Friends, there is only one conspiracy.

594
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,300
And that is the conspiracy of the normals.

595
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,480
The one that doesn't even know it's a conspiracy.

596
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:31,900
But it only takes one such conspiracy to bring every one of our little individual conspiracies down.

597
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,520
That's the sad, sad part.

598
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,480
Especially when a subgenius falls for conspiracy.

599
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,420
And the conspiracy is a conspiracy bullshit.

600
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:45,720
Such as the idea that the Jews control America, so forth and so forth.

601
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:53,040
The big conspiracy always gives you a bunch of your own special little conspiracy enemy to hate.

602
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,900
They want to get you really hating one of those little conspiracies.

603
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,540
Because that way there's always one for you to join.

604
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,060
There's always one that's your friend.

605
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,220
That's also against that other little conspiracy.

606
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:15,560
And most of us on this last November 7th went out and voted for whichever conspiracy was the least of our enemies.

607
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,220
Or else we didn't vote at all.

608
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,680
Which meant you voted for whoever really won.

609
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,000
Well, we know who won.

610
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,620
Because like I say, they just shoot you in the back.

611
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,600
That's how they get there.

612
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,420
But, friends, I don't know.

613
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:37,200
It might be true that mere human Jews or commies or queers or Nazis or negroes or Mexicans.

614
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,200


615
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,440
Or Scientologists or good old boys or white supremacists or subgenius idiots run the entire world.

616
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,260
I don't know.

617
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,560
But I do know this.

618
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,200
They all know how to throw a damn good party.

619
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:55,680
But the party we will throw will make their parties look uncannily like, almost like little concentration camps.

620
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,000
A funny coincidence.

621
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,240
We talk a lot about coincidence.

622
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:06,080
Not many people like to admit that if alien science would seem like magic to us.

623
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,180
Then really, it would be magic.

624
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,720
Any good alien science would just seem like coincidence.

625
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,440
Notice any good coincidences lately?

626
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,040
Maybe that's just alien science.

627
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,780
Who is to judge, friends, but Bob?

628
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,320
And so let none be a bigot except for Bob.

629
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,320
Only Bob has the ability to judge a book by its cover and look a gift horse in the mouth and see.

630
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,880
And then get paid extra just to take that horse.

631
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,160
Friends, I myself have had to start being a bigot.

632
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:47,020
I have to be careful not to say mean and bigoted things about Christians and Republicans and commies.

633
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:54,000
And I was actually patting myself on the back one day thinking, wow, I'm so cool.

634
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,140
At least I'm not anti-Semitic for a, you know, Texas boy.

635
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:03,280
I forgive the Jews for inventing the thing that fucked them up and us.

636
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,340
I forgive them for inventing Christianity.

637
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:17,660
But I can never forgive our yeti ancestors for the foolishness of creating humans and then letting them out of their cages.

638
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,580
And now somebody said to me, Reverend Stang, did I hear you correctly?

639
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:28,520
You said that you shouldn't be mean and bigoted to Republicans, Christians, and communists?

640
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,980
Are you feeling okay, Reverend Stang?

641
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,680
Friends, what I meant was it is wrong to be mean and bigoted only.

642
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,860
For that is what we must say for the icing on the cake.

643
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:43,900
In our hating, we must use accuracy, clarity, and objective reasoning.

644
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:52,100
Because that blanket hating of abstract concepts is exactly the main conspiracy construct.

645
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:59,200
We must hate individual Christians and Republicans and Democrats.

646
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,960
Individual Christians.

647
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,980
You know, people.

648
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:11,340
Because the group, the them that you start hating, that's just a conspiracy-defined sub-conspiracy.

649
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,240
I don't mean sub-conspiracy.

650
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:21,120
It's there to lull and lure certain especially frustrated subgeniuses into thinking that there's a simple answer to everything.

651
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:30,420
And this us versus them crap is in fact the very sort of mass fuzzy thinking that the conspiracy invented.

652
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,480
Not Bob.

653
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,740
There's no us and there's no them.

654
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,940
There's just you, me, and everybody else.

655
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,840
But then you go, but what if the alternative conspiracies, can't I believe in any of those?

656
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,620
Can't, you know, aren't some of them at least cool?

657
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:57,920
The, you know, the jokers, the deformed people, the outcasts, the trans-ensexuals, you know, the mutants, the retards, and the hideous supergeniuses in wheelchairs.

658
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,340
You know, what if, what if...

659
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,340
What if them?

660
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:05,720
What if the bonobos, onobos, and monobos?

661
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,280
What if these once beloved minorities?

662
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:17,820
Must we distrust and hate them too and slay them instead of worshipping them as we subgenii always used to worship those weirdos and geeks?

663
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:23,000
In other words, can't we just kill without hating?

664
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,560
You know, it's enough.

665
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:39,320
That we're slowly, that on X-Day we're going to slowly dismember entire cities full of ignorant, disbelieving normals.

666
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,880
Do we have to drag hate into it?

667
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,020
Do we have to dirty up our clean killing with hate?

668
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,520
Friends, I don't, I don't feel that that's necessary.

669
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,700
I don't feel we need to lower ourselves to that kind of behavior.

670
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,400
Hating while killing.

671
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,720
We'll kill them!

672
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,740
Let's have the internet shut down.

673
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,540
I want them off the internet tomorrow.

674
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,800
If the Scientologists can do it, we can do it.

675
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,100
Stop the bandwidth.

676
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,040
I'm calling, I'm calling Ma Bell tomorrow.

677
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,220
And he can do it too. He knows the bells.

678
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,000
I know Mrs. Bell. I'm going to give her a call and I'm going to ream her out.

679
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,600
And the crowd goes crazy.

680
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,880
Not much of a crowd.

681
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,760
Well, it's early in the morning.

682
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,400
It's early out here.

683
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,900
We have a Last of Genius show.

684
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:28,520
Yeah.

685
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,320
There's probably a lot of people out there.

686
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,320
There's probably 20, 30 people there.

687
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,540
How many people came to the Last of Genius show?

688
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,300
And how many people will come to the one on Flash's property?

689
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,580
Are we going to be able to do that on Flash's property?

690
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,400
It's the scariest thing in the world.

691
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,380
Why would we do anything on Flash's property if he doesn't have a hot tub?

692
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,500
Oh yeah, you're right.

693
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,600
Because he's got two big legs.

694
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,620
Well, legs, great.

695
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,200
To throw Ivan Stang into, get it?

696
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,160
Yeah, it's like shooting Bob.

697
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,740
I know, exactly.

698
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,320
They did produce some amazing photographs though, just like shooting Bob.

699
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,500
Yeah, just like shooting Bob.

700
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,980
Done there, been that.

701
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:10,740
Yeah.

702
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,820
Hey, if either one of you guys ended up at X Day, you know, you'd be the next ones in line to get roasted.

703
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,740
I'll be there.

704
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,040
I can't wait to get roasted.

705
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,480
I'll be there.

706
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,800
Bob would love to get his revenge on puzzling evidence.

707
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,300
I know that for a fact.

708
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,100
Bob just wants to pay me back the money he owes me.

709
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,120
Yeah, oh, Byron has that money, Philo.

710
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,000
A guy gave it to Byron.

711
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,140
Along with your prop.

712
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,500
What's the matter, haven't you ever seen a man with throat cancer before?

713
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,740
I understand Byron still has your prop, is that right?

714
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,780
Thank you, yeah, thank you.

715
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,900
No, you have Byron's prop and you need to give that back to him.

716
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,220
I couldn't remember who had it, but I knew one of us had it.

717
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,500
You have it and you need to give it back to him.

718
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,620
I don't have it anymore, I'm sorry.

719
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,500
You may have left it at some girl's house, but...

720
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,420
Something happened to it.

721
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,240
It was in my possession for a long time, but little by little it's just kind of flickered away somehow.

722
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,860
I don't know how it disappeared on its own like that.

723
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,220
It started out about a pound and then little by little over the years...

724
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,240
It was a pound of really good prop.

725
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,900
It dwindled down to nothing on its own.

726
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,960
It's sort of like it just, like the will of the wisp or like the...

727
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,440
It was so beautiful.

728
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,620
The, um, the...

729
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,680
It was Haber prop Zip-U-Lot.

730
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,200
The legendary manna from heaven.

731
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,300
It sort of just dwindled away in the sunlight over the years.

732
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,480
The very manner of it, nanners of heaven.

733
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,620
And this was the gift of the subgeniuses.

734
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:40,500
If you go out in the street right now, you'll see the streets covered with Haber prop Zip-U-Lot.

735
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,600
They were talking about banana.

736
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,600
Brought to you by the subgenius church.

737
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,720
I got a banana from heaven.

738
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,720
I remember that.

739
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,320
I remember when I was eight years old, I saw Bob on Night Flight.

740
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,040
It changed my life.

741
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,200
And you let me down, man.

742
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,740
You let me down.

743
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,680
Come on, caller.

744
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,260
Be brave.

745
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:01,660
Poor Bob.

746
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,760
Light your own flame.

747
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,100
He's gotten the brunt of all of our jokes.

748
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:15,180
Brody Culpepper just came back on Christmas Day from Laos and he said the entire population near Dobstown, Malaysia, walks around with little bob pipes.

749
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:16,700
Everybody.

750
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,000
Well, they were doing that back in the 60s.

751
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,420
Yeah, but no people were going there to look at it, so it wasn't really happening.

752
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:23,920
Uh-oh.

753
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,200
Yeah.

754
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,980
I'll see you again, old scratch.

755
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,160
What are those funny things sticking out of your head?

756
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,720
Those are our antennae.

757
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,080
Are you a television set?

758
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,520
What in the ding-dong-heck-a-ma-doodle-hell is that?

759
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,560
Let's see if you bleed chlorophyll.

760
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:51,660
Plants are the most cunning and savage of all life forms.

761
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,900
I was following up on a lead to what some might consider just another New York City massacre.

762
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,660
A pretty woman thrown out of a high-rise window.

763
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,820
Her Japanese husband disemboweled.

764
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,000
And their two kids turned into shredded wheat.

765
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:08,880
Do you know what it's like to be violated by a 300-pound Filipino skinhead named Gunther?

766
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,180
It ain't no picnic!

767
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,340
Stop living in dreams.

768
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,900
No woman can travel the world without a man to defend her.

769
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,780
Please allow me to introduce myself.

770
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,400
I'm a woman of wealth and taste.

771
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:44,420
I've been around for long, long years, seen many men gone to waste.

772
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:52,220
I was round when Jesus Christ had his moments of doubt and pain.

773
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,340
Made damn sure the pilot washed his hands.

774
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,300
And sealed his fate.

775
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,460
Pleased to meet you.

776
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,820
Hope you guessed my name.

777
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,700
That thing that's troubling you?

778
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,740
It's the nature of my game.

779
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,200
I hung around St. Petersburg.

780
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,200
Till I saw it was time for a change.

781
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,140
I killed the Tsar.

782
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,520
And the ministers.

783
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,220
Anastasia screamed in vain.

784
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,900
I joined the ranks in the General's tent.

785
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,280
As the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank.

786
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,740
And I shouted,

787
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,580
Who killed the Kennedys?

788
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,500
Well, after all,

789
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,420
It was you and me.

790
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,340
Pleased to meet you.

791
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,780
Hope you guessed my name.

792
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,680
That thing that's troubling you?

793
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,280
It's the nature of my game.

794
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,400
Now, just as every cop is a criminal.

795
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,180
And every sinner a saint.

796
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,700
Heads or tails just call me Lucifer.

797
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,700
Cause I need some respect.

798
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,540
If you need me, have some courtesy.

799
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,480
Have some sympathy and some taste.

800
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,160
Accept your well-earned apologies.

801
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,520
Or I'll lay your soul to waste.

802
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:48,660
Hope you guessed my name.

803
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,620
Ooh.

804
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:25,980
Fuck your life, Sht�.

805
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,740
I'll lay my soul to waste.

806
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,180
Hope you guessed my name.

807
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,760
People won't tell.

808
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:36,760


809
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,540
And the horrors of losing their past.

810
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,620
Not only because of this me-

811
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,380
a thought or several.

812
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,380
Consider these alternate titles.

813
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,100
Earth Needs Women.

814
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,160
Angry Blue Planet.

815
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,240
Robinson Crusoe on Earth.

816
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,160
Mission to Earth.

817
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,580
Abbott and Costello Go to Earth.

818
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,200
Earth Attacks.

819
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,040
The Earth Chronicles.

820
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:17,640
Or even Reproduction Cycle Among Lower Lifeforms Under the Rocks of Earth.

821
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,520
Now think of these alternate titles.

822
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,900
The Day Mars Stood Still.

823
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,900
20 Million Miles to Mars.

824
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,320
Mars Versus the Flying Saucers.

825
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:36,040
Now, why do those somehow ring true?

826
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,380
Maybe some of you, they didn't ring true.

827
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,240
You said, what?

828
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,880
What the hell is he talking about?

829
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,320
Well, friends.

830
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,400
Some of us, and I think, I think you,

831
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,840
some of us have felt for a long time that we're on the wrong planet.

832
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,380
As Susie the Floozy put it, right hemisphere, wrong planet.

833
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,480
Well, you know, we always assumed,

834
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,620
well, that's because we're subgenius descendants of the Yeti.

835
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,440
We don't have pure blood human genes, you know.

836
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,560
Of course we feel a little left out.

837
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,620
But, you know, we've begun to suspect because of certain,

838
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,580
clues Bob left mostly in cheesy B-grade science fiction movies.

839
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:23,220
That, now, this sounds, again, this sounds ridiculous.

840
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,260
Ludicrous to the polished ears of the modernist, perhaps.

841
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,160
But, you know, it's theoretically possible to bump a planet out of its orbit.

842
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,120
Totally out of its orbit, put it into a new orbit.

843
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,080
It might even be possible to switch the orbit of one planet with another one

844
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,600
that was a similar size.

845
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:48,260
Could it be that the reason some of us do not feel at home

846
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:53,680
is because we were native to the planet now called by us Mars,

847
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,640
but which was originally the one true Earth,

848
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,940
and in which, in fact, we, the Martians, are in fact the only true Earth people,

849
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,000
and the conspiracy of the normals,

850
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:10,180
in fact, the ones who, oddly enough, seem to be trying to turn this planet into a,

851
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,640
a, a place with a poisonous,

852
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,660
poisonous atmosphere,

853
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:18,680
a dry desert covered with just rock and concrete.

854
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,720
Maybe somebody's pulled a trick on us somewhere.

855
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,860
Well, of course, now, at this point you're thinking,

856
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,080
yes, that all makes perfect sense.

857
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,780
Earth was switched with Mars.

858
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,740
The true Martians are us,

859
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,860
and no wonder we feel out of place.

860
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:39,600
And the true, the false Martians are trying to turn this planet into a false Mars

861
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,360
with, you know, carbon dioxide atmosphere,

862
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,240
and so forth.

863
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,740
Now, of course, and you all agree with that, right?

864
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,400
That makes sense.

865
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,680
Here's the tricky part.

866
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,980
It happened in 1953, and no one noticed.

867
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:59,480
I'm going to leave you, I'm going to charge you with thinking about that.

868
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:04,960
How did they switch planets in 1953 without any of us ever noticing?

869
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,140
Could we be that totally out of it?

870
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,380
Could perhaps the reason that X day

871
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,580
hasn't happened yet be that 1998 hasn't happened yet,

872
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,820
and that they kept it 1943 for 10 years or something like that,

873
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,540
and no one even knew the difference.

874
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,220
Everybody cuff now.

875
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,400
It's time to be carnivorous with your friends and family.

876
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,800
Everybody cuff down and pull out a paring knife,

877
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,160
because we're going to remove the sockets around Grandma and Grandpa's eyes.

878
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,980
They made a delectable treat for afternoons, summer pickled,

879
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,920
sitting by the old patio, or maybe talking to the fire.

880
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,740
It's time to go back.

881
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,820
You must keep talking to the fire.

882
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,220
It is time to return.

883
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,360
Shut up, Pink Bob.

884
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,800
Shut up, Pink Bob.

885
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,760
You can feel it for miles and miles.

886
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,400
Earth back to Mars.

887
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,840
Earth back to Mars.

888
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,680
And now the aroma is in the air.

889
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,540
You can sniff the aroma.

890
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,160
You can feel it.

891
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:12,260
Seize all.

892
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,520
All atomic pesticides.

893
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,300
It is talking to you.

894
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,420
The womb is talking to you now.

895
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,660
Get me out of here.

896
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:30,000
It is later than you think.

897
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,040
As we descend upon the minds of the members of the Cabinet,

898
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,820
the United States government, and the Senate, the Congress,

899
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,060
and the other representatives,

900
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,240
the representatives of the Congress,

901
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,420
the governments of the world,

902
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,920
we shall find in each one of them the chip is completely unaltered.

903
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,260
The plan is now in stage go.

904
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,380
The green light is lit and everyone is smoking.

905
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:56,700
The lamp is at your feet, old Buddha.

906
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,700
Please, please, put that back on.

907
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,940
I can't stand the sight of it.

908
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:02,980
It's...

909
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,560
The Exhibitionist Buddha.

910
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,460
Little mentioned in ancient texts.

911
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,320
Slathering Siddhartha, he was called,

912
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,520
for his bow-legged appurtenance,

913
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,720
and the strange way he made the women in Gopis cry

914
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,000
as they ran from the villages in fright.

915
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,960
For this is a matter of life or death.

916
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:25,600
Who is he?

917
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,700
Your lives.

918
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,260
The lives of everyone on Earth.

919
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,460
At one o'clock on July 24th,

920
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,280
Zyra, a new planet, will pass so close to the Earth,

921
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,660
it will cause vast destruction.

922
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,960
The Z-ists.

923
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,300
Never before in the history of the world

924
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,940
has humanity felt so close to God.

925
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,400
As Zyra inexorably rushes toward us,

926
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,180
perhaps to destroy the Earth,

927
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,700
men and women of all races and streams

928
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,320
pause to think, to pray, and to atone.

929
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,780
As the evacuation of coastal cities progressed,

930
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,420
tales of individual acts of heroism and sacrifice

931
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,780
poured into newspaper offices.

932
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,300
So that's what's happening.

933
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,880
How can we get out of here on a broken planet?

934
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,500
The planet Zyra is heading towards Earth.

935
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,080
We must not tell the people

936
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,640
As inexplicably as life itself,

937
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:22,080
the planet Zyra hurtles closer and closer to Stang's head.

938
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,920
You know, Stang's head equipped with a special antenna.

939
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,160
Nineteen-year-olds today are so stupid,

940
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,300
you could probably play that on the radio and they'd believe it.

941
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,800
No, no, they would not believe that the planet Zyra is actually approaching.

942
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:38,640
That's exactly why they let us play it on the radio.

943
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,520
Just think if you were one of the skanks-wanks who had enough dough.

944
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,020
Only those teenagers would believe it.

945
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,340
Only the sub- and the subgeniuses would believe in anything.

946
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,480
Praise Bob.

947
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,440
And, uh, friends, you're listening to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

948
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:08,620
As, uh, recently, a combination and a collision of shows from KPSA,

949
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,600
WCFN, Berkeley, WCSB, here in Cleveland,

950
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:15,440
and, uh, elsewhere around the divivals around the world,

951
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,560
and the artists of alt-binary slack.

952
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:21,380
And, friends, if you want to know more about the word Bob Church's subgenius books,

953
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,660
tapes, and videos, and geegahs, t-shirts, and blah, blah, blah,

954
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:32,580
and, uh, friends, you can always check our website at www.subgenius.com.

955
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,400
Subgenius is spelled without an O.

956
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,520
Although we do have a decoy one there,

957
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,540
for the real subgeniuses, so they won't get lost.

958
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,440
And, uh, you can write for free information,

959
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,920
or more at, uh,

960
00:49:50,120 --> 00:50:01,020
Hour of Slack at Post Office Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

961
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:08,300
Now, if you want to send your tapes, or CDs, or videos to me, Reverend Ivan Stang,

962
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:13,120
uh, my actual production studio is here at the Cleveland branch,

963
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:24,900
and you can send that to me at Post Office Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

964
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:31,000
And if that's too confusing, I'm stang at subgenius.com.

965
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:37,100
Friends, you can also, uh, you might want to get in touch with Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

966
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,960
who's doing this music in the background,

967
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,100
and who has the show on WCSB on Thursday nights,

968
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,240
from which this show is scavenged,

969
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:48,940
like a Frankenstein's monster from the parts of dead shows.

970
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:53,720
That's Einstein's Secret Orchestra, ESO, at Post Office Box.

971
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:59,160
Blah, blah, blah, no, yeah, yes, friends,

972
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:04,400
the church of the subgenius was born out of Bob in Dallas in the 19,

973
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,080
in, actually, January 1st, 19...

974
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,000
1980, the pamphlet number one was first released.

975
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:13,860
But, my friends, it was never limited to Dallas.

976
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,960
Dallas, we, it was a good place to begin the operations,

977
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:23,580
because it is a sterile town, a sterile city, full of sterile pinks,

978
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,460
most of whom don't even come from Texas.

979
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:31,000
And, uh, friends, I, uh, have, uh, have gotten out,

980
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,080
and, of course, uh, the church is in the hearts and minds of every subgenius,

981
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,280
everywhere.

982
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,260
Uh, some find it on the internet, some find it in the bookstore,

983
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,280
some find it in the junkyard,

984
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,540
uh, but the luckiest ones find it in the gutter,

985
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,520
at the bottom of a bottle of muscatel.

986
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,760
Because, friends, those are the ones that have reached the bottom,

987
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:58,340
that have yet achieved total slack through slacklessness,

988
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:03,380
and now can reverse their evolution, as under Bob,

989
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,760
to become slackless millionaires,

990
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,340
who give all their money to Bob.

991
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:13,960
Praise Bob, Hail Connie, and, uh, ah, yes, let there be slack.

992
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,760
Listen.

993
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,440
Friendly persuasion.

994
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,420
Hahahaha.

995
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:01,820
They're sackin' близke opportunity if not more.

996
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,840
Uh, keep your eyes open.

And that was the Bran Flakes new album, dear friends.

1012
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:21,180
Friendly Persuasion from the Bran Flakes new album.

1013
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,880
And you can contact...

1014
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:27,180
They are at thebranflakes.com

1015
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,220
And Bran Flakes is spelled like you would expect.

1019
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:39,940
And now, back to Burning Man with Philo and Puzzling.

1020
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,280
And Burning Bush with Phineas.

1021
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,380
Ah, yes.

1022
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,060
It's so exciting.

1023
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,820
We're out here on the playa.

1024
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,080
And it's raining.

1025
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,360
And we're going to get money.

1026
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:53,840
And we're going to get the badge of our new president.

1027
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,640
We won't be able to walk out of here.

1028
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,020
No.

1029
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,320
We'll just have to stay here for days.

1030
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:01,080
But we've got George W. to study the words, the wisdom.

1031
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,420
The optimisticist can happen.

1032
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:02,860
Yeah.

1033
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,580
The optimisticist can happen, scum.

1034
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,620
I asked you to pray for...

1035
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,420
I asked you...

1036
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,920
I voted for...

1037
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,380
I asked you to pray for Gore.

1038
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,320
I asked you...

1039
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,960
I asked you to pray for Gore.

1040
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,720
Our future demands it.

1041
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,300
You were supposed to vote for Larry.

1042
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:19,980
You're supposed to pray to God on your knees.

1043
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:21,860
That he dies.

1044
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,640
Together we will create an America...

1045
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,980
Is he like the Jesus guy?

1046
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:26,620
Yeah.

1047
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,120
And an America that is...

1048
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:28,940
An America...

1049
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:29,760
In our diversity...

1050
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:30,620
In our diversity...

1051
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,180
Diverse...

1052
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,260
Excellent school...

1053
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,940
Yes, all Americans will get diversity...

1054
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,000
Excellent...

1055
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:36,720
In the new America.

1056
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,160
In the new America.

1057
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,000
Shared American values...

1058
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,300
In America...

1059
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,100
American values...

1060
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:43,720
The charge...

1061
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,660
No, I don't think so.

1062
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,960
Fight the Bush crackdown.

1063
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,380
Not over National Radio.

1064
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,500
By now, in Bogota, Colombia,

1065
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,440
is the editor of...

1066
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:53,520
The newspaper...

1067
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,860
Juan Carlos Pastrana.

1068
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:55,480
Pastrana.

1069
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,040
Pastrami.

1070
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,200
Yeah, I can have some pastrami on my Bushdown crack.

1071
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,120
Okay, fine.

1072
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,260
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

1073
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,240
Man, I'm tired.

1074
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,080
End of message.

1075
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,140
Hello, Radio Shack.

1076
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:07,580
This is Bob.

1077
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,160
How may I help you?

1078
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,800
This is Radio Shack.

1079
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,320
This is Graham.

1080
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,180
Can I help you?

1081
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,480
No, it's Bob.

1082
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,640
You're calling me?

1083
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,260
Uh-huh.

1084
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,700
Oh, somebody's played an evil joke on us.

1085
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,060
Ah.

1086
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,940
What people will do is...

1087
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,660
People who have conference call capability on their phones...

1088
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,640
Sad little...

1089
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:22,920
Sad little...

1090
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,220
It's a sick world.

1091
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:24,840
Okay.

1092
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,660
They're the only puppies sick enough to do that.

1093
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,380
Oh, I gotta run.

1094
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,220
Okay, bye.

1095
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:29,900
Hello?

1096
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:30,780
Hello?

1097
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:31,920
Hello?

1098
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:32,840
Pardon?

1099
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:33,760
Goat?

1100
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,640
Uh, no, Goat is not here yet.

1101
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,240
You're talking to Mr. Miracle Man.

1102
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,140
Would you like to pump the obscenities,

1103
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,060
or would you just like to have your feet shaven?

1104
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,020
Well, I'm sorry you're gonna have to wait,

1105
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,000
because we're on wait mode, as you know, right now,

1106
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,420
as Scott and Lona have told us,

1107
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,500
we've been waiting here for the last 45 days,

1108
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,700
and still there's no sign of it.

1109
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,160
Uh, we're calling it now, uh, Day 45.

1110
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,140
Can you tell us a little bit of, uh,

1111
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,160
about, uh, where we stand right now, Reverend?

1112
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,600
Well, yeah, that's exactly right.

1113
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,620
Day 45 and counting.

1114
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:09,120
45 days until it is released.

1115
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,000
And it appears...

1116
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,540
It will finally happen.

1117
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:14,940
And if, uh, tomorrow, things, uh, go as the way they have been going,

1118
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,400
and it's not likely to get much better,

1119
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,800
it'll probably be Day 46.

1120
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,840
It will be Day 46.

1121
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,040
It will still be waiting.

1122
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,060
It will be.

1123
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,440
Forever after Day 45.

1124
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,760
I'm gonna say the...

1125
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,600
It will be it.

1126
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,320
For me and my family...

1127
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:28,840
It will be the world.

1128
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,140
...has been excruciating.

1129
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,900
Uh, my little dog, Norice, left me, uh, something in the mail,

1130
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,740
and, uh, the rest of my family just broke up, as it were.

1131
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,460
They didn't even, uh, bother to call me.

1132
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,220
They just, uh, in a thousand little splintered pieces...

1133
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:44,060
I saw those horrible little melting pieces.

1134
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,200
We've had calls like this from, uh, everyone in town.

1135
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,100
In fact, everybody called at one time to tell us that, like, everything is collapsing.

1136
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:52,880
It is.

1137
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,220
And it's time to go.

1138
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,180
Back into our...

1139
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:55,940
Till next week.

1140
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,880
...original component parts.

1141
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:58,940
Keep your hat on tight.

1142
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,760
You're back to the winter sack in the saddle.

1143
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,280
Try to keep from bleeding.

1144
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,200
This is the S.O. Radio, kids.

1145
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,400
Try to continue...

1146
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,680
We'll be back next Thursday night.

1147
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,640
...taking air.

1148
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:12,100
After we go and sweep the Freetown Music Awards.

1149
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:17,840
...and the big nasty from croaking up your throat and going into your head.

1150
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,000
I think it's awesome.

1151
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,900
...me home.

1152
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:22,780
You said...

1153
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,460
Silly boy.

1154
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:31,260
Put your arms around me.

1155
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,660
Take me home.

1156
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:39,080
You silly boy.

1157
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,600
All the world is not right.

1158
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,500
Silly boy.

1159
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,300
Hurry up and go.

1160
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,400
You can't hear me, can you?

1161
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,160
I don't even know what you're talking about.

1162
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:16,160


1163
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:16,160


1164
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:16,160


1165
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,260
I'll burn his head, doctor.

1166
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:18,260


1167
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:18,260


1168
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:18,260


1169
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:18,260


1170
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:18,260


1171
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:18,260


1172
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:18,840
We can't even say it's a garbage truck.

1173
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,240
Bagpipes on top of that are bubble gums...

1174
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:19,240


1175
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:19,600
That happens many times.

1176
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:19,680
Dig it up, good night.

1177
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,920
... Rubbia!

1178
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:22,920


1179
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:22,920


1180
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:22,920


1181
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:22,920


1182
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:22,920


1183
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:22,920


1184
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:51,260
And this is a rerun of Hour of Slack number 777.

1185
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,800
Hour of Slack number 777.
