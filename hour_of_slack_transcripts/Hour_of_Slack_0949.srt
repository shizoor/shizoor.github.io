00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:11,280
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,700
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,200
Is specially designed only to be played on radio station

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,960
And only in the city of

6
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,320
So I'm packing and re-running

7
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,080
Friends, this Hour of Slack number 949

8
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,560
Is really number 744 from the year 2000

9
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,260
Just after Triple X Day

10
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:21,120
And you know friends, it's as true now as it was then

11
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,840
Amen

12
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,380
Everybody be seated please

13
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,060
Thank you very much

14
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,680
The sermon today

15
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,600
Is the meek shall inherit nothing

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,200
Amen

17
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,960
Some take the Bible for what it's worth

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,180
When they see it

19
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,780
Says that the meek shall inherit the earth

20
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,900
Well I heard that some sheik

21
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,260
Has bought New Jersey last week

22
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,460
And you suckers ain't getting nothing

23
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,100
Is Harry Rama really wrong

24
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,560
When you wander around

25
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,000
With a napkin on

26
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,140
With a bell on a stick

27
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,420
And your hair is all gone

28
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,200
The geek shall inherit nothing

29
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,540
So you say your life's a bum deal

30
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,320
And you're up against the wall

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,240
Well you ain't really got

32
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,280
No deal at all

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,240
Cause what they do

34
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,340
In Washington

35
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,380
They just take care of

36
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,160
Number one

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,260
And number one

38
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,400
And you

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,440
You ain't even number two

40
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,800
You ain't even number two

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,140
You ain't even number two

42
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,280
Well those Jesus freaks

43
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,120
Well they friendly but

44
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,240
The shit they believe

45
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,520
Has got their minds all shut up

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,560
And they don't even care

47
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,720
If the church take a cut

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,700
Ain't it bleak when you got so much nothing

49
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,900
So what do you do

50
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,020
Eat that pork

51
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,280
Eat that ham

52
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,740
Laugh till you choke on Billy Graham

53
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,120
Moses, Aaron, and Abraham

54
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,460
They're all a waste of time

55
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,160
Let's take a look at the Bible

56
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,380
And it's your ass that's on the line

57
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,880
Do what you wanna, do what you will

58
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,240
Just don't mess up your neighbor's thrill

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,420
When you pay the bill, kindly leave a little tip

60
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,760
And help the next poor sucker on his one-way trip

61
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,940
Some take the Bible, some take the Bible

62
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,220
Some take the Bible

63
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,800
The Persuasion's doing Zappa, friends.

64
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,260
Yes, that amazing thing is The Persuasion's doing Zappa

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,960
from their album of all Zappa songs.

66
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,740
Friends.

67
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,660
Frankly, a capella.

68
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,300
But yes, it's true.

69
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,760
We survived, friends.

70
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,080
We survived another end of the world drill.

71
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,440
Triple X Day.

72
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,700
We didn't get off in spaceships,

73
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,580
but we did get screwed, friends.

74
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,120
And Bob, well, old Bobby, he came.

75
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,420
Bob and Connie showed up at the last minute

76
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,100
to climax our orgy.

77
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,780
Vintage was a glorious X Day drill, my friends.

78
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,480
A suitably slack-filled,

79
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,940
a beginning of the real countdown,

80
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,600
the real new millennium,

81
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,580
which we commemorate with this first

82
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,320
all-digitally mixed hour of slack.

83
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,600
The first hour of slack on CD.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,440
Although some parts of the X Day celebrations

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,280
were recorded only on cheap, hissy audio tape,

86
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,700
there's so many great moments, friends,

87
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,800
like Sympathy for the Devil,

88
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,420
played by Bliss America

89
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,220
in front of a giant bob painted by Jesus.

90
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,540
From now on, every subgenius band

91
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,300
is gonna have to do Sympathy for the Devil

92
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,280
in front of a giant bob.

93
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,060
Friends, the conspiracy is still with us,

94
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,480
but at least we're getting rid of the hiss.

95
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,360
No more hissy-fisted nimbobs.

96
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,380
Henceforth, friends, it's a pissy-whooped Connie Law,

97
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,060
because it was a Connie-type X Day.

98
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,420
The Connieites ruled this festival,

99
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,900
and that's why, for once, it was more sex than violence.

100
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,120
But we did have violence, friends.

101
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,600
Don't worry.

102
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,080
It wasn't just sex, boys,

103
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,220
but mostly, mostly it was slack.

104
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,920
We broke the tolerance barrier, friends,

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,260
and wait till you hear the rants and banter

106
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,920
from the bands and ranters of the triple X Day baby.

107
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,560
We all know it was everybody!

108
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,440
Woo-hoo!

109
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,500
Woo-hoo!

110
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,600
Woo-hoo!

111
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,600
Woo-hoo!

112
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,560
Woo-hoo!

113
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,500
Woo-hoo!

114
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:23,980
Woo-hoo!

115
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,720
Woo-hoo!

116
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,000
Woo-hoo!

117
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,020


118
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,220
Woo-hoo!

119
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,580
Woo-hoo!

120
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:28,720
Woo-hoo!

121
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:28,720


122
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:28,720


123
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:28,720


124
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:28,720


125
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,000
Woo-hoo!

126
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,800
Woo-hoo!

127
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,880
Friends, are we controlled by secret forces?

128
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,480
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

129
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,100
Do people think you're strange?

130
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,360
Do you?

131
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,540
Then you may be on the right track.

132
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,860
Give me slack, or give me food, or kill me!

133
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,580
Give me food, or kill me!

134
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,740
Steep right up, step right up!

135
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,080
Come on!

136
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,680
Come all!

137
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,600
Come on, one another!

138
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,620
Great big gloss!

139
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,180
Welcome to the subgenius festival of freaks!

140
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,700
The triple X Day, triple Xtravaganza that saves your soul for a mere $30 or triple your

141
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,760
god damned money back!

142
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,560
It serves up tenderloin of pink and a series of savage gestures, and a crazy show of the

143
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


144
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


145
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


146
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


147
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


148
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


149
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


150
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


151
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


152
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


153
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


154
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


155
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


156
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


157
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


158
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


159
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


160
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


161
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


162
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,420
for charm's sake. It puts loud

163
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,560
plaid pants on the devil. It soothes your

164
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,580
soul, felches your holes, and takes you on a grand

165
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,480
tour of the grassy knoll. Step right up.

166
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,560
See common decency

167
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,580
skewered on the pitchfork of special privilege.

168
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,520
Hear music that'd scare the living

169
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,460
fuck out of the local Amish if they got close enough

170
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:39,960
to hear it.

171
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,500
See the asses that launched a thousand wet

172
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,020
dreams. Hear ye, hear ye.

173
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,740
Buy stank's chest

174
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,960
hairs for a dollar a pluck.

175
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,540
Sample as a result of screams. Use them as a

176
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,360
rhythm bed for the music

177
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,300
competition. We'll hold the next year's two-malt

178
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,080
if the saucers don't come again this year.

179
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,740
Step right up.

180
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,300
When thin 30 does it. Join the

181
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,060
jubilant jamboree that makes that juvenile

182
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,180
jackanapes Jim Jones jerkwad jackoff

183
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,240
look like the jar of jizz it was. Praise

184
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,400
Bob.

185
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,300
Kick it, lick it, suck it,

186
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,140
whack it, dress it up in cutesy little pants

187
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,200
and make it do the pee-pee dance. Bring on them

188
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,280
saucers. I'm paid up. I want to get laid up.

189
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,320
I stayed up all night at Subgenius Bootcamp.

190
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,220
Huh? Who needs sleep?

191
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,360
Drinking that suspicious coffee that ate through

192
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,340
the friggin' spoon just so I could be here

193
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,460
tonight to tell you that it is a sin not to dump

194
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,500
your soul in your wallet and hand the whole fucking mess

195
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,440
over to Bob.

196
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,400
Because it's the best deal you'll get outside

197
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,460
a three-day blowjob from Hypatia League

198
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,400
as the fun just keeps on coming and so will

199
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,220
you. Praise Bob.

200
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,180
Take a deep cleansing breath

201
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:43,960
and release.

202
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,080
Yeah.

203
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,860
See, that's it. All I had to do was speak in tongues.

204
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,220
Robert Tilton style. I used Robert Tilton's magic

205
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,580
words.

206
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,260
Chag Chag Mabah

207
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,320
Deba Soya.

208
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,140
And Triple X Day

209
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,800
ceremonies begin. Praise Bob.

210
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,980
Care. Praise Bob.

211
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,520
No, it is the biggest, the biggest crowd to show

212
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,080
up at the opening ceremonies.

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,840
And I'll get it over with as quick as I can.

214
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,100
But, praise Bob.

215
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,220
Y'all made it to Triple X Day.

216
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,340
You made it. You actually, if you're any,

217
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,940
most everybody I talk to, the devil was trying to stop them.

218
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,660
The cops were trying to stop them.

219
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,360
The weather was trying to stop them.

220
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,160
Their cars were trying to stop them.

221
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,880
You were telling them to stop me.

222
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,880
Their own intelligence, their brain, rational thoughts

223
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,800
said, don't do it, man.

224
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,520
But they did not let, you did not let your brain stop them.

225
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:51,520


226
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:51,620
They did not let your brain stop you.

227
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,660
And that is what slack is all about.

228
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,760
Don't ever let your brain stop you.

229
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,600
The thing I think about showing up, we just sort of appeared here,

230
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,120
and we sort of wanted here.

231
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,840
It's like migration, every kind of thing.

232
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,980
Yes, it's migration.

233
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,740
Every year, certain, a certain species migrates to its place.

234
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,540
It's mating grounds, friends.

235
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,500
There are many animals that can hardly, they don't even want to get laid unless they're at their mating grounds.

236
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:21,500


237
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:21,500


238
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:21,500


239
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:21,500


240
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:21,500


241
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,060
What, what, what, what?

242
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,220


243
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,280
Oh, well, you go sniffing around, you just find out.

244
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:40,640
I know what you just want to, you're, no, you're, you, you younger males will have your time at the top of the heap.

245
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,380
But first you must defeat the old, many silverbacks who are in line ahead of you.

246
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,160
Including a doctor like you.

247
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,500
And he's really, really good.

248
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:51,840
He's really ugly.

249
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:59,260
So, um, anyway, friends, this is truly, I mean, well, I mean, the, the,

250
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,300
Truly.

251
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,580
We will admit that there have been some disappointments here at this very place.

252
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:05,900
No.

253
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,280
On a yearly basis.

254
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,080
This would be the third year in a row if we're not lucky.

255
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,740
But, friends, we're going to get lucky.

256
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,160
We will get off, and if we won't get off, at least we'll get screwed.

257
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,700
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity for thousands of years.

258
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,860
God has been misquoted all this time.

259
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,500
Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet.

260
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,280
Jehovah is an alien.

261
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,220
Jehovah is an alien.

262
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,360
I just love you more than the terror of the dark.

263
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,980
To get technical, of course.

264
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,160
Doctrinally, it does not say in the book of the subgenius that the exodus will rupture.

265
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,220
The subgenius is on July 5th at 7 o'clock a.m. year 2000.

266
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,680
No.

267
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,840
It does, however, say that in the year 2000 the exodus will leave.

268
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,740
Which we interpret, of course, to be the rupture, the foretold rupture of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

269
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,540
Now, uh, now, when the, and we presume that when the exodus leave, they'll have the courtesy to take us with them.

270
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,620
If they think we're worthy.

271
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,920
If they think that tape is worth flipping.

272
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,080
For the tape of your life, my friends, your life is like a cassette tape.

273
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,260
An audio, not a CD, an audio cassette tape.

274
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,160
It's got a couple of sides to it.

275
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,640
You better hope that first side's interesting enough to Bob Dobbs that he's reminded to flip it.

276
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:47,760
If he don't like what you do with that tape, he ain't going to, he might just decide to record over it with something better, friends.

277
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,520
Friends, this has been a wonderful show.

278
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:50,520


279
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,860
This has been a wonderful X Day for me because I have had slack.

280
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,720
We've learned a lot over the last few X Days.

281
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,300
We used to run around trying to make sure we put on a good show and prove to the aliens that we had slack.

282
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,140
Well, friends, slack ain't like that.

283
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,800
Slack is just, you know, why should we worry about anything?

284
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,800
Because we can let the aliens do it.

285
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,500
That's the, now, many subgeniuses sit around and think, oh, who am I, I'm making my list.

286
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,300
I'm making my list of all the hated pinks in my life that I'm going to kill.

287
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,940
Friends, you don't have to spend, that's kind of anti-slack.

288
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,640
All you have to do on X Day is think about who not to have killed.

289
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,140
That's, it's like you get to decide who gets on Noah's Ark.

290
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,080
So try to think about the, you know, think the nice thoughts.

291
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,920
Think about, you don't want to end up ruptured onto the escape vessels.

292
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:56,260
And be halfway to Planet X when suddenly you go, oh my God, I forgot my poor old sweet mother and father back there on Earth.

293
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,220
Oh Lord, I should have stopped the aliens from turning, from killing them.

294
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,400
And at least gotten them a good place in the concentration camps or something.

295
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,440
When was the last time you thought about your family and buying them, saving their asses whether they want to be saved or not?

296
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,180
Friends, we're just like the Mormons.

297
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,900
You can buy your ancestors their way out of hell.

298
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,180
Yes, friends.

299
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,020
All we have to do is say who not to kill.

300
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,920
Because as J.R. Bob Dobbs, here's a new Bob quote for you, friends.

301
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,220
The latest memo from J.R. Bob Dobbs was this.

302
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:47,100
Quote, about the same, quote unquote, isn't the same as, quote, the same, unquote, unquote, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

303
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,580
Friends!

304
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,640
This is the last year that there's going to be a church of the subgenius.

305
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,820
Because the Earth ain't going to need one after that.

306
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,300
We're going to be gone, baby, gone.

307
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:01,080
And this has been a great last year for this old church.

308
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,300
And it is the last year, but it's been a great one.

309
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,300
Why, we got new publishers for our out of print books.

310
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,680
iUniverse.com will be publishing High Weirdness by Mail and Three Fisted Tales by our friends.

311
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,300
We've been doing deep Bibles and saving souls all over this.

312
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,640
Be 90 Glow.

313
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:27,120
Dallas, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, San Francisco, Tampa, Cleveland, Seattle, Lemuria, Columbus, Mars, friends.

314
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,740
And we've been building our own ships, too.

315
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:36,540
Did you know that we just opened the first subgenius office building in Dallas, Texas?

316
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,260
We built our own ship.

317
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,540
We opened a branch office in Cleveland, Ohio.

318
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,180
We built our own ship, friends.

319
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,320
We got back on live radio.

320
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,500
Our Slack is still on 17 College Station, friends.

321
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,240
And Time Magazine voted Bob Dobbs the fraud of the century.

322
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,620
We've done the rehearsals, friends.

323
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,640
We've done our homework.

324
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,840
We've sacrificed the virgins.

325
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,460
We're onboard the ships.

326
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,180
We've got our lighters right up against the fuse, friends.

327
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,620
And we are ready.

328
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:13,200
Earth first, and then we'll destroy all the other planets.

329
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,320
Goodbye.

330
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,780
Goodbye, Earth.

331
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,820
Because I must get off.

332
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,840
Oh, yes.

333
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,760
Yes, yes.

334
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,680
Yes, friends.

335
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,040
Friends, my name is St. Byron Werner.

336
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,760
I've been a subgenius, a proud subgenius, for 20 years.

337
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,700
This is the first time I've gotten up to rant.

338
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,540
Probably the last time I'll rant.

339
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,520
I'm taking my time getting into this church.

340
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,640
I'm taking it nice and slow because...

341
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,400
I tell you, there are times...

342
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,600
I know it sounds crazy, but I don't really trust Bob.

343
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,500
And I'm here to tell you that I have severe doubts about the sacrament of slack.

344
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,300
Slack itself?

345
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,320
I'm here to talk against slack and in favor of stress.

346
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,440
I know.

347
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,300
You all work your long jobs.

348
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,340
You go on home.

349
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,380
First thing, you hit that refrigerator for that beer.

350
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,500
And you roll up a nice frog stick.

351
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,500
Helps you hold on.

352
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,640
Helps you feel, dare I say it, normal.

353
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,400
But anyway, I think this is wrong.

354
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:29,600
I think there's nothing like a good head of steam, of hate, of stress,

355
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:36,240
to sharpen your view about what the fuck is wrong and what you ought to do about it.

356
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,920
Now, Solver Dolly, when he would write,

357
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,160
he'd put on a pair of shiny little black patent leather shoes,

358
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,020
little fetishistic shoes for him.

359
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,880
But he bought them a couple sizes too small.

360
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,960
So they'd squeeze his feet.

361
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,220
So he would sharpen his brain and he could...

362
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,300
You know, when you're stressful, you know who your enemies are.

363
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,820
You know what's wrong.

364
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,640
And eventually, you know what you gotta do about it.

365
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,260
And I think coming home after that horrible, kiss-ass job

366
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,300
that you gotta do to be able to keep your house

367
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,660
or buy more frop or whatever you gotta do,

368
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,240
I think you're dissipating your energy.

369
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,100
You're dissipating your holy hate, your sacred sarcasm

370
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,600
that's gotta be chilled.

371
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,040
You gotta stop these people.

372
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,020
Come on!

373
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,900
Beer is false slack.

374
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,860
Beer could be false slack.

375
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,780
I do love beer. Look at this shade. This is beer, baby.

376
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,240
But I'm thinking, you know, we can't just think about it.

377
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,240
We can't just think about ourselves first.

378
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,540
We can't say, oh, I feel stressed.

379
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,040
I don't wanna fight the conspiracy today.

380
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,140
I gotta slack off.

381
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,700
And you've got that beer and you feel more like,

382
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,300
hey, live and let live, you know?

383
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,340
Fuck that! Live and let live!

384
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,240
My God!

385
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,720
You gotta hold on to that hate!

386
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,540
Stay tense! Drink too much coffee!

387
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,960
Stop having sex! Get married! Stop having sex!

388
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,360
Seems to go hand in hand, but keep yourself sharp.

389
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,760
Focus yourself into a time and heart lens

390
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,540
that you can just beat that hate out and blast them

391
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,940
peakies walking across the street.

392
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's your job.

393
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,580
Do it anonymously or just be out there being the weirdest fucking subgenius you can.

394
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,100
Get in their face.

395
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,620
Just give it to them.

396
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,260
Then after you've done something, then you get your slack.

397
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,940
But you're not doing nothing!

398
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,240
Get out there!

399
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,600
And the next time somebody says, oh, have a nice day, sir.

400
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,820
Did he help with those bags out to the car?

401
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
How you doing today?

402
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,260
You can look at them and say,

403
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,100
Bring on the conspiracy,

404
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,580
because I know my forehead can stop that tank!

405
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,980
I'm a man of honor!

406
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,100
I'm a man of honor!

407
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,160
Okay, St. Andrew, are you ready to give us your in?

408
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,020
You folks are so freaking kind.

409
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,720
I look out into this vast, enormous, we've never really played a place this big before

410
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,560
and never have seen so many people in one place.

411
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,140
And you don't know how grateful we are that some of you are still breathing

412
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,520
and that others of you have not started the transmorphal shift yet.

413
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,000
Especially Dr. Lagoum, who right around this time of night begins, you know, the,

414
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,560
well, we don't want to get into the,

415
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,220
the lower chakra begins to start.

416
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,700
It begins to expand and you all begin to decrease right along with it.

417
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,420
So don't start hoping them yet, doc.

418
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,260
There's lots of time, isn't there?

419
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,100
Time's been suspended!

420
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,560
I'm a man of honor!

421
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,640
I'm a man of honor!

422
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:31,800
Father of night, father of day, father who takes the darkness away,

423
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,200
Father who teaches, father who teaches,

424

Builder of rainbows up in the sky,

427
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,360
Father of day, father of night,

Father of black and father of white,

429
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,900
Father who hides the mountain so high,

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,580
Shaping the clouds up in the sky,

431
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,680
Father of loneliness and pain,

432
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,300
Father of night, father of day.

433
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:16,340
Whoo, hooo, learning how to be left alone,

434
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,160
Ah, ooh-oh, ah-ooh-oh-oh-oh-yes,

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Father of light, hope He YouTuber,

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,200

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,780
Father of week, Father of cold, and Father of heat

Father of air, Father of trees

00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,140
Father of night, Father of day

443
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,840
Father who takes the darkness away

Father who teaches men to fly

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,520
Father of loneliness and pain

447
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,100
Father of night, Father of day

Great hospital anduri Mack

449
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,180


450
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,300
Res� existence of the movie

451
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:55,580

guitar solo

456
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,160
Thank you.

457
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:44,140
But with just a few short, quick lines,

458
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,920
we have the symbol of the new Bob order.

459
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,480
The symbol that we will rally against

460
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,220
to destroy the very conspiracy.

461
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,460
It makes me believe that the new order is soon coming.

462
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,440
That the...

463
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,500
The black copters and the black Humvees

464
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,880
will roll down the streets

465
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,560
and then we will know when to run and hide

466
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,520
or when to run and shoot.

467
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,240
But friends,

468
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,260
we know something a little bit different.

469
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,680
The new world order has already taken place.

470
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,800
The conspiracy's boot is invisible,

471
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,860
but it is on your back,

472
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,400
pushing you down.

473
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,580
Friends, there's only one way to beat the conspiracy,

474
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,560
and that is not to take them over,

475
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,880
but to become them.

476
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,820
Yes, friends, we'll become the new conspiracy.

477
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,360
Yeah!

478
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:35,940
Yeah!

479
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,900
Under the symbol of Bob.

480
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,980
And then they will do what we say,

481
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,420
when we say, and how we say.

482
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,120
Yes, the great race of the subgenius

483
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,340
will take back the motherland.

484
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,800
Friends, America has been destroyed.

485
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,180
It has been destroyed by them.

486
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,660
It was once a proud country.

487
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,380
It was once a proud country

488
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,000
that was rallied under wonderful things like growing hemp.

489
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:01,900
Yeah!

490
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:02,740
And it's been destroyed by them.

491
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,480
Yes, we will see the freedom of expression.

492
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,440
Liberty!

493
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:06,800
Liberty!

494
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,760
Does anyone even know what that means anymore?

495
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,340
Well, friends, no.

496
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,220
It's been all reduced to a beer commercial

497
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,620
and a cigarette ad.

498
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,220
Well, friends, soon this will be the only ad they will see.

499
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,580
Praise Jesus!

500
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,100
Hold up! Hold up!

501
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,160
I've got to get a TV antenna light.

502
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,820
Stop it now!

503
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,520
Ha, ha, ha!

504
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,320
Friends, yes, we will unite

505
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,840
in order to bring down the conspiracy.

506
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,460
Friends, Bob is dead.

507
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,400
Long live Bob.

508
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,140
Yeah!

509
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:44,900
Whoo!

510
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,380
Yeah!

511
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,340
And now, sales pitch.

512
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:51,420
Yeah!

513
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,240
Yeah!

514
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:32,460


515
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,280
N Stadium is prime.

516
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:50,280


517
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,660
Thank you very much.

518
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,480
Alright, thanks.

519
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:52,540
Well, bosses, have a good evening.

520
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:52,780
Have a cute evening.

521
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:52,780


522
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:52,960
Get used to a good evening.

523
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:52,960


524
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:52,960


525
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,580
is my favorite song to ŷ

526
00:28:59,580 --> 00:28:59,580


527
00:28:59,580 --> 00:28:59,760
or my favorite to be a doctor,

528
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,940
puff me up somewhere.

529
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,300
Haha, your dad is right.

530
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:01,820
If you need me,

531
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,020
I'm always happy to help.

532
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,020


533
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,440
is such a great finan João.

534
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,800
Your dad has a family,

535
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,840
It's gonna be a bad day, get it?

536
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:05,940
YAAAAAAAAY!

537
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,920
Anybody not wearing a toon bling in your tongue lock

538
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,220
It's gonna be a bad day, get it?

539
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,820
Come with me if you want to live

540
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,620
This is Tactically Dangerous

541
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,000
BRAIN BALL

542
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,300
This is Tactically Dangerous

543
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,640

BRAIN BALL

546
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,680
This is Tactically Dangerous

547
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,120
Come with me if you want to live

548
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,960
Tano?

549
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,380
How do you feel we're not in Kansas?

550
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,700
Roger that

551
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,480
This absolutely will not stop

552
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Ever

553
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,900
Until you are dead

554
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,320
Until you are dead

555
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,660
Until you are dead

556
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,720
It's in your nature to destroy yourselves

557
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,480
It's in your nature to destroy yourselves

558
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,100
It's in your nature to destroy yourselves

559
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,980
Come with me if you want to live

560
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,060
YAAAAAAAAY!

561
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,600
This is Tactically Dangerous

562
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:54,600


563
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:54,820
This is Tactically Dangerous

564
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,220
BRAIN BALL

565
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,680
This is Tactically Dangerous

566
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:11,680


567
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:11,680


568
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:11,680


569
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,800
This is Tactically Dangerous

570
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,120
BRAIN BALL

571
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,700
This is Tactically Dangerous

572
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,060
BRAIN BALL

573
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,520
This is Tactically Dangerous

574
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,560
Friends, brothers and sisters, I'm here to tell you about one of the greatest...

575
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,360
Perhaps the greatest Frenatic of all time

576
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,820
His name, my friends, is Jack T. Chick

577
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,340
Now I know what you're thinking

578
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,380
You're thinking, oh well Jack T. Chick

579
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,760
We're not interested in him, he's some sort of Christian

580
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,100
We don't need some sort of fundamentalist Christian

581
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,480
Well friends, blasphemy!

582
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,120
Do we care whether or not he worships

583
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,140
Oh Jehovah 1, Jehovah 2, space aliens, or Jesus fucking Christ?

584
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:50,880
Hell no!

585
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,280
What we care about is he's a true believer!

586
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,100
That's right!

587
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,420
And that my friends is what we need in this here church

588
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,060
True believers! Woo!

589
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,840
And that my friends are willing to die for the cause!

590
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,640
Praise God!

591
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,860
Now friends, I am holding in my formerly, oh, sinful hands

592
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:13,500
A very copy of a Jack T. Chick track called Love the Jewish People

593
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,600
Now what is so unusual about this track

594
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,400
Love the Jewish People?

595
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,640
Is that it's in Hebrew!

596
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:19,980
Hebrew!

597
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:26,680
Now, excuse me, but if you're Jewish don't you already love the Jewish people?

598
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,800
I mean what kind of fanatic needs to know that?

599
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,400
He needs to write Love the Jewish People in Jewish that no one else can read!

600
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,500
This my friends is a true believer!

601
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,060
Someone who even wants to convert Jews to Judaism!

602
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,800
Jack T. Chick is a God amongst gods!

603
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,720
He may be misguided, but he has the fever my friends!

604
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,300
The fever of love of what he believes in!

605
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,620
And that's what we need in!

606
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,120
We need fanatics that are willing to die for Bob!

607
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,260
Fanatics that are willing to spend 40 of their years

608
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,660
Cranking out these pathetic,

609
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,060
little cartoon tracks!

610
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,520
You know how much they sell for?

611
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,300
13 cents!

612
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,060
He's the greatest underground artist of all time!

613
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,760
Is it because his art is great?

614
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,780
No my friends!

615
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,520
It's because his art is cheap!

616
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,160
13 cents!

617
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,580
450 million of these things have circled the planet!

618
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,200
You can just look at the back of the internet

619
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,560
and even has a picture of a globe being surrounded by Jack T. Chicks!

620
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,140
That's exactly what's happening!

621
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,760
Why we sit here and lollygag

622
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,700
and say, oh we'd like to be an artist

623
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,040
for something like Marvel!

624
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,300
Or maybe DC!

625
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,000
Or maybe have some great movie done about it!

626
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,060
He's sitting there doing little Xerox comics!

627
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,520
And converting the millions of people!

628
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,140
Over 90 languages!

629
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,620
Including Hebrew!

630
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,260
My friends! Hebrew love the Jewish people!

631
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
I mean that just says it all!

632
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,220
Doesn't it my friends?

633
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,700
Now folks, some of y'all probably think

634
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,540
You know, you gotta have the style!

635
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,720
We wanna be superstars!

636
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,240
A lot of you think perhaps

637
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,000
the greatest subgeniuses are the famous ones!

638
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:00,940
Well friends,

639
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,060
I think the ones that are gonna be first

640
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,940
on the saucers are the ones who have the greatest beliefs!

641
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,980
And that includes some of the greatest outcasts!

642
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,400
The ones you won't even recognize!

643
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,680
I'm talking about Shock Treatment!

644
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,160
Why Shock Treatment?

645
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,880
Is he some famous subgenius?

646
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,480
He just gave me cocoa!

647
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,200
He did one thing that no other subgenius did my friends!

648
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,200
He gave me cocoa!

649
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,540
He quit his job on X-Day!

650
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,480
He sold all his goods!

651
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,220
He re-sold all his goods!

652
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,060
I really didn't think there was gonna be anything after X-Day!

653
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,140
Now again,

654
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,060
some of you may think this is kinda stupid!

655
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,920
Hey, it's just a big joke!

656
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,740
Ha ha ha!

657
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,520
But what if you were wrong my friends?

658
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,180
What if you were wrong?

659
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,040
Then, Shock Treatment would be the only one on them saucers!

660
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,980
And that is the blind faith

661
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,380
that Jack T. Chick

662
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,720
presents in his tracks!

663
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,600
That is the blind faith

664
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,800
that we need for Bob!

665
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,820
And come on this X-Day

666
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,220
I'm talking about not July 6th!

667
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,300
On Sunday!

668
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,740
What kind of church in the subgenius sits here

669
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,020
and moves the day of rapture around

670
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,960
so that it's convenient

671
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,420
for the business community?

672
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,360
I'm talking about July 5th!

673
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,300
God damn it!

674
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,400
1998!

675
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,420
I don't want to hear any of this

676
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,700
well that's already come and gone.

677
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,740
No! If it ain't happened yet,

678
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,240
it means 1998 ain't happened yet!

679
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,960
Because Bob said it and I believe it

680
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,160
and that settles it Bob!

681
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,820
Damn it!

682
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,980
So I'm going to see you guys on July 5th, 1998

683
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,940
at 7am with your Chick tracks

684
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,060
Shock Treatment

685
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,160
and we're going to praise Bob!

686
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:32,740
Amen!

687
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,780
Praise Bob!

688
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,040
Praise Bob!

689
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,360
Thank you all!

690
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
The masses are thrilled!

691
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,560
Friends!

692
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,160
Because we are fanatics

693
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,840
and I don't mean

694
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,960
I mean us!

695
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,660
Look!

696
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,540
We are fanatics!

697
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,100
We are the only true believers!

698
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,100
Like you said,

699
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,580
preach ain't nobody there!

700
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,300
Well I'm going to tell you,

701
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,400
the only one who preaches to a crowd

702
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,300
are Bobbies!

703
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,400
The only true, strong, hardcore preachers

704
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
preach to no one!

705
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,280
They preach in their closets

706
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,500
and they preach in their rooms!

707
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,180
His eyes watch the man behind you!

708
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,000
So friends, us,

709
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,400
we are the proud

710
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,360
and the few, the ranters!

711
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:22,220
We are the proud!

712
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,880
The blackness

713
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,560
comes far

714
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,560
and stares

715
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,140
straight into my face!

716
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,860
straight into my face!

717
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,820
straight into my face!

718
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,420
It smothers me

719
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,040
It smothers me

720
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,280
with ugliness!

721
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,160
It blinds

722
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,320
my hope!

723
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,480
My hope!

724
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:07,480


725
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:15,260
And then it goes away

726
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,920
And then it goes away

727
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,400
And it's just another day

728
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:18,960
And it's just another day

729
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,120
And I smile at everyone

730
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,140
But I don't care!

731
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,540
But I have little to say!

732
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:24,540


733
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,760
The blackness

734
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,060
The blackness

735
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,700
is powerful!

736
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,420
It cannot

737
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,020
be stopped

738
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,920
or slowed!

739
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:38,940


740
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,120
As the futility

741
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,960
becomes more and more

742
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,680
evident

743
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,540
My will

744
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,800
to resist

745
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,660
does erode!

746
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,100
As the futility becomes more and more evident

747
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,520
My will to resist does erode!

748
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,420
And no one seems to know

749
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,360
And no one seems to know

750
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:05,360


751
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,620
And I want to tell them all

752
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:08,980
And I want to tell them all

753
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,540
But I know I mustn't dare!

754
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:11,560
But I know I mustn't dare!

755
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,880
The blackness

756
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,160
The blackness

757
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,240
Is patient!

758
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,040
Is patient!

759
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,860
For now

760
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,220
It can be

761
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,600
My friend!

762
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,600
My friend!

763
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,740
It takes my

764
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,860
It takes my

765
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,240
Pristine illusions

766
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:35,420
Pristine illusions

767
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,980
Leave them tarnished

768
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,700
Stale!

769
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,220
And dull!

770
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,680
And dull!

771
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,100
And dull!

772
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,100


773
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,760
And mid-coffee break at ten

774
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,540
And the broncos

775
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,780
Fucked up again!

776
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,940
Elwes Gardell the magic's no more

777
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,540
And it's really

778
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,200
all such a bore!

779
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,440
All such a bore!

780
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,520
The blackness

781
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,580
The blackness

782
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,600
Is honest!

783
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,520
And it sure

784
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,340
Is a stare!

785
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,740
It takes my

786
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,660
It takes my

787
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:21,700
It takes my

788
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,820
It takes my

789
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,560
Pristine illusions

790
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,040
Pristine illusions

791
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,060
Leave them tarnished

792
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,820
Stale!

793
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,200
And dull!

794
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,000
I know the arguments are good in law

795
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,220
Showing how all that I do is wrong

796
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:41,500
Showing how all that I do is wrong

797
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,660
I want to strip them out of my mind

798
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,220
I want to strip them out of my mind

799
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,400
For I know what I will find

800
00:39:47,400 --> 00:40:03,780
For I know what I will find

801
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,960
If Ibook me

802
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:27,940
Imma find

803
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,680
The blackness

804
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,680
The blackness

805
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,500
takes programs

806
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,820
The blackness

807
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,300
And embeds

808
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:37,860
And embeds itself deep

809
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,660
in my soul

810
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:54,960
There's nothing left for me to do Except acknowledge complete control

811
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:06,000
And the hospital bed is flat And I see the world from my back

812
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,120
And I smile and everyone can laugh And I finally can laugh

813
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,420
And I smile and everyone can laugh And I finally can laugh

814
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:57,420


815
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:03,980
And so we gather here late, the late hours of the night.

816
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,360
A late watch.

817
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:13,560
A vigil, shall we say, to bring in the new year.

818
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:21,800
The poor pinks thought that their little Y2K bug in their year 2000 would bring some kind of great change.

819
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,540
Well, sure, there were a few divorces, praise Bob.

820
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,360
But then, on the other hand, there was the hope.

821
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:32,760
The hope of a true new beginning, friends.

822
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,980
Where we can throw out all the old things.

823
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,140
The old rules.

824
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,180
Yes, we can get on board them.

825
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,960
Hey, talk about anarchy.

826
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,920
Wait until they see what a dose of patriopsychotic and narco-materialism at work can do

827
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,160
for a person given control over the powers of the gods and their own planet.

828
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,500
Ah, yes.

829
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,180
Sure, we grew up with the rules of their government.

830
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,720
The rules of their church.

831
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,700
The rules of their...

832
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,080
Polite society.

833
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,260
And the rules of their so-called coolness.

834
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:15,360
Well, friends, we now have the opportunity to create a whole new world.

835
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,380
A new type of government.

836
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,400
The kind of government Bob would provide.

837
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,800
And you know, you can be alone with Bob.

838
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,220
He ain't gonna tell you what to do.

839
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,740
And we can have a new church.

840
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,140
The kind of church Bob would have.

841
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,080
Where you can sleep in on Sunday.

842
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:29,800
Praise Bob.

843
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,200
And we'll have a new kind of shopping malls where stealing is legal.

844
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:39,340
And we'll have a new kind of coolness where the geeks decide who's cool.

845
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:49,380
And the normals are the ones who are put out on the ice floes and sent out into the woods to fend for themselves.

846
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,040
Praise Bob.

847
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:54,620
Or put in the nice evangelical love camps where they can be reeducated.

848
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,600
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

849
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,340
I feel like something good's gonna happen.

850
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,620
Might be tomorrow morning at 7 a.m.

851
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,820
Might be Wednesday morning at 7 a.m.

852
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,680
It might be!

853
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,040
It might come as a thief in the night!

854
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,460
So you better be ready.

855
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,140
You better have that membership card in your pocket.

856
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:15,560
And every second, even when you take a shower, if you're the kind of subgenius who takes showers.

857
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:23,560
And friends, when we took a D-Bible tour to Amsterdam, Holland.

858
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,840
And we learned a lot there.

859
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:33,660
We learned about, and we were reminded about the way this country used to be before they regulated every single thing you did.

860
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,440
Before they gave your dog a ticket for taking a shit on the sidewalk.

861
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,280
But one of the great things about our trip to Amsterdam is we met a great subgenius.

862
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,780
A Dutch subgenius by the name of Jeroen van Bram.

863
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,880
Jeroen van Bram, the Dutch subgenius.

864
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:56,260
He had been in a coma for two years when he was 18 years old.

865
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,400
So he had seen Bob during that time.

866
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,200
He already knew about Bob.

867
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,220
We didn't have to tell him.

868
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,880
And he lived on the street.

869
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,700
And basically was a bum.

870
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,160
Had a fair amount of slack.

871
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,280
But he had a great philosophy.

872
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,460
And a louder voice than me.

873
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,140
He was the loudest son of a bitch I ever met.

874
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:20,520
And Jeroen van Bram, as he walked down the streets of Holland.

875
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,680
Getting money for more froth from the tourists.

876
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,660
He yelled at us and he said,

877
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:32,200
You know my friend, while you're alive, you gotta shout and make a lot of noise.

878
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:37,280
Cause when you die, you shut up like hell.

879
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,680
Cause when you die, you shut up like hell, friends.

880
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,700
And so friends, that's why we are...

881
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,340
It's the old thing.

882
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,320
It's like, well so, the world might not...

883
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,040
You know what it doesn't say in that first pamphlet?

884
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,320
The very first top of the page.

885
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,740
It doesn't say the world ends July 5th, 1998, 99 or 2000.

886
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,980
It says the world ends tomorrow.

887
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,220
Tomorrow, my friends.

888
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,620
And you may die.

889
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,220
You will in fact die.

890
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,260
You can believe that prediction by J.R. Bob Dogg.

891
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,580
You will die.

892
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,500
And what you don't know is when.

893
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,520
It's not a matter of if.

894
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,880
If you've got your subgenius membership card in your pocket, then why.

895
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,960
If, hey man, if I don't live forever, I get my money back.

896
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,540
But, it could come at any time.

897
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,960
And a lot of what this show is about, is not about money.

898
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,280
It's about what your church is really all about.

899
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,240
It's what you're doing with your precious time.

900
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,500
What is slack, friends?

901
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,240
Is slack more toys?

902
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,600
Well, you know it's not that.

903
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,700
Is slack more money?

904
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:44,840
Well, it might be.

905
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,700
But what slack really is, is more time.

906
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,340
More time to do what the fuck you want.

907
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,540
And not to have to be doing what they want.

908
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,140
That's what this is about.

909
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,080
And we cannot tell you how to spend your time.

910
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,540
We can only tell you that you have to spend it wisely.

911
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,520
And for a subgenius, that's kind of a trick.

912
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:27,320
Now somewhere among our crowd here, I imagine there must be the cop or the detective or the agent, federal agent of some kind, who is assigned to study us and, you know, make sure they know what's going on with the church of the subgenius.

913
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:34,220
And friends, I want to speak to that poor detective, that poor federal agent tonight.

914
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,460
Because by now, he's got to be drunk as hell.

915
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,520
And bitter.

916
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,580
Bitter because he's saying to himself,

917
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,660
They're right!

918
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,080
My God, they're right!

919
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,980
The conspiracy assigned me to cover these subgeniuses.

920
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,280
And here I am agreeing with them.

921
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,560
There is a conspiracy and I'm part of it.

922
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,220
But I'm not.

923
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,300
I'm not.

924
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:57,700
But friends,

925
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:08,620
You know, and we, the great thing is we, Bob Dobbs and the church's subgenius, ain't gonna tell you what the best way is to fight the conspiracy.

926
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,300
We'll only tell you that you must do it!

927
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,360
We don't know who you are or what you're best at.

928
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,340
You have to decide that for yourself.

929
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,220
Unlike most of those other churches, we only have one rule.

930
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,960
And I think you know what that rule is, friends.

931
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,160
It is, fuck them!

932
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,540
If they can't take a joke!

933
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,220
That is all that matters in this church, my friends.

934
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,760
That is truly a livable philosophy.

935
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,320
I am the one!

936
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,880
I am the one!

937
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,180
I am the one!

938
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,980
I am the one!

939
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:46,620
Come on, you may die!

940
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,580
Come on, you may die!

941
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,420
Come on, you may die!

942
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,540
You may die!

943
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,620
Praise Bob!

944
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,940
You may die!

945
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,900
Praise Bob!

946
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,660
You may die!

947
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,880
Praise Bob!

948
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,840
You may die!

949
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,620
Praise Bob!

950
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,480
You may die!

951
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,040
You have to escape the other world, don't you?

952
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,520
Or will you live your own lives?

953
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:29,640
Praise Bob!

954
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,100
Yo! Yeah!

955
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,500
I know what time it is!

956
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,760
Yes, uh...

957
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,380
Credit's time, dear friends.

958
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:48,660
Well, I'll tell ya, editing my first hour of slack on my computer has been...

959
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,440
different.

960
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,900
And I'm sure I'll get smoother at it.

961
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:58,680
And we've just barely scratched the surface of the wonderful recordings from the XXX Day Festival

962
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:04,140
and CDs handed to me, such as this background music by MC Kev Rock.

963
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:11,540
And anyway, the last music, the big piece of music we've heard and been hearing throughout

964
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:18,820
is called Slogans Run by Saint N and Mini True of Pittsburgh.

965
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:26,120
Near the beginning, we heard a great rant by Hell Pope Huey and my opening ceremonies rants

966
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,720
and also some ranted by me with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

967
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,980
We heard the great Saint Byron Werner ranting on stress.

968
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:39,060
And we heard ESO, Einstein's Secret Orchestra, doing Father of Night.

969
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,580
Jesus Christ, the devil aqua, spoke on the new Bob Order icon.

970
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,200
We heard another big long song with the Terminator line.

971
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,380
And we heard the X-Day by Saint N.

972
00:50:51,620 --> 00:51:00,280
And Papa Joe Mama ranting on Jack Trick, Chick, Chick's Dig Chick tracks.

973
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:05,060
Followed by The Blackness by Little Theodore.

974
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:12,800
And some of my very last ranting at 11.30 p.m. July 4th, 2000 on Or Kill Me Radio.

975
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,800
Praise Bob, Or Kill Me.

976
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,820
And now, friends.

977
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,380
If you...

978
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,920
need more information about the Church of the Subgenius,

979
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,920
please write to this address I'm about to give.

980
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:27,860
That's...

981
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:38,920
Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

982
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:46,240
Once again, that's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

983
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,420
www.subgenius.com.

984
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,780
And praise the...

985
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,420
I feel like sometimes I'm sharing...

986
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,500
I feel like I'm sharing the studio sometimes with Barry White.

987
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,480
That's Chaz.

988
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,640
Hey, baby, I'm right on the microphone.

989
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,580
Check this Barry voice out.

990
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,360
Donovan's out there.

991
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,240
I know you listen to him.

992
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:25,040
I'm sorry if I happen to use the tried and true tools of the preacher in my daily walk.

993
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,340
It is your tried and true tool.

994
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,400
You must...

995
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,820
You have to kind of pull the whole thing together.

996
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,440
It's a leathery old beat-up, flapping thing.

997
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,300
But the tongue of the preacher is his most important tool.

998
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:35,440
Or hers.

999
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:38,580
We wouldn't want to pull the hood back to see what you're making of it right now.

1000
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,060
We don't make a big deal about making a pope out of a woman.

1001
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,500
We don't either.

1002
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,400
Or a woman pope-ess out of a man.

1003
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,480
We'll go either way.

1004
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:47,900
That's been done.

1005
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,140
Baby, we're swingers.

1006
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,400
Well, not everybody.

1007
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,440
I mean, I...

1008
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,520
But, you know...

1009
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,380
Hell, anything goes.

1010
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,460
As long as Bob don't mind.

1011
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:00,080
As long as we hear Bob complain about your behavior, you're out of the church.

1012
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,620
He cares not for your behavior.

1013
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,520
Bob only cares about your 30 bucks and your slackulent behaviors.

1014
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,140
And if you're willing to perform oral sex on any one of himself,

1015
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:13,140
you know, the written or unwritten denigents that emanate from his first body,

1016
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:17,040
he'll just let you do anything you want to as long as there is anything you do.

1017
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:18,820
I mean...

1018
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,720
In fact, Reverend Evangela won that very contest at Triplex.

1019
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,820
See, but I don't know why you guys always make everything contest.

1020
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,340
You know, I mean, Christianity is...

1021
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,280
Oh, just for fun.

1022
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:28,960
Bad enough, you know.

1023
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,720
Yeah, because it's too sloppy.

1024
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,380
It gives it a sense of meaning where there is none.

1025
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:34,700
A drama.

1026
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,260
That's all people want out of life.

1027
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,100
See, you can preach now.

1028
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,960
Here comes some preacher music now.

1029
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,140
I want you to put your hand on the radio, sister.

1030
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:47,680
Okay.

1031
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:49,580
Lean on in.

1032
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:53,960
I want you to take the tenderest, sweetest part of your body

1033
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:59,200
and put it closest to the vibrating part of the radio membrane.

1034
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,100
And if your body's feeling bad

1035
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,500
And it's the only one you have

1036
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,800
You wanna take the wind away

1037
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,220
Go on walking in the rain

1038
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,520
Watch the flowers go to bed

1039
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,800
Ask the man inside your mind

1040
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,320
You'll never have to leave

1041
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,560
All you gotta do believe

1042
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,460
Praise Bob!

1043
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,600
You can't, you can't find relief, my friend.

1044
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,920
You can find real satisfaction.

1045
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:46,180
And I don't mean just your money back on the day you die, friend.

1046
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,980
You can get it all.

1047
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,220
Everything you can have.

1048
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,020
That cake and eat it too.

1049
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,180
Go on.

1050
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,120
Take it all away.

1051
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,160
Some have alluded to some form of mana.

1052
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,600
Some mystical pie in the sky.

1053
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,220
I say revolution is the only way out of this mess.

1054
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,480
God will not come to our aid.

1055
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,780
He assists no one.

1056
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,360
He cares not for you.

1057
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,660
Get yourselves together.

1058
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,200
Everlasting sweet desire.

1059
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,380
It no matter what the doctor says.

1060
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:18,260
It no matter what the doctor says.

1061
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:20,480
He will not leave me still.

1062
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,580
I'll wait.

1063
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,400
Immortality for two.

1064
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,820
Miracles they come for you.

1065
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:34,260
God loves you but Bob wants you.

1066
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,640
I hear the sea does.

1067
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,240
Then the dumpster behind you.

1068
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:48,240


1069
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,760
Behind the lock there.

1070
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,920
They must have found something they really like.

1071
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,280
I can hear the screeching going louder.

1072
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,680
I can hear the squawking.

1073
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,480
What's that?

1074
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,940
It sounds like a siren in the distance.

1075
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,820
I hope they don't find it there.

1076
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,820
If they find it here, they're not really going to find it.

1077
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,620
Anyway.

1078
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,720
Faith and hope and charity.

1079
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,700
Simple relativity.

1080
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,660
He can make you understand.

1081
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,100
All you gotta do is take his hand.

1082
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,540
Remember what someone says.

1083
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,840
Ask him inside ahead.

1084
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,980
Finger drifts and hold him tight.

1085
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,540
So inviting.

1086
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,300
Welcome inside.

1087
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,460
We've been waiting for you.

1088
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,080
Bye.

1089
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,760
Oh, then Connie, welcome you into their home, dear friend.

1090
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,660
Yes, room to play for everyone.

1091
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,900
There's so many things to do.

1092
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,720
There's one here, one there.

1093
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,960
Here's this way, the new way to enjoy.

1094
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,520
Can I put my hands on you?

1095
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,680
Can I put my hands on you?

1096
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:11,200
Yeah.

1097
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,400
Oh, I want to grab you real tight.

1098
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,060
And pull.

1099
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,400
Oh, you like what I do, do you?

1100
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,340
Don't do that.

1101
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,600
Don't tell me that.

1102
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,140
You like what I do, do you?

1103
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,060
I know you do.

1104
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:25,520
No.

1105
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,080
He's going to punish you.

1106
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,680
God hates folks who are fat.

1107
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,420
God hates folks who are small.

1108
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,120
God hates.

1109
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:32,920
God hates.

1110
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,000
God hates.

1111
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,080
Where's God's way?

1112
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,720
Oh, where's God's way?

1113
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,960
Can I put my hands on you?

1114
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:43,440
Can I put my hands on you?

1115
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:46,800
Can I put my hands on you?

1116
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,220
Can I put my hands on you?

1117
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,160
Can I put my hands on you?

1118
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,960
Can I put my hands on you?

1119
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,100
Can I put my hands on you?

1120
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:53,100


1121
00:57:53,240 --> 00:58:00,920
Hoping that some of you out there will actually reach through the membrane into this, other

1122
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,480
things, and establish yourself with me.

1123
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,360
First take the vinegar.

1124
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,640
That's right.

1125
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,240
Plain white vinegar will do.

1126
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,780
Then take the baking soda.

1127
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,380
The small wine.

1128
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,160
That's right.

1129
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,340
We'll go to the little bottle right here.

1130
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,200
Now, take the little bottle right here.

1131
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:24,140
Put a membrane, much like the membrane we discussed, between the vinegar and the baking soda.

1132
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:30,760
Now take the bottle and crack firmly on the cranium three times like so.

1133
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,940
Can I put my hands on you?

1134
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,280
Can I put my hands on you?

1135
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,780
Can I put my hands on you?

1136
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:45,140
Can I put my hands on you?

1137
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,820
Well, I can't feel my legs.

1138
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,880
Wait, my legs gone. I can't feel my legs.

1139
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,820
Well, we gotta get out of here.

1140
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,440
There's always tomorrow.

1141
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,860
Somos en Chiapas por el mil y es de la mes.

1142
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:15,180
Y mañana nos vamos a acompañar por las montañas.

1143
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,280
I ain't gonna go home.

1144
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,180
I'm gonna sit here.

1145
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:24,140
I'm gonna sit in there and dub them X-Day recording sofas from the D.A. to the CD.

1146
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,780
For hours and hours.

1147
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:33,260
So I can put them hours of slack together in them CDs.

1148
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:38,380
Well, I'm just gonna put those photons between me and the next erection.

1149
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:44,180
I'm gonna go down to the nuclear accelerator and see if I can snort up a few atomic particles.

1150
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:46,440
I think I might join ya.

1151
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,980
I guess we ain't going to sleep.

1152
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:48,440
Then.

1153
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,320
No, no.

1154
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,680
We're not going to be getting much sleep, are we?

1155
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:55,660
Keep snorting those till next week.

1156
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:56,860
Subatomic.

1157
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:57,900
Stay awake.

1158
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,060
Bring in the money.

1159
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,440
Cast out the conspiracy.

1160
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,780
Pretend the rainbow has an end

1161
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:12,360
And you'll be there, my friend, someday

1162
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,740
There's always tomorrow

1163
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,720
For dreams to come true

1164
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:28,860
Tomorrow is not far away

1165
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,080
Oh

1166
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:32,760
Oh

1167
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,680
Oh

1168
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,740
Oh

1169
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,020
Oh

1170
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:39,540
Oh

1171
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,940
Oh

1172
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:40,960
Oh

1173
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:40,960


1174
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:40,960


1175
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:40,960


1176
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:40,960


1177
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:40,960


1178
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:40,960


1179
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:40,960


1180
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:40,980
Oh

1181
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:40,980


1182
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:40,980


1183
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,080
Oh
