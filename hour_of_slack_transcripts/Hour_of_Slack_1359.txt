What's the name of this place?
The Self Genius.
Watch now.
I have absolutely heard of that place.
Sounds like a school for Neanderthals.
No, it's actually considered the Harvard of kindergartens.
I wish it would work.
Oh dear.
I'm watching woodwork.
How are you doing?
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
The earth tremors are strong here,
and the building seems to be settling.
That crashing and vibrating you here
is a result of nature's transient phenomena.
Thanks for your help.
Yes.
So don't worry.
We're all perfectly safe in that grotesque grinding
is simply an epiphenomenon,
a byproduct, if you will,
of the...
the speed and celerity of industry.
Ivan Stang is taking a break
in the excrementation chamber,
and we're taking it easy here,
as only a subgenius can do.
I heard he was pyroflagellating in that chamber.
He's welcome to be as creative as he wants,
because that's what it's all about,
the search for slack.
He asked me for some wooden matches.
And wouldn't you know it,
you had them.
He could pyroflagellate so much better.
Leaving me with a bag of shit to hold.
Maybe you should think harder
about trafficking in fucking junk.
I'm a purveyor of spirits,
I dope fucking included,
and when chance affords, a thief.
But I ain't no fucking hypocrite.
There is a light off on the board
for microphone number two.
So after all that disruption and fussing,
we still don't have three mics.
No, there's one explanation.
And what might that be?
If a menstruating woman enters the radio studio,
one of the mics will break.
Well, and that happened sometime
while my back was turned.
Now, we don't want to have to kick you out of the sweat lodge.
Don't look at me, she says.
Well, we could put her on the ducking stool
and see whether or not she loves God.
No, this one is not working.
It's that one you're hearing me through, huh?
I believe so, because there is another thing
that they were completely talking about.
And that was that the mixing board is stuck
and some things won't turn on,
like the submixer, which doubles as microphone number three.
The instructions at my radio station
and the other one that you guys go to sometimes
say not to whine about the equipment.
I know, I don't like to do it.
You're breaking the rules of many professional radio stations.
I realize that.
I'm not the one who wants to talk about it.
I'm not the one who wants to talk about it.
I'm not attempting to dismiss this subject.
But I have to say that...
I'm enjoying it because I'm forbidden to most of the time.
You can do whatever you want.
We're back to the way it was.
It's going to have to be that way.
That is the truth that we have to live with.
I just want to cry like a little baby.
I will bend like a reed in the wind.
Maintain your flexibility.
That's what comes my way.
I will play my flute.
I will prefer some things above others to come my way.
My flute of tranquility.
Tranquility.
That's not one of the things I was hoping for.
What, that flute?
Philo's flute of tranquility.
I will play my skin flute of tranquility.
Yes, it's tranquility for you.
A grown man.
Terrible embarrassment for witnesses.
Truly.
These witnesses may have something to say.
I saw a beaver today at this...
What was the name of that...
Well, we probably shouldn't plug a restaurant,
but it was up in that town.
We can do anything we want.
This is pirate radio.
Yeah, we can do what rules, man.
There's no rules.
It was Creek Monkey Cafe.
Yeah, Creek Monkey.
And they really did have...
They were on the edge of a creek,
and there were beaver dams.
They had their own beers there.
They have beaver dams outside the restaurant.
You can step out on the back porch.
Watch the beavers frolicking and killing and maiming.
They don't do that.
No, they just frolic.
You're just exaggerating.
They busily carve up the neighbor's trees
and make their little huts and dams.
Now, it's true.
They may have...
They may have to fell a forest giant
in order to make one of their artfully constructed dams.
Sometimes they have to undercut a, you know,
a restaurant's foundation so that it falls into the river.
You know, I just finished publicly whining
about Robert Anton Wilson being resistant to miking.
I'm not resistant.
I just didn't want to...
And that was...
My peas.
And that was part of a...
Huh?
Eh?
What?
The...
We are, of course, once again,
making a delightful smorgasbord of sound effects
for your pleasure back home.
Ah, yes.
But we generally don't try to strike the microphone stand
or move it or make loud sounds
that are conducted into the microphone.
It was a necessary sound effect, Dr. Halpern.
I know it is.
And I...
Philo's disobeying me.
I just want our...
And his contrariness.
Our listening audience...
But look, it's almost touching, Dr. Hal.
...to appreciate how wonderful it is.
And believe me, we have this incredible, technical...
It's pointed.
...complicated matter under...
It's pointed strategically at Dr. Hal.
Just look at this giant board with its blinking lights
and flashing switches.
It looks like a Christmas tree.
We are totally mastering this intensely complex scientific equipment.
Yes.
That tree's lit up like a Christmas board.
Board and man are one.
How effortlessly we pilot the ship of radio,
all kidding around and making goofy sound effects aside.
Because what we have here assembled are masters of radio
who have been doing it for years and years
and actually laugh to scorn all foolish amateurism of the airwaves.
Gentlemen...
That's so true.
...to your health.
So true, Dr. Hal.
Thank you, thank you.
We're between Los Cruces and Deming
and we're heading for a place called City of Rocks.
And this is...
This is the Chihuahuan Desert.
We'll soon be approaching the Sonoran Desert.
But this is the Chihuahuan Desert.
And it's so named because behind every single one of those bushes
and yucca scrub things out there and tumbleweeds,
there lurks a Chihuahua.
Now you told me it was because of the...
because there were Chihuahua-sized tarantulas in there.
No, there's also Chihuahua-sized tarantulas.
Otherwise, this whole country would be overrun with Chihuahuas.
And these are not the kind of Chihuahuas that you make into pets.
They're bloodthirsty, nipping Chihuahuas
that jump up onto your face and nip your eyes out.
And then they...
When you're blind and helpless, then they go for your throat.
Oh!
And they make you bleed to death.
They nip your artery, your throat arteries,
as you try to get them off.
But, you know, two or three of them will jump on you at once.
And then you, you know, you bleed to death real quick.
And then they...
All the Chihuahuas come and fight over your parts.
They like the soft parts best.
And they're real fast at pulling things like blue jeans and coats off of people.
You know how Chihuahuas are.
They're really mean and fast.
Yeah.
If there's a gas station up there, we ought to stop.
We must stop.
Because out in the Chihuahuan desert,
you don't want to end up stranded by the side of the road
because that's just what the Chihuahuas are waiting for.
They're small, but they're really, really mean.
It's also known as phylo-leg-breaking land.
Yeah, it's definitely...
Well, not leg-breaking.
No, that was mortarian.
ACL-terrifying.
Mortisorexit.
Mortier.
Ripped his ACL.
Oratule tissue.
Legs got aces.
Popped his leg back in a direction it wasn't supposed to go in.
And that's the place for it, folks.
I just spent...
Oh, in fact, here I...
I just spent some more time in a similar place.
But you know what?
The rocks were not as hairy, you know, with little rock salts that grip your flesh wide open.
The rock salt?
The rock that wants you to spray your ankle wasn't there?
Yeah, it didn't grip like that.
It's much more extruded.
And we were near a thing called Hercules.
Hercules' finger.
I don't find that for a thing.
Hercules...
Oh, you'll see.
They have Hercules' finger?
Not to be confused with the devil's finger.
No.
Or Thor's hammer.
Or Thor's hammer.
Satan's toe bone.
Hercules, that doesn't look like his finger.
National Monument.
No offense, but that...
Yeah, it is not his...
That don't look like no finger to me.
It's not his finger that comes to mind.
That's not...
Well, City of Rocks looks a lot...
But who's gonna give anyone...
In near-demming New Mexico, looks a lot like that.
It's a series of gigantic phallic symbols.
I just don't understand.
This is like Godzilla's weenie.
Yep.
What?
That's not a dog sleeping in a rock.
I'm gonna have to take a short break here.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
A kind of a dachshund because the weening...
This is the best part of the show.
These dogs take quite a long time.
When Phyla takes a break for a few minutes.
And that is why the dachshund is known as a long weener.
What?
Never mind.
I retract.
I take it back.
He's talking about...
Nope.
First off, the ankle-spraining rock.
The rock is a rock.

The rock is a rock.

The rock is a rock.




It can be invisible.
Sometimes it's like...
It was right along there hiding, trying to catch me.
Anyway, this is the City of Rocks near Demet, New Mexico.
It's this very, very strange area made of volcanic tuff.
Remember volcanic tuff?
About 35 million years ago, a volcano exploded here and pumice rained down all over the place.
And then more crap came down.

And then more crap came out and spewed all over that.
And the pumice was compressed and became tuff.
T-U-F.
Tuff.
Tuff.
That...
It's soft.
It then cracked as it cooled.
And those cracks in the tuff were enough to allow rainwater, wind, and God only knows
what else, to slowly separate parts of it into, you know, a...
A...
A deeper and deeper little areas.
And wind and rain erosion turned it into this amazing situation we have here.
Somebody is definitely fucking with us.
How'd that rock get up there?
Some of this tuff is pretty tough here on the trail.
We're pretty sure we're on the trail this time.
I think anything can be the trail though.
And around each bend, there lies...
Slack.
Uh, Slack in the case of this particular bend being a piece of music we're about to share.
Sorry we neglected to actually describe the city of rocks in all those location recordings
and Ask Dr. Howland Puzzling Evidence shows.
That'll be coming up after a review.
And we'll be back with a refreshing change of noise.
Although we did indeed, as promised, get our photos heavily edited and online.
And the easiest way for me to tell you how to see them is to go to subgenius.com, click
on News, and then go to my blog, Reverend Ivan Stang.
Also, the events page has a link under the X Day promos.
Meanwhile, Reverend Tater turned us on to this upcoming piece of music by the name of
Carlos Serafina from the Detovelvulation Project called 13 Miles, which Tater calls,

You don't know where
I'm going to hide your balls.
But the music will tell you.
Now, first of all,
shut your eyes while I hide them.
Yes. Shut your eyes.
Now,
open your eyes
and dance
lightly about looking everywhere
for your balls.
And now the music's going to tell you where your balls are.
They may be high up so that you have to stretch and jump up for them,
or they may be low down so that you have to pick them up off the floor.
Listen.
Well, were your balls high up or low down?
They were high up, and I hope you've all jumped up and got them.
Now, dance around and toss them in the air
and play with them.
Play with them.
Now I'm going to hide the balls again.
Shut your eyes.
Now open them
and run lightly around
and throw them in the air.

Looking everywhere for your balls.
And now you're going to find them,
and the music will tell you where your balls are.
Listen.
Have you found them?
Where were they?
Yes, this time they were low down on the floor.
Now dance and play with them again.
Is she making fun of me?
Anyway, hide your balls from some unknown evil English lady.
Thanks to Reverend Greg Bishop for turning us on for the show.
And now Princess We Are Doe will attempt to explain her reaction to the next state park that we explored.
It's like everything around me is the coolest thing I've ever seen, and it's all free.
I can take anything I want and take it home with me.
Pieces of it.
I always wondered how at festivals people had these bowls of pretty rocks out, and you could get like a bag of it.




I'm not sure I've ever seen a bag for $5.
This is how.
They come out here, they find them, and then they put bowls out and you give them money for it.
Isn't it right?
Yeah.
It's true and right.
Well, they put them in little polishing machines that cost about $20.
Well, if these were just wet, all they have to be is wet to be shiny.
I know how to do that.
I can make them wet.
I'm just saying.
I don't want to do it on camera, though.
It's my favorite, and there are cacti, really sharp.
Oh, thank you for mentioning.
Cacti everywhere where you are.
I was about to walk over there with a little barrel of cacti.
Friends, we're in Rockhound State Park in New Mexico, and we're off trail, totally off trail, and it's really cool.
The place they don't tell you about.
When we pulled up, our hearts sank because it was pinks and RVs as far as the eye could see, and this very plain looking foot of a small mountain.
None.
Nonetheless, we took the little trail they showed on the map, and then we went.
I bet if we went over that bend, we'd have privacy.
Anyway, we found this really wonderful crag of cragness.
Big, weird looking rocks and cacti and twisted dead trees and our favorite sort of roadrunner coyote landscape.
Across with Flintstones.
Flintstones, Twilight Zone, and that Bryce program I used to play with.
Arnie Stocknesson made this trail.
He left little marks and cairns along the way, so you know you're not the first human who's ever been here, and that this is a way that someone has been able to come so far.
However, I don't see the next cairn.
You don't see the next cairn?
Or white spot painted on the rock.
They just left us here in the middle of...
No, no.
We left them.
Oh.
Remember, we wanted to get away from those pinks.
But look how much closer we are to the rock ridge.
It's marred by the presence of radio transmission towers and wireless transmitters and all that kind of crap.
Damn things are everywhere.
Someday, someday they won't be no use to nobody.
They'll just be rotting away up there.
Nobody to tune nothing in and nothing being broadcast because it'll all be fried.
Just fried.
Just like that.
When the change comes.
Next day.
The tribulations.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Anyway, listen to that bag of rocks.
You've heard the phrase, dumber than a box of rocks.
That's my bag of rocks.
We have a balance here.
Now, we're continuing on the trail.
Right.
Because we don't know what is ahead.
This is unmarked.
This is unexplored territory except by Arnie Sognasom, the great explorer.
The great explorer.
There could be acres more slack around the corner.
We're here for our slack at the Devil's Slack Altar.
Praise Bob.
From PR News in Washington, I'm accused by several women of sexual harassment.
A senior Chinese official has acknowledged the country is ill-prepared for polar bears.
I'm adding red cans to the mix.
Republican businessman Herman Cain is claimed he'd had an affair with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich for 13 years.
Cain made the announcement this afternoon in Atlanta where he was to open a national bombing in Baghdad this week.
I am suspending soul searching.
Newt Gingrich called Herman Cain a fass.
He said the two had had a private conversation to him.
A lot of people complained they didn't like the color and some thought Cain was different.
But it turned out he wasn't there at the time.

Thank you.
Thank you.
And you can count
pathetic posers and
shitwads.
Useless pee-mongers.
The great
unwashed.
Shall we say.
Metaphorically.
They might be better washed
than us.
But you know what I mean.
Princess, what did I forget to tell you
that there are 17 different types
of rattlesnakes that live out here.
No.
You've told me that I forget all the times
it scares me so much.
And although it's
January
they're probably not out
but you know it's been a warm
day today. They may not have curled
up in their hidey holes under
the rocks and under the
cacti yet.
Frisky little fellows
that they are.
Here's a green mark.
Ernie Sacknelson's
green mark.
That means beware of pinks.
It's an anti-color of pinks.
The negative of pinks.
A green mark.
That shows that now we must beware.
See look.
There's the trailer court.
Oh my god.
We're now inside of the pinks.
There's people.
Yeah.
People. Humans.
Humans.
Humans.
But soon we'll be in another place
where there are no humans.
We'll go to
Chikahawatalgataka
a national monument.
It will be free because it's national.
The state parks weren't free.
We thought they would be free because of
Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
Like the national parks.
But nay.
Nay.
Nay.
They wanted five bucks.
Which I'm happy to give them.
Because these are, you know, beautiful places.
And it costs to not let the conspiracy have them.
The sad thing is that the conspiracy surrounds them.
Real close.
There's houses within walking distance.
Actually there's a town surrounding the trailer court.
But up in these mountains there aren't many people.
Just a few rockhounds, subgeniuses, other antisocial people.
It reminds me of the Alabama Hills.
Yeah.
That's what we like.
It's things that look like the Alabama Hills.
Things that look like Bryce Canyon.
Things that look like the Devil's Waterhole.
The Devil's Hall.
The Devil's Staircase.
And Bob.
Bob's Frop Chamber.
Or Bob's Privacy Chamber.
Which happens to be this open crag made of crags.
Giant rocks and boulders that form sort of a reef of rock in the midst of the desert vegetation.
You know, you say desert and you think, oh, the White Sands National Monument.
Just sand.
And just a cactus every now and then.
And tiny little desert mouse tracks.
But what we're in is the Chihuahuan Desert or maybe the Sonoring Desert.
And it's green almost everywhere except where there's giant craggy rocks.
It's very green.
It's green with prickly pear and Indian tea.
Yuccas of many kinds.
And what was that bear plant?
Bear riping.
Bear claw.
Yeah, a seven-year bear claw plant.
Every seven years it uproots itself and comes shambling after you to get you.
Because the desert is full of hostile creatures.
Giant mutated tarantulas.
We're not that far from Los Alamos, you know.
All them things could be up here.
Yeah.
Damn it.
You're a rock kleptomaniac.
You're not a rock hound.
There's a difference, you know.
What do you mean?
One's a hobby, an avocation, perhaps even a profession.
Yours is a sickness, an obsession.
There is a difference.
No.
God.
We had to look around and go, where can we go?
Where are there no pinks?
Where would there be privacy?
And since they'd like to cluster together by definition, they tend to stay all in that
one safe area with the hiking trails or concrete, you know, or boards, or have railings.
And we like to get down in there.
Yeah.
Where the things you'll see from the road, you go, God, I wish I could go climbing around
in that stuff.
That is so weird looking.
And we need to negotiate this prickly pear hallway to test your courage and coordination.
Well, so much for...
We both got a B, which means you're dead.
Got a B?
That means you're dead because one touch of that plant kills you.
Oh.
It takes 24 hours, exactly.
It's called the 24 hour death cactus.
To counteract the death?
Huh?
To counteract the death?
Yeah.
Oh!
I'm a type of gringo.
I think you've heard...
No.
...which type.
I just touched a prickly pear spine in my excitement to photograph a rotting prickly
pear leaf, which has its skeleton exposed.
We've made photographs of the skeletons alone because they look so weird.
You wouldn't even know it was a prickly pear skeleton except that it's shaped sort of prickly
pearishly.
We saw our two friends, the crows.
The two black crows that we traveled with.
Yeah, the two black crows.
They're kind of like a side man.
We saw them.
They followed us...
Oh, God!
All the way across the country and back to a certain point.
You don't see them everywhere.
Look, where's the trail?
Do we go up, down, or indifferent?
This is why the pinks don't go here.
What would Arnie do?












What would Arnie Sognason do?
It's easy to get distracted with thoughts of wonderment, thoughts of the future, cosmic,
grand schemes in this marvelous environment out here in nature.
Just listen to those crickets and cicadas.
The sound of nature.
The sounds that I'm hearing in this phone...
The sounds that I'm hearing in this phone when no one's talking are stranger than what
I hear when you're talking.
Stang, I can only conclude that you're having a bunch of hallucinations.
Could be.
Well, I think you're hallucinating.
And you're misinterpreting your cerebral cortex as it does once in a while.
How would I know?
How would you know?
You would think the large blue lady entering your room carrying the scimitar was the postman
who was delivering your nightclub.
That's right.
I was always thinking there was he knows, like, surviving...

And I noticed that a lot of guys from the near west side and some guys from the east side.
So you don't think people should start their own religion?
Well, I don't.
No, I'm not saying they shouldn't.
No, I'm not saying I don't think people should.
What we need to know is if you can do so profitably, then go for it.
Maybe that was a bad idea on his part.
Hello, Cleveland!
Hello, Cleveland!
This show goes to 11. Actually, the show goes to midnight.
If I could see things in the distant future as well as in the distant past,

The day Sky King died.
I went to bed that night and I just...
died.
I remember the day.
The day Sky King died.
I still remember the day.

But the day the skyねy turned to the sky.

His head should be broken now.
The dust went off.
Now it got made of drops.
The world is a.



Let's send a message from the sky king to the sky king.
OK to the sky king!





The Day Sky King Died
by the Swingin' Love Corpses at QuiveringBrain.com
who also did this background music.
And before that, a clip of Radio Synesthesia from WCSB Cleveland.
The instrumental a little earlier was
Touch Me Please by the Psychoskeletons
found under that name at SoundClick.com
and PR News was by Reverend Cosmic Debris.
This is Hour of Slack number 1359 from Subgenius.com
and other places such as Upcoming,
the Ask Dr. Howell Show on Radio Valencia
with Dr. Philo Drummond,
and a clip from the Olden Firesign Theater,
our mentors from 1972 in the Duke of Madness Motors collection.
But now, back to the trail.
Even put a bottle cap in their pocket
until they get back, or put the bottle cap on the bottle.
There's a novel idea, until they get back.
Yeah, this is real close to the campground,
and yet people throw their bottle caps here.
I'll take that one.
It's just sick.
You've done enough bottle cap picking.
I stopped.
I'm like so tired of people's piggishness
and having to pick up after them.
I'll put them in my pocket with my dead batteries.
I'm in picking up of free gorgeous rocks mode.
Yeah, normally we...
It's sad.
The little respect people show.
It would be so easy not to just throw that plastic bottle of water
down in the middle of Bryce Canyon.
It seems like...
It doesn't weigh anything after you drink the water out of it,
so why not crumple it up and stick it in your pocket
until you get out?
No.
You've got to leave your pink mark.
The mark of the pink.
Yep, I was pink.
I'm a pink boy, and I was here.
Not everyone.
Not everyone.
You can't do that.



You can tell.
You want to be guilty, but there are odds.
No, most people aren't guilty.
Obviously, there are a few.
Yeah, there's just these...
And it's sad that we all...
They mar the world that we all share.
They mar it.
Well, you know, the trail itself mars the world,
and the highway getting to the trail,
and the thing that brings us down the highway to the trail
all mar the world,
if you want to look at it that way.
Yeah.
On the other hand, without those things,
we never would have seen any of these.
No.
No.
There must be a balance.
By dobs, there must be a balance.
Yes, I insist upon it.
Surely there must be.
We can't be such stupid chimpanzees
as to screw it all up
just when it was getting cool.
My God, man.
What's wrong with these people?
What's not wrong is the question.
I'm a...
I'm afraid.
Oh, yes.
What's not wrong?
Why, there's even nothing or two wrong with me.
I'll admit it.
Yes, I'm a humble man.
A greatly humble man.
Where is my camera?
I need my camera to record the greatness of nature,
which compared to myself is...
is so much grander.
This one rock,
this one tiny, funny,
little purple...
little purple...
cube of rock in the middle of gray and red ones.
I mean, orange cube.
What was I saying?
Something's happened to me.
Radiation.
We're near Los Alamos.
It's not far.
But we are here.
I have a dobs head on,
but it's under two layers of clothes.
It is January.
It's not cold, though.
It's like about 50 now.
The sun's on its way down.
It's been behind clouds all day.
Darn it.
But if it hadn't been,
we'd actually be hot.
Look, there's some left of cigarette butt there.
Right where everybody could see it.
Not like picking up a rock and sticking it under it
where it'll remain for 200 years.
Till some bug...
Two million years till some bug man picks it up and goes...
A roach man will pick it up.
A roach man of two million years
will be walking along what's...
remains of this ground.
And kick that rock and look underneath and go...
Good Lord!
Would say the roach man.
A roach!
But that was a mere American spirit roach
or Marlboro or Merritt or something.
Sad.
Sad.
A tear is rolling down my cheek
like the noble red man.
Weeping for the wonders that were lost.
Weeping for the fact that he himself,
his own ancestors,
helped wipe out so many large species
when they arrived on this continent.
A tear rolls down my cheek.
A tear rolls down my cheek.
At the cigarette butts.
Sorry.
There are cigarette butts
in Rockhound State Bar.
I'm not a cigarette butt.
Calling all coordinates.
Calling all coordinates.
Moon 4 degrees Taurus.
Roger.
Cancer rising.
Roger.
29 Pisces 59.
Roger.
This one looks serious, Roger.
You're right.
We'd better call Captain Equinox.
Captain Equinox, the deadliest foe of those who attest
to railing democracy.
By day, Adolph Tree, a mild mannered college professor.
By night, King.
Kiki, a mini-skirted obituary of Hollywood's star-struck
Sunset Strip.
But twice a year, he's Captain Equinox.
Today's dumb story spies over Broadway.
But first, here's Captain Equinox himself
with today's secret coded message.
Okay, Solstice Squad, get your pencil and paper ready
and listen up.
You can buy a car, rent a car, or have your car serviced
at Jack Poet Volkswagen in Highland Park
at 5944 North Figueroa off the Avenue 60 exit
of the Pasadena Freeway.
Got that down?
If you don't have your decoder, tear off the top of your daddy's car
and mail it together with 10 cents in cash or coin
to Captain Equinox, decoder tie, Drop City, Colorado.
And now, Captain Equinox.
Yes, some of the rocks here look just like meat.
They're red and veiny and pork chop shaped.
They don't have the smell nor the texture of meat,
but they look like meat.
Not all of the rocks look like meat.
Some seem to look like faces.
Listen, you can hear the trucks and pinks.
You can hear guys barbecuing.
Oh, remember when we went to the restrooms,
there was a guy just standing in front of the men's room,
just standing there, a redneck.
I walked up to him.
Actually, I was walking to the restroom door,
and he goes, it must be wax.
It must be waxing day, huh?
I looked at him.
I said, oh, excuse me.
Pardon me.
It must be waxing day.
I go, uh.
He goes, that fella up there, he's waxing his RV.
It must be waxing day.
I looked up the hill, and there among the 40 RVs
was an old man waxing his RV.
And I said, like, that was the funniest thing I ever heard
when I walked in the bathroom.
He probably looked at him and said, he was like,
honky.
He was like, I'm killing weather, don't it?
Feels like I'm killing weather, don't it?
Well, it was one of those kind of comments you say to strangers.
It was a homely one, I suppose.
But he really did say it like, it must be waxing day.
I'm sure he meant no offense.
He was being folksy and newsy.
Friendly.
Just wanted to see if I was Muslimic.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He was.
Now, I'm sure I could be a terrorist out to blow up Rockhound State Park, New Mexico.
Well, yeah, with your long hair, I mean.
Or an illegal immigrant from France or something.
Yeah.
I'm going to check my accent.
I'm sure it's, my accent goes a long way out here.
Not mine.
This whole part of the country.
No, you're a Yankee.
But around here, they can, even at my most polite, they can tell, oh, he's a nice city boy,
probably from Dallas or someplace.
Nice.
I bet he was like one of them lawyers or stage actors or something.
Do you notice how pretty he talks?
He talks real pretty.
His mouth sure ain't as pretty as his talk coming out of it is.
Now is it, is it?
Nose ain't nearly as pretty.
His mouth ain't.
How happened to you?
I go rock picking for one second and all of a sudden you degenerate into this thing that I don't even know anymore.
Who are you?
What's happened?
Who is anyone?
Who is anyone?
And how did this one rock get this way?
Who can tell the story?
Actually, I'm sure a qualified geologist could tell the story in endlessly boring terms.
Now, yesterday we were watching Tarzan and the Mermaid.
Oh, that's a good one.
The studio claimed that a stuntman died doing a high dive in Acapulco during the shooting,
but there's no proof that that ever happened.
Hollywood hokum.
Pure bourgeois.
Yeah.
So there.
That was Johnny Weissmuller's last Tarzan movie.
God, do we sound old.
I don't know why, talking about those great classics of the cinema,
produced by fighting two-fisted producers like Carl Denham, for example.
They're still around.
Yes.
The movies are, not the producers.
Yeah, well, yeah, the movies are around.
Those producers are now panty waists.
They're not like hard-hitting Carl Denham at all.
Carl Denham.
What a name.
They're not even buffoons like Max O'Hara.
And they laughed at him.
They laughed at Carl Denham.
They said, you're crazy.
There's no Skull Island.
That's nuts.
And they laughed at Max O'Hara when his Golden Safari nightclub opened.
They weren't laughing when they were running from those dinosaurs.
You mean in the Denham expedition?
Yes.
Yeah, is that yours?
It's so sad that Skull Island vanished beneath the waves.
If you believe that, it certainly seems to disappear very rapidly.
There aren't any more expeditions after, like, 1943 or so.
Has there?
The United Nations has kept it as an international preserve.
I hope so.
That would be great.
I haven't seen any proof of it.
It seems like something would come out on it.
So that you can't see it anymore.
All right, here's the phone.
Just as something interesting got started.
But just out of the love of novelty, I am going to answer the phone.
Although, of course, it cannot be heard.
Well, not by the radio audience.
Can the radio audience hear?
No.
But now I will hold the instrument to my ear and I shall...
Strange question.
Can the radio audience hear?
Hello, whoever this is?
Who is it?
Who's there?
Who's there?
Please answer.
Well, the problem is, because of a technical malfunction, we can't...
What's that flaming bag on the doorstep?
Yeah.
Over the...
So I'm speaking to you, but you can't be heard, I'm afraid.
You'll have to try us again when everything is in apple pie order,
which, unfortunately, it now isn't.
But thanks for calling anyway.
I suggested that to someone the other day.
What?
They were really, really, really, really mad.
They wanted to get revenge on somebody.
And I said, I got a simple little thing.
It's a tried and true method that works every time it's tried.
Take a crap in a paper sack, put it on the front doorstep,
light the bag, ring the doorbell,
and run away.
People still fall for that?
It still works.
People still will come out and jump on the sack with the fire out.
Yes.
Well, I'm afraid I can't discuss it with you,
but I'll tell our audience what it is that you've just told me.
Anyway, when I reminded them of that simple strategy,
they thought it was, like, brilliant.
That caller was saying that...
It's the simple things that you can pull out.
Movies aren't special as they are...
They aren't now.
As they were once, if I can screw him properly,
with Netflix and DVDs and all of that sort of thing.
They finally got movies down where they're, like, worth about a buck now.
Maybe two bucks.
But you have to pay far more for that.
Well, video games are like an extension of movies in some cases.
They're like a combination art form that's new,
and that's made a difference.
And also the fact that so many people today are just half humans,
just shadows.
Walking...
Shamblings.
Shades.
Shields.
Mounds.
Shells.
Humanoid shapes.
So, of course, they can't possibly comprehend
the importance of certain 1930s and 40s Universal.
They don't even know how the movies are made back then.
You know, they were, like, just...
Before the computer, how'd they do it?
They might be pleased with the novelty.
If you were to set up a 16mm projector screen and speakers
and then project a movie in a dark room,
they might like the novelty.
They might like the quality of the sound and the picture.
Except the noise the projector made.
But that would be cool, too, because, after all,
do we not worship the device more than the material which comes through it?
No.
Well, you might not, but they do.
I happen to know.
They're unable to get past the fact that they have a contraption that does something,
and they're clearly not interested in it.

They're not interested in doing anything with it.
Well, now, look, let's face it.
All of us were the AV kids that loaded the projectors, right?
I was called on to do that, of course.
Yeah.
And all of us made horrible, stupid little movies
when we were about 11 years old, right?
And older, in my case.
Yeah.
Well, none of us is quite soft.
I made comic books.
You didn't make any movies?
But what about the fake blood?
What about the...
There's a whole reason to make movies.
I saw a movie of you in the garage that took 20 years to make.
Well, that one started in 1977 or so, and so he was in his late 20s then.
Looked like a 70s porno star, didn't he?
Yeah, he did.
Yeah, that's Bob's Lunch Hour.
It's on my YouTube channel, which is one word, RevStang.
And Bob's Lunch Hour, we had to remove the stolen soundtrack.
But it's just as well.
It was made as a silent movie.
We started in 1977.
We ran out of steam.
And suddenly, we realized that it would be better if we finished it now, 30 years later.
We did it in 2006.
We should do that scrolling text thing.
We shot the ending of it.
So, Philo ages 30 years in this Twilight Zone-like short film.
And there's a shock cut from the 27-year-old Philo to the 50-year-old Philo.
A company by Changing Music.
It's wild.
Wild.
Wild!
From the original, just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in, to a punk version.
When the punk version starts, that's when you see the wizened Philo in rags, replaced the business suited, young, healthy Philo.
He's a good guy.
He's been going, in the movie, he's been going downstairs and down elevators for 30 years.
And only getting higher and higher up in the building.
And at the end, he ends up on the roof and decides to jump.
And at first, he goes to heaven.
He's sitting on a cloud, looking young again.
And at first, he's happy.
But then he realizes he's even higher up.
He looks over the cloud and there's the earth down there.
And he realizes he's worse off than ever.
I got too high.
I got too high.
And I can't come down anymore.
It was our first and last subgenius movie.
Or should I say first and latest?
It seems to have it all, including a great span of years in its making.
You could actually say 20 years in the making.
30.
30.
Well, remember they used to say two years in the making and so forth.
Well, 30 years in the making.
This was before J.R. Bob Dobbs was known to the public.
And we, as a joke, had Philo play a character named J.R. Bob Dobbs.
And we made a name for it.
Now, that's awkward.
It says J.R. Bob Dobbs and it shows the young Philo, who, of course, didn't even have a pipe.
He had a mustache.
He didn't look anything like Bob.
All confusing to our listeners.
All confusing to our listeners.
All confusing to our listeners.
All confusing to our listeners.
All confusing to our listeners.
All confusing to our listeners.
