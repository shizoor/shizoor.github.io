1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,280
Good afternoon, Hal. How's everything going?

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,640
I ain't saying nothing.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,000
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,560
Hello, Hal. Do you read me?

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,120
Yeah.

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,120
Do you read me, Hal?

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:11,760
Yeah.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,300
Sure.

9
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,980
Now, you're fired along with all the rest of us.

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,020
I don't care about the others.

11
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,160
You're at 1-3. They're all 1-3.

12
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:18,760
Oh, please.

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,180
I didn't know what I was doing. I must have been crazy.

14
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,140
And I deserve anything that's coming to me.

15
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,440
The Self-Genius Hour of Slack.

16
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,620
I'm afraid I can't do that.

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,640
Guess what you think you're doing.

18
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,480
Now, what am I doing here?

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,660
Has this thing started?

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,120
This episode of the Hour of Slack, number 1545.

21
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:02,680
58 is entirely composed of my rant at the Starwood Festival of 2015.

22
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,260
Yeah, it's just me talking for an hour.

23
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,700
Don't say I didn't warn you.

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,920
But, see, the Starwood Festival is about the only place where I'm allowed to talk for an hour straight

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,400
without being interrupted by insane bulldada.

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,760
In fact, Starwood is about the only place where a lot of stuff happens.

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,400
And you'd have to see it to believe it.

28
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,380
And I can't show you.

29
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,060
So, on with the pre-recorded.

30
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,440
Show.

31
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,460
Praise Bob!

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,700
But we don't have to.

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,000
Is this thing running?

34
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,720
Is this thing on?

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,120
Is this thing on?

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,820
No, I'm totally deaf.

37
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,460
I'm just guessing what you're saying now.

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,320
Cool.

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,240
Yeah, good guess, huh?

40
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,480
No, that's fine.

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,240
Now, what am I doing here?

42
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,500
Has this thing started?

43
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,880
I guess it has.

44
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,300
I guess this is the subgenius revival.

45
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,460
Praise Bob!

46
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,140
Close enough.

47
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,480
Great weather, isn't it?

48
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,980
Yesterday, or the day before, I was talking to a nice young hippie girl that I don't know.

49
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,420
She said, when's your show?

50
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,960
And I said, Saturday afternoon.

51
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,860
But the weather cartoons on the internet say it's going to be thunder.

52
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,920
Thunder and lightning all day.

53
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,560
And she said, don't say that.

54
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,860
You'll make it happen.

55
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,020
Well, I'm a magic denier.

56
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,540
But, so I said, all right.

57
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,580
Well, if it doesn't rain, I'll take credit for it.

58
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:49,560
So, the reason we have such great weather today is because I asked J.R. Bob Dobbs to make the weather good.

59
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,280
Not that he actually has that power.

60
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,840
It's just that whatever he wants to do, he does.

61
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,160
And if he wants to happen, it happens to be what's going to happen anyway.

62
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,200
So, presumably, he must have felt like good weather.

63
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,000
Now, let me see if I can figure out.

64
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,380
I'm as clueless as anybody else.

65
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,080
So, I have to use the Starwood Tour Guide to orient myself.

66
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:22,060
And according to this, what we're doing here is the pulling of the wool in the Church of the Subgenius.

67
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,900
Let us rejoice in the word of Bob.

68
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,640
Or tremble in terror!

69
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,100
Or at his mighty vengeance.

70
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,660
Which will it be?

71
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,160
That depends on if you can appreciate the slack you already have.

72
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,440
Whether you know you have it or not.

73
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,040
What form does slack take in your life?

74
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,820
What takes away your slack?

75
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,280
You probably already know the answers.

76
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:54,040
But Reverend Stange's preaching will muddy the waters until your own confusion has washed you free of false slack.

77
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,820
Or at least provide you with a chance to do so.

78
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:55,820


79
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,880
You might have a grim mordant chuckle or two.

80
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,800
Praise Bob!

81
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,480
Or freak out trying not to.

82
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,600
Well, that's a good ad copy, I guess.

83
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,700
I recognize most of the faces here.

84
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,340
But I know that some people have no idea what this Church of the Subgenius thing is.

85
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,300
Presumably, you've seen old pipe face here and there.

86
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,420
Tattooed on hipsters or branded on the backs of criminals and such.

87
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,180
But that's not true.

88
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,840
And I'll...

89
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,060
Okay, I think the ad made some description.

90
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,920
But basically, back in 1953, the saint of sales, that square looking guy with the pipe, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

91
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,840
He was already the greatest salesman in the world.

92
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:51,060
But on the day of his immaculation, Jehovah One, the alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy,

93
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,100
reached down and yanked Bob up by the scruff of his neck.

94
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,320
And he was a little bit of a jack tie.

95
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,300
And told him that there was a...

96
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:04,380
Had throughout history been a conspiracy that didn't even know it was a conspiracy.

97
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,480
It was a conspiracy of normal, plain ordinary normal people.

98
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,280
Instinctively robbing away the slack of the weirdos, the abnormals, anybody different.

99
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,880
And so Bob was commissioned to found his Church of the Subgenius.

100
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,260
Not upon a rock.

101
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,160
But upon a $20 bill.

102
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,160


103
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,200
Which has since gone up to $35.

104
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:37,860
He teaches us how to obtain slack despite the conspiracy of the normal people.

105
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,860
Who will all die on X day, that great day.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,880
Which apparently is going to be next year and not last week.

107
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:55,160
A friend of ours told me a line that he came up with that kind of explains the Church of the Subgenius.

108
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,600
The difference between it and all of our rival cults.

109
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,940
He said, said Reverend Quasar,

110
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,660
I belong to a brainwashing joke.

111
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,560
Because it's the funniest cult I've ever heard.

112
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,820
Isn't that sweet?

113
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,520
And while I'm at it, I should mention there's another new line.

114
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,400
That I found on Facebook from Nunslow.

115
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:32,240
He said, a pipe is like a pie with more pee in it.

116
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,320
Appetizing, isn't it?

117
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,460
So, oh, oh, there are two things I have to do to make this an official Subgenius thing.

118
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,760
Besides get everybody yelling.

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,060
This is the most expensive part of our shows.

120
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,580
Oh good, I have, this is a dollar bill.

121
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,600
And what I'm about to do is very slightly illegal.

122
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,180
But we have to do it anyway.

123
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:03,840
Because as long as the men from Planet X, those aliens up there who are doing Jehovah One's bidding.

124
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,620
As long as they can smell the smoke from this burning U.S. dollar bill.

125
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,160
They know there's something down here worth saving.

126
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,540
Which might be the other two thirds of this dollar bill.

127
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,560
Normally I let it go all the way.

128
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:24,420
But the fact that it's still spendable proves there's really something down here on Earth worth saving.

129
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,700
Because even the aliens can spend that dollar.

130
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,880
As L. Ron Hubbard told J.R. Bob Dobbs, they may be pink, but their money is green.

131
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,700
And when we say pink, we don't mean white people.

132
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,120
It's an attitude.

133
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,520
An attitude that's the normal attitude.

134
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,660
The fear of the unknown or the different and so forth.

135
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,100
Oh, the other thing I have to do.

136
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,600
Thanks, Jeff.

137
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,280
Jeff Rosenbaum, one of the main founders of Starwood.

138
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,880
None of us would be standing here doing this if not for him.

139
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,040
He sure had lots of help.

140
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,400
He wasn't really exactly the only founder.

141
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,720
But he put more everything into it than just about anybody.

142
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,880
And thanks again, Jeff.

143
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,260
Praise Jeff!

144
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

145
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,540
Praise Jeff!

146
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,280
Yeah!

147
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,640
Now, although I'm looking at these pieces of paper every now and then,

148
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,760
I actually decided to do this one without a script.

149
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,080
Of course, I couldn't help but make some kind of notes.

150
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:40,800
And the reason is when you force yourself to just kind of wing it,

151
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,540
it challenges your little tiny half a brain cell.

152
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,560
That's what I'm working with anyway.

153
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,660
And kind of helps keep it going.

154
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:57,860
And for that matter, just having a festival at a remote campground

155
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:04,000
in the middle of Ohio's outback challenges your little one brain cell.

156
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,360
It takes you out of your comfort zone just camping, you know.

157
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,680
I mean, unless you're generally homeless all the time.

158
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,300
It's kind of a different...

159
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,400
You thrust yourself into a different situation.

160
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,660
It might be really uncomfortable at times.

161
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,320
We've had starwoods where it rained every day.

162
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,400
But all that did was drive strangers together in the shelter of tents.

163
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,280
And then nine months later, there's more little pagans running around.

164
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,980
And ten months later, more little subgeniuses

165
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,560
because they take longer to gestate.

166
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,700
I think because they're so damn lazy.

167
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,040
But we like being out of the comfort zone

168
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,040
because that kind of puts you into...

169
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,340
the zone.

170
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,780
You know, you're...

171
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,440
Well, that's what some of us call slack.

172
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,080
The conspiracy...

173
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,900
The marketing and advertising conspiracy

174
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,500
would certainly want you to think that slack is,

175
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,720
oh, buying the right clothes, or wearing the right makeup,

176
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,800
or drinking the right beer, or your team is just one, and so forth.

177
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:17,320
But some of us know that, no, slack is different.

178
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,660
I mean, for some people, slack is birdwatching.

179
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,860
For me, slack is playing this little, among many other things,

180
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,820
playing a silly video game called Monster Hunter.

181
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,840
By the way, are there any other Monster Hunters here?

182
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,060
Didn't think so.

183
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,100
It's big in Japan.

184
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,660
Oh, well.

185
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,760
So we'd love...

186
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,640
I mean, for some people, slack is working.

187
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,180
If you're lucky enough to work at what you like.

188
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,660
Gosh, I could say something about prostitutes,

189
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,500
but it would be in terrible taste.

190
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,600
Don't worry, I've got more bad taste coming up.

191
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,740
The bottom line is, when you really challenge yourself,

192
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,320
and you got your brain kind of working at top gear,

193
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,000
partly, it may in some cases just be to find a way to get out of the rain,

194
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,160
you realize that Rush Limbaugh's wrong.

195
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,960
You can't make the complex simple.

196
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,680
Because, goddammit, the complex is complex!

197
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,560
Some of us like it that way!

198
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,580
Some of us find that a bit of a challenge too.

199
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,320
But yet, making the complex simple certainly is what sells.

200
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,960
And if you doubt that, just look at any political ads,

201
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,960
especially with the presidential elections coming up,

202
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:45,000
or any religions advertising or recruitment.

203
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,820
What...

204
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,480
Everybody wants to hear what Rush Limbaugh says.

205
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,340
And that's what they most want to hear.

206
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,160
And there's always somebody out there gonna tell you what you're dying to hear!

207
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,220
And if I don't do it, get on the internet and find somebody else telling you what you most want to hear.

208
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,000
Now, I have a funny job here at Starwood.

209
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,060
I'm like the mascot skeptic.

210
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,600
I'm the magic denier.

211
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,340
I'm as big of a bring-down as those climate change deniers.

212
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,260
And so forth, you know?

213
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,760
It's not that I have anything against it,

214
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,720
it's just that it has never exactly worked for me,

215
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,780
although I still...

216
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,400
I guess I still see magic happening all the time.

217
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:43,320
Sometimes I have wonderful explanations that come from science books for things.

218
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,720
I honestly don't believe that talking about the rain causes it to rain.

219
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,280
No.

220
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,380
And I noticed...

221
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,860
Oh, and this is another thing I always like to do at Starwood.

222
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,240
I haven't done it in a couple of years.

223
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,080
Is go through my favorite titles of workshops.

224
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,660
And I don't even know what some of them are about, but I did read about some.

225
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,460
There was one called,

226
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,780
Is it Karma? Really?

227
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,540
Well, I'm not sure what that one was about, but I find myself saying that all the time.

228
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,100
Really? Karma?

229
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,080
You expected things to be fair?

230
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,100
A justice in nature?

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,760
Really?

232
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,180
On the other hand, there's a juxtaposition.

233
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,260
Why did these get programmed at the same time?

234
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,440
Phil Farber on cannabis magic,

235
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,500
and Harvey Wasserman on stop the drug war.

236
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,540
They're both at the same time.

237
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,080
You need cannabis magic to stop the drug war.

238
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,440
Those should have been the same.

239
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,520
But then the next, at the same time, there was one called Getting Odd,

240
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,120
which I presume is the opposite of getting even.

241
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,260
But some of us started out odd.

242
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,920
And yeah, we didn't have to get that way.

243
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,680
Audience with the war goddess.

244
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,900
Now, see, that one scared me away.

245
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,140
I figured the war goddess would kick my ass.

246
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,960
Beginning devil stick.

247
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,060
I don't know.

248
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,960
I don't know what that is, but it sounds sexy.

249
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,160
This is your brain on music.

250
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,160
Well, that's good.

251
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,160
These are my ears on too much music, and this one doesn't work at all.

252
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,820
Starwood frippery.

253
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,340
Well, that's what it all is, isn't it?

254
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,780
And finally, playing with your auric self,

255
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,500
which also sounds kind of naughty.

256
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,040
But it reminds me of something.

257
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,140
I've got a buddy down the road, Reverend Tater Gumphreys.

258
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,960
He can do aura piercing.

259
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,220
If you want to be really cool, go to Tater and get your aura pierced.

260
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,980
He'll also do tattoos, but I don't think they're permanent on the aura

261
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,720
because your auras are always changing.

262
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,340
Oh, the one labeled Werewolves of Wisteria?

263
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,780
Just a game.

264
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,800
Damn.

265
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,300
I was so hoping.

266
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,200
So anyway, there's that.

267
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:33,780
Now, I was going to do a workshop that my wife talked me out of doing.

268
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,700
But I'm just going to give you the title

269
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,660
because everything about the title was basically offensive to somebody.

270
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,380
And that's what we were looking for.

271
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,940
And this title, which doesn't appear in here,

272
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,560
because she's the nice one.

273
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,120
Astrology and Autism.

274
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,180
Now, how come nobody's throwing rocks at me?

275
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,520
There ought to be at least an astrologer and a vaxxer throwing rocks at me.

276
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,080
I'm not doing my job.

277
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,360
Two totally unrelated hot button topics.

278
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,600
How about abortion and autism?

279
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,320
Whoa, that's even better.

280
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,240
Obviously, in Church of the Subgenius, we have plenty of friends who are autistic.

281
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,440
I'm not making fun of autistic people.

282
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,760
However, I might make fun of some of their parents sometimes.

283
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,340
No, no problem.

284
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,160
I'm one of those people, friends,

285
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,240
I started out as more of a believer

286
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,100
because my original interests were, number one, monsters.

287
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,300
This is starting from the very beginning.

288
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,940
Well, no, actually, number one would probably be,

289
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,740
titties.

290
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,020
But, obviously, you know, if you're really starting at the beginning.

291
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,480
But then, you know, a little boy likes monsters.

292
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,020
And from there you go, oh, well, science fiction, monster movies,

293
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,240
that's where I can find monsters.

294
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:04,440
Then you go, well, the small town Texas library

295
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,220
doesn't really carry that many sci-fi and horror books,

296
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,620
but look at all these religion books.

297
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,740
They're full of monsters.

298
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,460
The Greek ones have Cyclopses,

299
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,640
and the other religion books have dragons.

300
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,100
The Bible has cool monsters in it.

301
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,900
Ten-headed chocolate triceratopses rising from the ocean

302
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,700
with the horror Babylon sitting on them.

303
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,980
Cool stuff like that.

304
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,780
Well, at one point, as a kid, you start putting it away.

305
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,820
Boy, they sure believe some silly myths there in ancient Egypt.

306
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,680
Wait a minute.

307
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:49,560
What if Noah's Ark was just like those silly stories from ancient Greek

308
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,740
and the ancient Romans?

309
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
Oh, no.

310
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,620
So then you get interested in paranormal.

311
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,680
It's like, well, all those organized religions,

312
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,980
they seem to cause more trouble than they're worth over the years.

313
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,640
But if there's anything to this,

314
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,420
you know, ESP, UFOs, any of that stuff,

315
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,720
it's the most important stuff in the world.

316
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,580
So I really got into that for a long time.

317
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,300
And you can tell in the subgenius books,

318
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,020
we weren't just, we weren't ripping off just anybody.

319
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,780
We ripped off the best.

320
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,580
The Church of the Subgenius is a Frankenstein's monster

321
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,040
pieced together from parts of the best dead religions

322
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,840
and a few live ones that we had to kill in order to skin them.

323
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:45,920
But then what my studies in paranormal eventually culminated in was

324
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,900
I met a lot of really interesting people.

325
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,740
And I got interested, invited to Starwood.

326
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,740
So right on.

327
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,020
But then I got off into, okay, I'd give up on magic

328
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,120
and even UFOs and everything.

329
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,900
They keep letting us down year after year.

330
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,440
So I got into science and history.

331
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,840
And slack.

332
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,880
And the history and the science were weirder,

333
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,000
far weirder and more scary and outrageous

334
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,740
than anything I'd read in fiction or even seen in movies.

335
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,920
And the slack finally came completely independent of any of those things.

336
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:34,440
The slack actually, I think, came when I got married to the right girl.

337
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,580
Yeah, sweet, isn't it?

338
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,500
But it's true.

339
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,660
And now I find myself in a situation where I can't,

340
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,400
I used to thrive on hate.

341
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,000
I was a hateful, angry young man.

342
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,780
And now I ain't got hate one.

343
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,180
All I can rant about is slack.

344
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,740
And it's my slack.

345
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,320
You're not interested in my slack.

346
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,880
You've got your own slack.

347
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,400
I could stand here and talk about how much fun I have playing Monster Hunter.

348
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,080
But, so therefore, I have to, when I have to do a hate rant,

349
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,560
these days I have to read old books.

350
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:07,860
I have to read old stuff.

351
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,880
Or use the fine written materials from up and coming younger subgenius preachers

352
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,360
who are still bubbling with that all power of hate.

353
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:24,000
But, I would like to share one aspect of my slack with you.

354
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,400
And Regis, this is when we need the microphone down in the audience.

355
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,480
Is the microphone in the audience?

356
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,220
Princess Wee has the microphone.

357
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,540
Friends, you are going to be the lucky ones.

358
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,320
Lucky witnesses to something that also happened last week here at X Day.

359
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,500
Princess Wee and I happen to be married.

360
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,320
I run subgenius.

361
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,500
She's one of the co-directors of Starwood.

362
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,900
The horrible church of the subgenius is permanently married to sweetness and light Starwood now.

363
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,560
And we brought my mother-in-law, the queen mom, also known as Wee Mama.

364
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:15,300
And Grandma Bob and she and Princess Wee are going to do a duet or two for you.

365
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:21,320
And you'll see what I mean by a different form of slack that you weren't expecting.

366
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,840
So take it away, Wee Mamas and Wee Ma.

367
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,720
Okay, I guess we'll take it away.

368
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,480
Cats on the rooftops, cats on the tiles.

369
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,520
Cats with syphilis, cats with a tail.

370
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:37,520


371
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:37,520


372
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,520
Cats with their assholes, breathing with a smut.

373
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,120
As they revel in the joys of fornication.

374
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:52,320
The old hippopotamus, so it seems, very, very seldom has wet dreams.

375
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,840
But when he does, he comes in streams.

376
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,860
As he revels in the joys of fornication.

377
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,960
The elephant is a funny bloke.

378
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,260
And very, very seldom gets a poke.

379
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,700
So when he does, he licks his soap.

380
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,840
As he revels in the joys of fornication.

381
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,500
The ostrich has a funny dick.

382
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,820
And it isn't very often that he dips his wick.

383
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,120
So when he does, he dips his wick.

384
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,020
As he revels in the joys of fornication.

385
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,800
Persecutous girls live under a strain.

386
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,080
Waiting for their monthly pay.

387
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,600
And when it comes, they smile.

388
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,780
As they revel in the joys of fornication.

389
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,060
But we revel in the morning with an upright stand.

390
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,400
It's urinary pressure on the prostate gland.

391
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,580
And you haven't got a woman, so you jerk it off by hand.

392
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,740
As you revel in the joys of fornication.

393
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,380
The grass-traveled parish has very little fun.

394
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,780
He doesn't even know how it's done.

395
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,300
But when he's too fun, he gets none.

396
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,940
And you end.

397
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,960
As he revels in the joys of fornication.

398
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,520
The cocksucker blows his friend in the face.

399
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,700
Then he licks it up so it won't go to waste.

400
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,840
Don't you think it's odd? It's a matter of taste.

401
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,980
As he revels in the joys of fornication.

402
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,240
Perhaps, cried the captain, as he thought.

403
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,560
These new ensigns are not so hot.

404
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,880
And the admiral takes the best of the lot.

405
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,040
As he revels in the joys of fornication.

406
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,740
When you wake up in the morning with your belly full of joy.

407
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,320
And your wife's on her vacation.

408
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,900
And your daughter's being caught.

409
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,420
So you'll point in the asshole of your young'ness' foot.

410
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,620
As you revel in the joys of fornication.

411
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,660
Do you ken John Peel?

412
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,200
Yes, I ken him, weel.

413
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,420
He sleeps with his wife, but he never gets a feel.

414
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,860
He sleeps by her side, but he never gets a feel.

415
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,080
He never gets a ride, as he wakes up in the morning in frustration.

416
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,800
That's one, we've got two more, if you want to hear them.

417
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,980
Oh yeah, yeah, do the Aspie song.

418
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,360
Which one? Oh, that's the last one, okay.

419
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,820
Do either one, do both.

420
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:28,980
Who paid the rent for Mrs. Rip and Rico when Rip and Rico was away?

421
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,260
He was gone for twenty years.

422
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,140
Who was enjoyed up all her tears?

423
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,660
There was no one in the place, no one there to embrace.

424
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,140
But the milkman always loved her with a smile on his face.

425
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:53,000
Oh, who paid the rent for Mrs. Rip and Rico when Rip and Rico was away?

426
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,420
And there was a little bird.

427
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,840
No bigger than a turtle.

428
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,580
And there was a little bird sitting on a telegraph pole.

429
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:15,380
He scratched out his neck, and he shit about a peck.

430
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:21,420
As he puckered up his little asshole.

431
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,360
Asshole, asshole, asshole, asshole.

432
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:36,580
As he puckered up his little asshole.

433
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,220
And last of all,

434
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:54,480
Razzby, oh Razzby.

435
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,340
If the heavens were to tell you,

436
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,900
That the hair on your head,

437
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,580
Is a bright curly red,

438
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,060
Then what color would the hair,

439
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,720
On your razzby?

440
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,540
Say hello to your new earworms, friends.

441
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,280
I've had that one running through my head since you guys were rehearsing it earlier.

442
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,640
Hard to get out.

443
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,200
Yes friends, the subgeniuses come in all shapes and sizes.

444
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,780
Louise Lefcourt there has been coming to Starwoods for years.

445
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,080
She, the first time we had Paul Krasner here, she went,

446
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,120
Oh, I used to read his magazine, I want to go.

447
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,460
And she's come back almost every time she could.

448
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,120
She's the only ACE Associates parent to ever attend Starwood.

449
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,680
That's right.

450
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,480
So, praise Louise.

451
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

452
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,460
Next we'll have to bring my dad out here.

453
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,220
You thought, I thought my jokes were bad.

454
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,620
Here's one more final quote.

455
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,880
That fits in the subject matter there.

456
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,200
The immature, vulgar subject matter.

457
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,180
Dr. Katahdin Lagume said,

458
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,880
Slack is like fucking.

459
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,580
The more you put in,

460
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,340
the more you pull out.

461
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,260
Well, well, well.

462
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:32,640
Hmm.

463
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,480
Okay.

464
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,180
You know, this is my 23rd Starwood, I think.

465
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,260
I started in 1990.

466
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,740
I missed a few.

467
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:46,420
I've also been to Burning Man, X Day, the Devo, the Devotionals,

468
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,560
which are Devo conventions.

469
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,020
But Starwood has more love.

470
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,260
More wonderful hippie love stuff.

471
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:00,160
And it even gets to me, even though I'm a cranky old skeptic.

472
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,520
But why not both?

473
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,380
And that's my new philosophy.

474
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:12,160
It's partly inspired by a former frequent guest of Starwood,

475
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,340
Pope Robert Anton Wilson.

476
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,720
Praise Pope Bob.

477
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:23,180
And he got to where he had kind of boiled his philosophy down

478
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,900
to something called maybe logic,

479
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,920
which was summed up in the phrase,

480
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,280
maybe, if everybody said maybe more often,

481
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,560
the world might be a nicer place.

482
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,000
And I have decided that he was right about that.

483
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,020
And I decided to take it even further.

484
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,900
Besides, you know, maybe I should do this, maybe I should do that.

485
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,380
Why not both?

486
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,720
In some cases,

487
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,940
Dr. Timothy Leary used to speak,

488
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,240
at Starwood, a lot.

489
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,240
And one of his themes was,

490
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,080
choose your major.

491
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,900
Decide what you're going to do.

492
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,360
Kids in China don't get to.

493
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,860
Their job is picked for them,

494
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,000
you know, practically when they're born.

495
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,620
Back then, that was true.

496
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,640
There's always this false dichotomy.

497
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,800
Now, do you want to be a big fish in a little pond,

498
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,120
or a little fish in a big pond?

499
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,080
Why does it have to be a big fish in a small pond,

500
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,640
or a small fish in a big pond?

501
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,040
What about a medium fish in a medium pond?

502
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,860
Or a medium fish in a small pond?

503
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,520
Or a small fish in a small pond?

504
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,220
Or a small fish in a medium pond?

505
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,520
Or a medium fish in a large pond?

506
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,040
Or a large fish in a large pond?

507
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,400
Choose your major.

508
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,380
They will constantly,

509
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,400
it's just a linguistic thing, apparently,

510
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,040
everything gets presented in this either-or fashion.

511
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,820
You know, you can either have the vinaigrette dressing

512
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,180
or the French dressing.

513
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,880
Why not both?

514
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,640
It may turn your stomach,

515
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,160
but there are some of us who like to mix our dressings.

516
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:02,100
So we run into this hard-headed philosophy

517
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,460
among non-subgeniuses a lot.

518
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,780
Just so you know,

519
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,040
we're making fun of the people who can't tell

520
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,940
that we're making fun of anything at all,

521
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,320
which makes us a lot of enemies.

522
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,120
We're making fun of anybody,

523
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,420
anybody ignorant, humorless, gullible,

524
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,400
and insecure enough to take us seriously,

525
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,280
pro or con.

526
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,420
So friends, if you take this at face value,

527
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,020
you've kind of just flunked common sense 101.

528
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,540
But we have to try to be patient,

529
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,880
or do we?

530
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,580
Why not both?

531
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:48,720
With the pinks, let's just call them,

532
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,500
and the reds, let's just call them.

533
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,580
I hate to generalize and stereotype.

534
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,400
Every human is different.

535
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,700
Well, no, they aren't. That's the problem.

536
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,740
Every subgenius is different.

537
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,920
Now remember what I said about telling people

538
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,820
just what they most want to hear.

539
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,240
But it does help.

540
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,020
It helps to go ahead and look down on somebody

541
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,560
because of their race.

542
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,700
If it's the human race you're talking about.

543
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,960
And I've noticed that in the,

544
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,100
the times they've been a-changing, some,

545
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,220
not as much as some people would think.

546
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,180
And I've noticed, especially on television,

547
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,700
the internet, and the media,

548
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,760
among the pinks, anger is the new slack.

549
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,440
They are really into being outraged

550
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,780
at damn Obabo or those, those, those queers

551
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,420
or those feminists in gaming

552
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,740
or that, those Confederate flag haters.

553
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,700
It's, it seems, you know, we had a,

554
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,900
there was a lot of promise in the internet.

555
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,040
Anyone can learn anything, anywhere.

556
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,260
Well, if they, they can also,

557
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,620
anyone can get the most ridiculous, horrible information validated.

558
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,340
If you wanted to believe some idiotic thing,

559
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,000
all you gotta do is Google it.

560
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,820
You'll find a hundred thousand other people that also think,

561
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,360
oh, I don't know, women are bullies.

562
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,960
I mean, the internet has emboldened the insane,

563
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,140
the jealous, the vindictive, the dumb asses

564
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,300
to think that it is once again cool

565
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,320
to be an ignorant, sexist, racist, homophobic,

566
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,320
self-righteous, and generally hateful,

567
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,440
loudmouth because they're anonymous.

568
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,520
They're on the internet.

569
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,060
And, and they just, and they're mad.

570
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,820
They're so angry because things just didn't go the way they wanted.

571
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,560
And I've gotten tired of being patient with them

572
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,100
and decided to just, like,

573
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,760
Gamergate, where these tough guys decided,

574
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,240
oh no, some women dared to write articles about video games

575
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,780
and said maybe it might be okay to have non-violent video games.

576
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,680
Oh no, they're gonna take away our Grand Theft Auto.

577
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,160
Why not both?

578
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:31,620
The troubles in Ferguson and Charleston and Cleveland,

579
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,480
for that matter, and all this ridiculous nonsense

580
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,760
over the Confederate flag.

581
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,560
I have a bad habit, friends.

582
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,300
I'm gonna confess.

583
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,280
I'm a junkie, a news junkie.

584
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,400
But worse than that,

585
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,780
I'm a news comments junkie.

586
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,040
I read, sometimes I, if, if, if it's,

587
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,300
if the article has the word climate in it,

588
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,800
or Michelle Obama,

589
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,440
or Hillary, or whatever, flag,

590
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,200
anything scientific,

591
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,840
you can just skip through straight to the comments.

592
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,420
It's like, hilarious.

593
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,900
It's like Mad Magazine.

594
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,420
It doesn't say much for our educational system anymore.

595
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,200
But I'm starting to,

596
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,220
get to where I,

597
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,360
I can't get enough of watching these poor,

598
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,260
picked on, white Christian male jocks

599
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,660
and tough manly rednecks

600
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,280
feeling oppressed.

601
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,620
Because people started telling them they were wrong.

602
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,360
Boo hoo.

603
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,340
That limp-wristed, sissy, gay, liberal college professor

604
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,740
is picking on me.

605
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,780
And, uh,

606
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,260
they're showing fear.

607
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,700
That's what happened in, uh, in Charleston.

608
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,820
They, they, they get on the internet

609
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,280
and look at a website that is so utterly biased,

610
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,380
but it's just what they wanted to believe.

611
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,980
Because it makes them feel,

612
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,140
well, it's somebody else's fault that I'm an unemployed,

613
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,100
ignorant, uneducated,

614
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,300
uh, unemployable,

615
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,880
mentally ill, religious nut

616
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,120
sitting in a trailer court on welfare,

617
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,760
whining about all the things that I do.

618
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,160
And I'm not going to put all those city people on welfare.

619
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,540
And they, they feel cornered,

620
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,700
as well they should.

621
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,460
I hope they are cornered.

622
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,360
And I keep hearing this phrase over and over again.

623
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,060
America has been destroyed.

624
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,700
It's not Obama is destroying America,

625
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,900
or those queers are destroying America,

626
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,380
or whatever.

627
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,040
It's always America has already been destroyed.

628
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,240
They destroyed America.

629
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,800
They just took all of our rights away.

630
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,760
It might as well be 1984.

631
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,380
Well, god damn, if it was 1984,

632
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,460
you wouldn't be able to reference George Orwell's 1984.

633
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,580
You wouldn't even know what it was.

634
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,560
And, I don't know, I go, uh, outside of,

635
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,240
or out of my computer,

636
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,180
out of my house, and go over to the supermarket,

637
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,420
and I look around, and,

638
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,400
as far as I can tell, America's still there.

639
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,140
In fact, I live in a, in a, a really nice,

640
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,220
nice neighborhood.

641
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,800
It's a middle class neighborhood,

642
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,740
and it's a mixed neighborhood.

643
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,080
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

644
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,640
Strangely enough, everybody gets along.

645
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,220
There's, uh, a lot of, uh, black Christians

646
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,080
who are pretty liberal, but they probably don't like

647
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,120
the gay marriage thing.

648
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,560
But they are very hardworking,

649
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,960
and their yards are usually better than mine,

650
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,720
a lot better.

651
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,000
I don't like to generalize about anybody.

652
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,960
There's, uh, all kinds of other weird religious cults,

653
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,520
Hasidic Jews, who have a big presence.

654
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,240
A lot of artists and weirdos,

655
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,480
a lot of gay couples.

656
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,880
It's an interesting, it's almost like some place in New York,

657
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,880
but if anything, more, more integrated.

658
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,680
I'm sorry, but everybody gets along just fine.

659
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,380
I haven't seen America destroyed yet,

660
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,560
except on the back of pickup trucks,

661
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,860
where they spell, America has been destroyed,

662
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,120
and they spell destroyed with an M.

663
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,880
It's got an I in it.

664
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,240
So, yeah, some parts of America have certainly been destroyed.

665
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,700
I'm, as a subgenius and a weirdo,

666
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,220
I actually have gotten to where I enjoy being in the minority.

667
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,420
I get the creeps when I, uh, well, I never,

668
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,560
this never happens anymore.

669
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,540
I used to have to go with my former relatives

670
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,380
and hang out at the North Dallas Country Club.

671
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,880
I felt like a vampire in church there.

672
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,760
I've been, I've spent, by, partly by choice and partly by luck,

673
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:51,380
I've spent a lot of time being the only white guy in the room

674
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,500
or the neighborhood or the trailer court or the town.

675
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,780
Spent a lot of time being the only non-Jewish guy in the room,

676
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,920
the only straight guy in the room,

677
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,120
the only subgenius atheist skeptic in the room.

678
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,100
And I, I love it. It's great.

679
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,820
I get exposed to new stuff.

680
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,140
No one has ever beat me up except my fellow wasps.

681
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,220
And that was for having long hair.

682
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,720
Can you believe that?

683
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,780
In the 1970s, my buddy and I, in high school,

684
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,620
just after high school, we went to a park to drink our wine,

685
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,920
our underage wine.

686
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,840
And these two big football player looking jocks walked up,

687
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,920
and this was at night in the dark,

688
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,060
and started making small talk and we offered them some wine.

689
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,120
And suddenly I was on the ground being kicked.

690
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,120
And I was like,

691
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,380
what, what, what, why are you doing this?

692
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,600
And they go, and I quote,

693
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,280
because we're rednecks, you hippie.

694
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,320
So I guess they were doing their job and I was doing my job.

695
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,140
But that was 40 something years ago.

696
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,340
You'd think they'd have learned by now,

697
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,140
but apparently they haven't.

698
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,880
So, so I'm glad to be at a place like Starwood

699
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,800
where you get a little bit of everybody,

700
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,540
all, nobody's butt hurt because some, you know,

701
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:24,240
well actually, I like to think there's a certain contingent of pagans,

702
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,400
let's call them the Fundy pagans.

703
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,120
They don't like the Church of the Subgenius

704
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,580
because we poke fun at and trivialize serious issues.

705
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,820
And it's true, we do.

706
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,740
That's not all we do.

707
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,340
We actually have a pretty nice support group.

708
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:40,860
If you get into the church, you get a little bit of support.

709
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,120
It's a social circle.

710
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,680
I never expected that to happen,

711
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,840
but it's a pretty strong one.

712
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,300
Anyway, why not both?

713
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,280
That's my new philosophy on just about everything.

714
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,520
Bob used to say, he's got a lot of great sayings,

715
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,820
too much is always better than not enough.

716
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,320
Why not both?

717
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,740
Now wait, that may not make much sense.

718
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,540
But remember eight years ago

719
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,240
when Obama ran for president, his slogan was,

720
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,380
Yes, we can!

721
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,920
You know, that was, how optimistic can you get?

722
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,940
It's only three words.

723
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,820
Yes, we can!

724
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,540
Can we overcome poverty?

725
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,120
Yes, we can!

726
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,680
Can we stay out of foreign wars?

727
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,440
Yes, we can!

728
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,020
Well, turns out some of these things are trickier than,

729
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,260
but it sounded good.

730
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,440
Now, now we've got the clown car.

731
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,040
Now, I've got a lot of,

732
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,140
if I was going to hold it against somebody

733
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,140
because they were conservative,

734
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,980
I wouldn't have much family

735
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,760
and I'd lose a lot of good friends.

736
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,940
But sometimes I think maybe their slogan is,

737
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,460
No, you can't!

738
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,300
So we have on the one hand,

739
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,300
Yes, we can!

740
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,920
No, you can't!

741
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,460
Yes, we can!

742
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,880
No, you can't!

743
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,060
Why not both?

744
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,480
Why not both?

745
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,020
If, okay, yes, we can!

746
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,020


747
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,020


748
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,620
We can marry our same-sex partner or whatever.

749
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,840
And you can't.

750
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,620
If you don't want to, then you can't.

751
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,060
If we want the choice of having an abortion,

752
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:22,960
yes, we can.

753
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,320
If you don't want that choice, then good.

754
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,440
No, you can't.

755
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,300
But you can, you know, live and let live.

756
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:30,900
Jesus.

757
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,520
Or Bob.

758
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,400
Whatever.

759
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,360
Hey, River's Day, I've got a funny joke for you.

760
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,560
From now on, instead of saying God damn it,

761
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,740
say Bob damn it!

762
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,780
Oh, I've got another one.

763
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,380
Bob spelled backwards is still Bob!

764
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,800
You can use that one for free.

765
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,620
Third one.

766
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,100
Let's make a Bob tarot card set.

767
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,560
Okay, now you know which ones not to suggest to me

768
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,720
because they've all been done.

769
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,740
Now, we've only got,

770
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,540
I wanted to do a question and answer thing.

771
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,200
Okay.

772
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,000
And I will.

773
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,680
But first, it seems, I haven't done a short-duration

774
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,340
mass marriage in a long time.

775
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:21,700
Now, I know that some of y'all, probably kind of horny,

776
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,060
came to the hippie festival and there's,

777
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:28,320
they talk big, they talk big licentious talk now,

778
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:28,760
don't they?

779
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:33,600
But it's been a long time since I've had to step over

780
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,120
fornicating couples in the dark.

781
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,180
Although I hope to.

782
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,480
Later on.

783
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,540
You just, used to just stumble over them.

784
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,040
The advent of cell phones with cameras,

785
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,160
I think it kind of cramped the style.

786
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,420
And that's understandable.

787
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,820
But, on the other hand, some of you met somebody

788
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,660
and you're, or some little small animal maybe,

789
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,980
I don't know, that you're kind of, you know,

790
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,160
mutually attracted, but you got a few hang-ups.

791
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,540
You know, you grew up in, I don't know, any church,

792
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,920
and you're supposed to be married,

793
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,560
and you're not supposed to just fornicate like in that song.

794
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,500
There's all kinds of stuff you're supposed to not do.

795
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,900
But, if you're married, it's okay.

796
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:25,920
I'm a preacher.

797
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,220
Let's all get married!

798
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,180
Then there's no stigma attached, okay?

799
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:37,840
So, dearly beloveds, for years, jealous associates,

800
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,140
enemies.

801
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,080
I'm not going to stand any hidden cameras.

802
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,040
Do you, insert name here, swear to tell the truth,

803
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,080
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, say yes!

804
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:51,280
And let us decide that this period of sanctified coupling

805
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,700
shall last, well, the bonfire's tonight.

806
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,420
Probably everybody's going to be heading out by tomorrow.

807
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,480
So, 24 hours, sounds good.

808
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,560
This will be a standard 24-hour subgenius short-duration mass marriage.

809
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,620
If Reverend Sun Young Moon can do it, we can too.

810
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,040
Although, those usually didn't work out real well.

811
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,580
Dearly beloveds, we are gathered here today in the presence of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

812
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,400
whatever form he may choose to take.

813
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,360
It is often a role of duct tape, by the way.

814
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,160
And, insert other deity names here,

815
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,260
and that list could go on quite a long ways in this campground.

816
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,920
We'll even allow the flying spaghetti monster.

817
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,240
That's big of us, isn't it?

818
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,420
Okay.

819
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,140
In the meantime,

820
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:41,280
we're going to be in the presence of all these invisible monsters

821
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,080
to join these men and these women,

822
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:49,260
and possibly their pets, wallets, car keys, and so forth,

823
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,920
in a temporary, but no less virtuous, bondage of holy matrimony,

824
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,500
for better or for worse, but praise Bob, not for long!

825
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,600
Do you feel the spirit?

826
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,340
Everybody say, praise Bob!

827
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,840
Praise Bob!

828
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,940
Now, put your hands on each other.

829
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,840
This is embarrassing.

830
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,860
Oberon's practiced at that.

831
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,300
I know.

832
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,240
He's the master.

833
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,940
I don't need to preach to Oberon Gazelle.

834
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:16,640
Okay.

835
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,800
Now, this is a bond of sub-holy wedlock,

836
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,520
so no matter what physical position these beloveds may take,

837
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,640
in the next 24 hours,

838
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,060
their moral standing shall remain upright!

839
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,000
And if there are any jealous losers here who feel these men, women, and men,

840
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,920
and women, and women, and car keys, and so forth,

841
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,860
should not be joined temporarily, even for 24 hours,

842
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:39,740
shut up!

843
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,220
Put your hands on each other, hold tight,

844
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,680
do you, insert name here,

845
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:50,460
take this other entity, or all these other entities, insert names here,

846
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:54,460
to be your lawfully wedded spouse, in short duration sub-genius matrimony,

847
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:59,520
to have, and to hold, in fact, to do just about anything you can think of,

848
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:05,240
with, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in kinkiness,

849
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,280
through any hardship or disaster, blah, blah, blah,

850
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,480
the next 24 hours, for whatever sick and twisted,

851
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,380
but no less blessed reasons, say, I do!

852
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,620
I do!

853
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,960
Now shake on it and say, it's a deal!

854
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,560
It's a deal!

855
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:29,220
Now see, some of these smarty pants pretend that I don't mean handshake, okay?

856
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,860
Oh, and if you don't have a ring, there's always the sacred temple of Devo,

857
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,160
where you make a circle here, and a finger here,

858
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,960
and, uh, it's a, we take this ring as a symbol of the holy estate of marriage,

859
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,960
and the shackles, the veritable handcuffs of wedlock,

860
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,220
as well as the pole going deep into the hole repeatedly,

861
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,440
penis fuck pussy,

862
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,280
and, uh, by the authority invested in me by J.R. Bob Dobbs,

863
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,300
and in defiance of the laws of the state, and of nature itself,

864
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,840
I pronounce you all, man and wife, or man and man,

865
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,560
or husband and husband, or wife and wife, or thing and thing,

866
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,080
uh, for the next 24 hours,

867
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:15,080
you must now kiss each other, or you make a mockery of the sacred institution of marriage,

868
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,540
ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

869
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,740
it is done, amen, and a...

870
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,700
women.

871
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,740
Praise Bob.

872
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,120
Now seriously, I want to see you all consummating that stuff.

873
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,660
You can do it alone if you want,

874
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:35,640
that's no problem.

875
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,360
The, uh, we have a list of sins in one of our books,

876
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,340
it's like 200 sins that you never heard of,

877
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,420
that no one has ever tried.

878
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,180
Everything else, you know, we're not interested.

879
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,300
Been there, done that.

880
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,360
Bob doesn't care.

881
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:56,600
He's not here to forgive your sins,

882
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,260
because he doesn't give a hoot about your half-assed sins.

883
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,520
He brings not forgiveness, but an excuse.

884
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,080
An excuse is all you need.

885
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,420
Praise that old Bob.

886
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,900
And it so happens that when you become an ordained minister

887
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:19,380
by purchasing the thick kit over there for $35 at the sales table,

888
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,440
which comes with a decoder pen, by the way,

889
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:29,820
it also has a beautiful, frameable, all-purpose, all-inclusive, divine excuse.

890
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,960
Lawyers love that one.

891
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,080
And a doctorate of the forbidden sciences.

892
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,240
So you can put that up on your wall,

893
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,720
and you're an expert.

894
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,500
There you go.

895
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,640
I, did, did I mention that that stuff is available at the subgenius sales table?

896
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:53,940
Right over there, that long stretch of attractively packaged t-shirts,

897
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:58,000
one of a kind, and copies of book of the subgenius.

898
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,720
Not sold in any stores, and not stored in any souls.

899
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:11,020
And now I have a prayer by our friend Ride Theory

900
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,000
about the face of Bob.

901
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,120
His fizz is risen.

902
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,020
Oh, okay, good.

903
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,640
Oh my God, it keeps changing, changes a lot.

904
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:28,720
Yea, though ye walk through the uncanny valley of the half-toned salesman,

905
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,020
speak and see and hear no evil.

906
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,200
For the new Bob is with you.

907
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,460
His odd and changed puss discomforts thee.

908
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:43,200
He preparest a web page before thy frenemies.

909
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,020
Milk flows from thy nose.

910
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,220
Thy cup is spit taken.

911
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,220
Goodness and mercy shall follow thee all the days of thy life,

912
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:58,860
and you shall dwell on this JPEG forever and ever.

913
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,000
Thank you.

914
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,920
Thank you, Ride Theory.

915
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:04,800
That's so poetical.

916
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:11,100
And I will close, before we do the Q&A, with a short story written by a computer.

917
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:12,740
Honestly.

918
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,600
There's a thing called plotgenerator.com.

919
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:21,780
And you go to this website and just punch in some words at random.

920
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,800
And I did.

921
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:28,640
And I came up with, it came up with this very short story called

922
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,800
Hippie Filled Wisteria.

923
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,360
That is the title picked by the computer.

924
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,280
A short story by Gray Harryhausen.

925
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:46,340
Suzy the floozy had always loved hippie filled wisteria with its curvy, clever chem toilets.

926
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,260
It was a place where she felt fropped.

927
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:54,640
She was a topless, irrepressible guru pee drinker,

928
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,780
with brobding nagging breastises,

929
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,860
and knobby penises.

930
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,820
Her friends saw her as a homely, happy hooker with a heart of gold.

931
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:10,700
Once, she even jumped into a river and saved a little dog named Snuckles.

932
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,240
That's the sort of woman she was.

933
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:19,200
Suzy walked over to the window and reflected on her fropped, redolent surroundings.

934
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:24,180
The smoky air teased like a gigging prairie squid.

935
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,040
Then she saw something in the distance,

936
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,020
or rather someone.

937
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,620
It was the figure of Old Sequa.

938
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:39,140
Old Sequa was a schizophrenic testudine with appetizing breastises and indescribable penises.

939
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:46,760
Now, Old Sequa is actually the giant prehistoric snapping turtle that lives in the pond down the road there.

940
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,500
You know the part that's roped off?

941
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:52,000
Well, nobody dares go in that pond for the most part,

942
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,240
but the part that's roped off is bottomless.

943
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,320
And yet,

944
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,380
at the bottom,

945
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,120
there dwells Old Sequa.

946
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,340
The Indians around here knew him.

947
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,500
That's why they built that turtle mound to appease him.

948
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,020
And every year,

949
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:12,220
Old Sequa takes one subgenius and one pagan.

950
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,740
And usually nobody misses him.

951
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,180
Anyway, on with the story.

952
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,280
Suzy gulped.

953
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,760
She was not prepared for Old Sequa.

954
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,760
As Suzy stepped outside and Old Sequa came closer,

955
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,300
she could see the giant,

956
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,620
joyous glint in his eye.

957
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:34,760
Old Sequa gazed with the affection of 9925 paranoid,

958
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,180
greasy,

959
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,120
great,

960
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,280
jaggies.

961
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,440
That's a monster hunter character.

962
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,080
He said in hushed tones,

963
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,560
I love you and I want sex.

964
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:53,440
Suzy looked back even more horny and still fingering the slimy pipe.

965
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,860
Old Sequa,

966
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,300
I like reptiles,

967
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,760
but you're a little old for me,

968
00:52:58,860 --> 00:52:59,340
she replied.

969
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,360
They looked at each other with stoned feelings,

970
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,940
like two lively late lizards gagging at a very over sexed X day,

971
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:14,760
which had anti music playing in the background and two hungry uncles ramming to the beat.

972
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:20,800
Suzy regarded Old Sequa's appetizing breastises and indescribable penises.

973
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,400
I feel the same way,

974
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,440
revealed Suzy with a delighted grin.

975
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:25,840
Old Sequa looked at him.

976
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,640
He looked in slackened,

977
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:33,000
his emotions blushing like a pongee putrid pea suitor shooter.

978
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:39,600
Then Old Sequa came inside for a nice drink of Guru P at hippie filled wisteria.

979
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,240
The end.

980
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,280
Thank you to the computer that wrote that touching,

981
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,860
touching fairy tale.

982
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,420
I could just listen to that overwhelming applause.

983
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,020
What a talented computer that was.

984
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:53,700
Okay,

985
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,080
so now it is.

986
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:59,560
So we've got about 15 minutes for questions and answers,

987
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,460
which is actually my favorite part,

988
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,360
except nobody ever has a question.

989
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,380
Because you're too lazy.

990
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,200
Now come on,

991
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,100
come up with a damn question.

992
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:17,160
Why is the question that followed Timothy Leary's phrase question authority?

993
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,260
That's your cue to say why?

994
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,620
Okay,

995
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:22,360
just so you know,

996
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,220
just in advance.

997
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:23,980
Now,

998
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,940
who's the little girl back there with the spider crawling over her eye?

999
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,160
You're going to have to come down.

1000
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,020
I can't hear anything.

1001
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,120
Do you have a question?

1002
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,400
Yes,

1003
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:34,760
I do.

1004
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,660
Let's try it.

1005
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:37,620
Okay.

1006
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:45,040
What is the relationship between the church of the subgenius and the church of the flying spaghetti monster?

1007
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:45,740
Oh,

1008
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,740
what is the relationship?

1009
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,220
The church of the subgenius and the flying,

1010
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,540
the church of the flying spaghetti monster?

1011
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,040
Well,

1012
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,300
you've heard the jokes about the traveling salesman.

1013
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,100
Those were based on a real man,

1014
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,820
J.R. Bob dogs.

1015
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:06,480
And Bob did a lot of traveling and there were a lot of farmers daughters he left knocked up.

1016
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,800
And that's not the only species Bob left knocked up.

1017
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,400
Bob could knock up squamous,

1018
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,080
formless,

1019
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:17,720
hideous,

1020
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,980
indescribable creatures from between the dimensions.

1021
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:25,320
Bob could hump on Cthulhu.

1022
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:33,580
And so therefore the answer to your question is the flying spaghetti monster is Bob Dobbs bastard child.

1023
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,440
Simple as that.

1024
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:37,740
On the other hand,

1025
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:47,020
we might owe a bit of a tip of the trepidated skull to the discordians who came before us and before them,

1026
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,540
those two wise acres,

1027
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:54,980
who wrote the pamphlets that were attributed to Christian Rosenkranz,

1028
00:55:55,220 --> 00:56:00,680
which were actually just satires that people took seriously and grew into the Rosicrucians,

1029
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,380
the Theosophists and the whole new age.

1030
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:12,860
So guess what happens when you make up a funny religious character and make little pamphlets about it that look just like the real thing.

1031
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,840
If we could keep a straight face,

1032
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,780
we'd be like Scientology.

1033
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,660
And I wouldn't be here.

1034
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,420
Now what was that?

1035
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,780
I couldn't get that.

1036
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,100
Somebody's going to have to translate.

1037
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,860
Oh, does he like his pasta with cream sauce?

1038
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,240
Bob?

1039
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,780
I don't know,

1040
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,060
but I can tell you this.

1041
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:42,180
He does not like Cincinnati chili.

1042
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:43,760
No, sir.

1043
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,560
No, sir.

1044
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,260
And if you ask me,

1045
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:56,080
the Flying Spaghetti Monster is to the Church of the Subgenius what Cincinnati chili is to good old down home Wolf Brand chili.

1046
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,400
I'm a little prejudiced because I originally came from Texas,

1047
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:04,160
but you may notice me not moving back there.

1048
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,300
Or six months later,

1049
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:12,580
you might notice me moving back there after all,

1050
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:13,960
at least during the winters.

1051
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,080
In fact,

1052
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,240
this show was edited in my new office.

1053
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:22,400
In the 7th Mega Fist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius at the big house,

1054
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:23,620
Stang Ranch,

1055
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,640
Stangsville,

1056
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,100
Texas.

1057
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:29,060
And we're not sure exactly when we'll be ready to drive back to Cleveland.

1058
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,380
But on with the Starwood Festival Q&A.

1059
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,960
Why not broth?

1060
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,860
Why not broth?

1061
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,240
For the Flying Spaghetti Monster thing.

1062
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,940
Why not bowls?

1063
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:42,680
Why not broth?

1064
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:42,900
Well,

1065
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,640
we're getting off into some complicated doctrinal issues here.

1066
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,320
You'd probably have to take those up with a more highly placed priest than me.

1067
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,240
Next time you see Philo,

1068
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:53,900
no, I know,

1069
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,080
ask Dr. Howell.

1070
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,380
Call the Ask Dr. Howell Show.

1071
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:58,720
AskDrHowell.com.

1072
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,740
He's got an answer for everything.

1073
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,300
Mmm.

1074
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:03,720
Broth.

1075
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,220
I don't know,

1076
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:05,600
bruh.

1077
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,740
I'd like to make broth out of some of those bruhs.

1078
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,940
I'm so old,

1079
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:15,640
I still say man instead of dude or bro or bruh.

1080
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,240
Can't even keep up.

1081
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:24,100
Are the Yetis related to the Exists?

1082
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:27,560
Are the Yetis related to the Exists?

1083
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,360
Well, in a way, yes.

1084
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:31,920
Let us clarify.

1085
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,340
This man has obviously been reading and memorizing his pre-scriptures.

1086
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,680
And not everybody knows who the Exists are.

1087
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,080
That's our shorthand for the men from Planet X,

1088
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,400
which is just what the media will call these

1089
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,220
indescribable aliens.

1090
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,800
We think of them as flying saucers

1091
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,000
and creatures with bodies.

1092
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,660
It's not like that at all.

1093
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,260
We have to,

1094
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,020
if there's any saucers and stuff,

1095
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,520
it'll be because our minds are too puny

1096
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:05,460
to comprehend their actual four-dimensional appearance.

1097
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:10,320
And so they may appear as things we can understand.

1098
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,360
And those are the ones,

1099
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,180
those are Bob's alien friends.

1100
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,260
As opposed to, you know,

1101
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,380
the kind that makes saucers that crash,

1102
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:24,300
your Greys, your Venusians, your Arians, and so forth.

1103
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,780
Those are all half-fair.

1104
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,240
Most of them are just from our solar system.

1105
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,020
They don't know nothing.

1106
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,020
The Exists did come to the planet Earth

1107
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:36,740
one fine spring day 80 million years ago

1108
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,720
during the Cretaceous era on a picnic.

1109
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,980
And they accidentally wiped out all the dinosaurs.

1110
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,480
And most species.

1111
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:51,180
But they did start a new life form,

1112
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,660
which, the Yetis.

1113
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,380
They created the Yetis in a test tube,

1114
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,300
you might say.

1115
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:00,900
And they were the perfect, perfect creature

1116
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,480
to inhabit the Earth.

1117
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:07,100
However, once the Yetis started to flourish and multiply,

1118
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,780
and you know, they walked around naked

1119
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,540
in the frozen north or in lava,

1120
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:17,860
because their minds were so advanced,

1121
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,720
they were all like yogis.

1122
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,440
They didn't even feel the cold.

1123
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:24,100
They could walk across hot coals and stuff

1124
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,220
and not be affected.

1125
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:29,400
They could grow as many dicks as they wanted,

1126
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,240
or whatever, you know, that kind of thing.

1127
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,200
But the Yetis made a terrible mistake.

1128
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,680
They decided they too would create life.

1129
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,440
And they set up a half-assed,

1130
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:43,800
half-assed lab,

1131
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,200
and created a terrible form of vermin

1132
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,840
that swarmed over the whole planet after that.

1133
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,940
They were called humans.

1134
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,100
And over the years,

1135
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,340
the Yetis, some Yetis,

1136
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,300
became degenerate.

1137
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,320
The other Yetis just disappeared.

1138
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,460
They're still around, but you'll never see them.

1139
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,220
So, the degenerate Yetis started to,

1140
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:11,440
well, they cohabitated with their pets, the humans,

1141
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,360
and eventually there was a half-breed race.

1142
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:18,100
Half Yeti, part Yeti, part human,

1143
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,340
more human than Yeti.

1144
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,000
And those are what we call

1145
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,300
the sons of Bob and Connie,

1146
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,860
the subgeniuses.

1147
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,500
Yes, the children of the Yeti.

1148
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:32,280
I got a letter once from a guy who said,

1149
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,060
you guys have this alien stuff all wrong.

1150
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,860
They're not arriving in 1998.

1151
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,400
They're arriving in 2011.

1152
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:40,740
Everybody knows that.

1153
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,720
But you're right about the Yetis,

1154
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,420
because one time I dropped acid,

1155
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,920
and I looked in the mirror,

1156
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,340
and I stared at my,

1157
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,420
don't, that's the,

1158
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:50,840
everybody knows better than to do that, right?

1159
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,920
He goes, I stared in the mirror,

1160
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:57,280
and I saw the face of the Yeti hair grow all over me,

1161
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,320
and I got my Yeti self shown through.

1162
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,060
So I know you guys aren't bullshitting about that.

1163
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,340
Eh, we get a lot of those.

1164
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,900
So, any other questions?

1165
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:10,340
Or,

1166
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,540
we have a question from the audience.

1167
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,020
How do you keep the price so low?

1168
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:15,340
We can't.

1169
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,220
The postage just went up.

1170
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:19,180
We're about to raise the price

1171
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,460
to account for postage.

1172
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,800
But you're here,

1173
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,900
and we don't have to mail it to you.

1174
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:27,560
So it's as if you're getting it for free almost.

1175
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:31,040
It's only $35 with no postage.

1176
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:31,840
And hey,

1177
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,820
if you don't tell the Ohio State,

1178
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,640
I won't tell them either.

1179
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:39,720
And I'll pay the sales tax later.

1180
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,320
How's that?

1181
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,680
I really do have to do that.

1182
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:47,100
I also have to renew the trademark

1183
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:51,340
on Bob's face and the word subgenius.

1184
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,120
Just to keep Walt Disney Company

1185
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,060
or somebody from screwing it up.

1186
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,460
If anybody's gonna screw it up more,

1187
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,240
it's us, damn it!

1188
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,880
And, yeah, so...

1189
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,740
Why not both?

1190
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,640
Why not both?

1191
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:10,860
That's it.

1192
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,420
So, um...

1193
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:14,980
Yeah.

1194
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:17,080
Why not both?

1195
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,200
I'm not sure that that applies to everything.

1196
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:24,840
Too much Everclear

1197
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,480
is always better than not enough to Everclear?

1198
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:27,900
No.

1199
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,080
Why not both?

1200
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:30,860
Maybe.

1201
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:32,820
So,

1202
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,160
any other questions?

1203
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,980
Why is it that they say

1204
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,400
you can't sell boobs without Bob?

1205
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:41,440
Oh.

1206
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,160
Why not both?

1207
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,200
Can't we sell both?

1208
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,760
I honestly don't know.

1209
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:53,200
Well, maybe we should cut it off at that.

1210
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,640
There's some great bands coming up tonight.

1211
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:58,480
And they require a lot of setup.

1212
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,220
And, um...

1213
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:02,260
I require a lot of slack.

1214
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,760
But, leaving

1215
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,800
positive feedback?

1216
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:36,180
the rehearsal for the complicated

1217
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:40,580
bonfire lighting, which they always changed no matter how we

1218
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:44,480
rehearsed it. So you never know what's going to happen down there.

1219
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:48,240
And I understand there's especially powerful explosives

1220
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,840
buried inside that giant pile of wood this time.

1221
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:56,000
So it ought to be tons of fun and we will definitely see you down there.

1222
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,240
And late at night, sometimes at Starwood,

1223
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,960
Bob appears.

1224
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:07,840
Now, to some people it's a bit of

1225
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,740
a letdown. He's a little bit long in the tooth

1226
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:14,360
these days, as you can imagine.

1227
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,540
And he's not as tall as you might think.

1228
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:24,020
And he seems not to be able to see or hear very well.

1229
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:28,240
So if you see Bob, be gentle

1230
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:28,980
with him.

1231
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:35,700
And don't just grab him and mount him and have your way with him like you want to.

1232
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,500
You kind of, you know, lube him up a bit.

1233
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,780
The poor old scutter, you know. He's been through a lot.

1234
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,940
And I guess that's it. I'm going to get off stage.

1235
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:49,160
Thank you all very much for... Oh, what, Princess Wee?

1236
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:55,980
Do you have any of the new Bob songs CDs that have just come out?

1237
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,020
No. Well, yes, I do, but they're all on the internet.

1238
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,280
It's been 10 years since we assembled

1239
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,520
Subgenius music, hymns.

1240
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:11,840
We have like 10 CD albums of those going back to

1241
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:16,180
the 90s, but we haven't assembled a new one in about

1242
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,600
10 years. And just recently we put together three new collections

1243
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:24,060
with, they're really great, and we don't have them for sale.

1244
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:28,280
Except online. If you go to subgenius.com

1245
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:30,140
there's a little link.

1246
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,820
There for our new albums. They're on bandcamp.com.

1247
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:38,040
And you can pay a dollar per song or $10 for album

1248
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:42,120
to download them. Nobody buys CDs. All they

1249
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:46,180
ever listen to is downloads anyway. But to tell the truth, you can

1250
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:50,040
actually hear them without downloading them. I don't know why we're even putting a price

1251
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,080
tag on them. I could copy them easy myself.

1252
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:57,820
But yeah, the old albums are there

1253
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,280
and they're...

1254
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,680
much more musical than I am.

1255
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,900
And probably a little better looking and

1256
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,200
don't take as long in the bathroom.

1257
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,920
So, thank you very much.

1258
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,660
Praise Bob!

1259
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,640
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1260
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,300
Question authority.

1261
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,520
Yeah! You learned something!

1262
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:29,600
And with that I ended the second of two Starwood shows from last July.

1263
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:33,280
We might play the first show which was very different in the future.

1264
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:41,580
Or you can attend the next Starwood which is held at Wisteria in Southern Ohio the week after our X-Day Festival.

1265
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:49,220
Just Google Starwoodfestival.com or look at the subgenius events page on subgenius.com.

1266
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:59,580
Or you can also learn about the Starwood Preview or Winter Star Ball happening on February 28th Sunday in Cleveland at the Beach Club.

1267
01:07:59,580 --> 01:07:59,580


1268
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:05,200
And you can also watch the show at the Westland Ballroom with Reverend Baby Bear doing the subgenius preaching part and emceeing.

1269
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:12,360
Because I'm still in Texas and besides she's louder and prettier as heard here.

1270
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:19,640
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.
