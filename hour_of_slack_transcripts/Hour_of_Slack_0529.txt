It's time for toast!
No, it's not it's time for the church of the subgenius friends
And what kind of a church is that you ask?
And I'm afraid that that answer is sort of in the eye of the beholder
It's in the church you see is the ultimate Rorschach test some look at it and see the devil some a fascist cult
Other says excuse me a snake oil rip up some see screwed up hit me. Oh
You are about to participate in a great adventure
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius
And remain with us for the next 30 million years
Yes, dear friends
And we're back we're back and oh how I wish I wish I really was back friends. Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry
I'm sorry. Um, I wish I was back on the air really in a radio station
Friends because we got kicked off the air here in Dallas. I had a show for for ten years here and
Oh, we were the wrong
ethnic group or something and they they you know, the subgenius is the
ultimate
minority and and you know, even the minorities hate minorities
Take the big the gorillas beating on the orangutan and the orangutans beating on the chimpanzee and the chimpanzees
beating on the gibbon and the gibbons whooping on the subgenius and
and
The nice thing about having a show
I think where you had to go to a stage?
And do it every week was that you had to do it every week. I hate this freedom stuff friends
I have the freedom to put together the show any time I want and
That's why we end up doing reruns a lot. Well, for instance, I've got to leave town
Tonight and I've got to get this show done in about one hour
so I'm gonna pretend I'm really on the air and just
I'm not gonna care about the mistakes I
did queue up a few tapes a few tapes, but we're just
Gonna we're gonna wing it on a wing and a prayer a prayer to Bob
But it's so it's kind of awkward to tell the truth pretending
There's a live audience pretending that you're really listening to to us
Preach the word of Bob right now because it makes me feel like I'm one of those little crazy militia guys
You know cooped up in his basement making tapes to send it and that's exactly what we're doing
I mean, there's 17 stations now
There have always been 17 stations it seems there
It's always 17 different stations that carry the hour of slack and we love those stations
but
But it just ain't the same having to do this militia style
because it reminds me of the militia guys and I they make me mad and
and it's not
Not for the reasons it may they make me mad because they're so naive about it. It's like oh, they've made this great discovery
There's a conspiracy that's out to get the little guy
Well, duh, some of us figured that out in the 60s
I guess it just took the rednecks of but what what twenty year how many years has been thirty years longer?
I don't hardly even remember
Citizens at Texas here from whence I speak is really full of
citizens common law courts a bunch of poe buckers and ne'er-do-wells who have declared the United States illegal
They haven't caught on that the conspiracy won hundreds of years ago and it's just playing cat's-eye
And mouse with them, you know, why don't they just put a big target on their faces and Walker and it's just an ego thing
for him, you know, they they
I'm gonna fight the man with my shotgun
You can't give me a break. It's I mean I like where they're coming from. But like we say about Charlie Manson
he had some good ideas, but they were on the wrong scale and
The church have I said this before on this show? The church should declare itself a sovereign nation. The Vatican did it, you know?
I mean we can demand that the UN and the Geneva conference
recognized the sovereign state of mind of the Church of the subgenius and the authority of J.R
Bob Dobbs high he popped his Royal Highness King Philo and Prime Minister Ivan stang yours truly
Been stanging the fur flung and nushin gingers out and the commander of the Armed Forces shall be G Gordon Gordon and the Son of God
The fightin Jesus shall do something and and they shall be accorded the same rights privileges as any heads of

from all outer worlds
The right to declare war as well. We'll do all that stuff first and then we'll buy the land later
For I am NOT an animal I am NOT a man
I am a Yeti a descendant of the pygmy Yeti of the British Isles. Yes
Something like that friends. I'm not running music in the back
ground right now because
Well just because because that's what kind of a show this is we will be playing lots of music
I've got some great stuff here and some some wonderful rants. We got to Pope David and Myers
rant from New York and and
But I've had to tell you some news here before we proceed any further
This is just clipped out of the Dallas Morning News news around, Texas and the Southwest now get this

Cool. Cool, man.
Pretty good mix there.
I've got this CD here that Negative Land sent to us and also distributes.
Negative Land, yes, is a distributor of this record called Head and Leg.
Oh, I'm sorry, a CD.
My kids really get after me for using that word record.
Hell, it's round and flat and it spins and sounds come off of it.
Just like some people's mouths.
Anyway, yeah, it's Head and Leg.
Spoken words, sound collage, music, and ambient noises,
which of course sounds real corny and stupid at first,
but it's a wonderful CD.
You'll probably hardly be able to find it anywhere.
You can write to Head and Leg.
At 90 Highland Avenue, Somerville, Massachusetts, 02143.
Now, see, if I didn't give you time to write that down,
what you can do is just take your true speech button
and pull that slider back and just play it again.
If you're listening over the internet.
We are, our internet broadcast is working better and better all the time.
You can now hear, oh, God, there's probably about a dozen hour slack shows that are on at any given,
any time of day, anywhere in the world, if you've got a decent, you know, sound card or something like that.
I know that's a lot to ask.
And it sounds horrible, by the way.
It sounds quite bad, which is one reason I'm not using background music right now.
I'm starting to cater to those, to the internet geeks,
because you internet geeks out there, there's more of you than there are listening to the broadcast, I think.
But let's see what else we have coming.
What is that tape doing in the background?
Hey, I kind of like that.
Nenslow has such wonderful choice of music, hate and so forth.
And now, where were we?
Where were we, dear friends?
Oh, I have one more.
No, I'll read it later.
I'll read it later.
Where is that thing I was about rightly fixing to play?
Here it is.
Okay.
Dr. Bizarro.
We'll continue with Dr.
Bizarro's Rock Opera.
The Big Machine.
Thank you.
Wow, I'm all nervous.
Trying my best.
Finally, we have Dr. Bizarro's Rock Opera.
Anything to metal, that's no, nothing to drank, nothing to beer.

earth to them and we'll leave and the pinks will burn and die and all that stuff. But,
uh, what was I getting to? Oh, um, you know, but in the meantime, what we can, what we,
you know, some, some occasionally some, uh, militia type will say, well, you guys are
just being silly. You're just, you're trivializing these important, uh, things. And, and, uh,
all we're trying to do is keep some, but keep subgeniuses from killing themselves.
Somewhere out there is some kid on the verge of just, you know, throwing it all away, giving
up and kid, you're not alone. Don't kill yourself yet. Go on to invent that cure for
kid. If you can just hang in there for a little while longer, you'll probably end up, uh,
you know, becoming the first, uh, good leader in history.
Or, or, um, you know, regular damn, uh, Martin Luther Dobbs or, or Louis Pasteur or something
like that. There is hope there, there is hope. And to prove it, here is some more Lou
Duchesne with his sympho flatulation. I hope.
This is the place to be. Fun living is the life for me.
Far and wide. Gee, Manhattan, just give me that countryside. Man. Now see, a subgenius
can, uh, you can take away, you can throw them in jail, take away their, um, electric
guitars and their radio equipment and so forth, but they've still got their armpit.
Hello friends and welcome. The sermon tonight is entitled, The Man Who Made Me a Man.
And I'm here to tell you that the subgenius is the one who made the world the deal with
Dobbs. Because the church of the subgenius is unlike any other religion, my friends.
It's not just a faith. It's a promise. A binding contract between you and the subgenius
foundation. Most religions give you nothing but assurances. You're supposed to trust them,
have faith in them, and pray. And I'm here to tell you that the subgenius is the one

who made me a man. I don't know if I'm lying to you, man, but it's a fact. Jamal, I see
you're right. Unfortunately, the word con means more than just conspiracy. It's slang
for confidence. Now confidence man, for those of you who haven't heard, is a man who lies
for a living. An actor who gains people's trust and then rips them off. Can you spot
a con artist by their appearance? Of course not. You identify them by their appearance.
by their reputation.
And the same holds true with religions, my friends.
The best way to spot the fakes
is to see how they treated their previous customers.
Take, for example, oh, Islam.
Muhammad promised to lead his followers
into what he called enlightenment.
He's had over a thousand years to do it,
but so far things are still pretty backward over there.
Now, they do have some interesting customs, all right,
but stoning people to death for having affairs
or cutting off their hands for thievery
isn't exactly what I call progressive.
Then, of course, there's the Jews.
Yahweh promised he would protect the Jews
and let them rule Israel forever in perpetuity.
That means without interruption.
But it didn't happen, my friends.
In the last millennium,
the Jews have ruled Israel for about 50 years.
And they only got that opportunity
out of sympathy from the Holocaust.
Now, me, I like to give gods the benefit of the doubt.
But if the Holocaust is what their god considers protection,
oh, I'd hate to see persecution.
And then, of course, there's the Christians.
God promised to send Jesus back to Earth
and reclaim the world.
The apostles expected that to mean in their lifetime.
When they started dying,
the date was moved back to when the very last apostle died.
When the last one croaked,
the church decided Jesus would return in exactly 100 years.
They've been moving the date back for centuries ever since.
Talk about patience.
When are these people going to realize they've been stood up?
The mainstream religions are filled with unfulfilled promises.
They just don't have any credibility.
According to the Bible, Old and New Testament,
God performed miracles for all to see,
not just subtle hints either,
but dramatic displays of power,
like bread falling from the sky
or the sea splitting in twain,
special effects that Steven Spielberg would be proud of.
But that hasn't happened for a long, long time.
It stopped long ago.
Why?
Did God get tired of Earth and move on?
Did he grow old and die?
Or perhaps, just perhaps,
it never happened in the first place.
It was all gossip that got exaggerated over time,
like Paul Bunyan and Kris Kringle.
Then somebody wrote it down,
and the next thing you know,
people are watching the skies for giant lumberjacks,
big blue oxes, or floating fat men with flying reindeer.
No one can prove these legends or lies
any more than they can prove a religion is false,
because you can't prove a negative.
But if you compare the promises,
from the promises made to the promises kept,
you have all the evidence you need
to make an intelligent decision.
The Bible says,
if they lie about the small things,
then assume they lie about the big things.
I say amen to that.
And I also say,
it takes one to know one,
because unlike the rip-off religions,
we, the subgenie, keep our promises.
We give a written warranty
that guarantees eternal salvation
or triple your money back.
Do the other religions give written guarantees?
Hell no.
They get bent out of shape
if you so much as ask too many questions.
Why, the other day,
I told a Christian about our money-back guarantee,
and his eyes grew real big,
and he said,
aha, you say it's a guarantee,
but you only offer it because you know it,
that if someone's dead,
they won't be able to come back and claim it.
Not so, I explained,
because if we're wrong and Christianity is right,
then all the Christians will return to life
on Judgment Day and demand payment.
He got all miffed and retorted,
Christians don't pay money for salvation.
If they did, they wouldn't be Christian.
I said, well, we wouldn't know about that,
because unlike your religion,
ours doesn't discriminate
based on race, sex, or religious preference.
They can be pink so long as their money is green.
And that shut him up real quick,
because only Bob's church
can afford to make guarantees like that,
since we know we're right.
We don't have to worry about 2,000 years
of dead Christians coming back for their money,
because we're equally certain
not only that our religion is right,
but that their religion is bogus.
Ours may not be as exciting a denomination
as the fantasy faiths.
We don't have towers of flame
or plagues of locusts.
Our God hasn't turned on us
or turned anyone into salt.
But what do these stories prove anyway?
Reality is always less exciting than fiction.
Everybody knows that.
Our miracles aren't as legendary as their miracles,
but our miracles happen.
And they happen this century, this decade,
to you and your generation,
not 2,000 years ago to a bunch of dead foreigners.
Why would you believe them over us?
We say trust no one until you see for yourself.
Come July 5th, 1998,
we're either going to put up or shut up.
Forget 20 centuries of,
he's coming, no, really, we mean it this time.
That's poop for pinheads.
We deliver results you can judge before you die.
We'll start you off with the miracle of slack
on a daily basis, no expertise required.
You don't have to be Muhammad or Moses
or Mary Madeline, for that matter.
Just be yourself
and reject the conspiracy way of doing business.
You'll get results you can taste, touch, see, smell, and hear.
So don't be conned by the con.
Make that deal with Dobbs today
and stop wasting your money on religions
with a proven track record of failure and disappointment.
Invest, invest your faith
in a religion that gives you a receipt,
a receipt, a money-back guarantee.
Because, my friends,
if your soul isn't worth a written warranty,
then what the hell is?
Herein is the word of Bob.
Praise Bob! Amen!
Oh, and praise Father Joe Mama,
also known as Papa Joe Mama,
the, oh, what a great preacher.
And, friends, you can probably,
I believe that you will be able to,
those who can get there,
to the Brushwood Folklore Center,
two events in July,
the X Day,
see, friends, we're practicing for salvation.
And Father Joe Mama knows from whence he speaketh,
because he just recently repented,
quit his job,
and slacked off.
Praise Bob!
And now the government is paying him
just as much not to work.
But, yes, on July 5th of every year from now on,
July 5th this year,
actually it's the 5th through the 7th,
we are holding the X Day drill
at Brushwood Folklore Center,
big campground in Sherman, New York.
And the only way you can get more information on that
is to write for the information from us here.
And I'm about to give the sacred address
of the church, of the subgenius,
and that is just write to Bob, friends,
just write to old Bob at
postofficebox1403.
That's the address.
Box140306,
Dallas, Texas,
75214.
Box140306,

Thank you.
All types of these subgenii have the yearning for slack,
frop,
all the subgenius products.
They have the Revelation X book,
the original Bob book,
the Bob comic books.
Every morning they get up
and they drink out of their Bob mug.
They got their frop pipe full of frop.
They got every little thing.
Their pad is a virtual slack shrine.
They even got the giant velvet Bob
right in the middle with all their Bob goodies.
They even have all the subgenius doctor bands,
more than I can even list.
Of course OBE, Kings of Feedback,
and the classics like Brother Cleave.
Hail Brother Cleave.
And doctors for Bob,
the swinging love corpses,
and you know, like Devo,
Negative Lance,







and of course my favorite doctor of all times,
Jimi Hendrix.
And hey, these buy me Bobs even bought him a four track
and a cheesy little Casio sampler and a dumpy little guitar,
and they're making doctor music for Bob.
Our right Reverend Ivan Stang even played their sacred
heap of slack tape on the Hour of Slack.
That's another thing.
I don't want to get into them,
but where is the Hour of Slack in Boston?
The closest thing we have is Dad Townsend in Maine.
We need the Hour of Slack in Boston.
That's a whole other rant though.
I got distracted.
Just kill me.
Please kill me.
And of course these buy me Bobs are on the internet.
Posting the alt slack every day,
some kind of babble slack shit,
who knows what, man.
They got him a web site.
They got a web page with little Bob pictures all over the place
and they're linked to the almighty sub slack of Slack.
What is that sub site of Slack?
But comes X Day,
they're going to be at some fashion revival on X Day Eve
moving around in all their fashion bobs.
Got a different t-shirt for every day.
They'll be humming the song.
Their description of theirfang has selenity crazy

You're not cured yet.
What? Tape ran out. Friends, that was Bill T. Miller, of course, live. It was a live show,
a strange kind of live preaching. Friends, Bill Miller has the most doctored-up keyboard I ever
saw in my life. He just had this long keyboard in front of him. Every single key had some different
horrible little pertinent bit of a rant there. Oh, you can indeed get tapes. Bill Miller's CD,
The Outband Experience and Kings of Feedback CD,
the best way to get information about that is to write, no, to call 1-617-LICK-O-B-E,
L-I-C-K-O-B-E, 1-617-LICK-O-B-E. Do it now. Seriously, his studio stuff is just amazing.
He's a professional studio subgenius. All right, okay, I'm halfway through the show,
and we're going to plunge ahead, but I don't have any
urgency.
I don't have any earthly idea of what it was that I was going to play next. There's so much
material. I'll tell you what, though, while we're thinking about addresses and things,
let me give you our new email address for the church, church headquarters here,
Hour of Slack, Subgenius Foundation. You can email us at slack at metronet.com. That's slack
at metronet.com. Metronet is spelled about the way you pronounce it.
I'll put the full name of the person who sent that email out, and we'll send him a request.
The address is surscrji.com. That's surscrji.com, and I've made a very detailed list of every埱

And once again, friends, subgenius does not have an O in it.
Speaking of legal documents, well, there's the legal...
I could play the legal documents guy. Where is he?
Here's the... Oh, man, I love the legal...
Let's see what the legal documents guy's phone message was this week.
It says in the paper you have the ability to check right away
to see if a guy's education process was wrong.
It says you have the ability to improve a guy's education process.
You have, like, the equivalent of a ship or a stage,
and you're this, and you're this group of guys, and that.
So it's all explained in the paper.
Now, it says in the paper, back all the way to the late 70s,
that I'm allowed to...
to carry the news, I'm allowed to read the news,
to receive the news, to carry the mail.
In fact, I'm the guy in the paper that Northeast Ohio
is under restrictions that my brother and I are the only guys
allowed to smoke a cigarette.
And because of places of strange behavior,
they're terminally jealous.
Yes, sir, I'm the guy with the legal notice in advance in the paper.
You've got permission to serve.
And so I got a story.
I talked about who's allowed to carry the mail around Euclid,
and they're only allowed to carry it since my hearings
until they serve what guys.
And until we lift restrictions,
this place has been charged with strange behavior.
And my brother and I are out from under restrictions, supposedly.
Some clemency cop is still playing with me.
And then I have a legal notice, I believe, from you guys
right after my hearings.
And some people have, like, one word,
one right and a word under official,
like maritime, merchant marine talk and legal talk.
But I've got it all, man.
I'm investitured, invested.
I'm allowed to wear a vest, walleted,
cashier, cash, and purse, and satchel.
It's in my tools.
I'm allowed to have it.
I got an old case in my tools and trade secrets
and trade secrets and formula for success
in my tools and in the things I use in my...
And, yeah, I can carry white and green,
and I've got the purple space purple.
And, uh...
I got the documents.
I got the legal...
I'm the guy with the legal documents in the paper.
Yes.
From an answer machine, friends.
Probably ought to leave it at that.
I love the legal documents.
Got it, though.
And here's a legal document,
which our new business manager, Jesus,
had to dig up the other day.
We had to dig up our trademark papers.
You know, the main portrait of our leader, Bob Dobbs,
is that main picture of Bob,
smiling guy with a face.
That is actually a trademark,
that particular portrait of him,
owned by the Subgenius Foundation.
That's basically me.
And, uh...
But Jesus was digging through the old papers,
and I had forgotten about this.
This was, like, 15 years ago.
It was September 27, 1982.
And this is a letter from the Subgenius lawyer
to the patent office,
the patent and trademark office,
of the United States,
who had originally turned down the trademark on Bob.
Now, the end of the story is that they relented.
But this was a letter, um...
Let's see.
By official...
I want to talk like the legal documents guy.

in agreement with and supporting of the philosophy
of Church of the Subgenius,
and soliciting money.
And that's all accurate and true.
These are documents registered with the government.
And that's basically what it does say
about the Church of the Subgenius.
In the halls of Congress.
Our lawyer continues,
although the specimens submitted
might well support other uses of the mark,
uses of the mark, that's Bob's face,
the services sought to be covered by this application
are clearly supported by the specimens submitted.
In other words, Bob's face clearly supports these things.
The examiner notes that the specimens state
that an applicant is, quote,
a sin-a-sac religion and a society for strange people, unquote.
The literature submitted as specimens further states
that the Church of the Subgenius
is beyond the shadow of a doubt the only true religion.
He's quoting the pamphlet.
Oh, that was the specimen.
Um, we perform miracles, answer any questions,
invoke demons, and have a direct etheric hotline
to space god Jehovah One through our
infra-psychic, trance-babbling personal savior J.R. Bob Dobbs.
And that's all simple legalese, right, friends?
Now, Webster's dictionary defines religion
as belief in a divine or superhuman power,
or powers to be obeyed and worshipped
as the creators and rulers of the universe,
and blah, blah, blah.
There can be no doubt that the Church of the Subgenius
is a religion as commonly defined,
albeit a rather unorthodox religion.
The Overman Identity Card, submitted as a specimen,
that's the membership card, friends,
the thing that gets you on the spaceships on X-Day
and dooms you if you don't have it.
The Overman Identity Card, submitted as specimen,
clearly shows that the Overman is entrusted, quote,
to perform all duties of the subgenius,
including sermonizing, harangues, invocations,
exorcisms, marriages, baptismal sacrifices,
seances, hypnosis, levitations,
the casting out of false prophets,
smitings, deflowerings, indoctrinations,
and the acceptance of donations.
Each of the services performed by the Overman
clearly falls within religious services,
as that term is commonly known and understood
by the ordinary person.
See, he's, our lawyer is trying to, to, um,
argue that this, he goes, obviously, educational,
quote, the terms educational, entertainment, and religion
have different connotations and meanings for different people.
However, the prejudices of one sect or group of people
cannot be used as a statutory standard
to deny registration of a mark, such as Bob's face,
used by another sect or group of people
who view these terms in a somewhat different light.
And, um, and he goes on to quote various other,
the case of Rose versus Reality or something like that.
And the specimens do support that this, uh, mark
is, uh, legitimately to be used and so forth and so on.
And in the end, we got our trademark,
and every few years we have to send them 500 bucks
to, uh, to keep, keep that booger in line.
But, well, heck, enough of that legalese,
uh, because I'm gonna go to, uh, some preaching again
from Pope David N. Meyer.
But first, some more music from the Klingons,
a subgenius band in Berlin.
Yes, Berli... not Berlin, Texas,
but Berlin, Germany, and, uh, praise the Klingons.
Oh.
Well, I guess so.
I guess the Klingons can't hardly do nothing
if they're not rewound or something.
Oh.
Too many people on this planet
There's too much dark shit on the street
There's too much bad news on the TV
Ain't no one that makes me wanna scream
Ah!
Ah!
Too much junk in the apartment
Too many things to do this week
Too many years of doing nothing
Too much time to send a fake
Well, here's the answer, why not do it again?
I like to take things too extreme
It's time to liven up the party
And kill the comfort of routine
We know on that path lies madness
Things worse than death lie in wait
I'll pay the price
For the spices of life
Gladly accessing my face
Too much
Oh, it's better than none, none
Much too much
Too much
Yeah, it's better than none, none
Much too much
Too many differences between us
Too much has happened in the past
I think I'm getting to the spirit
Take too much, move too fast
Well, here's the answer, how about doing it?
I like to take things too extreme






I like to take things too extreme
It's time to liven up the party
And kill the comfort of routine
Like this
Wives' men are temporary fiends
Always avoiding extremes
But moderation in all earthly things
Has taken the life out of me
Too much
It's better than not enough
Much too much
Too much
It's better than not enough
Much too much
Too much
It's better than not enough
Much too much
Too much
It's better than not enough
Much too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
It's beter than not enough
Even then, children, even then, lo, yea, verily, I would walk down the street, perhaps in Seattle, Washington, perhaps in Boise, Idaho, and total strangers would come to me, children. They would come into my face, and they would say to me, Dave. They would say to me, Rev. Dave. They would say to me, come down, New York City, Dave.
Who is it that stands in the way of the conspiracy? And you know that I said to them, children, who is it, children, that stands in the way of the conspiracy?
You know, children, there was a train, a subway, I didn't quite catch that. Who is it that stands in their way?
That's right, children. And now, children, the other question they come to me and ask me, they say to me, Dave.
No!
They say to me, Rev. Dave.
They say to me, come down, New York City, Dave.
What must a subgenius have?
What must he have?
What must he have?
What must he have?
What must he have?
What must he have?
What must he have?
That's right, children. A subgenius must have slack.
So, children, I want to talk to you about a new product. You know, the church of the subgenius has a vast and varied product line.
They're selling right over here. We have t-shirts, we have books, we have bumper stickers, we have buttons.
They're all worth every penny you pay for them, children. Every penny that you pay for them goes to fight the conspiracy.
Does it go to fight the conspiracy on the street, children? Does it go to fight the conspiracy in the sky, children?
No, it goes to fight the conspiracy in Dallas, children, in the coffers of the church.
And when Bob knows that you have tied unto Bob, you know that you have tied unto Bob.
That which is Bob. When Bob knows that you have taken him into your mind and your heart and your checkbook, then Bob fights the conspiracy.
But I'm selling a different kind of product tonight, children.
I'm selling a product that never wears out.
I'm selling a product in which interest will never flag.
I'm selling a product that you already know and love.
I'm selling a product that will bring you greater happiness than any other product you can buy, children.
And that's because my product is you.
You see, children, let me explain it to you, children.
One of the things the conspiracy has done...
Let me just look at my notes here.
One of the things the conspiracy has done, children, is to make certain conditions of modern life seem so normal that you don't recognize them as an aberration.
And one of the things the Church of the Subgenius has done is to bring certain crucial separations back together, children.
Because you see, the conspiracy has separated us.
It's separated you from you.
That's right, children. It's separated you from you.
The conspiracy, children, the tortures of day-to-day life, children, have given you anomie.
Now, children, those of you who remember the great, late, subgenius saint, Lester Bangs, might remember what he wrote about anomie.
Do you know what Lester Bangs wrote about anomie, children?
He defined anomie in the following manner.
There's only one of you, but he doesn't know.
Now, children, there's only one of you, but he doesn't know.
In the old days, in the old days, before the conspiracy was so mechanized, industrialized, and pervasive, there were prophets, if you will, of anomie.
Post-pre-industrial citizens who were experiencing that separation and found their own solutions.
And those solutions always lay in excess, children.
Why, your poes, your Baudelaires, your Rimbauds.
But now, children, everybody's got it every minute.
And nothing you do seems to satisfy you, children.
So what you do is what the conspiracy wants you to do, children.
And that is you purchase to close this separation.
You purchase to fill this void.
You purchase to pile up that unbridgeable canyon so for one moment you can step across it and embrace yourself.
And the conspiracy loves that, children.
It loves to see you spend your money on their useless products.
And when you feel that rising up in you, children, and you want to fight the conspiracy, you just remember this.
Why do you think they call it The Gap?
Now then, children, let me just take a look here.
Notes are a good thing when you don't have passion and you've only got God.
Now the other weapon that the conspiracy uses against you, children, is it raises the stakes day by day by day to make sure that no matter what you do, no matter what you accomplish,
you will always feel in the middle of the gap.
You will always feel inadequate and you will have to buy conspiracy products.
And the newest thing they're using on your children, you've noticed in the last four or five years, is an incredible bull market in useless beauty, children.
We're surrounded by beauty, children.
We're bombarded with beauty, children.
Beauty in the aim of the conspiracy.
Beauty to make you feel inadequate.
Beauty to make you buy those conspiracy products.
Now, children, look around this room.
Please, look around this room.
Gaze upon your neighbor.
In all frankness, children, we are not the beautiful people.
No, children, we are subgeniuses.
We are, by definition, disenfranchised children.
That's what makes you a subgenius.
Well, your attitude can lean you towards subgenius, but you are not a subgenius until you tithe unto Bob, that which is Bob.
Now, children, we don't care if you're beautiful.
We don't care if you're smart.
We don't care if you're trendy.
What we care about is that you've got $30 to give to Bob.
Now, this makes us as democratic a religion as you can find.
And when you tithe to Bob, that which is Bob's, you will get value for your dollar, children.
What good is $30 in today's market?
Well, children, it's just a pittance.
It's a bag of shells.
It's nothing.
But when you buy that book, children, when you buy Revelation X, available at finer bookstores everywhere,
when you get that $30 membership, children, you will get satisfaction.
You will get comfort.
You will get peace of mind.
And who knows, children, if your mind is right, you might even get a little slack.
But best of all, children, what you'll get is yourself.
Thank you, DK.
Now, children, people come to me on the street, and they say to me, Dave.
Dave!
They say to me, Rev. Dave!
Rev. Dave!
They say to me, pull the ball, New Yorkers!
New York City Dave!
New York City Dave!
New York City Dave!
What are we going to do with our $30, with our membership, when the church, like everything else, goes out of style?
Oh, children, let me explain it to you, children.
The conspiracy makes you sick of everything, so you'll keep buying.
The conspiracy is a vast, omnivorous, gobbling mall.
And it sits right here in the center, children, and it gobbles up everything on the fringe.
And it pulls it in.
And it pulls it in.
And it spits it out and vomits it back to you in a way that's unrecognizable.
And that's why, however long ago, you loved this band, and now you don't because the whole conspiracy likes them.
Well, children, let me explain this to you real clearly.
You could cast your mind back, children.
Cast your mind back.
Listen to the calendar pages flip.
1981, children.
November of 1981.
1981, the world's first subgenius world convention.
DK Jones was there.
Now, children, think back to 1981.
Think back to your so-called pop culture movements that have come and gone since 1981.
Why, children, it boggles the mind.
Why, I believe you've had the latter days of your punk.
I believe you had your big hair bands.
Yeah!
I believe you had your grunge.
I believe you had your rap.
Had your punk come back again.
All of it started out there, children, and all of it ended up in the middle.
But 15 years later, the subgeniuses are still on the fringe.
Praise Bob!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, praise Bob.
Dear friends, Pope David Ed Meyer preaching.
I wish I didn't have to cut that off.
It goes on and on.
But there's so much I want to play, you know.
And there's so little time to play it in.
But it is time to play the sacred post office box.
Friends, you can write for information about everything we do from Bob at post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.
And as Pope Meyer was saying, yep, it's been 15 years.
We're still on the fringe.
Still cranking this radio show out of a, well, it's not a basement.
It's not a basement anymore.
It's actually quite a well-equipped office in a tall Dallas skyscraper, an entire building owned by us.
And, well, we did just sign a deal with America Online and the Disney Corporation.
But with, and we did have a sort of a small merger with Polygram and Simon & Schuster.
But we own them now, you see.
And so don't worry.
When we turn into the conspiracy, it's not really the conspiracy, you understand.
Well, what can we end this show with as much as I, Susie the floozy has this wonderful long play that's been on Subgenius Radio.
But it hadn't been on Subgenius Radio anywhere but Atlanta.
And I wanted to play that.
I want to play this.
And I want to play everything.
But here's Joe.
Why don't they call it Pant?
Instead of Pants.
It's only a single piece of material.
Horny in the Pant.
Horny in the Pant.
Horny in the Pant.
Horny, horny, horny horn.
Horny in the Pant.
Sometimes I call it the Cants.
Horny in the Cants.
Horny in the Cant.
Horny, horny, horny horn.
Horny in the Cant.
Praise Joe.
And good night.
