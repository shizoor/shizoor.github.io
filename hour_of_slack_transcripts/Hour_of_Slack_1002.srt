1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
7, you know, 7, you know,

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:05,720
Breakthroughs in knowledge and experience of the 21st century.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,560
Now we're going to begin this afternoon by taking a look at Cleveland.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,240
Your high, cotton steamy, and your below average this afternoon and tonight.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,680
Some kind of super intelligence that was able to create this.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,020
From PR News in Washington, I'm passed out and physically exhausted

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,360
from the ordeal of demanding an apology from the United States

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,600
for alleged desecration of PR's people that have detonated explosives

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,980
outside a bank in Pennsylvania today.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,360
PR has the reports.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,360
Authorities in Florida are looking into the 4-year-old boy

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,040
who refused to deploy with his unit to Iraq for motion sickness bags in PR News.

13
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,400
And now, fought with the terrible weapons of super science,

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,960
menacing all mankind and every creature on Earth,

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,480
comes the...

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:12,000
People of Earth, attention.

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,360
This is a voice speaking to you from thousands of miles beyond your planet.

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,820
Don't try this at home.

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,820
Don't try this at home.

20
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,780
Don't try this at home.

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,320
No one had a bad trip.

22
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,880
It was all very good.

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,600
Big sports brands and fashion designers.

24
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,160
A creature that rules the universe.

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,440
You must find strength.

26
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,300
Behold the secrets of nature's deepest mystery.

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,240
You pompous, stock-up, snot-nosed, giant twerps.

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,040
He is the creator and sustainer of all the worlds,

29
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,840
whether those worlds are known or unknown to mankind.

30
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,400
Budgets?

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,540
We ain't got no budgets.

32
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,780
We don't need no budgets.

33
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,840
I don't have to show you any stinking budgets.

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,400
Deadly germs are creeping over the Earth,

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,060
killing every human in their path.

36
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,120
Gentlemen, it's impervious to all poisons.

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,720
Sucking the hallucinatory acid into the system.

38
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,900
It belongs to a creature from outer space.

39
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,900
And love.

40
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,160
Meditation.

41
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,580
300,000 volts of electricity.

42
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,620
Breakdown.

43
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,320
First in the flame.

44
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,700
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,600
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

46
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,680
Ah, yes, dear friends.

47
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,140
That was Lamprey Systems with their new one,

48
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,600
Don't Try This at Home.

49
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,980
And friends, this hour of slack is so late

50
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,700
that I'll bet you thought we all flew away in the flying saucers, didn't you?

51
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,080
Well, the experience actually was kind of like that.

52
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,980
And, uh, in fact, we're all so shaken by it here

53
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,760
that I'm running two hours of slack behind

54
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,100
and we have Starwood coming up.

55
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,100
Cytopia.

56
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,080
And in a way, we might as well be on the saucers.

57
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,560
Friends, luckily, we collected lots of recordings

58
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,620
from 8X Day, the 8X Day drill.

59
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,220
Recordings of Dr. Howell and Dr. Philo Drummond,

60
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,200
our special guests.

61
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,020
And friends, I've got a lot of recordings

62
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,580
from the radio synesthesia show that followed 8X Day.

63
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,340
Uh, and of course, there's a ton,

64
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,520
of course, there's a ton of recordings from the radio synesthesia show that followed 8X Day.

65
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:34,980
And, uh, and, uh, in fact, that's what's about to happen right now.

66
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,420
Friends, you're listening to the hour of slack

67
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,540
of the Church of the Subgenius.

68
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,320
I'm surprised more people haven't made,

69
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,060
invented their own religions in this country

70
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,780
as our country was founded on, you know, freedom of religion.

71
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,720
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

72
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,680
I got the hot dog up to my mouth again,

73
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,260
and I was ready to bite,

74
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,540
and the scream got louder.

75
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,300
And it hit me.

76
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,700
No, it couldn't be.

77
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,820
And I looked down at the hot dog,

78
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,520
and there was a face on him.

79
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,340
Eyes, nose, a mouth.

80
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,300
I had put the ketchup to where it looked like his hair.

81
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,220
And he started telling me that I couldn't eat him.

82
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,640
Bob, Bob, Bob.

83
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,920
And he had a wife and seven kids at home to support.

84
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,980
And I stood there with his hot dog and asked Terry,

85
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,320
do you know this hot dog is talking to me?

86
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

87
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,620
And, of course, we will have the X-Day report

88
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,320
as soon as the right people show up here.

89
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,960
Uh, hello, you're on...

90
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,120
Hello, you are on the air.

91
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,120
Ahoy, ahoy.

92
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,260
Ahoy, ahoy, Ragnar.

93
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,540
Well, let's title this,

94
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,780
this, this night's show,

95
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,040
Repressed X-Day Memories.

96
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,100
Ooh, you know, I,

97
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,860
I'm not sure if I want to dig up those repressed memories,

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,520
you know, I mean,

99
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,060
I might actually remember,

100
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,420
you know, some things that I didn't want to.

101
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,080
Yeah, those memories are repressed for a reason.

102
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,580
Ah, that's true, that's true.

103
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,380
So this is the season premiere of Synesthesia, is it not?

104
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,020
Well, I guess you could call it that, you know,

105
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,120
but I don't really think that this show has seasons.

106
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,340
The seasons...

107
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,360
Well, if you consider X,

108
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,600
say, a day of renewal...

109
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,880
Then, in that case, it would certainly be a new season.

110
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,520
But, uh, just so everybody knows right now,

111
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,040
one of the biggest events, of course,

112
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,840
uh, is that the church has been burned.

113
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,640
And it has been resurrected as a zombie church

114
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,040
by Mary Magdalene.

115
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,260
That is right, and with a little help from the bachelors for Bob.

116
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,880
UFO cult waiting for their ship to come in.

117
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,700
Space Brothers.

118
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,760
On this site,

119
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,340
three spaceships representing each planet of the Interplanetary Confederation

120
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,000
will land one atop the other to form a university

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,600
that will become the new World Teaching Center for Planet Earth.

122
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,380
But who shall dwell in these worlds if they be inhabited?

123
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,180
Are we or were they lords of the world?

124
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,860
And how are all things made for man?

125
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,520
No one would have believed in the last years of the 1960s

126
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,860
or the first century that this world was being watched keenly and closely

127
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,440
by intelligences greater than man's,

128
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,080
and yet as mortal as his own.

129
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,800
That as men busied themselves about their various concerns,

130
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,980
they were scrutinized and studied.

131
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,300
Perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope

132
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,040
might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.

133
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,260
With infinite complacency, men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs,

134
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,520
serene and unambiguous,

135
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,780
vain in their assurance of their empire over matter.

136
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,860
No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger,

137
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,400
so vain as man, and so blinded by his vanity,

138
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,900
that no human up to the very end of the 19th century

139
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,980
expressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed beyond its earthly level.

140
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,460
Yet across the gulf of space,

141
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:20,460
intellects fast and cool and unsympathetic regarded this earth with envious eyes,

142
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,420
and slowly and surely,

143
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,860
drew their plans against us.

144
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,920
God

145
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,160
and

146
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,220
NECABABASA!

147
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,980
Orbalize

148
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,060
I will make you understand

149
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,620
someone who wants to kill humans

150
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,320
Shredded

151
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,500
in the head

152
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,940
There's all on your mind

153
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,080
Let me out

154
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,180
Productive

155
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:42,620
Release

156
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,760
Shut up

157
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,820
and sit down

158
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:45,820
Solvated

159
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,080
BOMB!

160
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,980
Stop!

161
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,120
My mind is going!

162
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,060
Stop!

163
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,960
My mind is going!

164
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:07,720
Stop!

165
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,580
My mind is going!

166
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,540
And we're going to take to the phones now at 687-3515.

167
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,080
Hello, you're on the air.

168
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,860
Oh, hi, Dr. Sinister.

169
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,300
Oh, boy, boy, Stan.

170
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,020
Do you have a good X day?

171
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:24,840
Oh, great.

172
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,720
It was.

173
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:34,660
As far as, well, I'm, again, I don't know what Bob did to us this time, but so far I actually feel great.

174
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,040
But what Bob allowed us to do to ourselves, though.

175
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:46,460
I felt, I felt better when I got home than when I left, so maybe I did get a new body, and maybe this is my escape vessel,

176
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,560
and I was just too fixated on reality to come up with anything different than what I did.

177
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,320
You hardened it.

178
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,340
You hardened it by drinking that fighting cock whiskey that I brought.

179
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,580
You toughened it.

180
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,840
You got it ready for the new year.

181
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,840
Was that before or after the saucers came?

182
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,220
That was before.

183
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,220
That was, um.

184
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,960
Yeah, you were slamming that stuff.

185
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,840
That was like Saturday night.

186
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,540
Damn.

187
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,220
You were pounding that stuff down.

188
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,560
I don't even drink.

189
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,240
I saw him hit it once and make a face, actually.

190
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,680
I wasn't there Saturday night.

191
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,220
Are you guys crazy?

192
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:19,840
You were there.

193
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,720
It was at Doc Frop's.

194
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,540
I went to a motel so we could drink.

195
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:21,540


196
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:21,540


197
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:21,540


198
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:21,540


199
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,560
We went out to see War of the Worlds Saturday night.

200
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,040
No, I'm talking about X Day.

201
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,440
We were in a motel.

202
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,160
That was somebody else's look like me, man.

203
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,980
Oh, I'm talking about the Saturday night of X Day.

204
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,120
You guys are nuts.

205
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,520
You're crazy.

206
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,440
Yeah.

207
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,220
Apparently, Bob came and did something with all of us.

208
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,840
Look into the sex life of robots.

209
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:46,580
Since the dawn of the human species, man has wrestled with the dark side of human nature, the prince of lies.

210
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,680
I love evil, and I love evil actions.

211
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,160
Cults are much stronger than people realize.

212
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,320
Sex orgies, prostitution, dope, or any of these things.

213
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,780
We just worship Satan in a nice, peaceful manner.

214
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,120
The Satanic cults are famous for subliminal messages.

215
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,160
This would include, say, music at a roller rink.

216
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,360
Right now, the latest from Britney Spears.

217
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,420
This is stronger.

218
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,680
Blue-eyed blonde hair will sell for $50,000.

219
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,320
$50,000.

220
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,680
It's time to loosen things up and do the hokey pokey.

221
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,680
I am a stripper.

222
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,240
I'm also a stripper.

223
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,100
Many people are attracted to pornography, sex, and so forth.

224
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,040
It's sheer joy and pleasure.

225
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,580
Porn.

226
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,880
I think that would be quite attractive to the public.

227
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:47,260
These are the more beautiful women who have been used in the past and are being used today through the mind control program that's practiced by the CIA,

228
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,660
designed to make a human world.

229
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,440
It's a great way to get the human robots out of these individuals.

230
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,160
Stupid.

231
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,380
I slapped him in the face with a cartoon.

232
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,660
This could be a subliminal message.

233
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,220
Nor'el Pref at 8X Day.

234
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,180
Friends, you can download or read more.

235
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Nor'el Pref at heavyconfetti.com, friends.

236
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:19,520
And special thanks we have to give out to Governor Ratnar for spearheading the Dr. Howell to X Day effort.

237
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,020
And also for throwing himself on that bomb to save the rest of us.

238
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,680
It's a good thing it was a discordium bomb.

239
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:38,560
Anyway, friends, let's get back to Dr. Howell and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, possibly with Dr. Philodrummond, on stage at 8X Day at Brushwood.

240
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,640
Minutes before the end of the world.

241
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,600
The final hour approaches, my friend.

242
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,500
Could Nostradamus have been a human?

243
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:49,500


244
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,340
He would have been right when he predicted the end of the world, July 5th, 1998.

245
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,900
Actually, Nostradamus predicted it July 5th, 1999.

246
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,520
Bob corrected that note using some Edgar Cayce hints, actually.

247
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,220
Well, it couldn't be an even number, so it would have to be an odd number.

248
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,580
And when you go into the numerology, you have to go through a certain checklist.

249
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,140
Nostradamus lived in a stone tower with no plumbing.

250
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,020
He often made mistakes.

251
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,600
And I, too, live in a wooden garret with no plumbing.

252
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:32,980
But there you perform your secret scientific experiments, investigating into the very heart of life.

253
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,820
Life itself! We can discover the secret of life, good and evil!

254
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:48,740
Peering, peeking through the veil which hides the round and blushing charms of nature, and then ripping that veil asunder and plunging forward.

255
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:59,800
Into true understanding and enlightenment until it bursts over the brain and seems to seize it with a great awakening light.

256
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,420
And then profitable things like the Book of the Subgenius and other strange monsters may be born.

257
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,880
Monsters, yes, monsters!

258
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,800
Did you ever think that maybe to them, why, maybe we're the monsters?

259
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,820
Yeah, ever think of that? Maybe them, you're the monster, huh? How about that? Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?

260
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,780
How many times have we said that just this very weekend? Just to remind you, friends.

261
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,840
You can't say it often enough!

262
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:35,480
You cannot! To them, maybe we're the monsters! In fact, to them, maybe we are the cockroaches.

263
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:44,580
You know, it's necessary to keep repeating this depressing litany because one has what one calls a positive self-image,

264
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,260
which automatically reasserts itself.

265
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:54,320
Just as when you hit a bouncing round-based cupid doll, it always wants to return to the vertical.

266
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:05,240
So does the positive self-image, displacing any fleeting and vague imago of a monster that your accurate thought might have placed there.

267
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:12,260
It's not a good thing to be forced continually to confront one's monstrous self.

268
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,240
And paradoxically, a good way to avoid it is simply to consider it every now and then.

269
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:22,340
And Pastor Stang and I are just helping you with this simple intellectual exercise.

270
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,660
Every now and then, you have to go ahead and drink Dr. Jekyll's potion, come to grips with it, and then leave it alone.

271
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,540
That'll be good. Maybe once a year.

272
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,780
Well, you leave it alone, but the thing about that particular potion is that you have flashbacks. It comes back.

273
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:42,800
Well, yeah. That's why I said once a year. You don't want to end up kicking children too often.

274
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,720
The exhilaration of it all. The headlong rush.

275
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,820
Through the strange corridors of the body.

276
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,660
Friends, you don't know what slack might really mean.

277
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,400
Are you going to go into that dark hallway with faith?

278
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:04,100
Perhaps you may find that slack for you was something you previously found to be repugnant, even illegal.

279
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,380
It could be simple. You don't know.

280
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,780
You may find that it's something embarrassingly silly, like birdwatching.

281
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,860
Sometimes the best way to go forward is to go backward a little bit.

282
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,600
If you get your pants caught on the fence, you can't go forward. You have to back up a little bit.

283
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,620
Then you can go forward. The way forward is not a straight line.

284
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:32,780
It's a wriggling sinusoidal curve, and you must twist yourself adroitly to reach the glowing end of the tube.

285
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,920
It's like crawling through the tunnels of your own brain. Boring your way through.

286
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,200
Digging with your teeth through the little curling tubes of your brain.

287
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,340
Because all that brain tissue...

288
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,440
Trying to reach the inside.

289
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,880
...is not going to be important in the long run.

290
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,680
No, you don't need those brain cells.

291
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,780
You can jettison these sad memories, these archetypes, these tropes...

292
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,520
Bad facts.

293
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,860
...these engrams, these falsely learned syllogisms.

294
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,840
And then you construct in its place a shining, crystalline edifice.

295
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,480
One which might not be able to exist on this muddy, old, stinky, organic earth,

296
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,320
but in the crystal clarity of the earth,

297
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,640
and in the crystal clarity of space,

298
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,560
resonate like a cathedral of glimmering shards.

299
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,420
What about bombs?

300
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,100
I give it the torch right in the eye.

301
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:23,620
Ah!

302
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,200
Ah!

303
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:26,780


304
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,480
Ah!

305
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,360
Ah!

306
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,340
Ah!

307
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,300
Ah!

308
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:32,320
Ah!

309
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:33,440


310
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:33,900
Ah!

311
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,640
Ah!

312
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,280
Ah!

313
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,440
Ah!

314
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:35,900
Ah!

315
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,240
Ah!

316
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,260
Ah!

317
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:36,500
Ah!

318
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:36,780
Ah!

319
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,260
Ah!

320
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:38,260


321
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,260
Ah!

322
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:39,940
Ah!

323
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,140
Ah materia,

324
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,500
Reverend Howell.

325
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,720
And Dr. Howell may stand here with the sun spotlighting half of his face.

326
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,400
He was a reverend before he was a doctor.

327
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,040
A perfect photographic setup.

328
00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:01,040
Ladies and gentlemen, after I finish, Reverend Alex, I'm reliably informed, is up next.

329
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:08,460
And so, given this moment to speak, I might say it is a good excuse,

330
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:14,580
now that you hear my voice, to start making your way elsewhere to a more comfortable place.

331
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:23,460
Because you will hear the sounds of my syllables echoing after you until you reach safe distance.

332
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,320
Until then, I intend to verbalize and soliloquize.

333
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:37,940
Because a subscription, as you have heard, was made so that I could come out here and be among you here this X-Day.

334
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:47,040
I cannot begin to express the harmonious feeling which I underwent when I heard this news.

335
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:53,220
It started as a sort of a warmth in the solar plexus and then rose through my torso,

336
00:17:53,560 --> 00:18:02,820
expanding to fill the thorax and finally shooting up little flames of contentment toward my cerebrum.

337
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,640
And I think on certain special occasions we all feel that.

338
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,520
Or something similar.

339
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:21,060
I realized that in this one area, I was deemed somehow necessary, or less unnecessary than usual.

340
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:28,020
Now next year, I may be able to pay the freight myself, since my rhyming dinosaur book will be published, I assume.

341
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,620
And also, I'm writing a play, which I'm told will make my fortune.

342
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,120
There's a pair of glasses here.

343
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,720
I wonder if they are...

344
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,500
I've lost a pair of glasses for which extravagant promises were made.

345
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:52,480
Well, be that as it may, there are so many examples of intricate points of subgenius doctrine,

346
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,060
which need to be hammered into people's heads over and over again.

347
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:05,500
The purpose of understanding, the purpose of total immersion in the subgenius worldview.

348
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,560
This is done by incremental,

349
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,720
repetition,

350
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,540
tedious and exhaustive.

351
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:17,580
Just like the locusts that carried away the grains of wheat in Pharaoh's storehouse.

352
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,600
It didn't happen all at once, but incrementally, through tiny changes.

353
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:30,180
And so it must be, as my jaw moves up and down and tongue flaps back and forth,

354
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:35,600
these syllables, like the fragments of food which according to legend fed the prophets,

355
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,300
brought by birds out of the sun, will ideally spread over the campsite,

356
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,380
and then falling to earth, manure the ground, so that in this rich garden,

357
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,560
the garden of subgenius thought may grow.

358
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,760
Now, many people probably ask you, when they hear about what your religion is,

359
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,520
when you are injudicious enough to say what it is,

360
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,540
well, what does that mean?

361
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,180
That means you're stupid, right?

362
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,040
And of course, it doesn't mean that you're not stupid.

363
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,020
Since it doesn't have anything to do with genius as is commonly understood.

364
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,400
But I always maintained that this word genius was like the word,

365
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,300
was the same word as genie, that would be the plural actually.

366
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:32,360
Referring to those strange spirits of the air one encounters in Arabic mythology, the jinn.

367
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,760
They came out of Aladdin's lamp, or another one came out of a ring.

368
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:47,680
Or going into Greco-Roman mythology, there were the spirits of place, the genius Loki.

369
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,060
I'm sure that Brushwood Campground has them.

370
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,180
You can certainly intuit their presence hovering near the frog pond as you go there at night.

371
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,280
Well, there are such spirits.

372
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,280
And I will go farther.

373
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,340


374
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:11,540
And say that it is an absolutely essential nugget of belief that each person have such a spirit.

375
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:20,000
Not as vulgarly supposed a guardian angel or some namby-pamby, goody-goody, goo-goo

376
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,360
hovering just outside of one's threshold of understanding.

377
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,100
But the result of one's own intellectual and physical activity in this world.

378
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,360
One generates such a spirit.

379
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,320
And then that spirit hovers and assists.

380
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,880
And one should be under the direction of this tutelary body.

381
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,520
And not the false spirit of the conspiracy.

382
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,760
We don't seem to talk about the conspiracy enough.

383
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
And that's probably because we hate it so much.

384
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,880
And hate being entangled in its tentacular coils.

385
00:21:53,300 --> 00:22:00,400
But it's a reality that many of us do have to face when we leave Brushwood and its environs.

386
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,280
And return to what some are pleased to call the world.

387
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,260
Only the highest order of subgenius succeeds in renouncing these shackles entirely.

388
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,120
And achieving the exalted title or condition of being an art bum.

389
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,420
One who diddles around with things artistical.

390
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,160
And rarely has to work by the sweat of his brow.

391
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,100
All these people will tell you.

392
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,940
And I will even say on certain occasions.

393
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,960
When vexed with the limited understanding that others seem to possess.

394
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,300
That it's just as hard as digging post holes in the hot sun.

395
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,880
While the sweat runs down.

396
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,160
And millions of blood sucking night flies bite your perspiring limbs.

397
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,580
And that would be a lie.

398
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,740
Because that, that stuff's hard.

399
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,140
But being an art bum is the path of slack.

400
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,180
And that is why we are all trying to get there.

401
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,120
One way or the other.

402
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,240
But to try too hard of course.

403
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,160
Is to shed more slack.

404
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,800
Is to leave a greasy trail of spots of shed slack.

405
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,880
Which are fruitlessly cast aside.

406
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,340
And not used in the metabolic dynamic engine of construction.

407
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,700
Which drives the true subgenius forward.

408
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,360
So one should marshal one's grease spots.

409
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,540
And not bestow them on the path that one treads.

410
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,660
And marshal them proudly.

411
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,240
What is distasteful to someone else.

412
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:36,760
May be the true, true subgenius significator.

413
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:42,800
And we have learned to experience a number of unshapely odd.

414
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,100
Even creepy philosophies.

415
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,620
As well as body types here.

416
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,660
And this shows our largesse.

417
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,600
And our larger understanding.

418
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,660
Part of our journey of exploration and discovery.

419
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,960
So, you know, all I could do to add to this.

420
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,980
Would be to go on explicating already overly familiar portions.

421
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,880
Nano bits of subgenius doctrine.

422
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,980
I think rather than the scholastic approach.

423
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,280
We are all here more or less to relax.

424
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,280
Settle back.

425
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,460
And enjoy our feature presentation.

426
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,240
To have a good time.

427
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,880
Rather than a good read.

428
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,200
Or a good study.

429
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,140
For there is always time to absorb.

430
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,860
Subgenius doctrine.

431
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,900
I recommend for this time.

432
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,420
The down time.

433
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,240
The time in between regular activities.

434
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,480
We write in our books of extra meditation.

435
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,340
This is after all a private time.

436
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,180
While the body does its thing.

437
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,940
The brain may race ahead.

438
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,140
Constructing fantastic traceries.

439
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,780
Of airy castles of creation.

440
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,980
And imagination.

441
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,140
There is no reason to be chained.

442
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,120
To the physical world.

443
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,400
To the physical body.

444
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,000
Simply because one must pay the rent.

445
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,520
While one is in it.

446
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,680
And that being just one of many examples.

447
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,880
I will let that drop here.

448
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,520
Only our own warm earth.

449
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,820
So cold and molten lead.

450
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,780
Lies frozen on its surface.

451
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,360
But from the blackness of outer space.

452
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,600
We were being frozen.

453
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,820
But thousands of pounds of dust.

454
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,660
Lies close to Uranus.

455
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,860
But only our own warm earth.

456
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,160
Was green with methane gas.

457
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,740
Eloquent of fertility.

458
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,360
And possessed.

459
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,200
A cloudy atmosphere.

460
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,460
Flaming at the tops.

461
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,660
But only our own warm earth.

462
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,600
For centuries it has been in the last stages of Uranus.

463
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,340
Even at its equator.

464
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,540
But Uranus.

465
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,220
Uranus.

466
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,960
I say this calls for action.

467
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,560
And now.

468
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,880
Now it's in the.

469
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,200
Bump.

470
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:07,880
How was the 200 million dollar War of the Worlds compared to the 2000 dollar War of the Worlds?

471
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:21,140
Well oddly enough the even though the El Cheapo War of the Worlds which came out just before Spielberg's version is exactly painfully faithful to the book.

472
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:26,460
The Spielberg version is better because the book is good.

473
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,900
And the Spielberg version is good.

474
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,100
And the.

475
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:40,620
The El Cheapo version that's exactly faithful line for line to the book is one of the worst shot movies I've ever seen in my entire life.

476
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,480
I mean it's like.

477
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,240
Ed Wood.

478
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:43,860
Or.

479
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,180
Larry Buchanan film in a way.

480
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,640
It's that bad.

481
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,120
But in a modern desktop special effect.

482
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,120


483
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,700
So it's it's it's not a period piece.

484
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,520
It is.

485
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:54,940
It is.

486
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,300
So new.

487
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,060
Is that what was playing at the theater.

488
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:57,480
No.

489
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,300
There are two War of the Worlds that came out at the same time.

490
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,960
The Spielberg one which takes place now.

491
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,060
And doesn't actually mention Martians.

492
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,940
Doesn't say anything about Mars.

493
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,960
And.

494
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,720
And.

495
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,700
And one that was made really low budget.

496
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:20,880
There is a period piece set in 1898 when the novel was written by H.G. Wells.

497
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,040
And it's really low.

498
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,080
It's so low budget.

499
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,960
They really weren't.

500
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,500
Couldn't pull it off.

501
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,940
And yet they did anyway.

502
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,980
So it's like a bulldog a masterpiece of bad film.

503
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,860
The guys.

504
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,760
The guy that.

505
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,240
The guy that pulled it off though.

506
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,860
The War of the Worlds is simply an ordinary real well made really well made film.

507
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,800
Just as it.

508
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,840
Would you say it's just.

509
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,740
Would you say it's actually a good film or is it by well made you mean like it's just like typical Hollywood fare.

510
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,020
Well it's typical Hollywood fare.

511
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,960
But I was.

512
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:56,400
I'm an H.G. Wells fanatic and I was very pleased because I felt that it captured the essence of the book.

513
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,700
And they even managed to work in the main rants from from the the War of the Worlds.

514
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:10,820
There are some great rants about what little rabbits the people of the world are and how most of them are just scurrying about their little jobs.

515
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,200
Afraid of the boss and afraid of God on Sundays.

516
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,640
And oh it won't be that big of a change for them under the Martians.

517
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,220
You know.

518
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,720
I believe they've built a flying machine.

519
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,560
A flying machine?

520
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,240
Yes.

521
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,620
If they have that it's all over with humanity.

522
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,300
It is over with humanity.

523
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,160
We're down.

524
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,640
We're beat.

525
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,440
This isn't a war.

526
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,100
It never was a war.

527
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,600
Any more than this war between man and ants.

528
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,120
That's all we are now.

529
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,620
Just ants.

530
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,540
Only.

531
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,620
Yes.

532
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,060
We're eatable ants.

533
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,620
At present they can't be eaten.

534
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:49,620


535
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,900
They can't catch us when they want us.

536
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,580
But they won't keep on doing that.

537
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,440
They'll begin catching us.

538
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,560
Systematic.

539
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,260
Picking the best and storing us into cages.

540
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,740
Lord.

541
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,200
They haven't begun on us yet.

542
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,020
Not begun?

543
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,200
Saw people that lived in these houses.

544
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,220
Running wild for their little season ticket train for fear they'd get dismissed if they didn't.

545
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,100
And on Sundays for fear of the year after.

546
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,680
As if hell was built for rabbits.

547
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,420
These Martians will make pets of some of them.

548
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,540
Train them to do tricks.

549
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,080
Who knows?

550
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,700
And some maybe.

551
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,980
They were trained to hunt us.

552
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,380
If they come after me.

553
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,660
Lord if they come after me.

554
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,560
We've got to learn while we've got a chance.

555
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,180
And we've got to live and keep independent while we learn.

556
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,800
I've been thinking about the drains.

557
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,280
The mine drains are big enough and airy enough for anyone.

558
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,580
And the railway tunnels and subways.

559
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:49,720
Eh?

560
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,300
You begin to see.

561
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,260
And we form a band.

562
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,860
Able bodied clean minded men.

563
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,880
Able bodied clean minded women we want also.

564
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,180
Mothers and teachers.

565
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,620
Imagine this.

566
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,620
Four or five of their fighting machines suddenly startling off.

567
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,360
And not a Martian in them.

568
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,440
Not a Martian in them but men.

569
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,420
Swish.

570
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,860
They ray.

571
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,300
And behold.

572
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,680
Man has come back to his own.

573
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,640
It was then I had my first inkling of the gulf between the artilleryman's dreams and his powers.

574
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,980
There's some great subgenius rants.

575
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,000
Of course the sad thing is at the end the humans live and the monsters die.

576
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,340
That's always sad for us subgeniuses.

577
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:42,640
But the whole idea behind these blockbuster end of the world Martian invasion movies every summer.

578
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,580
Is to discredit J.R. Bob Dobbs.

579
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,280
And to give people the idea that aliens are just monsters in spaceships.

580
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,420
They're not gods that can completely smash you.

581
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,540
And don't get colds.

582
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,700
You know.

583
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,280
Because it's sad.

584
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,520
The aliens die of the common cold.

585
00:30:59,780 --> 00:30:59,960
You know.

586
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,120
Well I don't want to ruin the movie.

587
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,660
I think that's old news by now.

588
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,100
Yeah.

589
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,620
Yeah it was based on that radio show right.

590
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,200
Which was based on that war.

591
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,460
Which was based on that novel.

592
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,740
Right.

593
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,040
There really was a war of the worlds.

594
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,260
Just before World War I.

595
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,200
But.

596
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,680
That was covered up.

597
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,000
That was covered up like the switch with Mars.

598
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,100
Right.

599
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,380
So it really gets pretty complicated.

600
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,820
It is enough to make a man's head spin.

601
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,580
Yeah.

602
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,400
And let me tell you I'm doing about 78 RPM right now.

603
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,220
Sigh.

604
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,800
And their overturned war machines.

605
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,520
Some of the now rigid handling machines.

606
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,800
And a dozen of them stark and silent.

607
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,180
And laid in a row where the Martians.

608
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,020
Dead.

609
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,200
Slain by the putrefactive and diseased bacteria.

610
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,660
Against which their systems were unprepared.

611
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,500
Slain as the red weed was being slain.

612
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,520
Slain after all man's devices had failed.

613
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,460
By the humblest things that God.

614
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,880
In his wisdom.

615
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,940
Has put upon this earth.

616
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,240
Friends.

617
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,440
You may have noticed that the church tends to not be all that hard sell.

618
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,920
That's because we're in this for the long run.

619
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,180
We don't want to be.

620
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,380
A Wilhelm Wright.

621
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,500
We don't want to be.

622
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,840
Look what happened to all of our predecessors my friends.

623
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,360
Well we don't want everybody anyway.

624
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,540
Only the elect.

625
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,720
But they can't all be saved.

626
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,860
They can't and it is not good that they should.

627
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,000
We only need the individual holotypes of each particular subgenius mutation.

628
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,420
Let's look at it from the standpoint of vertebrates.

629
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,700
The vertebrate paleontology.

630
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,240
There we go.

631
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,220
That always straightens out things.

632
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:57,060
Now you may be aware of one of the most famous of the giant dinosaurs.

633
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,540
One of the last that perished from the earth.

634
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,320
Was the triceratops.

635
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,620
And in the museums there are many different heads.

636
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,040
Of many different species.

637
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,760
Because those big skulls are hard to destroy.

638
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,860
And they survive the lengthy process of fossilization.

639
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,460
So there's one with a twist here and a hornlet there.

640
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,960
One called triceratops prorsus.

641
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,620
One called triceratops horridus.

642
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,980
One called the triceratops ajax and so forth.

643
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,440
Triceratops trionocles.

644
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,720
But you know soon they started arguing.

645
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,200
Oh boy maybe these aren't different species.

646
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,400
Maybe everyone was different.

647
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,620
Maybe everyone was an individual mutation.

648
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,280
And it had these strange horns and spines.

649
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,700
To fight with other dinosaurs in gigantic battles.

650
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:45,980
No.

651
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,500
To look good to the opposite sex.

652
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,200
That's what it's all about maybe.

653
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,000
Because these dino horns and plates and things were cool.

654
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,520
And if you had more of them you were more likely to mate with another dinosaur.

655
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,500
They had no actual function.

656
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,060
You wouldn't want to fight with them.

657
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,100
They might break off.

658
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,060
Then you wouldn't look good.

659
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,020
So at any rate.

660
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,920
Each triceratops once considered a different species.

661
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,800
Is now recognized as the same species.

662
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,960
Not because the difference is not known.

663
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,220
But because speciation went on in such a subtle way.

664
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:23,060
That it's inconvenient to list every different god damn species.

665
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,960
And science tries to make everything nice and easy and clear for future generations.

666
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,960
Well of course we know there aren't going to be any of those.

667
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,900
But it is essential for us in contemplating ourselves.

668
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:44,260
To understand that each one of us is essentially the holotype of a different subgenius species.

669
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:49,560
And as we move on into the transition to the unknowable future.

670
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:56,700
It is up to us to push our own genetic template out there.

671
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,340
Because it has value.

672
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,500
To survive.

673
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,840
To infiltrate the cosmos.

674
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:10,460
And to make every face spiritually the grinning face of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

675
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,660
That's right friends.

676
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,040
Your job is not only to get slack.

677
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,440
But to make sure that slack survives.

678
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,640
To keep the subgenius genotype going.

679
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,540
That means sooner or later.

680
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,120
You must reproduce.

681
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,580
And make more little subgeni.

682
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,200
I know most of you are going.

683
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,720
I'm not going to bring a kid into this horrible world.

684
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,300
Well this is.

685
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,700
Actually we've only got a few hours left to have those future generations I suppose.

686
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,880
But given.

687
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,260
You know.

688
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,200
Pretend that we were faced.

689
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:40,400
You know.

690
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,560
I'm the saucers.

691
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,840
In relativistic time.

692
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,180
They can grow up the kids in tubes anyway.

693
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,840
Not to worry.

694
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,220
Well.

695
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,200
You've seen those movies.

696
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,840
I hear so many of my subgenius friends saying.

697
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,700
Oh I'm not going to bring a kid into this pink world.

698
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,100
And plus.

699
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,880
I'd be a terrible parent.

700
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,800
And so forth and so on.

701
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,600
We don't care.

702
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,440
It's.

703
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,360
I don't care if that kid grows up to be a serial killer.

704
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,240
If it has the Yeti gene.

705
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,380
That's all that counts.

706
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,260
And if it.

707
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,520
Then reproduces.

708
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,200
And creates more little serial killing.

709
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Half Yeti.

710
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,740
Half human.

711
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,380
Half breeds.

712
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,600
That's fine.

713
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,260
That's fine.

714
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,060
Sooner or later.

715
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,680
It'll all work out.

716
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,080
Of course on the escape vessels.

717
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,360
We won't have to worry about.

718
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,320
Species mixing.

719
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,600
From PR News in Washington.

720
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,780
I'm still recovering from Ivan.

721
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:32,400
But fans are looking forward to an interesting rematch.

722
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,380
Pornography.

723
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:33,820
Yes.

724
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,960
The National Hockey League could reach land later today.

725
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,740
The BBC's reports.

726
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,180
So to tax.

727
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,180
The best way to do that is to get the best of the best.

728
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,180


729
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,180


730
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,180


731
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,180


732
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,180


733
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,180


734
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,180


735
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:03,840
If you liked this video.

736
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,300
Leave a like.

737
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,360
And subscribe.

738
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:04,580
And hit the notification bell.

739
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,020
I don't know what to say.

740
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:06,460
But I'll be back.

741
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:06,460


742
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:06,460


743
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:06,460


744
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:06,980
Show.

745
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:06,980


746
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:06,980


747
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:06,980


748
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,160
The.

749
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:07,580
Space.

750
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,480
Show.

751
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,020
The.

752
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,020


753
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,020


754
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,440
And.

755
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:09,580
From.

756
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:09,580


757
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:09,580


758
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:09,580


759
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:09,580


760
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:09,580


761
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,540
Space.

762
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,040
Show.

763
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,180
might encounter, in addition to

764
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,800
exists, the Yetinsin

765
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,360
in some form?

766
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,940
The original Yeti?

767
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,340
Well, there's been a rumor

768
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,820
or a legend, or whatever you want to call it,

769
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,320
I'm not exactly

770
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,100
certain of its provenance, that

771
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,720
the titular

772
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,680
guardian Yetis themselves

773
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,120
might be on

774
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,340
the saucers.

775
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,260
Or a few guides, guardians.

776
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,260
Well, Dr. Howell, you know, it's been

777
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,300
80 million years since most of

778
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,520
the original Yeti left the planet

779
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,140
following their failed

780
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,080
experiment when the humans escaped

781
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,440
from the so-called, the test tubes,

782
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,440
so to speak. You know, many of them

783
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,360
were in the latter days slain

784
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,420
by the evil, barbaric

785
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,520
Yehu humans.

786
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,340
And the more gentle and

787
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,600
higher savants

788
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,880
of the Yetinsin

789
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,500
withdrew even further into their

790
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,260
remote fastness,

791
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,060
unwilling to

792
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,100
release their deadly actinic

793
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,000
fires that they could so easily control

794
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
on a thing which seemed

795
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,420
shaped like them.

796
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,440
But,

797
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,200
what about Gigantopithecus and its

798
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,240
enigmatic lower jaw that you

799
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,000
were telling me about?

800
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,220
Yes, friends, as a matter of fact, in the Cleveland

801
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,380
Natural History Museum,

802
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,820
there is on display

803
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,540
the jawbone of a Yeti.

804
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,160
Now, talk about offensive!

805
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,980
That'd be like an American Indian

806
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,980
walking into a museum and seeing his

807
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,040
grandfather stuffed.

808
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,040
Which they used to have. I mean, at the

809
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,140
University of Arizona, they had an Indian

810
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,220
mummy, but when I went back there

811
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,940
to see it recently, they said,

812
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,660
oh, we never had no mummy. No,

813
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,020
we don't have a mummy. You never

814
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,720
saw an Indian in there. No, no.

815
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,460
But I know what I saw.

816
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,960
A mummy, withered and

817
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,180
horrible, in complete Indian regalia

818
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:01,500
too.

819
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,180
Yeah, yeah, that one.

820
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,120
Yeah, indeed.

821
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,540
Not the same as the...

822
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,040
So, and the Gigantopithecus.

823
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,020
Gigantopithecus skull

824
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,620
in the museum is a similar outrage,

825
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,000
and yet, once one

826
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,860
puts aside one's

827
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,400
understandable natural

828
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,840
repugnance, loathing, and

829
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,400
horror, one can see that

830
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,760
science might need to show off

831
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,600
this massive Yeti jaw

832
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,780
against a similar, but much

833
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,920
smaller jaw of an adult male

834
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,800
gorilla, and

835
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,840
even the sadly

836
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,800
etiolated, weak little

837
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,160
jawbone of a human.

838
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,560
That's right, and the

839
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,040
Yeti jawbone would indicate

840
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,000
an animal nine feet tall,

841
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,300
and probably pretty fat,

842
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,780
and with a really

843
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,260
profoundly developed

844
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,200
ability to kiss and make

845
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,840
out. With those big

846
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,260
slobbery lips it had.

847
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,020
The German scientist

848
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,040
Franz Weidenrich said in

849
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,540
his epochal work,

850
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,480
Apes, Giants, and Men,

851
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,060
that this beast, this

852
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,900
creature, Gigantopithecus,

853
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,960
is actually misnamed, and shouldn't

854
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,280
be given the name Gigantopithecus

855
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,960
or Giant Ape. It should instead

856
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,020
be called Gigantropus, or

857
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,140
Giant Man, because

858
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,180
there are certain man-like

859
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,960
homologies in the

860
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,980
strange bones of

861
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,780
this enormous anthropoid.

862
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,060
Particularly of the structure of the teeth,

863
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,080
and if you want to know what something really

864
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,820
is, and you're a scientist,

865
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,200
well, you look at the teeth.

866
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,140
Teeth are an indicator. You might remember

867
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,880
that when Gulliver came back from

868
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,120
Brobdingnag, the teeth

869
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,980
that he had collected

870
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,900
of the giants were one of the most

871
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,600
convincing proofs that he had to offer.

872
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,640
Friends,

873
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,860
at 7.15 tomorrow

874
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,120
morning, you can fuck

875
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,240
a full-grown yeti

876
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,720
if you so desire, or

877
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,780
for that matter, you could bring into

878
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,940
existence a homo

879
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,820
forensiensis, the newly

880
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,340
discovered little hobbit people.

881
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,280
You can even set up a three-way.

882
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,740
Think of that. With you,

883
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,680
and the sandwich. That movie,

884
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,780
Revenge of the Sith, was mentioned,

885
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,040
and it shows their ludicrous gynecological

886
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,700
techniques, where robots

887
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,400
with huge scoops for hands

888
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,680
deliver tiny, wriggling babies.

889
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,520
Compared to this primitive

890
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,040
level of medical development,

891
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,880
what you'll find on the saucers

892
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,500
are an unbelievable

893
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,840
series of skills of

894
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,940
genetic manipulation. You can

895
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,020
give birth to any kind of offspring

896
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,660
you want. They

897
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,540
can do it. The

898
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,820
age of being tied to the earth

899
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,860
and its organic winds and

900
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,300
waves shall be over.

901
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,640
And you can be not only the architect

902
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,800
of your own destiny, but

903
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,120
that of your entire posterity.

904
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,820
Normally too great an

905
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,660
honor, too dangerous a power

906
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,240
to wield, but to we

907
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,840
who are as gods, not

908
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,560
so. For we

909
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,700
need not stop at traffic lights

910
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,380
anymore after X day.

911
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,480
Who are we to obey

912
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,100
society's laws and morals?

913
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:08,960
Ours?

914
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,240
Ours is a high and lonely

915
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,860
destiny, and no

916
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,360
more financial humiliation

917
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,080
will be in the cards.

918
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,940
Friends, one of the dangers of

919
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,820
X day is that your mind won't be able

920
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,900
to accept all the things that you can

921
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,940
do, and that you'll end up

922
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,920
just using the powers of the

923
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,960
exes and the lone computers

924
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,860
to simply recreate

925
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,960
the world that you're familiar with

926
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,580
just because you can't really imagine

927
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,080
anything better. You think you can,

928
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,320
but you can't really,

929
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,440
and therefore you may end up,

930
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,600
your escape vessel might somehow

931
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,440
resemble your seedy apartment

932
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,380
back home.

933
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,780
Or even your bathroom.

934
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,540
Yeah, you may be on the escape

935
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,320
vessels speeding towards

936
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,460
planet X, and it looks like

937
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,920
driving down I-90 back to Cleveland.

938
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,240
That's why Dr. Drummond,

939
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,420
Dr. Drummond needs to come here

940
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,900
and do show. It's time to

941
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,560
hide him into the circle.

942
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,840
The seance is not complete without

943
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,400
his etheric energy.

944
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,120
Bills, bills, bills, bop, bop,

945
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,140
bills, bop, bills, bop, bills, bop,

946
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,120
bills, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,

947
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,020
bop, bop, bop, zippy, bop, bop.

948
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,800
I'll have to admit it.

949
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,820
For a lot of people, the church is right

950
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,400
where it belongs.

951
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,920
Here lies the church.

952
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,480
That's what some people think about the church.

953
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,280
In the school, the conference room,

954
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,860
high-rise apartments, camping trailer,

955
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,820
exclusive restaurants, racy sports cars, discotheques,

956
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,160
topless bars, even the living room.

957
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,420
Why is that, anyway?

958
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,520
Of course, some people say the church fits everywhere.

959
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,080
Gotta be more specific.

960
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,660
Bob fits everywhere in life.

961
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,660
And they say that when he fits,

962
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,140
he makes a difference in what you do,

963
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,540
how you do it, where you do it, and why.

964
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,920
They say he doesn't squeeze the life out of you.

965
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,140
He pumps it into you, you know?

966
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,640
They say he opens the lid on life, love,

967
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,340
the kind that cares for other people.

968
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,000
They say he opens your eyes to beauty,

969
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,980
flowers, people, you, and Bob.

970
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:05,700
Drugs needed.

971
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,720
You know, speaking of neighbors,

972
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,540
I had a really, you know, they were,

973
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,380
you gotta kind of love and hate your neighbors

974
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,000
at the same time.

975
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,120
They were playing this music, this loud thumping music.

976
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,880
It's shaking my house all to hell.

977
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,140
So what I do is I aim my computer speakers out,

978
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:27,040
and I put in my CD player, the amino acids,

979
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,020
destroy the warming sun.

980
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,240
I hit them back with the amino acids.

981
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,180
That'll hit them back with a pretty heavy weapon.

982
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:33,740
And that turned their music off.

983
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,520
I've had people do that to me, too.

984
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,540
I use some, like, death metal, actually,

985
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,600
is what I use, too.

986
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,460
To shut the neighbors up if they're too loud.

987
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,340
Because, you know, I mean...

988
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:42,840
I have a synthesizer.

989
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,700
I can fix them good.

990
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:44,640
Yeah?

991
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,040
Yeah, what can you...

992
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,140
Man, you can do all kinds of stuff with a good synthesizer.

993
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:51,580
You can...

994
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,860
Yeah, you can take your frequencies

995
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,180
and basically drive them nuts.

996
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,180
You can shatter their windows, probably,

997
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,180
if you have a good speaker.

998
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,260
Well, best of all is to not have any neighbors.

999
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:01,500
What's that?

1000
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,960
Best of all is to not have any neighbors.

1001
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,440
Yeah, but that's...

1002
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,980
Then you gotta live out in the middle of nowhere.

1003
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,580
When the Russians come, I'm gonna join up with them, and become a hero.

1004
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:08,580


1005
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,240
I'm a human hunter.

1006
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,360
I'll be a good pet for the Martians.

1007
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,300
I want to shut the neighbors up.

1008
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,760
Get rid of all of them.

1009
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:16,420
Bob?

1010
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:19,520
Bob?

1011
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:24,620
Bob?

1012
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:25,660
Bob?

1013
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:29,480
Bob?

1014
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:30,680
Bob?

1015
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:31,320


1016
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:31,320


1017
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:31,380


1018
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:31,420
Bob?

1019
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:31,480
Bob?

1020
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,320
Bob?

1021
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:32,340


1022
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:32,340


1023
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:32,340


1024
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:32,740
Bob?

1025
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:32,740


1026
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:32,740


1027
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:32,740


1028
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:32,740


1029
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:32,740


1030
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,000
Bob?

1031
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,040
Bob?

1032
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,960
Bob?

1033
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:16,800
verse can see it. And finally, off to stage left, a suspicious-looking hole, square like a garage

1034
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:26,560
door, out of which a certain streamer of smoke coils and is ascending upward. You know, the sad

1035
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:34,740
thing about this whole chick setup is that everyone who goes to that judgment scene is guilty. If

1036
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:42,320
you're all right with Jesus or whatever, I'm not certain of all the doctrinal ramifications, but if

1037
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:47,360
you do all that you're supposed to do, you're not even going to be there. You might be able to watch

1038
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:54,760
it on your companion telescreen in heaven, but the great white throne judgment, as it is called, is

1039
00:46:54,760 --> 00:47:03,320
only for the guilty. Only 144,000 shall be saved, my friends. But we know this is a distorted version

1040
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,720
of the actual judgment.

1041
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:10,820
Apocalypse, to which we have the true key and knowledge, as revealed in the original

1042
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:19,040
pre-scriptures, published now, lo, these many years in the book of the subgenius. Pretty good, huh, how the

1043
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:25,900
pre-scriptures have proven so true? Amazing, yeah. You know, if you study, well, of course, if you study any

1044
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:32,080
prophetic thing like the Bible, you can find hints, the things that could be stretched to appear to

1045
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,340
represent events happening.

1046
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:34,900
Right.

1047
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:40,380
In the current times, but with the subgenius prophecies are right exactly on the money, all the way up

1048
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:47,200
the date line. Well, maybe not date line for dominance, but the pre-scriptures, although they may be a little

1049
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,560
vague in some areas, leave a little bit of room for interpretation.

1050
00:47:52,140 --> 00:48:01,260
Well, they have a certain poetic flexion, a certain rubbery theological flexibility, but Satan, too, can quote the

1051
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:01,700
scriptures.

1052
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,120
That's right.

1053
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,720
However, Nege cannot quote the pre-scriptures.

1054
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:11,560
He can't quote the pre-scriptures because they're just too confusing and complicated for its senescent degenerate brain.

1055
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:25,040
That's just common subgenius doctrine, friends. Nothing special is being said there. We're just regurgitating those subgenius...

1056
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,300
Nothing special except that you uttered his name.

1057
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:34,700
... truisms. Well, we do that because we are speaking to an audience of the elect, not to the...

1058
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:34,700


1059
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:43,880
... the primitives who are hag-ridden by credulity, superstition, and fanaticism, but the true enlightened ones.

1060
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:51,520
Therefore, we can even say that terrible name. And you can dress up as him and his wife at the deity ball.

1061
00:48:51,740 --> 00:49:04,680
But the point is that we're free here, free to bandy about the most offensive concepts. We had Nazis on our stage belching forth hatred, and we've had terrible...

1062
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:04,680


1063
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:17,560
... fights in our midst, with radios being smashed, crockery fractured, and tears and departures of indignant subgenie and subgeniates in a huff.

1064
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,420
That proves it's a real religion!

1065
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:34,640
As the fatal hour grows closer, so mount the tensions, until finally, like a boil giving way to erupt in purulent matter, the tensions will...

1066
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:34,660
... be gone.

1067
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:47,480
The tensions will resolve themselves one way or the other. That's why we need that big, hygienic, gleaming saucer to come down and save us from our human predicament, since this is the final hour.

1068
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:51,980
You know, I could be talking to a beautiful live girl instead of you guys.

1069
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,280
You could be, yeah, you could.

1070
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,240
Yeah, where is we?

1071
00:49:54,500 --> 00:50:00,040
She's doing princess-ly stuff. You know what princesses do? They just sit around looking beautiful, and everybody looks at them and goes,

1072
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,780
... aahhh. That's what she's doing, probably.

1073
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:04,360
Yeah.

1074
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,260
It's kind of like that last supper we had at the corral.

1075
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:14,440
No matter how many times they try to corral those subgeniuses, though, they can't train them. They stay wild.

1076
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,700
You can't break them.

1077
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:26,860
Look at some of the ones that, you know, the humans call them drunks, ne'er-do-wells, stumbling, nattering nabobs.

1078
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:33,020
But in the Church of the Subgenius, they get special double credits and awards for that.

1079
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:37,220
You get to be Pope, Cardinal, Bishop, and altar boy all at the same time.

1080
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:43,320
Actually, I have noticed that the subgeniuses that take the most important sounding titles, like Pope...

1081
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,580
... are some of the most humble people you'd ever meet, actually, in some cases.

1082
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:46,880
No, of course.

1083
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,780
Not really, but...

1084
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:52,040
No, I don't think it's the other way around.

1085
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:57,020
They tend to be insane egomaniacs.

1086
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:57,780
Yeah.

1087
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,540
Like sex-mortis, polka-dots.

1088
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,320
Well, I call them...

1089
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,980
Well, you get pretty much all the subgenius popes that I know of.

1090
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:10,260
And then there's the ones, however, who are the most incredibly productive.

1091
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:15,020
They often have humble names, like Mr. Fernandinandilymer.

1092
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:21,220
He's the only subgenius who's not a pope or a general or a reverend.

1093
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,140
He's just Mr.

1094
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:29,060
And yet that guy does more audio and visual stuff than any other subgenius to speak of.

1095
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,300
He does those PR newsletters.

1096
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:30,780
He does those PR news segments.

1097
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,220
Yeah, and massive amounts of graphics.

1098
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,160
So what I'm saying is, these people are all completely insane.

1099
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,020
Yes, and that's the point.

1100
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:47,060
And we can not only cause the insanity, my friend, we can sell you the cure.

1101
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,580
That's a wonderful thing.

1102
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:55,980
Actually, I saw this wonderful thing once that was describing an account of this boy who, at the age of four, he stopped growing.

1103
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,080
And numerous tests eventually revealed that he had celiac disease.

1104
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:04,060
And then they put him on a gluten-free diet and he's fine now.

1105
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:04,780
He's back to normal.

1106
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,520
And they say, we give God the glory for his recovery.

1107
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,100
So do we also give God the glory for him having that genetic disease in the first place?

1108
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,440
Or God the glory for inventing gluten?

1109
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,740
Yeah, you know, seriously.

1110
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:23,160
That's like giving an arsonist, that's like having a firefighter slash arsonist, you know?

1111
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:30,060
You can say that God did both of those things as long as you remind people that the Lord works in mysterious ways.

1112
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,500
We can't know why he tortures us.

1113
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,820
But it's probably for our own good.

1114
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,880
That's the funny part.

1115
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:42,440
We know for sure that he tortures us, but we have faith that it must be for our own good.

1116
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:47,540
I guess that's how it works.

1117
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:48,980
Well, or somebody is good.

1118
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,860
It doesn't have to be your good.

1119
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,020
Maybe somebody a thousand miles away is good.

1120
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,940
It all works out in the end whether you like it or not.

1121
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,360
They all end up on their heads, one and all.

1122
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,760
From the presidents down to the shoeshine boys.

1123
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,900
Every single one ends up the same.

1124
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,160
Except for Bob.

1125
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,900
That's right.

1126
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:11,800
Bob is the exception to the rule and the rule to the exception.

1127
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,200
He's always there and he's always missing.

1128
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:22,140
He is the sine qua non of ipso facto and whatnot.

1129
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,940
And he always has a really cool tie.

1130
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,860
He's a very well-dressed man.

1131
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,160
He can be kind of a difficult, short-duration person.

1132
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:29,580
He's a very personal savior.

1133
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:34,300
I noticed with Chagrin this year that at 7 a.m. I was having to get ready for work.

1134
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,540
Maybe that's why the saucers passed you, because you were getting ready for work.

1135
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,480
Oh, no, I wasn't.

1136
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,800
I didn't start getting ready for work until the appointed moment had passed.

1137
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,560
No, I wouldn't want to do that.

1138
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,140
Right.

1139
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:51,540
But if 7 a.m. passes, it's kind of like, well, damn.

1140
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:53,020
Yeah.

1141
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:58,800
I mean, you turn on the morning news and you notice that nothing is burning or being zapped or anything.

1142
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,760
You know that things are not right.

1143
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:11,200
Well, it starts being disappointing for me the day before, because we all know it starts at the international dateline at 7 a.m.

1144
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:17,240
Well, that's in the middle of the previous afternoon for people in the U.S.

1145
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:25,600
So we would see disasters coming on television across Australia and China and Russia and so forth.

1146
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,100
Unless?

1147
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,480
Well, here's the thing, though.

1148
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,000
You see one station after another go off the air, basically.

1149
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,840
That's what we're going for.

1150
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,000
As they came closer and closer to you and finally.

1151
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:36,440
Unless?

1152
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,780
I mean, but here's the thing, though.

1153
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,860
Whenever it happens and wherever it happens, that's what's going to define 7 a.m., July 5th.

1154
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,100
So wherever it happens, all right, that means it's actually 7 a.m. there.

1155
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:49,780
We'll finally know what time it really is, yeah.

1156
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,120
Yeah.

1157
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,320
We don't know what time it is, either, if we don't know what year it is.

1158
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,800
We can reset our calendars.

1159
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,060
That's right.

1160
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,460
We may be horrified to find that it's several thousand years.

1161
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:58,460


1162
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:05,380
That we were kept on ice on some other planet for a whole long stretch of time that we don't even know about.

1163
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:05,960
Who knows?

1164
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:14,800
Well, the switch to Earth's powers probably took some unspecified amount of time in hibernation or stasis or suspended animation or whatnot.

1165
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,180
We can only speculate.

1166
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:21,800
And, again, the Lord and the aliens work in mysterious ways.

1167
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:22,380
You can't.

1168
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,720
You know, if we could understand them, well, we'd be gods ourselves.

1169
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,440
Oh, of course, that's what the New Age will tell you.

1170
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,980
Oh, you're just as cool as Bob.

1171
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,560
What obvious claptrap?

1172
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,880
What superstitious nonsense?

1173
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,320
Is there room in the same universe for two probabilistic distortions kind of like Bob?

1174
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,700
I mean, what would happen if they came together?

1175
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,000
Which direction would the telephone pole fall, you know?

1176
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:46,600
Right.

1177
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,760
We don't know.

1178
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,720
There might be a Bob Singularity Theory.

1179
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,000
See, Bob and alternate universes are all still Bob.

1180
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,440
Is there predestination?

1181
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:57,800
Yeah.

1182
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:05,500
And can we escape it all through the quantum foam like in some stupid hot sci-fi novel?

1183
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:07,960
I don't know.

1184
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:11,980
You know, with that thought, I actually think it's time to move on for the evening.

1185
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,700
Yeah, my tape's about to run out.

1186
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:14,620
All right, gentlemen.

1187
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,500
My battery.

1188
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,540
Good bye to you, sir.

1189
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,900
Nice talking to you.

1190
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:18,820
Nice talking to you.

1191
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,160
My bladder's about to run out, man.

1192
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:20,960
Just about.

1193
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,700
Just being like an X-Day almost.

1194
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,160
Yeah.

1195
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,020
All right, well, we'll talk to you next week.

1196
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:25,800
All righty.

1197
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,880
All right, all right, all right.

1198
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,820
See you around.

1199
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,060
And that was the official X-Day report.

1200
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,360
You heard it here first.

1201
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:38,060
We're going to take a little break right now and service the public with these public

1202
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:38,840
service announcements.

1203
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,440
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

1204
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,300
Be quiet!

1205
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,120
Ear infections are a common problem for kids.

1206
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,920
Wild animals like squirrels, pigeons, or skunks may have moved in to raise their young.

1207
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:50,600
Gross.

1208
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,200
You have roaches.

1209
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,000
Fernanda Nande-Lemur did it.

1210
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:56,860
I'm a little bit scared.

1211
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:56,860


1212
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:56,860


1213
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:56,860


1214
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:56,860


1215
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:56,860


1216
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:56,860


1217
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:56,860


1218
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:56,860


1219
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:56,860


1220
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:56,860


1221
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:01,040
Have you ever had ostriches before?

1222
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:01,420
Yes.

1223
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,940
Food life changes in the world.

1224
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,320
Hi there, folks.

1225
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,420
It's Albert K Matteo, your host for Covipack.

1226
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,160
I wanted to share with you a message just so we get to know the world.

1227
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,600
We've launched our first ever radio show of SPAC inclusive.

1228
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,360
Ivory Coast U minutos comes to everyone at 2020 11ak today, and the very first episode

1229
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:26,060
has been talked through by my stealing you're paying me to come show you my hot spot.

1230
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:26,840
Hello.

1231
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,340
or by writing to our offices here in Cleveland Heights.

1232
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:38,740
A subgenius or hour of slack or Reverend Ivan Stang at Box 181417.

1233
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:48,440
That's P.O. Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1234
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,420
Praise Bob.

1235
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,560
Cleveland?

1236
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:55,180
Yeah, Cleveland. How about Cleveland?

1237
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:55,960
Cleveland?

1238
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,940
Okay, okay.

1239
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:58,880
Oh, Cleveland.

1240
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,260
It's been canceled until further notice.

1241
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,100
