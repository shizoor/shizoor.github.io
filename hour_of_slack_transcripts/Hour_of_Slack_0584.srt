ðŸŽµ

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,200
Remember, remember, remember, remember

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,880
You need me, and I have come

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,940
Hi Bob

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,580
Hi Bob

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,060
Hi Bob

7
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:16,460
Yeah

8
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,760
Bob, Bob

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,380
Bob

10
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,860
Bob, Bob, Bob

11
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,020
Bob, Bob, Bob

12
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes sir, I like subgenius

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,020
No sir, I don't like pink boys

14
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,820
Yes sir, I love Bob

15
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,720
No sir

16
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,240
No sir

17
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,980
No sir, I do not want to stop Bob

18
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,700
I want Bob in every tree

19
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,700
I just want to give my feast to the thousands

20
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,860
In every flower, in every bee, in every leaf, in every twig

21
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,860
In every cow, in every pig

22
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,720
I want Bob deep fried and deep freezed

23
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,440
I want to feel him in the breeze

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,600
I want to see him in the sky

25
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,080
I hope his fight will catch me

26
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,000
Dear Bob who floats above the ground

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,340
I long to hear the mournful sound

28
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,980
That's made when you emerge from space

29
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,080
And come to this, my dwelling

30
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,120
Dear Bob, each night while I'm asleep

31
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,240
I hope to my house you will creep

32
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,840
And poke your pipe in through the wall

33
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,380
So I'll be burned, remembering all

34
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,740
Dear Bob, it's time to close my eyes

35
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,960
Remember now, it's no surprise

36
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,980
If I should be found dead someday

37
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,640
I'll think that you were in the way

38
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,300
Oh, gimme Bob

39
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,100
Confusing that face

40
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,160
With my own

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,520
Can't remember my place

42
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,940
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

43
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,420
Which reaches from the inner mind to

44
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,480
The subgenius hour of slack

45
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,480
Bob's role on this planet

46
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,700
Is to see that the earth is not sold

47
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,920
On that glorious or terrible day

48
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,880
We call X-Day in 1998

49
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,420
When the men from Planet X arrive

50
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,400
Yeah, now it may sound ludicrous

51
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,980
It may sound ridiculous to many

52
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,580
It may sound impossible

53
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,000
It may sound impossible

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,880
Are you saying that all nuts, all those people

55
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,620
Maybe, yeah, maybe

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,980
Your brothers from the park of space

57
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,280
Are coming with advanced knowledge

58
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,860
To help

59
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,660
Superman

60
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,240
To help

61
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,060


62
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,060


63
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,780
To help

64
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,060
To help

65
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,060


66
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,060


67
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,060


68
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,060


69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,720
To help

70
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:31,720


71
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:31,720


72
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:31,720


73
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:31,720


74
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,280
Bob will save all true believers though in 1998 right?

75
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,100
Actually Bob, if, you better hope that Bob does some wheeling and dealing for your soul come 1998

76
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,300
He is the salesman of the universe here to make sure that the earth and your soul does not get sold

77
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,740
To ah, to the robot mutilators

78
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,900
At least for not too low a price

79
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,720
So you better read that book with all three eyes or however many you have left

80
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,160
And leave the driving to Bob

81
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,080
That's right, you do the walking, let Bob do the talking

82
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,680
Who are these men from Planet X children?

83
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,540
What is waiting there for me?

84
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,740
Bob

85
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:19,860
Gosh

86
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,400
Ah, yes dear friends, well I guess this is one way to start a show

87
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,060
Jesus and Nick and Bob are here to help you out today

88
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,060


89
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,060


90
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,060


91
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,100
Bob and Nicky are here having a business meeting

92
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,300
Reverend Nicky Deathcheck

93
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,240
They're counting through hours of slack masters

94
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,180
Did some good, good prayer partner order a lot of backpipes?

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,660
How many?

96
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,080
Several of them, it's just we're about three months behind

97
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,520
Hey!

98
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,780
What that is a bunch of them

99
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,820
Ones that haven't even been made yet

100
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,720
Oh that's a, those are good choices

101
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,440
The 587, I can't wait to hear that one.

102
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,380
589?

103
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,340
That'll be the...

104
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,680
589 is gonna be the greatest, man.

105
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,380
This one, we are on hour of slack number 584, folks.

106
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,200
Incidentally, 382 days to X-Day, the end of the world.

107
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,480
And we've determined that there will never be an hour of slack number 666

108
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,900
unless we continue to do them on the escape vessels,

109
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,520
but I don't see much point in that.

110
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,060
Someone else?

111
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,320
You might as well come on in.

112
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,040
We got the whole crew in here.

113
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,980
I've just started doing the radio show.

114
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,060
I thought, well, heck, we got all these big minions in here,

115
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,960
sort of rummaging through tapes of shows.

116
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,080
Of all the shows, people actually buy copies of this show.

117
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,420
Folks, I've got a stacked and packed show.

118
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,700
Several of those bands came out with new CDs.

119
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,260
Zug's Rift has a new album out.

120
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,260
And friends, you know something?

121
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,500
Five big bands.

122
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,400
A billion pinheads.

123
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,880
Can't be wrong.

124
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,200
That's the name of the album.

125
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,040
And...

126
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,100
I work on the retard bar

127
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,860
Where blind compliance keeps me from harm

128
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,500
There's only so many hours a day

129
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,320
But I have to sell them to get me my pay

130
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,360
I work on the retard bar

131
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,180
I work on the retard bar

132
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,020
guitar solo

133
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,500
Putting this thing over there

134
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,900
Doing this, doing that

135
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,860
I do the same thing every day

136
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,900
Man, I got it down

137
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,120
I work and I work

138
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,580
But I can't get ahead

139
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,720
Live all this time

140
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,400
Living like a better off dead

141
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,460
I work on the retard farm

142
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,300
I work on the retard farm

143
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,060
I work on the retard farm

144
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,960
I work on the retard farm

145
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,560
I work on the retard farm

146
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,560
I work on the retard farm

147
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:08,780
I know a guy

148
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,380
You can call me

149
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,760
I know a guy who refuses to buy it

150
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,660
He never goes to work out and then to try it

151
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,180
But he's always broke and can't go on a diet

152
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,180
There's hell to pay if you try to defy it

153
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,920
I work on the retard farm

154
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,780
I work on the retard farm

155
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,940
Yes I do

156
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,620
I work on the retard farm

157
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,380
I work on the retard farm

158
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,160
Yes I do

159
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,160


160
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,180
I work on the retard farm

161
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,360
And friends, you know something?

162
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,920
Five billion pinheads can't be wrong.

163
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,160
That's the name of the album.

164
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,320
And the guys that used to do Silica Gel

165
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,500
have two new Noise albums out.

166
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,420
We have The Truth About the Greys

167
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,180
which we will be revealing.

168
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,000
The Greys and Jesus, by the way.

169
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,420
We're going to go ahead and tell them about that, Lord.

170
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,620
See, he doesn't even think of it.

171
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,600
He's paying attention to filling your orders, dear friend.

172
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,180
We've got Heba Phreniatrix.

173
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,640
We've got the KPFA show.

174
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,740
We've got more Suzy the Flusie's Apocalypse

175
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,080
Saturday night collection.

176
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,820
We've got more Stupid Apocalypse

177
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,180
and thrift store music from Yeti's for Bob.

178
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,400
And we have Slack Jeopardy!

179
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,340
recordings of the subgenius trivia game show

180
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,100
from our Dallas Clinch meeting.

181
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,140
Friends, here in Dallas

182
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,200
we've been holding monthly meetings

183
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,640
only not in a church.

184
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,520
It's in a bar.

185
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,780
Well, we just...

186
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,120
The bar just got sold to somebody else

187
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,040
so we're going to have to do them

188
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,500
in another venue.

189
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,920
But we do prefer bars.

190
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,180
We do prefer bars.

191
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,120
We do prefer bars.

192
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,120


193
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,120


194
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,280
We may start mixing

195
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,060
Hour of Slack live at those.

196
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,940
And I've got so much X Day music.

197
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,600
By the time you hear this

198
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,660
we're going to be in Sherman, New York

199
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,700
at Brushwood Campground.

200
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,400
Not the Rainbow Gathering.

201
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,940
It's not the Rainbow...

202
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,260
Yeah, we're going to...

203
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,900
We're just going to drive on past this time.

204
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,400
Yes, friends.

205
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,060
We're going to be...

206
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,860
The All Naked Baptisms

207
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,860
will be practicing

208
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,160
for the next few days.

209
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,800
For the...

210
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,360
For the pure pleasure

211
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,280
that awaits us

212
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,840
on the actual X Day

213
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,480
which of course

214
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,500
is not this year

215
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,900
on July 5th, 1997

216
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,640
but next year

217
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,480
1998

218
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,200
on July 5th

219
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,660
when we...

220
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,820
Well, you've heard the...

221
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,840
You've heard the...

222
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,760
You've heard that routine.

223
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,440
If you haven't sent us

224
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,240
your love offering

225
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,500
and become a minister

226
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,020
in this church

227
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,700
you're going to fry

228
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,040
while

229
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,800
we...

230
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:36,840
escape.

231
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

232
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:38,620
Ooh.

233
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,880
Friend, the elder gods

234
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,700
have been sleeping

235
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,580
but they're waking up.

236
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,880
And you've got to find that word of Bob

237
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,660
before it's too late.

238
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,600
Before 1998, July 5th,

239
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,520
the end of the world,

240
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,180
the end of time as we know it.

241
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,740
When the very...

242
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,040
The very...

243
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,920
The score is racked up.

244
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,140
The score is racked up

245
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,960
and it's the time and a half time.

246
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,660
Yes, sir.

247
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,240
We just won't have a chance.

248
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,260
They'll be able to have their ways with us.

249
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,800
You've heard about the smallpox blankets

250
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,860
and the Indians, you know.

251
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,860
Well, this is going to be...

252
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,860
technological viral infectation

253
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,580
of an entire planet

254
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,420
with means of doing things

255
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,220
and means of destruction,

256
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,160
means of alteration

257
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,120
of genetic patterns,

258
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,060
means of controlling people's minds

259
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,300
that we don't even...

260
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,080
To us, it's magic.

261
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,340
Any significantly advanced form of science

262
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,320
becomes magic.

263
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,560
If that smoke comes out of Bob's pipe no more,

264
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,520
then we shall be reduced

265
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,800
to that can of warm beer

266
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
under the bed of a hungover elder god

267
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,220
at 11.30 on a Sunday morning.

268
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,440
Bob is here to make sure

269
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,840
that instead of it being a bomb,

270
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:35,840


271
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,980
it's the end of the world.

272
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,840
It's the end of their world.

273
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,240
And the new...

274
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,720
The new Jerusalem.

275
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,040
The new Jerusalem where slack begins.

276
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,360
Yes, dear friends.

277
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,700
Oh, former subgenius Pastor Buck Naked

278
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,420
there with G. Gordon Gordon.

279
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,380
Oh, God.

280
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,540
That was so many long years ago.

281
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,800
Oh, yes.

282
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,100
And yes, friends,

283
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,400
and slack does begin somewhere, somehow.

284
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,580
And I'm gonna lay some slack on you right now.

285
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,280
This is a song that's not by a subgenius band,

286
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,560
and it's not about Bob.

287
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,280
I just like this song.

288
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,680
Let me tell you about a girl I know

289
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,020
Had a drink about an hour ago

290
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,700
Sitting in the corner by herself

291
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,020
In a bar in downtown hell

292
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,280
She heard a noise as she looked through the door

293
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,520
And saw a man she'd never seen before

294
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,000
Light skin, light blue eyes

295
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,300
A double chin and a plastic smile

296
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,700
Well, her heart erased as he walked in the door

297
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,120
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar

298
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,280
My brand new car is parked right outside

299
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,720
Had you lied to go for the ride

300
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,080
And she said, wait a minute

301
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,100
I have to think

302
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,260
He said, that's fine

303
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,540
May I please buy you a drink?

304
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,740
One drink turned into three or four

305
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,620
And then that thing got into his car

306
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,980
And they drove away someplace for fun

307
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,140
Now, babe, the time has come

308
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,300
How'd you like to have a little fun?

309
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,380
And she said, if we could only pace beyond our way

310
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,440
I would not run

311
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,780
That's when things got out of control

312
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,040
She didn't want to

313
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,240
He had his way

314
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,300
She said, let's go

315
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,560
He said, no way

316
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,500
Come on, babe, it's your lucky day

317
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,780
Shut your mouth, we're gonna do it my way

318
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,080
Come on, baby, don't be afraid

319
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,740
If it wasn't for date rape, I'd never get laid

320
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,220
He finished up and he started the car

321
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,600
He turned around and drove back to the bar

322
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,840
He said, no, baby, don't be sad

323
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,260
In my opinion, you weren't half bad

324
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,840
She picked up a rock, threw it in the car

325
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,860
Hit him in the head, now he's got a big scar

326
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,100
Come on, party people, she'll listen to me

327
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,260
Date rape, stylee!

328
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,280
The next day, she went to her drawer

329
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,640
Looked up her local attorney at law

330
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,840
Went to the phone and filed a police report

331
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,200
And then she took the guy's ass to court

332
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,540
Well, the day he stood in front of the judge

333
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,820
He screamed, she lies, that little slut!

334
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,220
The judge knew he was full of sh**

335
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,100
And he gave him 25 years

336
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,700
And now his heart is filled with tears

337
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,340
One night in jail, it was getting late

338
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,700
He was butt raped by a large inmate

339
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,340
And he screamed

340
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,900
But the guards paid no attention to his cries

341
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,620
That's when things got out of control

342
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,220
The moral of the date-wretch story

343
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,620
It does not pay to be drunk and horny

344
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,640
But that's the way it had to be

345
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,960
They locked him up and threw away the keys

346
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,360
But I can't take pity on men of his kind

347
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,740
Even though he now takes it in the behind

348
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,200
That's the way it had to be

349
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,340
They locked him up and threw away the keys

350
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,600
But I can't take pity on men of his kind

351
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,760
Even though he now takes it in the behind

352
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,140
Date rape!

353
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,060
DAVID

354
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,060


355
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,560
Roman

356
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,000
David

357
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,400
the Church of the Subgenius or anything, but it's a good vengeance song because the bad pink boy

358
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:13,840
gets his just desserts in the end, one might say. That's Sublime, the band called Sublime,

359
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:21,260
from their older album 40 Ounces to Freedom, which has a Dobbs head printed on the CD itself.

360
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,560
Yes, friends, and what we're listening to in the background here is the Potatoes

361
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:33,900
from Dallas, Texas, doing that old Nino Rota theme from Eight and a Half. And friends,

362
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,280
we've got some sounds coming up. I hope you have your headphones on. And if you're listening by

363
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,540
internet, it ain't going to do you a whole lot of good because we broadcast that in mono. But

364
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,900
really, I've got some, you know, we like negative land around here.

365
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:56,420
And there is a band out of Raleigh, North Carolina that used to be called Silicon,

366
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:03,260
Cajal. They have two new CDs out under the name Polycarp. And what's the other one?

367
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:13,600
Anyway, they're from Wifflefish, Racco. Beatless. Beatless is the other one. And they do sound

368
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:20,500
effects music. Friends, I love sound effects music. It's not really music. It's just sounds.

369
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:26,100
But I like the sounds of prying things. So let's,

370
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,140

I'm sorry.

395
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,040
I'm sorry.

396
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,720
It's a sunny day.

397
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,500
And I wouldn't have it any other way.

398
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,660
It's a beautiful day.

399
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:01,880
And I just want to go out to play.

400
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:08,700
But you know when I'm feeling good.

401
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:16,020
I just want a piece of you.

402
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,840
It's a beautiful day.

403
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,640
And I don't care what the big boys say.

404
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,520
With a little bit of color in mind.

405
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,560
Make it.

406
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,840
Just all the time.

407
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,840
But you know when I'm feeling blue.

408
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:56,860
I just want a piece of you.

409
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,960
What can you do?

410
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,520
Just a piece of you.

411
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,480
What is a.

412
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,220
A poor girl to choose.

413
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,660
When I call you up.

414
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,200
When I dial you up.

415
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,480
Oh, you just.

416

Say you love me.

417
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,680
But you know.

418
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,660
When I'm feeling blue.

419
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,220
I just want.

420
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,380
A piece of.

421
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:37,900
You.

422
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,860
A piece of you.

00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:45,880


424
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,760

uh

468
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,320
dear friends

469
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:19,640
now

470
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,600
we'll go back

471
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,360
to uh

472
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,160
delving into

473
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,400
to x-day

474
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,280
tapes

475
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,120
and uh

476
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,740
and uh

477
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,460
on side two

478
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,980
i think we will get into the truth

479
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,600
about the grays

480
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:29,920
uh

481
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,600
thank you

482
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,500
especially if you got a white copy

483
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,660
now if you got a white copy and a brown copy

484
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,280
it's a little bit of difference

485
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,840
but they're both worth more

486
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,080
than a bundle of thousand dollar treasury bills

487
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,040
a foot high

488
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,020
room full of bills

489
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,680
there will be people trading paragraphs

490
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,780
of that pamphlet

491
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,480
for box cars

492
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,200
full of food

493
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
we think it will replace currency

494
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,840
tracing

495
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,140
bob will replace drugs

496
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,700
religion

497
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,780
rock music

498
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,860
and everything

499
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,240
in a great paradise

500
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,900
of unrestrained sales

501
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,640
unrestrained um

502
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,180
slack and sex

503
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,220
and if you have any drug users in your audience

504
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,040
we should note that the book of the subgenius

505
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,820
we found in a test

506
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,220
that was conducted in austin recently

507
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,080
that if adulterated street drugs are thrown on top of the cover

508
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,420
all of the uh

509
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,440
non-narcotic qualities are completely erased

510
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,080
and uh

511
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,520
indicated uh

512
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,420
as negative

513
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:18,740
and or

514
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,760
All impurities are destroyed.

515
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,220
All impurities are removed, giving you that 1% of pure that you paid for

516
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,180
out of whatever it was that you were...

517
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,900
By the way...

518
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,240
That's better than pyramid power.

519
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,760
Yes, much better than pyramid power.

520
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,620
I'd like to say those...

521
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,380
Because it's in a plane rather than going to a point.

522
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,900
Book of the subgenius. That's it.

523
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,120
Book of the subgenius.

524
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,260
Come to fellow, everyone knows.

525
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,220
Bob.

526
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:40,900
Bob!

527
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,500
Bob!

528
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,680
Yes, Bob.

529
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,480
Hey, man.

530
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,240
That is one thing.

531
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,180
Who is it?

532
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,320
Who is it?

533
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,600
One strange dude.

534
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,840
I think Bob is just the guy with the pipe.

535
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,180
Oh, that's crazy talk.

536
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,540
You hand him that pamphlet.

537
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,580
Oh, friends, the scales fall from their eyes.

538
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,020
But you know, when those pink boys discover Bob,

539
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,520
it's either truth or death.

540
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,380
For the love of Bob can kill normals, friends, yes?

541
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,300
Yes, but Bob's men are moving on this planet.

542
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,400
Oh, that planetary alignment that came up.

543
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,860
The Jupiter effect.

544
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,840
Oh, I'm now sure that may have caused earthquakes.

545
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,760
And volcanoes and the Earth to tilt on its axis.

546
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,660
And men will, in the end times to come,

547
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,480
men will gnash their brains and think backwards.

548
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,600
Dead Christians will come up from their graves

549
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,100
shambling and rotting like not of the living dead.

550
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,640
But through it all, helping to profit from it all

551
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,780
is that one mighty link between heaven and earth.

552
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,200
That Bob.

553
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,280
Oh, yeah, I can see it now.

554
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,160
The miracle of the Bob world is unfolding.

555
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,420
They're wading up to their knees in blood, dear friends.

556
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,660
But it's the blood of the baptism of a mighty fist.

557
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,240
Face of Bob.

558
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,740
That face that can pile through eight-foot-thick titanium steel

559
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,880
conspiracy fork-knock stores with that mighty pipe.

560
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,800
Oh, he ain't from another planet.

561
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,680
He ain't something we have to bow down and kiss to.

562
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,340
He's a man.

563
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,520
Oh, well, you can pull Bob's leg and he'll laugh right along with you

564
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,320
because Bob, he's been a fool just like you and me.

565
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,680
Bob's been a pathetic fool.

566
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,720
And I tell you what, that J.R. Bob Dobbs will be a fool again.

567
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,060
He's a fool today.

568
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,360
He's a fool tomorrow because he's the same Bob.

569
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,340
He's always the same Bob and he's working for you and me.

570
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,380
Well, do you guys have anything to say to the prayer partners

571
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,560
out there listening to the radio?

572
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,820
Well, you guys are just full of you.

573
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,660
This is just such a slack-filled.

574
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,080
Listen to these wild partying.

575
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,360
We're going to take our party downstairs.

576
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,260
Yeah, man.

577
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,720
You're not invited.

578
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,280
I don't want to.

579
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,700
This is very frequently the case, folks.

580
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,960
I'm up here working.

581
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:47,720
He's boring.

582
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,320
For Bob.

583
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,160
And these babes and the Lord are down there frolicking.

584
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,680
And actually, they're not.

585
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,820
I'm partying.

586
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,900
I'm the one who's partying.

587
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,800
You guys are shuffling through tapes and trying to fill orders.

588
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
I guess somebody's...

589
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,440
Don't give me that kind of look.

590
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,780
Someone has to have slack.

591
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,440
Yeah.

592
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:06,820
Yeah.

593
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,540
That's right.

594
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,960
Hey, this is my idea of slack.

595
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,260
Trying to get me hooked on Bryce.

596
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,200
Yeah, I'm just trying to get...

597
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,880
I just started...

598
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,580
I gave her a quick run-through on the 3D computer program so that she would be...

599
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,860
It's like first...

600
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,600
That's right.

601
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,840
First hits free.

602
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,700
Yeah, I gave her a bunch of programs.

603
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,600
Here, these are free.

604
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,700
You just go ahead and take these, Nikki.

605
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,300
Mm-hmm.

606
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,140
Yeah.

607
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:30,980
Yeah.

608
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,080
It's loads of fun.

609
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,460
Next time.

610
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:34,800
Yeah.

611
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,140
Next time.

612
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,480
Next time she's going to be going,

613
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:42,360
you wouldn't happen to have a copy of Ray Dream Designer, would you?

614
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,360
I mean, I'd be willing to pay you.

615
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,180
I can wait.

616
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,580
I've been in no hurry or anything.

617
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,660
It's like, he said he was going to come by and bring that program.

618
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,860
I've been waiting here.

619
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,860
We've been waiting for an hour.

620
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,800
I'm sure he's going to have the stuff.

621
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,060
I hope something didn't happen to him.

622
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,580
He said he was going to have the stuff.

623
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,160
The proggies.

624
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,520
The connection was bad.

625
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,060
Huh?

626
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,760
He didn't have the connection.

627
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,940
Yeah, man.

628
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,060
Couldn't meet my connection.

629
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:12,880
Oh.

630
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,880
One, two, three, four.

631
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,360
You crashed.

632
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,040
Okay.

633
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,080
I'm out of here.

634
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,780
You promised.

635
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,720
You promised that all the time.

636
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,240
I'm going to go whack off the negative light.

637
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,260
I'll leave you to your self.

638
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,140
My reverence, thanks.

639
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,160
Leave me.

640
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,460
Leave me alone.

641
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,760
But I'm not alone, friends.

642
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,800
I'm with you.

643
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,160
I'm with you.

644
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,380
Good God.

645
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,780
What in the name of sweet screaming Jesus is this world coming to?

646
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,080
People bitch.

647
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,100
People gripe.

648
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,940
This is a sign of the end times.

649
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,540
That's a sign of the end times.

650
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:02,020
When you should all be hollering, it's all a sign of the end times.

651
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:09,060
What, brothers and sisters, will happen to this heretic on July 5th, 1998?

652
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,940
Would anyone like to take a guess what's going to happen to this heretic when the saucers come?

653
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,000
Bring it!

654
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:15,180


655
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,380
Bring it!

656
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,520
He will be on the escape vessels on July 5th, 1998.

657
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:27,900
He will be on those saucers with the sex goddesses because he paid his $30 subgenius membership

658
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,440
fee.

659
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,180
He had his membership card in the church.

660
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,820
And even if you were to go out today and turn your back on Bob, forget that you ever heard

661
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:40,820
any of this, even if you were to go out tomorrow and get a job, maybe even as president of

662
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,700
the United States or a cop somewhere ripping apart people's cars searching for dope.

663
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:50,160
You would still be able to get on the pleasure saucers as long as you had that subgenius membership

664
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,140
card, as long as you paid for that subgenius membership card.

665
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,400
Can you say the same?

666
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,140
Can you say that you're going to be on those escape vessels on July 5th?

667
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,560
Do you think you're going to squeak by just because you're cool?

668
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,180
You think coolness is going to get you onto those space vessels?

669
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,040
Well, what are you going to do on X day?

670
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,160
When suddenly all of a sudden, you're going to be on those escape vessels.

671
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,540
All your paid in full subgenius buddies disappear.

672
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,640
Many people would say, well, I'm not going to join up with the church of the subgenius.

673
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:32,100
The church of the subgenius is an organization of non-joiners.

674
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,540
So I'm not going to join.

675
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,720
Well, I got a surprise for you folks.

676
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,660
You're not going to be joining this on X day either.

677
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,140
I'm not going to join.

678
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,140


679
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,140


680
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,140


681
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,140


682
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,140


683
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,140


684
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:53,060
One of my own pretending bobs beside me.

685
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:59,920
In the dark, his dots in pipe, they guide me.

686
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:06,640
Without Bob, I smell his frop around me,

687
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,500
and when I have no slack, I touch my gland and Bob has bound me.

688
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,140
On my journey to love, I have only one-way guard, we're taking you with us on our stay,

689
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:15,140


690
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:15,140


691
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:15,140


692
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:27,020
All the normals act like dumb shits. Without slack, the sweat runs down my armpits.

693
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:37,080
The next day, I'll see the saucers coming, and all I need is Bob and me forever and forever.

694
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:51,420
But until I spend my thirty bucks, I'm just ranting to myself and not to Bob.

695
00:35:52,740 --> 00:36:06,520
And although I know that I am screwed, still I say, there's a day of pain.

696
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:20,120
I love Bob, but when the rapture's over, he'll be gone. The earth will be in ruins.

697
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:32,420
Without him, the world around me changes. The conspiracy is everywhere. The malls are full of pink boys.

698
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,500
I love Bob.

699
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:46,480
But every day, I don't spend that thirty bucks. I'm only just pretending.

700
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:58,040
Without me, Bob's world will go on burning. Our next day, Bob will have this life that I'll never know.

701
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,040
I love Bob.

702
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,060
I love Bob.

703
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,220
I love Bob.

704
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,160
Not only on my own.

705
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,160


706
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,420
I love Bob.

707
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:16,440
Not only on my own.

708
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,620
I love Bob.

709
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:21,620


710
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:21,620


711
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:21,620


712
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:21,620


713
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:21,620


714
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:21,620


715
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,800
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

716
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:33,020
Sivet Stang there, dear friends, my little dafter with her own song on Bob's own.

717
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,060
But now it is time for me to read some more to you from Silicon Valley.

718
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,060


719
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,060


720
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:44,780
Embrace by John Shirley, the science fiction novel which has embedded in it the truth about

721
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:51,320
the Greys, or the Zaytans, as they are called, as we continue here.

722
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:58,760
Certain strains of humanity developed, apparently spontaneously, a gene that had made them unusually

723
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:07,640
interactive with the ambient Iamton Continuum, with the sea of mind that intertwines quantum

724
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:13,200
probability and which can manipulate quantum probability and improbability.

725
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:19,560
They communed with this continuum and called it God.

726
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:27,740
The Zaytans have no natural capacity for this communing, this manipulation, this magic,

727
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,740
this grace.

728
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:38,100
And so they tried to experiment with humans and so forth, but the thing that activates

729
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:45,320
it is beyond the Greys, or the Zaytans, because they refuse to let the higher take part in

730
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,660
them.

731
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:54,500
The Zaytans have been controlling, but not controlled humanity in every particular, nor

732
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,280
wanted to.

733
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,740
A chance is always a necessary part of any long-term.

734
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,380
For centuries they would merely sit back and watch.

735
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:09,060
However, certain humans are telepathically sensitive.

736
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:16,640
And from time to time, the Zaytans influenced these certain humans through telepathic signals

737
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:23,100
sent from a transmitter which is hidden in space, past the orbit of the moon, a transmitter

738
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,260
corresponding in position to the star Sirius.

739
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,660
A small hidden moon.

740
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,860
The moon of Earth.

741
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:37,820
They influenced men to seek out those who carried this gene in human bloodlines, this

742
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:45,640
inherited proclivity for the apparently divine, and to refine it, develop it into a form they

743
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,440
could exploit.

744
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:52,080
They did this through, among other things, certain royal families in Europe, descended

745
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,800
from Joseph of Arimathea and Mary Magdalene, and Jesus himself.

746
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,860
Who fathered Magdalene's children after he escaped from Jerusalem.

747
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,960
He wasn't crucified.

748
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,500
Well, he was crucified, but he didn't actually die on the cross.

749
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:15,280
Jesus was active under other names in Rome and the Far East afterwards.

750
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:23,020
The Zaytans tried to keep these sacred families in power so as to protect this special DNA

751
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,420
through a variety of human organizations.

752
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,780
For example, the Priory of the Holy Cross.

753
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,600
The Priory of Zion.

754
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,300
An ancient and secret organization of which Dr. Le Guim was a member.

755
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:41,520
In fact, Le Guim was an initiated member of a series of interlinked secret orders culminating

756
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:47,960
in a certain arch-Masonic cult wherein he was initiated of the 23rd degree of the order

757
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:54,200
which underlay all orders which formed MJ15 at the behest of the Zaytans, but you know,

758
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,640
friends many organizations.

759
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,320
They were supposed to work for their own purposes.

760
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,960
Like the P2, the True Knights of Malta, and of course the MJ12, and even the Chinese Tong.

761
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,540
All of these were in fact working for agents of the Greys, the Zaytans.

762
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,480
It was always easier to use human resources for building bases and so forth than to import

763
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:23,840
resources from Zeta Reticuli, and it was easier to buy these resources here than to endlessly

764
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,620
have to commandeer them.

765
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:32,460
So money was needed, secret bank accounts and deals with drug dealers and the CIA and

766
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,260
the Vatican were needed.

767
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:44,740
Yes, dear friends, some of the truth, the hidden truth there from John Shirley's hardcover

768
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,320
sci-fi book, Silicon Embrace.

769
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,900
Pick up on it, man.

770
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,740
Do it.

771
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,380
You must.

772
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,840
And now, well I don't...

773
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,600
I don't know.

774
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,580
OK, I'm going to do it.

775
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,180
Friends, here is a recording...

776
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:02,980
of my...

777
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,840
wife.

778
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:10,480
I have to tell you a story about a man named John.

779
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,060
He could barely keep his family fun.

780
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,340
So?

781
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:21,540
He went out one day to hunt.

782
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,600
And he saw these giant pigeons.

783
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:25,600


784
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:25,600


785
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:25,600


786
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:35,460
footprints. He could sit in them. They were about a foot deep and he wondered where they came from.

787
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:46,620
Did a monster really come by or was someone playing a big joke on him? If he could find that monster

788
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:54,900
he'd be able to eat all that monster and feed it to his family for a long time to come.

789
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:04,200
So he started looking for the monster following the tracks up and down the hills

790
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,220
and into the valleys. He even found some of the monster's scat.

791
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:23,360
I really like them. I love them, the scat. He found rat bones and deer bones.

792
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,300
And was able to

793
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:25,580
and was able to

794
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:25,580


795
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,980
symbol an entire skeleton of a wolf.

796
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,780
And I'm losing, I can't think of anything.

797
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:42,240
He took all the bones home to his family

798
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,320
to show them how the wolf was put together.

799
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,240
And the children went to the library

800
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,760
and found all kinds of books on wolves

801
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:01,440
and learned all the names of the bones in the wolf's body.

802
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,400
But they died of starvation

803
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,700
because Jeff never found the monster

804
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,700
and could not keep his family fed.

805
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,060
The end.

806
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,360
That is an anxiety-producing term.

807
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,800
You gotta do, you gotta learn one word.

808
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,160
And the word is...

809
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,000
Wee!

810
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,320
Since we have a priest among us,

811
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,840
perhaps he would like to comment on this subject.

812
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,440
Lie on the floor, arms at your side.

813
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,720
Now hold the legs very straight and point the toes.

814
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,320
And if one

815
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:52,320


816
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:52,320


817
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:52,320


818
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,120
Thedle talalk too,

819
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,840
de thÃ­nh mÃ¨dite xÃ¬?

820
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,500
xÃ¬!

821
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,680
It's a record of all my favorite songs!

822
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,940
White boys are so pretty.

823
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,960
Remember kids, I am your friend.

824
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,840
To many of us, that is an anxiety-producing term.

825
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,720
Oh, I get the idea.

826
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,020
Ouch!

827
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,140
Oh yeah!

828
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,000
By now, most of you women in the audience are saying to yourselves,

829
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,780
how can I meet the love god?

830
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,320
What can you do that's fantastic?

831
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,280
Bizarre.

832
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,560
Oh, boy.

833
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,300
Boy, I'm plumb tuckered out.

834
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,240
Was it a rug or was it something else?

835
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,060
What was the floor like?

836
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,080
This, as recreated from a court transcript,

837
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,860
is what testifying was like for a nine-year-old girl we'll call sodomized,

838
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,360
raped, injected with drugs, and physically abused.

839
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,880
She was a victim of a nine-year-old girl we'll call Shelly.

840
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:33,340
During the trial, she and her sister received death threats from her mother and grandmother.

841
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,400
For their protection, the girls were separated from their father,

842
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,000
who was placed in protective custody.

843
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,420
UCLA psychiatrist Spencer,

844
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,940
can be enough to trigger a severe emotional reaction.

845
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,460
Did anybody put their privates in your bottom?

846
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,320
Okay.

847
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:58,340
Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to walk from here?

848
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,820
That depends.

849
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,620
Go to your lawn where you want to get to.

850
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,960
I don't much care where.

851
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:09,920
Then it...

852
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,220
It doesn't matter which way you walk.

853
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:13,860
No, no.

854
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,520
So long as I get somewhere.

855
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,040
Oh.

856
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,760
You're sure to do that?

857
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,440
If you only walk long enough.

858
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,400
But I don't want to go among mad people.

859
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,140
Oh, you can't help that.

860
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,760
We're all mad here.

861
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:35,840
I'm mad.

862
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,820
And you're mad.

863
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,640
How do you know?

864
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,900
How do you know I'm mad?

865
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,600
Well, you must be.

866
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,280
Or else, you wouldn't have come here.

867
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,400
We're all mad.

868
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,760
I tell you, we're all mad.

869
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,280
You're mad.

870
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,740
And I'm mad.

871
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,360
And everyone here is mad.

872
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,580
We're all mad.

873
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:00,900
I tell you.

874
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,340
I'm mad.

875
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:02,740
I'm mad.

876
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,360
You're mad.

877
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,500
I'm mad.

878
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,300
You're mad.

879
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,820
Stay tuned for the adventures of Ace Budlow, Psychotic Detective.

880
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,400
As the Duke of Madness radio program continues.

881
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,140
Now, this caller was there a couple of times, Dave.

882
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,280
With us.

883
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,500
What?

884
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:19,560
Spiritually.

885
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,360
Not you, but you can be with us now.

886
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:22,980
Not you, no.

887
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,980
By drinking the radio beer that's in front of you.

888
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,320
Authorized to blaspheme by the gods themselves.

889
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,080
But the other caller that's kissing you in your little caller ear there, that guy was with us.

890
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,280
Incompatible with all major world religions.

891
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:34,860
All right, there we go.

892
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:35,140
Okay.

893
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,740
Now, this caller kind of feels the way I did in the desert.

894
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,120
As I told Reverend Hal.

895
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,580
Hey, did you get to the desert?

896
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,740
Did you make it out there?

897
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,480
Oh, I didn't tell you what happened?

898
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:43,840
Sure.

899
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,820
No, no, what happened?

900
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,340
Pretend I'm pretty happy, you know?

901
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:46,880
Yeah, okay.

902
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:47,600
Just pretend.

903
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,400
When you guys go up to the clubhouse and start dropping anvils on people.

904
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:51,860
Yeah.

905
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:52,700
It's sort of like.

906
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,500
Okay, there goes one.

907
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,120
Hal's launching those anvils on an old catapult.

908
00:48:58,620 --> 00:48:59,180
That's right.

909
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,740
If it stays together, I'll try a third one.

910
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,360
Oh, there goes another one.

911
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,400
Right on the little caller.

912
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,340
And welcome back to Slack.

913
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:07,720
Jeff, what's up?

914
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:07,720


915
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:07,980
I'm a celebrity.

916
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:08,980
Where are the scores are?

917
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:09,760
Matt, 400.

918
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:10,620
Holly, 400.

919
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,660
Shelby, 300.

920
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,200
Man, I can't believe I was there.

921
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,840
And Holly, I mean, Shelby, you have control of the board.

922
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,700
World leaders.

923
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,920
World leaders for 400.

924
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,860
And the answer is cousin of Mickey Gilly, Jerry Lee Lewis.

925
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:28,740
This preacher was caught with a hoe Bob Dobbs wouldn't sleep with.

926
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,020
You know who it is?

927
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,120
Shelby buzzes in.

928
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:31,920
Hey, hey, hey.

929
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,740
Jimmy Swagger.

930
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,620
Jimmy Swagger is correct.

931
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,500
Four, 400.

932
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:37,700
Oh, my gosh.

933
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:37,840
400.

934
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,520
Slack points.

935
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,900
Shelby jumps out and leaves with 700 points.

936
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,460
And Shelby, you have control of the board.

937
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:46,820
Control it, baby.

938
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,040
Go.

939
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:49,820
Let's see.

940
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,540
We haven't done any of the subgenius stuff, have we?

941
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,800
Subgenius, gods, and saints.

942
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:53,760
Four?

943
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,240
Four?

944
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:54,700
I don't know.

945
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,140
What is it?

946
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:55,480
I don't play with 100.

947
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,420
You can go 100 to 500.

948
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,300
100, I guess.

949
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,740
Subgenius, gods, and saints for 100.

950
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,900
And the answer is?

951
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,520
Something has happened in the motor show.

952
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:07,700
All being of Time, Space, and Dimension, who took up salesman J.R. Bob Dobbs to fill

953
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:07,700


954
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:07,700


955
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:07,700


956
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:07,700


957
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:07,700


958
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:07,700


959
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,320
the Messiah.

960
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,240
Oh, come on, guys.

961
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:10,840
What is it?

962
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,460
He didn't hear it.

963
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,420
All being of Time, Space, and Dimension, who took up salesman J.R. Bob Dobbs to be the

964
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:17,800
Messiah.

965
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:18,440
Uh-oh.

966
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,300
I don't want to hear it.

967
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,140
Shelby.

968
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,040
The Exes?

969
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,740
And Reverend May.

970
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,080
Wait, wait.

971
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:24,720
I beep first.

972
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,660
Is that terrible?

973
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,280
Jehovah One.

974
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,360
Who is Jehovah One?

975
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,280
Holly beeps in with Jehovah One.

976
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,620
Jehovah One is correct for 100.

977
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,260
Slack points.

978
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,220
I would have gotten it wrong anyway.

979
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:32,880
I would have said, vote.

980
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:33,940
I would have said, vote, team.

981
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,600
And Holly, you have control of the board.

982
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:37,680


983
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:37,680


984
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,140
Oh, that's early pamphlet boy.

985
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,680
Oh, let's go with whatever's next in the music scene.

986
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,220
200, 300, whatever's next.

987
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:51,420
The music scene for 200, and the answer is Shock Metal Band, who has joined the

988
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,220
Subgenius Foundation in their own war against a conspiracy.

989
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,060
Reverend Matt.

990
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,840
Who am Gwar?

991
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,820
Gwar is correct for 200 slack points.

992
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,800
Who dies?

993
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,620
Who chats?

994
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:07,660
Who dies?

995
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:07,660


996
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:07,660


997
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:07,660


998
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:07,660


999
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:07,660


1000
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:07,660


1001
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:07,660


1002
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,240
You.

1003
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:35,480
Like I said, you can rat my name.

1004
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,260
I hate murder.

1005
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:37,260


1006
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:37,660
Yeah, like a piece of Energie.

1007
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:38,320
To the slaughter

1008
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,640
What are you going to do?

1009
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,020
What will be your habitat?

1010
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,440
When we get done with you

1011
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,060
Are you gonna cry for your mama?

1012
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,500
Or are you gonna have a good time?

1013
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,000
Are you gonna be a bohab?

1014
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,180
When it's your turn to die

1015
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,680
The dog is playing the crazy

1016
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,220
Dread them all around

1017
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,220
Anarchy

1018
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:01,880
Chaos

1019
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,960
Rural streets

1020
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,660
It's a randorock party town

1021
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,100
Your pain isn't turning your brain

1022
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,480
It isn't burning in your sanitation

1023
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,840
So why hide?

1024
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,620
The final hour's here, now wrap your thermal beer

1025
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,260
You're only king for one time

1026
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,560
Come on and get the job, we're gonna have some fun

1027
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,680
Nothing else to lose

1028
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,860
Breaking all the rules

1029
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,380
The only really winning device

1030
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,500
Is all the sinning, sinning feels so fine

1031
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,180
You're running out of time

1032
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,200
Ashes to ashes

1033
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,040
And

1034
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,740
That's the nut

1035
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,160
It's always one hell of a party

1036
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,360
When Ragnarok rolls around

1037
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,300
Ragnarok is low, Ragnarok is low

1038
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,520
It's time to trash the planet

1039
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,760
Ragnarok and man, no ground

1040
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,520
Ragnarok is low, Ragnarok is low

1041
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,120
Welcome to Valhalla

1042
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,300
Do not be afraid

1043
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,520
Now you are a

1044
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:05,920
Zombie

1045
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,480
And all your friends are dead

1046
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,760
It all gets rarer than awesome

1047
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,880
When you get backstage

1048
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,920
Everybody takes a grounder

1049
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,780
I hope you're undressed

1050
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:17,060
Hey

1051
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,640
With a jump alone

1052
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,980
You're failing, finding out

1053
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,700
And you wanna have one more time

1054
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:24,540
Looking for a lover, no need a world

1055
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,460
Have a ride, a rock and roll, roll by

1056
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,420
You're only by somebody

1057
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,620
Against the milly bloody

1058
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,140
Feeling then I'm talking, feeling then I'm joking

1059
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:35,700
Floating like a bomb

1060
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,740
Now you're running out of time

1061
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:39,860
Dust

1062
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,820
To dust

1063
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:34,660


1064
00:54:34,660 --> 00:55:04,660


1065
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,560
And the church of the subgenius

1066
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,080
Send a self address stamped envelope to

1067
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,240
Got your pencil ready?

1068
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,660
Bob, P.O. Box 140306

1069
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,660
Dallas Texas 75214

1070
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,180
That's Bob

1071
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,020
P.O. Box 140306

1072
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,200
Dallas T bef

1073
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:22,660
75214

1074
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,640
Stay tuned and

1075
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,820
Praise! Bob

1076
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:30,260
Yeah praise Bob man

1077
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,260
Friends stay tuned

1078
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,640
For uh gelato

1079
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,580
July 5th, 1998.

1080
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:40,960
It seems like everybody's trying to get in on the act.

1081
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,280
This is Soundgarden.

1082
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,640
Soundgarden

1083
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,640
Soundgarden

1084
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,640
Soundgarden

1085
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,640
Soundgarden

1086
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,640
Soundgarden

1087
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,640
Soundgarden

1088
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,440
Soundgarden

1089
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,680
Soundgarden

1090
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,820
Soundgarden

1091
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,980
Once asleep but now I stand

1092
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:46,960
And I still remember your sweet everything

1093
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,220
Light a Roman candle

1094
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,760
And hold it in your hand

1095
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,780
Cause it hit it in the wind

1096
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,040
And I saw it in the sky

1097
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:03,740
And I thought it was the end

1098
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,800
I thought it was the fourth of July

1099
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,600
Hit it in the wind

1100
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,400
And I saw it in the sky

1101
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,200
And I thought it was the end

1102
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,240
I thought it was the fourth of July

1103
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,060
Hit it in the wind

1104
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:39,500
And I thought it was the fifth of July

1105
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:39,560
Hit it in the wind

1106
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,080
And I thought it was the sixth of July

1107
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,640
Hit it in the wind

1108
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,160
Hit it in the wind
