1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,300
Oh, my friends.

2
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,740
I already kind of missed the smell of the dust.

3
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,420
Dust, that's the first thing you notice when you get to Black Rock City, Nevada, the dust.

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,700
First it gets into your nose, and then it gets into everything else.

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,880
Now, for most of the year, Black Rock City is not a city at all.

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:49,740
It's nothing, just dust, a perfectly flat expanse called a playa, which is Spanish for beach.

7
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,680
It's an ancient lake bed, now only alkali dust,

8
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,980
cracked in an amazing psychedelic,

9
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,180
pattern for miles and miles in all directions.

10
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,300
No rocks, no bushes, no bugs or snakes,

11
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,600
no water, not even gravel,

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,060
just flatness, dust, and sky.

13
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,680
And in the middle of nothing like that, my friends,

14
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,140
anything at all becomes pregnant with meaning.

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,840
During the Burning Man Festival, for one week,

16
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,440
there are thousands of pregnant anythings.

17
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,080
And then, my friend, the playa looks as if a spoiled child of giants

18
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,800
has spilled his toy box all over the desert and never picked up after himself.

19
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,140
And all these gigantic, wind-up toys are strewn across the vast desert.

20
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,280
Some have fallen over on their sides and others wobbling and marching.

21
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,820
And my friend, there is absolutely nothing like this!

22
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:56,820


23
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:06,520
no way, none, to impart to you the sheer brain-taking total madness and beauty that surrounds one

24
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,680
from up high on the man's pedestal in the center of it all.

25
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:18,180
You can sit directly under the man's crotch and pan the horizon 360 degrees, and from

26
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:25,500
that vantage point, this city made of carnivals that confronts you is certainly, my friend,

27
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,760
the most spectacular man-made sight that my brain can even begin to conceive of.

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,260
In fact, so much human ingenuity and nuttiness is pretty much inconceivable until you've

29
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,720
seen it.

30
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:45,780
Pictures just don't do it any kind of justice, and it's moot whether or not you believe me,

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,700
because even if you do believe me, you cannot rock it until you're standing there right

32
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,480
in the middle of it all, with your lower jaw scraping the ground as you shut it open.

33
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,880
You're awful stunned and agog through what is really a living Warner Brothers cartoon.

34
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,180
I don't know what it was on for you.

35
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,560
Oh, it's someplace named Charlie Hughes.

36
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,660
Man, look at us, about three PC companies, and everybody was there, except us, man.

37
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,320
So, I was laying in this puddle of red, and I'm a piece of man.

38
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,660
I hate all of this.

39
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,220
Sorry, we call him Charlie and Louie.

40
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,940
Big mouth, big thinking.

41
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,880
Bitch, man.

42
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,940
A little bit of the oddest of the oddest of the oddest.

43
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:56,960
We're not even in the end.

44
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:56,960


45
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,240
It was the first one to go, man.

46
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,620
The tide was laying right there.

47
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,940
Flooding the desert with the urine of the sinners and the cavorting demon, devil, werewolf,

48
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,740
spider girl.

49
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,600
Stang, stang, stang, what the hell are you talking about?

50
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,880
I thought Bob just came back from Burning Man.

51
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,840
Have you heard of that famous festival?

52
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,780
All I heard about was werewolves cavorting with barn old candles and so forth and other

53
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,000
things.

54
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:20,420
I don't even know what it was!

55
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,340
Hey, Blacky.

56
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,460
Any more babes in there?

57
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,540
And then, my friend, if you go way, way out there,

58
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,660
way out there on the perimeter,

59
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,220
away from the city and the plain of artworks

60
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,080
where there's nothing but playa,

61
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,400
that too is sublime in contrast, my friends.

62
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,460
And the contrasts are what is so delicious.

63
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,280
You can stand on a corner that looks like an old western ghost town,

64
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,640
but with Arabian caravans traversing the dusty streets.

65
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,680
And if you go into one of the saloons,

66
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,040
suddenly you're in the year 2525

67
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,220
in some bizarre high-tech holovision light sensorium.

68
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,640
And then you stumble back out onto the Fellini-esque desert,

69
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,600
and a Flintstones car drives by,

70
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,560
driven by spacemen on one side,

71
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,780
while a Jetsons car whips by,

72
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,600
driven by cave women on the other.

73
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,860
You know what?

74
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,240
I'm happy.

75
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,640
You can wander past these sound installations,

76
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,760
and sex installations,

77
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,380
and hell installations,

78
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:48,940
and...

79
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,840
We can change the world a little bit.

80
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:58,840


81
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,300
They were there.

82
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,900
They burned the man,

83
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,200
and after they did the giant opera of naked babes,

84
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,480
and the giant thing going into the giant hole,

85
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,020
and the...

86
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,680
A giant thing went into a giant hole?

87
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,700
Showing all the...

88
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:10,900
All the...

89
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,880
I had wanted to be involved in something like that

90
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,200
for so long, Dr. Jerry.

91
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,740
Love bitch on the plow.

92
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,520
Why do you keep changing names?

93
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,080
I was still out there,

94
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,540
I was still out there,

95
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:20,540


96
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,280
Jump banging back and forth like an old chimpanzee listening to...

97
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,400
Like an old private policeman hired by some neofascist state.

98
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,240
Like the Ernie Kovacs.

99
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,620
We were free of the corporate state for one week.

100
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,000
But you were not free of the corporate state.

101
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,600
Sort of.

102
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:37,960
We just lingered.

103
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,580
Sort of.

104
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,080
The man was there.

105
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,640
There was the burning man.

106
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,660
There was the man man.

107
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,800
And then there was...

108
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,200
You could see the man.

109
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,860
There was my man.

110
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,240
You could check out the man was there, though.

111
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,900
I mean, fleeting glimpses of the old trench coat behind the non-existent booth.

112
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,260
Puzzling evidence.

113
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,240
Was the man.

114
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,520
And he was...

115
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,100
Yes, he was.

116
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,700
He was Ranger Coyote.

117
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,360
And he would drive up in his cop car with his cop out...

118
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,420
Ranger, you know, Black Rock Ranger.

119
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,540
With the action rocket strapped to the roof.

120
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,900
And he'd go...

121
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,400
You stay right here while I go and call the cops.

122
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,340
There were cops.

123
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,940
There were...

124
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,800
Understand this.

125
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,860
When you got here to compare notes, you're a...

126
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,040
You're a...

127
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,480
Chief.

128
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,360
Understand this.

129
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,860
Uh, where's that string?

130
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,140
Is that string up his ass?

131
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:23,620
Oh.

132
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,600
It's not fun anymore.

133
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,560
I want to go.

134
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,660
I want to go home.

135
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,520
It's dusty and hot.

136
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,180
I just want to go to Ranger Heaven and talk on the radio all the time.

137
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,280
See important things like...

138
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,080
The man will burn without you.

139
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,140
The plier is closed.

140
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,760
Which I said today, and the guy said, really?

141
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,200
And he started to pack up his stuff.

142
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,500
I'll let you stay.

143
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,220
Everybody else...

144
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,740
Has to leave.

145
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,740
Because I'm the Ranger.

146
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,840
I'm your mom.

147
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,240
I'm meant for him on my way.

148
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,800
We do what your mom's supposed to do.

149
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,420
But she's not here.

150
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,580
Yes, you're right.

151
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,880
It is gruesome.

152
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,180
Yes, yes, yes, friends.

153
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,500
I would wake up in the morning at...

154
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,100
In our RV.

155
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,200
And look outside.

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,980
And look around at the sights.

157
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,740
I'll be right here.

158
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,540
And I would think, how long have I been asleep?

159
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,220
A few hours.

160
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:18,220


161
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:18,920
A thousand years?

162
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,620
E.T. phone house.

163
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,100
Is this the future?

164
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,520
Or the past?

165
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,920
I'll be right here.

166
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,200
And friends from atop...

167
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,320
Doctors for Bob.

168
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,860
What?

169
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,200
It's Doctors.

170
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,380
We're Doctors.

171
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,320
We're Doctors for Bob.

172
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,040
Friends, there were Doctors everywhere.

173
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,100
It was like a...

174
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,280
It was like so many unsaved subgeni.

175
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,200
And yet, many were saved.

176
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,720
All the way in.

177
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,200
All the way out.

178
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,700
And the only thing that was saved was the

179
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,040
alien sex, baby.

180
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:59,660
There was a live, open, open sexual bonoboisticism of an amazing kind of thing.

181
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,080
You people have a permit for all this frilliness?

182
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,500
Let me see your frill permit.

183
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,780
So we just passed what?

184
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,700
Five o'clock and sex drive.

185
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,480
So I want to know, if something comes up on our radio net about the sheriff going crazy

186
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,020
at five o'clock and sex drive.

187
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,980
Friends, I met so many wonderful subgeni.

188
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,520
That we had never encountered before out there.

189
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,780
The giant Dobbs heads we were toting around.

190
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,500
Lured them.

191
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,720
Bob himself was always one jump ahead of us.

192
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,580
We could never catch up to him.

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,640
But, uh...

194
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,800
God, there were some scroogeous...

195
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,760
There were real super heroes, friends.

196
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,940
Real super heroes.

197
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,460
My new hero, Megavolt, would drive through the crowds on top of the crowd.

198
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,220
On top of this gigantic truck.

199
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,460
Which was mounted...

200
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:56,020
It was mounted with huge Van der Graaf generators that must have been pounding thousands of

201
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,340
billions of megavolts through him.

202
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,300
Oh, here comes Megavolt's truck coming around the bend now.

203
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,100
Listen to those incredible discharges of electricity.

204
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,240
This guy would stand inside of a suit.

205
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,480
A thick space suit.

206
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,100
Holding things like...

207
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,160
People would pass up to him VCRs and TVs.

208
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,040
And he would hold them up to these incredible voltages.

209
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:20,960
And...

210
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:28,080
You'd watch the shrieking electricity rip through the objects of the man.

211
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,920
Megavolt is a real hero.

212
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,120
The mutants are among us, my friends.

213
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,140
Now...

214
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,400
Why...

215
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,280
Do these insane people heard in the background go to Burning Man?

216
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,280
It's to be as weird as they possibly can, my friends.

217
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,660
And there is some stiff competition for weirdness out there, oh my droogies.

218
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,400
It's like a fashion show of madmen.

219
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,040
Indeed, there's a yearly Burning Man fashion show sponsored by the madwomen, Annie, Franny, and Nick.

220
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,240
With our own Dr. Howell.

221
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,400
And the lovely Connie Champagne.

222
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,460
As MCs.

223
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,300
And you see, their camp, as well as various others, were associated with ours.

224
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,140
Which was Bob and Philo's Bad Film Fun Hole Theater.

225
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:36,160
Dr. Philo Drummond erected an actual full half-scale drive-in movie screen upon which we projected various sacred bad films from our collections.

226
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:43,380
And friends, it is because of the leadership and guidance of our own puzzling efforts, that we have created this show.

227
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:52,740
And it is because of the evidence, disguised as Ranger Coyote of the famous Black Rock City Rangers, that the subgeni are able to so well enjoy Burning Man and reap so many of its benefits.

228
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,600
And, uh, so...

229
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,420
And, uh, and, uh...

230
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,500
Snarf, snarf, snarf, snarf, snarf, snarf, snarf...

231
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:00,980
Why?

232
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Humanity is my evil enemy.

233
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:05,440
Why?

234
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,700
Because it's not worth saving.

235
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,740
Woo!

236
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,760
Yes!

237
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,280
Yes!

238
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,980
What do you think, Dr. Drummond?

239
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,420
Well, I think, uh...

240
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,260
That it's a dangerous place to be.

241
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,300
People with fire, and all this nudity.

242
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,460
I also know that judgment returns when you sober up.

243
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,920
Chemical cop out.

244
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,020
We scored this afternoon.

245
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:38,640
Wow!

246
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,240
Chemical cop out.

247
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,100
Restless is the hunger

248
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,340
In seven halves of a soulless gym

249
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,100
Crystal twilight to turn me on

250
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,580
With psychedelic super kick

251
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:09,120
Chemical cop out, lives inside of me and I

252
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,420
Where I find liquid motion paints a hazy sky

253
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,760
Oh, I'm not in front of everybody here, come on, Jack.

254
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,880
Maybe you'd like to tell us now what really happened last night.

255
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,580
Jack, you don't want everybody else to come on.

256
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,140
It was great, but it's not something to talk about.

257
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,280
This time I want the truth.

258
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,080
Okay, okay, it was great, Jack.

259
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,800
Did you go and repair a car for a woman by the name of Maria Aruba?

260
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,100
Look, Maria Aruba is a woman.

261
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,100


262
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,380
She's cool, okay?

263
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,460
Maria's doing...

264
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,260
She didn't have anything to do with it.

265
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,720
Is that so?

266
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,600
Go ahead, arrest me, take me in.

267
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
I don't want to talk about it.

268
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,340
All right, son, what is it, Speed?

269
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:19,940
Benny's?

270
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,340
What are you on?

271
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:21,860
Benny's.

272
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,600
All right, son, what is it, Speed?

273
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,100
Benny's?

274
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,560
What are you on?

275
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,760
And Mace.

276
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,380
Is that why your boyfriend needed money?

277
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,300
To support your health?

278
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,680
Clorox.

279
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,840
And some, uh, a little bit of, uh, acid and some downers and some...

280
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,080
I'm sorry.

281
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,080


282
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,080


283
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,080


284
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,080


285
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,080


286
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,080


287
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,080


288
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,080


289
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,080


290
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,180
Is that right?

291
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,900
Say Mace and PCP, Angel Dust.

292
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,160
Muggles Boo.

293
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,820
Is that right?

294
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,000
Sure, man.

295
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,160
Hey, come on, dude.

296
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,060
Get with it.

297
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,920
Who turned you on?

298
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,900
The grass or the pills?

299
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,360
Bob, man.

300
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,160
Bob turned me on, dude.

301
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,220
You're a liar.

302
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,500
No, man.

303
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,980
Bob is the truth.

304
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,700
Bob, Bob.

305
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,300
Well, Bob wants you.

306
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,060
God loves you, Jack, but Bob wants you.

307
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,060


308
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,060


309
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,060


310
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,060


311
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,060


312
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,060


313
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,060


314
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,060


315
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,060


316
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,060


317
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,360
You're a liar.

318
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,860
But it's not all reality of mine, Jack.

319
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,100
But with marijuana, the whole purpose is to get so high you don't know who or what

320
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,500
you are.

321
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,480
Son, no matter how you slice that, that's dangerous.

322
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,680
Praise God!

323
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,580
You're a liar.

324
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,780
I plead insanity, sir.

325
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,460
It's intolerable.

326
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,780
I only know one last question.

327
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,420
I want you to think carefully about what I'm gonna ask you now.

328
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,040
I'm gonna ask you a question.

329
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


330
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


331
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


332
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


333
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


334
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


335
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


336
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


337
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


338
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


339
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


340
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


341
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


342
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


343
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


344
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,040


345
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,340
Yes, sir.

346
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,680
I want you to think carefully about what I'm gonna ask you now.

347
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,320
Yes, sir.

348
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,340
Yes, okay.

349
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,660
Have you ever blazed up before?

350
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,700
Have you ever blazed up dance before?

351
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,080
Let's quit for the night.

352
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,700
I'm getting bored.

353
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,020
See you later.

354
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,280
Praise Bob.

355
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,200
See you later.

356
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,020
Watch out!

357
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,300
Yeah!

358
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,400
Bonjour!

359
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,120
Ah, ah!

360
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,020
Brother!

361
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,020


362
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,020


363
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,020


364
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,020


365
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,020


366
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,020


367
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,020


368
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,020


369
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,020


370
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,020


371
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,020


372
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,020


373
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,020


374
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,240
I...

375
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,660
Meme! Meme!

376
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,740
There has been no plutonium release!

377
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,420
Please step away from the bicycle!

378
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:16,980
Alright.

379
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,500
Friends, Princess Wee and I had been trudging from spectacle to spectacle for hours.

380
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:32,300
The sun was going down, but we were dreadfully thirsty, far from camp, and our canteens were dry.

381
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:41,940
Our legs hurt and slack was evaporating when suddenly, right before us, appeared a heavenly cloud on wheels.

382
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,720
A cloud, I tell you, with harp music.

383
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,740
And from this mobile cloud emerged angels.

384
00:16:52,660 --> 00:17:00,620
Beautiful angels with pure white wings and pure white miniskirts.

385
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:09,320
They let us each pluck a feather from their wings, and our slack was magically restored to us.

386
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:17,920
So many times, one would start to feel discouragement due to the hardship of the environment,

387
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:28,320
when suddenly, from nowhere, would shower rain, or slack, or beer, or light, or noobility.

388
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,600
Like an endless...

389
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,480
Like an endless parade of short-duration personal saviors.

390
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,340
And friends, speaking of short-durper salves,

391
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:52,380
here, in a live, non-planned, ranting performance, standing in the middle of the desert in his underwear,

392
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,260
the great saint, Michael Pepe.

393
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,600
No, it's been a great...

394
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,200
It's been a great burning, man, except now...

395
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,640
Now, you've got Philo all hyped up about, well, let's get out of here, we're leaving in an hour, leaving in a half hour.

396
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,380
I was going...

397
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:10,440
You've been in five years.

398
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,820
Tonight was gonna be my big night when I was gonna get laid.

399
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,820
I was saving up.

400
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,080
It was...

401
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,740
No, it wasn't going to be, Michael.

402
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,260
That was where you were wrong.

403
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,740
I mean, he screwed up your life that badly?

404
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,580
I've been... huh?

405
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,360
He screwed up your life that badly by taking you away from here before you could get laid?

406
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:26,760
Yes.

407
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,460
Man...

408
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,120
I was getting all psyched.

409
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,820
I was getting...

410
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,200
Uh...

411
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,540
I was reserving...

412
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,920
I was reserving my energy.

413
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,140
Well, if you'd, uh, helped...

414
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,400
If you'd made sure Philo got laid last night, then we'd still be here.

415
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,040
Then I probably would have had some.

416
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,280
But now he's all mad now, because he's over annoyed.

417
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,640
We used to call over annoyed...

418
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:42,860
Yeah.

419
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,380
Poisoning of the goonads.

420
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:44,940
Yeah.

421
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,440
Yeah.

422
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,160
He's over annoyed and...

423
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,900
And he doesn't want to larrap...

424
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,360
He doesn't want to larrap this place.

425
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,700
This place is larrapping good.

426
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,500
So, this is larrapping good and...

427
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:54,720
Yeah.

428
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,980
Well, why are we staying up here?

429
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,400
Now, were you gallivanting around last night?

430
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,640
Or were you lollygagging?

431
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,140
I was...

432
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,440
I was gallivanting and...

433
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:00,600
I was...

434
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,120
We couldn't get none.

435
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,680
But, uh...

436
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,240
But, uh...

437
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,380
Tonight, I'm planning to get some.

438
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,560
You gonna larrap it down?

439
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,840
Tonight I was planning to larrap it down.

440
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,740
Larrap some....

441
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,560
Uh...

442
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,080
Some...

443
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,740
Some rug.

444
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,140
Larrap some rug?

445
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,780
I was gonna larrap some rug...

446
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,180
You gonna larrap that rug?

447
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,600
Some of that pineapple?

448
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,900
Hey, here's a rug larrapper up here!

449
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,040
Michael Pappy, dear friends.

450
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,380
I'm not here to give you reasons to leave Burning Man.

451
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:26,800
No.

452
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,300
I'm here to give you reasons to stay.

453
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,300
Like for instance, here at Burning Man all the Altoids are pungent and refreshing and

454
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,460
certainly not dosed with a potent blend of lysergic acid diethylamide mixed with elephant

455
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,940
tranquilizer and methamphetamine.

456
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,320
How preposterous.

457
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,120
Why if such a thing were true, hundreds if not thousands of you would have already ingested

458
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,720
that brain-frying narcotic cocktail.

459
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,760
Any minute you might freak out, choke on your own tongues or even fall into a coma.

460
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,460
And no one falls into a coma at Burning Man.

461
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,880
Another good reason to stay here at Burning Man is that all the new people with whom you're

462
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,500
having sex are guaranteed to be 100% STD free.

463
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,900
STD stands for sexually transmitted disease and those vivid oozing blisters speckling

464
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,100
your groin right now can't possibly be one of those.

465
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,420
It must be heat rash.

466
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,000
Nope, there's nothing to worry about.

467
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,860
Hey why not get some coffee over at the cafe?

468
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,100
It's piping hot and totally free of ground glass and feces.

469
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,000
And hey, while you're wandering around with that coffee don't forget to look up and appreciate

470
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,440
those coffee cups.

471
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,640
There's fabulous lasers overhead.

472
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,160
Isn't it great that they aren't deadly and that Larry Harvey isn't planning to suddenly

473
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,520
train them on every major theme camp in Black Rock City neatly severing people's heads at

474
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,420
the neck and leaving their lifeless torsos to twitch and spill blood into the plier?

475
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,100
I think so.

476
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,560
So forget about the boy or girlfriend you left back home, the one who's cheating with

477
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,440
a mailman right now.

478
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,060
Forget about pointless conveniences like air conditioning, clean toilets, fresh sushi

479
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,940
and laundered underwear.

480
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,440
Forget about the co-worker who's putting in overtime to ensure that he's not getting

481
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,280
the promotion and you get the sack.

482
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:05,040
It all pales in comparison to the risk-free fun at Burning Man, doesn't it?

483
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,220
This has been Tokyo Rico with a transmission.

484
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,440
Well, Dr. Legume, I guess you should have gone to Burning Man after all.

485
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,880
Satan was ready to take you in there.

486
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,420
But you refused to say no.

487
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,420


488
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,420


489
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,420


490
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,420


491
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,420


492
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,420


493
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,420


494
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,420


495
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,420


496
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,420


497
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,420


498
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,420


499
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,420


500
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,420


501
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,420


502
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,000
You didn't even sign on the dotted line.

503
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,060
Instead, you decided to follow the Pink Bob.

504
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,640
And look where the Pink Bob got you, Catan Legume.

505
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,620
Oh, that's not the truth at all.

506
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,960
In fact, I was slacking off myself out at Brushwood last weekend while you were out

507
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,980
in the desert with all of those pink sellout Burning Man people.

508
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,420
Is that Mountain Dew Presents Burning Man now?

509
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:57,420


510
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:05,380
You know, actually, it's funny you should mention that because in defense of that noble

511
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,220
artistic festival, they don't even allow vending.

512
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,940
That's how uncommercial it is.

513
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,440
I had to hide my swag sales.

514
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:22,800
And Dr. Legume, I got to fire the propane cannon on the anti-popemobile driven by the

515
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,140
insane Argentinian monkey boy, Raul.

516
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,280
Man.

517
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,400
Oh, my God.

518
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:27,860
You're not even talking that up.

519
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,920
No, I am not.

520
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,420
And the reason...

521
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,520
Well, now I don't feel the need to brag myself.

522
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,340
I've heard enough of it, actually.

523
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,260
But...

524
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,060
Well, I won't...

525
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:48,680
They always get mad at me when I start to give away the secrets of Burning Man, so I'm

526
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,380
not going to talk about it.

527
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:49,920
I've had enough.

528
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,500
I refuse to say another word.

529
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,760
Come on, Stang.

530
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,700
What was it like when they did the man?

531
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,400
I don't know.

532
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,400


533
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,120
I'm not going to say anything.

534
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,580
Oh, no.

535
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,040
That's for the tourists.

536
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,720
That's the part that they tell you people about.

537
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,300
So now he says you people?

538
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,040
My lips are sealed.

539
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,360
You attacking our race.

540
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,960
You racist bastard.

541
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,940
You've been keeping us down too long, whitey.

542
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,360
What?

543
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:21,520
Are you talking about blemishes and acne and soiled underwear and one lousy fetid breath?

544
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,440
Legume's more whitey than me.

545
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,760
And that's saying a lot.

546
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,400
You got to feel it, man.

547
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,220
That's how as white as a white man can be.

548
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:38,740
Inbred from a strange race of albino monkeys on a little island in the middle of the Pacific 50,000 years ago.

549
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:46,600
As the aliens looked down in awe and wonderment, the tiny little pink and white men began to talk to each other.

550
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,000
They were called Smiths.

551
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,180
The very first ones were Smiths and that's why they're so named.

552
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,680
And they became confused, so one had to be a Jones.

553
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,780
The Smiths are the whitest, whitest white men.

554
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,300
Even the black Smiths.

555
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,580
Because when you're a Smith, it is as if you have inherited the mantle of the most...

556
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:16,400
Somewhere in Scotland, a long, long time ago, there was a guy named Smith and he really got around.

557
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,560
He was quite the stud.

558
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,600
There was a guy in China named Li who was a much bigger...

559
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,500
Bigger stud, however.

560
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,160
And there's a lot more Li's than Smiths.

561
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,320
Ah, no one doesn't like Sino-Soviet...

562
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,380
How many Lone Cow Dave?

563
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,760
They don't allow Lone Cow Dave.

564
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,040
Listen, listen, everyone, everyone quiet.

565
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,360
Lone Cow Dave illegal.

566
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,180
You go home, Lone Cow Dave.

567
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,540
Go to pasture and cow.

568
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,740
You love cow and bull man.

569
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,660
You owe me money.

570
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,220
Bull man, you love cow.

571
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:45,920
No, no, you owe me...

572
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,240
You go meet cow titty.

573
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,980
You go home now.

574
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,740
You owe me...

575
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,860
You go to smoking cow and go to desert.

576
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,820
You go.

577
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,860
You need store now.

578
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,400
You go out.

579
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,900
Put down pants and go.

580
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,880
Cut it out!

581
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,180
See, now it would be unique.

582
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,160
Check it, check it, check it out.

583
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,380
Now it's a real...

584
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,440
Now Philo's a burner.

585
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,120
That would be unique.

586
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,340
I'm a real burner now.

587
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,560
Sub-Genius Camp, Sub-Genius Theme Camp, everybody talking at once.

588
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,280
Shooting the multi-teni.

589
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,760
Imitating Jane or Sub-Genius Theme Camp.

590
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,060
Everybody's center of attention, Sub-Genius.

591
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Yeah, this is it.

592
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,100
This is the big media mecca.

593
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,400
This is media shema mecca.

594
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,860
You know, that would be good.

595
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,860
It's nothing but cameras, cameras, Sub-Genius.

596
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,320
Sub-Genius Theme Camp.

597
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,120
People ranting.

598
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,300
This is the way Burning Man should be all the time.

599
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,000
All the time.

600
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,100
Me all the time, Cam.

601
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,620
And yet these people sit here silently.

602
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,320
All me, all the time.

603
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
They say nothing about Bob.

604
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,100
That's what I listen to.

605
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,700
24 hours a day.

606
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,920
What do these people know of Bob?

607
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,400
What do they deserve to know of Bob?

608
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,880
At this late date, I mean, if the exorcist had come, these people would all be dead.

609
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,700
They'd be dead.

610
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,520
So why should we try to change fate after that?

611
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,700
Well, you know, you're right.

612
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,540
They deserve...

613
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,740
Only Bob can deliver the goods now at this point.

614
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,840
In a sense, they deserve the purgatory and the hell that's going to come.

615
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,740
But they're destined for...

616
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,000
Yeah.

617
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,280
A normal life.

618
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,140
A normal life.

619
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,760
A purgatory.

620
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,860
A Bob-less reality.

621
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,940
I've tried to talk me out of loving me from being as obsessed with me as I am.

622
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,280
No real connection with Slack.

623
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,380
No girls like that over there.

624
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,840
No pine tans.

625
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,820
And they have nothing.

626
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,100
Much like us.

627
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,860
They think that they...

628
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,220
That's right.

629
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,500
Much like us right now.

630
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:21,820
We have nothing, but we supposedly have Slack if we talk ourselves into that.

631
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,560
Well, that's the key, though.

632
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:23,820
That's the key.

633
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,080
We have the ability to talk ourselves into Slack.

634
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,100
Into Slack directly.

635
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,820
From nothing.

636
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,440
From nothing.

637
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,060
From a dead hole.

638
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,080
From ground zero.

639
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,060
Spontaneous combustion.

640
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,220
We could go to the Gulag Archipelago.

641
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,080
None of these people could even stand in there.

642
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,720
They'd be unhappy.

643
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,760
They have to have a fancy tent with glow lights and...

644
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,120
That's right.

645
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:50,520
They've got to have fancy sex, fancy breasts, fancy penises.

646
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,780
We don't need that.

647
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,820
As a subgenius, as long as his nose is glowing...

648
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,720
As a subgenius, as long as he's growing boogers...

649
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,500
That's right.

650
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,100
...he can still find Slack somewhere.

651
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,560
That's right.

652
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,520
He can eat and sleep.

653
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,940
There will be a source of Slack.

654
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,680
He's got boogers up his nose.

655
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,020
You know what I did a minute ago?

656
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,280
I took like a...

657
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,700
Dingleberries?

658
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,020
I took a big wad of paper towels and just reamed and reamed and reamed and reamed and

659
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,000
reamed and reamed and I went over here and reamed and reamed and reamed.

660
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,020
And a lot of people just don't know the joy of that.

661
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:17,420
I had one of those handle ones and pulled it out on this side and it took everything,

662
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,640
even the one from this side.

663
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:18,960
Wow.

664
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,020
I had one that had a handle on it.

665
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,500
I never had one.

666
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,800
And I grabbed that handle and I yanked and yanked and yanked and when it came out it

667
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,580
had these big long roots on it that had big bloody stumps at the end of each one.

668
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,400
Oh, that's a beauty.

669
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,140
That's a beauty.

670
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,160
It was connected to my brain pan, the bottom side of my brain pan.

671
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,000
That was medulla oblongata.

672
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,340
Yeah, it was right there attached.

673
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,220
And then when it came out, I kind of went like this.

674
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:37,620
I went...

675
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,440
Oh, yeah, but then it hurt kind of, didn't it?

676
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah, this side of my head went like...

677
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,700
Did it rip and start bleeding all coming down all over your mustache?

678
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,580
You got to be careful.

679
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:46,940
Don't...

680
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,340
I'm not going to lie.

681
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:49,860
I'm not going to lie.

682
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,380
I'm not going to lie.

683
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:50,440
I'm not going to lie.

684
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:57,120
One afternoon, my friends, anyone who is near the town of Black Rock City was treated

685
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:04,580
to thousands of bare feminine breasticles on bicycles in a parade called the Critical

686
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,880
Tits Bike Ride.

687
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:12,260
Actually it's thousands and thousands of pairs of chouncers and jigglers at which sporting

688
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:19,160
paint jobs and other decorations like an endless jiggling Christmas tree of...

689
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,420
of breasticles.

690
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:27,220
Friends, there were five story high Martian monster creatures, Salvador Dali paintings

691
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:31,800
brought to life, more satyricon than satyricon itself.

692
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:38,180
Friends, there were such gorgeous accidents waiting to happen, like the giant mushroom

693
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:44,640
in the Emerald City, which had a door at the bottom and a spiral staircase running up the

694
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,700
stem and a pleasure dome at the top crammed with hooch sipping sophisticons.

695
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,000
And gaping arched rednecks, much like ourselves.

696
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,600
Friends, and...

697
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,300
Oh my god, I can't even begin.

698
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:07,380
But after all, friends, where then and what does all this happy sappy baloney have to

699
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,140
do with Bob Dobbs, you ask?

700
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,460
Well, friends, it has to do with slack.

701
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,840
Slack is the only real pay at Burning Man.

702
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,180
It's the primary medium of exchange.

703
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:22,360
And most of those burners just don't know the word for slack yet.

704
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,040
But they probably have their own word.

705
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,080
This is cacophony society country, friends, remember?

706
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:34,220
A lot of them are already saved and we don't need to be preaching to them, just selling

707
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,660
to them.

708
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:40,100
And a lot of people out at Burning Man can't be saved because they're pink and destined

709
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,820
to die on X-Day no matter what.

710
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,700
Nonetheless, friends, Burning Man is like a preview of the real X-Day.

711
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,160
Or a preview of the real X-Day.

712
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,420
Or a preview as the case may be dehydration-wise.

713
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:57,260
The hundreds of elaborate and highly original theme camps are almost like personal pleasure

714
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,440
saucers.

715
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,580
And many actually look just like flying saucers from the outside.

716
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:06,600
And some are larger on the inside than they are on the outside.

717
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,680
And friends, there's just...

718
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:18,040
Just to give you an idea, here's a tiny sampling of some of the names of the theme camps.

719
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:24,600
And objects, the art and so forth that we wandered into such as the Bookmobile of the Wasteland,

720
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,640
which was a real bookmobile with real good books.

721
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,260
Haunted.

722
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,900
Nonetheless, the Alien Love Nest.

723
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,920
The Euphorium.

724
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,440
The Astral Headwash.

725
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,260
The Bad Idea Theater.

726
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,800
The Barbie Death Camp and Wine Bistro.

727
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,200
The Barnum and Burnham Circus.

728
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,000
The Boldvolutionary Camp.

729
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,140
The Burning Man and the Wasteland.

730
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,140


731
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,140


732
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,140


733
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,140


734
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,140


735
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,140


736
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,140


737
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,140


738
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,140


739
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,140


740
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,260
The Trading Scouts of America.

741
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,540
The Costco Soulmate Trading Outlet.

742
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,460
Crack Out in the Womb.

743
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,200
Cross Dress for Less.

744
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,460
Disturbia Disgraceland.

745
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,400
And Enlighten Trapment, friends.

746
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,240
And that's only reading through the E's.

747
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:12,720
Of course, then there is other places like the Latex Love from the Aliens Above, the

748
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,240
Irrational Geographic Society, and Loner Town.

749
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,380
Where you saw some of the subgeniuses.

750
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:27,000
Anyway, friends, I took a lot of pictures and those are all on sub-site at www.subgenius.com.

751
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,160
But we didn't get a whole bunch of audio that was worth a hoot.

752
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,860
Just Michael Pepe, the great Saint Michael Pepe ranting.

753
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,420
He was among us.

754
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:43,300
And so I'm going to mix in some rerun audio collage from the Doctor Youmentary from Hour

755
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,080
of Slack number 752.

756
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,960
Back in the old days.

757
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,900
Burning Man 2000.

758
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,120
Which went like this.

759
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:56,980
We would cruise the playa on the motorized living room of Saint Pepper Mouser.

760
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:05,020
Literally a living room on wheels with a bar and a bartender and a stewardess and beautiful

761
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:10,420
babes and a cranking stereo heard in the background and on this mighty machine.

762
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:16,240
We would ride across the desert looking at the weirdest artworks and human beings in

763
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,220
time.

764
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,700
Everyone on the internet was watching God's grey history and pouring out

765
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:19,700


766
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,240
Many many high muck.

767
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:32,600
We raised the giant Dob's Head on a 99 foot scaffold to compete with that fat panic burning

768
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,000
man.

769
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:40,280
We projected the metal Dob's head by why-ask-why on the hugest pain in the entire universe.

770
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,880
And human beings have never seen it.

771
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,520
It doesn't come out.

772
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,040
Our television doesn't lie.

773
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,480
What.

774
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:59,240
If you can imagine the sight of gigantic propane cannons looking, literally looking like atom bombs going off in the night in the desert

775
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:10,020
as we stood from the crow's nest of the motorized living room looking at 30,000 people wearing those neon green silo light sticks around their neck.

776
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,800
If you could only see what these eyes have seen.

777
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:20,520
It looks like you, yeah, there are no eyes. It looks like your pupils are like this, like translucent orbs and stuff.

778
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:27,560
I bet they are. I'm still, I have not yet repaired my cameras nor my eyeballs in mind.

779
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,840
Didja, make sure to shave the sphincter muscle the way Dad taught his son.

780
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,560
God, this has been such a fine year.

781
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,220
Didja, shave it the way that Mom and I both instructed you back when you were a little teeny boy.

782
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,660
I sure hope you did because of us now.

783
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,460
And next year, until the world ends.

784
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:53,420
And friends, this is a hell of a party as the world draws to a close in the year 2001.

785
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:58,880
And God darn heck it, they know how to party out there at that Burning Man thing.

786
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,720
It's kind of expensive.

787
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,680
How many does it cost for one human unit?

788
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,620
200 souls.

789
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,000
100 souls per swag bar.

790
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,260
Burn your soul.

791
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,940
But we're going to start our own rival.

792
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,720
We're going to get right to the point.

793
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,060
And rivalry.

794
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:23,340
And right out there a week earlier, before Burning Man, out on the Black Rock Desert, we will start holding a new festival called Naked Woman.

795
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,460
Well, no, that was not the funny one, which has been blotted out of existence, which I thought of many, many times before.

796
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:37,040
And now it's just totally gone, so I'm going to leave it there as a painful, painful lack of memory.

797
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,420
A pile of ash that has to be cleaned up.

798
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,540
It might have been Drowning Woman, but I think it could never be so specious and orgone.

799
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,740
The Overmen and Bob Dobbs were there.

800
00:34:54,340 --> 00:35:07,140
I return from Burning Man with renewed optimism for the fate of humanity, as well as a reinforced faith that our X-Day Drills events are kind of on the right track.

801
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,560
I mean, I mean, I mean...

802
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,360
Puzzlingly evidence was up.

803
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,780
And Philodrumon was...

804
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,720
Or policemen at Burning Man.

805
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,940
That's the kind of city Black Rock City becomes.

806
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,060
Like Brigadoon, once a year, this land of magic and slack.

807
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,060
You'll come behind the tent.

808
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,840
That's right.

809
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,960
And for everyone here, there's a corresponding...

810
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,100
Like, for instance, there, there was a lonely cow person, David.

811
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,700
Get out of here.

812
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,780
And a Charles of a...

813
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,160
Oh, I see what you're saying.

814
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:38,960
A Dr. Charles Smith.

815
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,160
And a...

816
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,380
There were these alternate, semi-connected characters, which you can't fit into your mind still because you're more...

817
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:44,640
As I understand...

818
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,780
What a curiosity about you.

819
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,020
And Einstein's famous band.

820
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,580
Get off of it.

821
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,480
And the Church of Dawn and so forth.

822
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,600
It was like a perfect...

823
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:59,140
Everything that we do in our bizarre cultish things, they do, only they do it jacked up times a thousand.

824
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,700
Perhaps you're an anti-world.

825
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,820
So if there's...

826
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,580
A world created to...

827
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:12,420
If we have ten beautiful naked babes wrestling at X-Day, they have ten thousand naked babes juggling fire at Burning Man.

828
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,240
Oh, man, we just can't compete.

829
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:22,500
If we've got one motorized art car that looks like something out of Road Warrior, they've got a fleet of them.

830
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,560
And it's every rich yuppie dot communist in San Francisco.

831
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,640
Dog whistles and go nags, Mr. Boing Boing.

832
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,320
Why don't we...

833
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,020
I'm sorry.

834
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,480
I didn't mean to interrupt you, but why can't we do something like this just on the spur of a moment?

835
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,100
We can.

836
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,540
It's so situationist, you know?

837
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,560
We can do it in your backyard.

838
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,920
And the police will come and kill you.

839
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,100
Well...

840
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,580
That's the only drawback because of the conspiracy.

841
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,860
That's the only conspiracy of the normal people.

842
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,460
Well, we have to learn to work around living in a police state.

843
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,100
We have to learn to enjoy it.

844
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,920
Perhaps there's some motives or perhaps some avenue or venue.

845
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,120
Well, we have to have our own police and our own state.

846
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,540
And they must be fully accredited so the real police don't come and bother us.

847
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,380
Good luck.

848
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,660
And they must be also highly armed in case the real police really come.

849
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,720
And then they must...

850
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,000
Well...

851
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,540
Well, if you build your own Amsterdam, they come and put you in jail.

852
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:19,160
If you build your own ship, it will probably explode on the launch pad knowing the people we're talking about.

853
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:24,140
If you build your own famous hero sandwich, you'll become a rich mongrel and a policeman forever.

854
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,800
I mean, just think about all the policemen we've stirred into the mix tonight.

855
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,280
If you'll just do the one thing the conspiracy wants you to do, then you can be a millionaire.

856
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,080
All you have to do is give up.

857
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,340
Just give up.

858
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,240
Just give up and face, you know, be practical.

859
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,540
Be practical.

860
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,340
Get a, you know, get the right kind of work.

861
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,720
Work your way up in the company.

862
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,880
And, actually, you know, there's nothing wrong with working your way up in the company.

863
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:58,740
If you can learn to kiss the art, the fine art, the zen-like art of butt kissing.

864
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,900
What company do you...

865
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,560
Without actually...

866
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,480
Have you been in the company of spirits?

867
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,880
...later, they will defecate on your face.

868
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,280
Nip, nip, nip, nip, nip, nip, nip, nip.

869
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,740
Philo's in there.

870
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,140
Do it.

871
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:13,900
I'm doing that.

872
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,980
Well, at least he waited till we were gone.

873
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,100
Oh, God.

874
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,380
Okay, all right, all right.

875
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,720
Because I'm supposed to report him to the Nevada State Highway Patrol for misuse of country roads.

876
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,860
You guys are both really bad cops.

877
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,360
Yeah.

878
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:34,020
I'm going to have to go arrest some people because I have to get my quota or I won't get paid in donuts today.

879
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,900
Yeah, wink, wink, donuts.

880
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,280
Oh, my God.

881
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,220
Camp Skinner.

882
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,020
Look at that with the rebel flag on it.

883
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:42,620
Cool.

884
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:43,840
Oh.

885
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,560
I bet they're fake rednecks.

886
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,200
I bet they're not even real rednecks.

887
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:47,620
I bet they're not even real rednecks.

888
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,120
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

889
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,820
Get out of the way.

890
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,920
People out here, they don't have any respect for road rules.

891
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,320
Look at that guy.

892
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:01,640
He's broke.

893
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,260
Just stop.

894
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:02,820
Yeah.

895
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,980
You guys think it's his ranger yelling at him.

896
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,200
I don't know.

897
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:08,960
Should I do something?

898
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,440
Yeah.

899
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,940
I'm pulling your bike license.

900
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,500
Don't kill yourself.

901
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,480
There's something happening here.

902
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,800
You don't know what it is, Mr. Harvey.

903
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,460
I can't control it because it's too huge now.

904
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,640
It's going too fast, and the state's going to smoosh your little parade permit.

905
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,320
Now, Ed Strange was another person I was thinking.

906
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:28,740
Okay, now why?

907
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:33,440
You should be at Burning Man every year because it's like a thousand Ed Strangers running around.

908
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,520
Defecators strangely defecating everywhere.

909
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,100
Making insane fake weapons out of household items.

910
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,240
I can't believe you frequented that perverse gathering out there.

911
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,880
I don't know what kind of racist organization you're running anyway.

912
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,840
Well, speaking of frequency, when was the last time you defecated in the Burning High?

913
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,620
Oh, wait a minute.

914
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:56,060
You're out in the middle of the Black Rock Desert burning a 150-foot effigy of a white man.

915
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,320
I'd expect that from a bunch of young punks out there.

916
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:06,180
But you're old enough to remember the segregation days of the 60s when white people were forced to sit at the front of the bus.

917
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,520
There's nothing better than having someone stick a screwdriver right in your frontal lobes and twisting it.

918
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,720
You're not going to get very, very hard until they actually sweat in the armpits.

919
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:20,140
I think you probably could explain loads and loads and other volumes of it.

920
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,680
Come on. Come on, fess up.

921
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,840
I saw a whole lot of colored people at Burning Man.

922
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,500
They were like blue, green, purple, scientific silver, you know, orange, blue, purple.

923
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,440
If we, if at X Day we have a parade of, you know, 40...

924
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,700
I got those Norwegian beauty. I got purple. I got black. I got purple.

925
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,260
Breastises.

926
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,060
I got orange.

927
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:44,840
Breastises.

928
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,440
At Burning Man, there was a parade of like literally a thousand breastises.

929
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,400
Breastises of our life.

930
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,120
I mean...

931
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,480
Dr. Tom, I told you.

932
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,540
What are they doing?

933
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,860
She's not going to make it through the X-Fest.

934
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,640
Why are they making more money than the Church of the Subgenius?

935
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,320
Look, Bill, I didn't want to give her an X-Fest in the first place.

936
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,080
An X-Fest is expensive.

937
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,980
We can't afford X-Fest for every woman that thinks that she's possessed by dogs.

938
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,060
The Church of the Subgenius would probably make more money.

939
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,700
It wasn't, frankly, filled with subgeniuses.

940
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,180
Well, then...

941
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,700
Frankly filled with subgeniuses?

942
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,120
You know, but that was a problem at one time the Mormons had, the Scientologists.

943
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,260
And look at them now.

944
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,740
They're visible.

945
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,240
They're big enough to get the masses of fine art of making them work for us.

946
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,000
Yeah.

947
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,800
Right now it's just us working for us.

948
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,260
Think of the wild rat party buffoons we used to...

949
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,180
Yeah, I know. We're terrible employees.

950
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,000
You know, think of the blues projects we used to invent before we passed out.

951
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,400
Doing the numbers, as they used to say.

952
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,460
I'm gonna go flip the brain.

953
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,620
Uh, Stan, you don't need to flip the brain.

954
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,560
Come back here. He's going away. He's mad now.

955
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,180
Bunch of dogs.

956
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,280
He was talking about Burning Man and he thought I was interrupting him, right, Chas?

957
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,480
That it was personally my fault.

958
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,540
It's all your fault, Dave.

959
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,560
I thought it was a spud gun up his ass.

960
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,820
Well, you know, you didn't have to stick that thing up there so early.

961
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,100
Why don't you go drink their damn coke then?

962
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,420
Quit and leave.

963
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,420
You know, well, what we've gotta do...

964
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,380
I'm tired of hearing you whine about it.

965
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,740
How much better the other guy is.

966
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,780
No, no, it's not that.

967
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:22,460
Actually, we... Bob Dobbs and Bob's called ministers made a hell of a showing.

968
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:29,180
And I couldn't sell too... save too many souls because it seemed like every other person there knew who Bob was.

969
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,140
Well, then it's time to start saving them so they can be saved once again.

970
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,100
Yeah, they're not Princess Louie. Princess Louie.

971
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:42,640
I'll tell you what, we need to just lead a huge caravan of our kind in there to show those people how to do it all night.

972
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:53,160
Cause most of them can tell I'm a 49,000 year old man and I outlasted most of them bum kids in that damn bum-free street crab in a high bunk.

973
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,700
Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow.

974
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,920
There it be. The fortress of...

975
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,980
The flying Dutchman.

976
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:12,680
We'll get there!

977
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,440
It appears sometimes in a different place on Earth.

978
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,520
Ice tank, the treasure is there.

979
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,660
Be man enough to find it.

980
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,380
Look, we're traveling through an absolute whiteout.

981
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,460
It's sheer blankness in front of us.

982
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,840
All you can see is like a vague shape of a car in front of you,

983
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,280
and the whole caravan goes away.

984
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,860
That's the last thing you see.

985
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,780
Look at those people. We could kill them. Nobody would even know.

986
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,260
We didn't mean to. We couldn't save them.

987
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:46,380
There was a lot of dust and there was a lot of rest in this edge.

988
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,440
Everybody in California has to put edge on the end of everything.

989
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:54,200
So it's like, man, I'm really feeling my road rage-age today.

990
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,080
Everywhere you went, there was this wind and this dust,

991
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,520
and there were so many things that could break your camera or your brain,

992
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:10,600
like dryness or LSD breath or sunspots or the giant lasers that covered the sky at night,

993
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,000
friends.

994
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,800
Lasers a mile long.

995
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,760
The weird vibes could break your camera.

996
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,760
The Cyalume light stick radiation could get to you.

997
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:27,840
The microwaves from the spy satellites photographing all the nakedity from above could get to you.

998
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,160
The dehydration could get to you.

999
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:41,960
The

1000
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,420
sun.

1001
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,820
The sun.

1002
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:45,820


1003
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:46,440
The sun.

1004
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,780
The sun.

1005
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,040
The urgency.

1006

Just a chemical cop-out

1019
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,600
Silent double sirens

1020
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,420
Happy the soul rotated me

1021
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,420
Tranquilizer flower chunking

1022
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,780
Lost the matter, laced in pain

1023
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:49,160
Chemical cop-out lives inside a neon light

1024
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:56,640
Where half our liquid motion paints a hazeless sky

1025
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,680
Chemical cop-out

1026
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,960
Just a chemical cop-out boss man

1027
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,840
Chemical cop-out

1028
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,500
Just a chemical cop-out

Chemical cop-out

1030
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,020
Welcome to Talk Show Camp Show.

1031
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,080
The year is 2000.

1032
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,320
We're in Black Rock City.

1033
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,700
What a great day.

1034
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,320
What a great day.

1035
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,840
What a fine, fine day, and what a fine, fine studio.

1036
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,040
Has anyone seen this man?

1037
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,400
Look at Bob.

1038
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,400
Is that Bob?

1039
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,800
Has anyone seen this?

1040
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,900
Have you seen him?

1041
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,000
We're sure that Bob Dobbs is that Burning Man.

1042
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,380
Bob is definitely a burning man.

1043
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:50,440
Since Bob can't be with us physically, I think we need to channel him.

1044
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,900
I think you're right.

1045
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,020
We'll have to wait a little while.

1046
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,660
Friends, here's the problem.

1047
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,020
You've got people who are always going, well, I want to hear Bob talk.

1048
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,600
I want to see what the hell's going on with Bob.

1049
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,240
I want to lean on Bob.

1050
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,840
I want Bob to be my crutch.

1051
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,360
My friend, this is not the crutch of the sub-division.

1052
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,240
If you are going to be some guy, you're supposed to be Bob's crutch.

1053
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,620
You don't ask what goes in Bob's pipe.

1054
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,340
You don't be asking what Bob's smoking in his pipe.

1055
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,380
You threw yourself into Bob's pipe, damn it.

1056
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,900
Don't let him smoke you.

1057
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,480
Let Bob smoke you.

1058
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,100
And then you'll understand.

1059
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,180
I can stand the ladies and gentlemen by their side.

1060
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:39,620
I can feel the magic.

1061
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,180
They'll find me when they pry me out of my car.

1062
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,180
I can hold that finger.

1063
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,160
Ivan, Ivan, I understand you brought a clip.

1064
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,020
What makes you scream like that?

1065
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,620
We're going to roll that clip.

1066
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:59,820
Friends, this music that I've been running in the background through the credits is from Lampre Systems.

1067
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:12,320
And friends, we have gotten to get away from Burning Man and yet to go back into it, we got a great new piece of music from the El Queso All Stars.

1068
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,740
Called Flesh Pinata.

1069
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:23,620
And this song, I think in some ways, sort of describes a subgenius's life at Burning Man during that Brigadoon-like week.

1070
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:26,760
And here they are, the El Queso All Stars.

1071
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,740
Don't make me kill that Gallaghan.

1072
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,480
I'll fucking do it.

1073
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,260
Step away from the Gremlin or through it into a parallel universe.

1074
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,980
In the navel of a Yeti with a twisted head like a bowl full of spaghetti and meatballs.

1075
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,580
Blue Rolls with a singing voice of Garfield.

1076
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,540
The Sensuals live in Springfield.

1077
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,500
My pal owns a Lee Enfield.

1078
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:50,580
And he has you in the hard side.

1079
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,620
So don't fight, just give up the pumpkin and do it right.

1080
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,900
He eats his Fendi at a birthday party.

1081
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,760
He's a Flesh Pinata.

1082
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,580
Hit me a mirror in a line of Lucille Ball's ashes.

1083
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,520
The fashes have dashed my hopes of necrophilia.

1084
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,280
By burning the butt, I've been yearning to fuck.

1085
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,400
I've been down on my luck jerking off to Buck Roger.

1086
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,080
And woman-fearing spandex camel toe.

1087
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,620
So the dirty hoe on that show turned little Gillen to a homo.

1088
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:21,640
If my mustache could throw a sausage, I would name it Jim J. Pollock.

1089
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,580
It would be a movie star so far beyond the gayest gay bar.

1090
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,660
Barring all but no perversions, fudgy tapes and sagging back teeth.

1091
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,400
Sickest person you could meet.

1092
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,360
He had a mind, he had no seed.

1093
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,480
If my sausage could throw a mustache, he'd shit English watching MASH.

1094
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,420
I'd name it Jim J. Pollock too.

1095
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,060
It'd talk for you and his family.

1096
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,420
I'd make a god of Jamie Farr.

1097
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,700
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

1098
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,240
Pork and beans is true meaning.

1099
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:52,620
Is it a blackout mind-shot?

1100
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,500
Looking at your face, how smile, part-time watch without a doubt.

1101
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,300
Excess bleed, off course disaster.

1102
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,580
Open chest, move a lot, bus transfer.

1103
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,620
Throw it down the door cause you can't find the answer.

1104
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,580
Vigilancy beyond the limits of the frequency.

1105
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,820
Living for the quest to contribute to delinquency.

1106
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:06,960
Thought crimes, good times.

1107
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,300
Diging middle land mines.

1108
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,800
Black eyes, moonshine.

1109
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,900
Eyes that cross the ties of isolation.

1110
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,740
Moth creation, regressed apathy, total manipulation.

1111
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,520
I'm the best you may.

1112
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,000
Tandem, forger, disco, discord, calling, yester, platinum.

1113
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,480
Rival, godly propaganda.

1114
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,500
Danny, great to win, too anti-cliffed.

1115
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,040
And shifting into obsolete.

1116
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,800
The shitting after blood.

1117
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,920
Easy peasy, this porn athlete.

1118
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,900
Born above the scorn of sin.

1119
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,480
Gear, pandem, mentioned, old, invisible.

1120
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,200
We're psychic pimps.

1121
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,600
Pushers of buttons that open and shut open.

1122
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,980
Slap up a lion by 30,

1123
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:53,100
and subscribe to the Night for solutions polluting the visions of minions of herbae and kings that would nay say the true way of slack and describable.

1124
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,880
A level is reached that makes normals free.

1125
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:00,160
You can land, Bob, and it was so inco-beautiful, dream.

1126
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:16,660
Like a cripple at recess when he beats the mean kids, he's a flesh piñata.

1127
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:24,900
Like a mouthing woman with a drunken husband, she's a flesh piñata.

1128
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:32,820
Like Alan Alda if we ever hurt him, he's a flesh piñata.

1129
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,920
Flesh piñata.

1130
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,040
Flesh piñata.

1131
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:48,820
Like a cripple at recess when he beats the mean kids, he's a flesh piñata.

1132
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,320
Flesh piñata.

1133
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:57,000
Like a mouthing woman with a drunken husband, she's a flesh piñata.

1134
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,660
Flesh piñata.

1135
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:04,920
Like Alan Alda if we ever hurt him, he's a flesh piñata.

1136
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,180
Flesh piñata.

1137
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:08,740
Flesh piñata.

1138
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,140
Flesh piñata.

1139
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,160
Flesh piñata.

1140
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,180
Flesh piñata.

1141
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:15,680
Flesh piñata.

1142
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,700
Flesh piñata.

1143
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,420
Friends, that was El Queso All Stars, with Flesh Piñata.

1144
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:32,280
And you can get more of their music and information from MP3.com.

1145
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:33,740
Slash.

1146
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,800
El Queso All Stars.

1147
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,300
And that's one word.

1148
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:42,980
You have to know how to spell El Queso, and I'm sure you can spell All Stars, but it's

1149
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,480
all run together.

1150
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:49,220
What I like about that band is they're actually called THE El Queso All Stars.

1151
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,260
If you're gonna do something, leave something with you.

1152
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,620
Just like I would tell you.

1153
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,380
If you're gonna do something, do it well.

1154
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,380
Then leave something with you.

1155
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,100
Leave a sign to let the world know that you were there.

1156
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,040
Oh, friends, leave a trace.

1157
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,640
That's what we try to do.

1158
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:15,660
And you can get more information about the Church of the Subgenius if you just write

1159
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,540
to this P.O.

1160
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:22,920
Box I'm about to give, or else check www.subgenius.com at P.O.

1161
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:32,740
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1162
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,100
And to bring us out.

1163
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,020
But never dance.

1164
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:45,300
Here's a great new collage by Reverend Protectrix Amazonia, which we copped off of alt.

1165
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:45,840
binary.

1166
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:46,460
Slack.

1167
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:50,240
Called Overman Rising.

1168
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,920
This is Berlin calling.

1169
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,360
Berlin calling.

1170
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,560
The American Mother Rise from T-Lab.

1171
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,020
And I'd just like to say, sir, that when Berlin calls, it pays you weekly.

1172
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,020
When Berlin calls, it pays you every week.

1173
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:08,020


1174
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:08,020


1175
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,100
We're going to play a hiding and finding game with music.

1176
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,800
Now, this is what we do.

1177
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,780
We pretend that you've got some balls, and I'm going to hide them.

1178
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:22,400
There's a blue light.

1179
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,080
Oh, thank God.

1180
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,360
I pray to the air.

1181
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,320
You don't know where I'm going to hide your balls.

1182
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,980
It's a testosterone storm.

1183
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:34,500
No matter.

1184
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,440
It's just too big.

1185
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,460
It's just too big.

1186
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,600
Now, open your eyes.

1187
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,120
Dance lightly about, looking everywhere for your...

1188
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:49,640
Sit down at the bottom.

1189
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,840
For a time, we tried to contact him by radio.

1190
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:57,420
I was swimming in a rainstorm with millions of babies.

1191
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,140
At the very top of it, it says, the Christ is here.

1192
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,940
And he was naked.

1193
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,000
Put a roof on this son of a bitch!

1194
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,580
You don't die that way.

1195
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,680
You can't do anything to him.

1196
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:12,800
He's a fucking elephant son of a bitch.

1197
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,160
You don't know where I'm going to hide your balls.

1198
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,760
I'm going to find him.

1199
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,160
You're going to find me.

1200
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:16,820
You're going to find me.

1201
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,480
You don't know where I'm going to hide your balls.

1202
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,520
You'll never know what's after.

1203
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,840
Go through a tender pain.

1204
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:30,160
And know that you'll save your flowers first.

1205
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,820
This is my last move, and I'll leave the pain.

1206
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,500
And you can tell the truth.

1207
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,000
You're going to find him.

1208
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,000


1209
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,000


1210
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,240
And then, all of a sudden, I turn into a perfect smile.

1211
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,780
Did you, sticky, apologize?

1212
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,840
Are you dead, 38?

1213
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,280
Are you looking at my eyes?

1214
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,960
At the very top of it, it says, the Christ is here.

1215
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,240
Never see a little bit of horror storming.

1216
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,640
Right there in the LA Times, in the full page, the Christ says it's in bacon.

1217
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,020
24 says what?

1218
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,540
Stand by to check interior radiation.

1219
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,200
My heart's as full as a baked potato.

1220
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,100
Wait.

1221
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,080
You're cutting into his butt.

1222
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,700
Well, what kind of teeth do you want?

1223
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,080
Well, not butt.

1224
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,840
I'm a water-based, fake, and straight-up no-wake doctor.

1225
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:24,840
I just got an answer, Dave.

1226
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,620
And now, the music's going to tell you where your balls are.

1227
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:34,320
They may be high up, so that you have to stretch and jump up for them.

1228
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,980
Or they may be low down, so that you have to pick them up.

1229
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:37,980


1230
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:37,980


1231
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:37,980


1232
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:37,980


1233
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:38,660
I'm off the floor.

1234
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:45,440
You will no longer stand between me and my destiny.

1235
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:45,940
Hold it.

1236
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,120
Look.

1237
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,420
Cover his quad.

1238
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:47,940
Hold it.

1239
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:48,980
Almost a lot.

1240
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,280
Some baby, that rat-fat spider nightmare, huh?

1241
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:57,680
Exactly six miles north of Skag Mountain in the Valley of Pain, there lives an evil devil

1242
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,140
monster.

1243
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:05,440
His name is Bingo Gas Station Motel Cheeseburger with a side of aircraft noise, and you'll

1244
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,220
be Gary Indiana.

1245
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:06,860
And I'm Gary Indiana.

1246
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:07,960
And I'm Gary Indiana.

1247
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,120
I'm not a superhero.

1248
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,360
And he loves to hurt people.

1249
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:09,640
Hold it.

1250
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:09,820
Look.

1251
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,100
Cover his quad.

1252
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:11,640
Hold it.

1253
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,660
Almost a lot.

1254
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:17,860
We have known your planet Earth since the herdsmen pulled out of the primeval slime

1255
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,840
of your seas to become man.

1256
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:20,380
I'm not a superhero.

1257
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,780
The sky is blue and all the leaves are green.

1258
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,480
My heart is full as a baked potato.

1259
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,500
I'm sure you know exactly what I mean.

1260
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,220
At the center of the universe.

1261
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,100
At the border between the light and the dark.

1262
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,060
I'm not a superhero.

1263
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:37,940
I'm a man.

1264
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:37,940


1265
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:37,940


1266
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:37,940


1267
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:37,940


1268
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:37,940


1269
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:37,940


1270
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:37,940


1271
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:37,940


1272
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:40,520
Some baby that wrapped that spider nightmare, huh?

1273
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,220
The girl.

1274
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,720
The hell with radiation, let's go.

1275
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,760
It's a testosterone storm.

1276
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,300
I'm a superhero.

1277
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,300
I'm nigh invulnerable.

1278
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,540
I'm not a superhero.

1279
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,640
I'm a superhero.

1280
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:54,780
You're doomed.

1281
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,120
Doomed.

1282
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,140
Doomed.

1283
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,200
No wondrous sorceress will die.

1284
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:06,200
This is the very beginning of the end of the medicine.

1285
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,100
All of his civilization.

1286
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,220
I left my world, I have no love of hair.

1287
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,340
You respect him.

1288
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,200
Well, you respect him.

1289
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,560
Lay your balls high up or low down.

1290
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:17,220
I'm not a superhero.

1291
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,060
I'm Batman.

1292
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,020
You can see it in his face.

1293
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,060
I just got asked for a date.

1294
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,660
You can help me save the Earth from a terrible experience.

1295
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,400
Yes, the whole Earth.

1296
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,680
Many false prophets, false primes.

1297
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:28,280
Bitch.

1298
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:29,300
Squaw.

1299
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,880
Oh, thank you, Master.

1300
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,080
It's just what Rush Limbaugh said.

1301
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,440
He's in town.

1302
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,160
He's over at McConnell's, standing in line.

1303
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:37,820
Jesus is here.

1304
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,460
He's in McDonald's.

1305
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,060
Now I'm going to hide the balls again.

1306
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,920
Shut your eyes.

1307
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,440
Oh, that's hot.

1308
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:45,960
That's very hot.

1309
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:47,280
You're a good boy, Mo.

1310
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,660
You're a superhero.

1311
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:52,820
We have known your planet Earth since the first creature crawled out of the planet.

1312
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,820
He was swine when Earth ceased to be governed.

1313
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,380
So creature.

1314
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,400
At the very top of it, it says,

1315
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,100
Targon's here.

1316
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:01,900
Targon is now here.

1317
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:10,820
Yeah.

1318
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,100
Targonacey surely has become the result ofernae extinction.

1319
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:13,100


1320
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:13,100


1321
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:13,100


1322
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:13,100


1323
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,560
I'm going to hide the balls again.

1324
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,420
The end.

1325
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:18,780
Shut up.

1326
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,180
Quiet.

1327
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,140
I said quiet.

1328
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,460
What's the matter?

1329
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,880
You deep sections.

1330
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,040
ithomlifting.

1331
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,960
It's like barter town in that Thunder Can you get anything you want there?

1332
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,420
Can you get anything you want there?

1333
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,460
Turn me on, Deadman

1334
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,120
I'm very bad

1335
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,900
Oh, God is dead

1336
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,800
We smell sausage

1337
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,020
We smell bad

1338
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:02,600
We smell bad

1339
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,160
Okay, break it up, son

1340
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,520
Joke's over, hey?

1341
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,660
Lone Cow Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

1342
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,620
Uh, hey, baby

1343
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:19,040
What do you say after the show, you and me go, uh, steppin'?
