1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,420
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,380
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,960
I have some nuggets!

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,280
No trouble.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,880
Just get set and get going.

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,480
Hey, hear me.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,040
Recording.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,280
Everything's going fine.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,400
No trouble.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,200
Where are we, Bob?

11
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,660
The code is broken.

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,580
Trouble?

13
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,160
Big.

14
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,180
Security.

15
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,600
I have the lid on tight.

16
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,380
Well, take it off for me.

17
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,900
The message is, Mars needs women.

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,880
Mars needs...

19
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,980
It's a gag.

20
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,160
It's a prank.

21
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,900
It's a fake.

22
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,740
I don't think so, sir.

23
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,240
Bob?

24
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,540
Bob?

25
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,260
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,360
Bob?

27
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,720
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

28
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:10,280
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,400
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

30
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,320
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,

31
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,240
sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius,

32
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,360
with Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius,

33
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,960
the opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

34
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,820
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs,

35
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,940
living avatar of slack and saint of sales on planet Earth.

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,920
Are we controlled by secret forces?

37
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,500
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

38
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,800
Do people think you're strange?

39
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,420
to you, then you may be on the right track.

40
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,380
Are you abnormal?

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,460
Then you are probably better than most people.

42
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,740
Yes, your time shall triumph.

43
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

44
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,420
Become physically attractive overnight.

45
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,260
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

46
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,720
Bob's promise is to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior,

47
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:38,060
to explore new ways of going over the edge and coming right back.

48
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,540
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

49
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,640
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormalities.

50
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,160
To turn conspiracy-implanted personality disorders around.

51
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:01,780
And channel them into an illusion of creativity that will fool normals and get you sex.

52
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,480
Bob's promise is to make you a better man.

53
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,680
Bob's promise is to make you a better man.

54
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:33,720
Bob's promise is to make you a better man.

55
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,020
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

56
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,260
This is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

57
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,040
But, friends, I still haven't mounted.

58
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,960
I'm late to the radio station.

59
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,680
I still haven't made it to the station.

60
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,580
I'm broadcasting from this little remote mic.

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,060
And I'm trying to get everything packed up together.

62
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,200
Here at my house.

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,400
This is the, uh, Bulldada time-controlled laboratory.

64
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,560
This little security system.

65
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,340
Shut down that little security system.

66
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,080
Turn off the fake revolving hand.

67
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,320
Oh, wait, I turned it on.

68
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,360
Get these things working right.

69
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,920
Oh, let's...

70
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,180
Well, you can't even see where I am.

71
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,240
These are the...

72
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,140
These are the, uh, kitchens of the Bulldada time-controlled laboratories.

73
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:37,540
You can see the, uh, little souls on ice over here that haven't yet been, uh, bought out.

74
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,860
Prepared for the vast hole in here.

75
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,080
Um, and, uh...

76
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:53,560
Oh, over here we've got the, uh, the slackless children who've been cast out of the home for slackless children.

77
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,240
Because of the...

78
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,240
Because you didn't send in your donations to the station, friend.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,480
Look at these poor little children.

80
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,220
What do you have to say to the, to the people, children?

81
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,300
My tooth is loose.

82
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,240
Like my favorite sleeper.

83
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,680
I got an ant bite, too.

84
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,100
Why?

85
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,220
A big old bump.

86
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:14,940
Why?

87
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,440
See, friends, these are truly slackless children.

88
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,080
And these kids, these ant bites and these little bumps.

89
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,860
And bruises.

90
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,540
Now, friend, you're not going to let these poor kids...

91
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,780
These are American kids.

92
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,040
You're not going to sit by and let these kids be in pain and slacklessness, are you?

93
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,960
See, they all call me daddy.

94
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,220
Isn't that sweet?

95
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,960
These are only two of over 5,000 of them.

96
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,440
Because we have this amazing electronic babysitter here.

97
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,440
This, this handsome robot.

98
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,460
You can hear it talking.

99
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,340
I have a tornado.

100
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:02,260
See, if you turn, if you turn this, this amazing household robot on,

101
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,700
why, it will just sit and entertain the kids.

102
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,540
And they don't have to do anything.

103
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,800
You don't have to do anything.

104
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,700
It's, it's a great time-saving device.

105
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:17,080
Only available from the hour of slack.

106
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,440
Dear friends, listen to the kids laugh with joy in the background.

107
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,100
It's time to be manipulated.

108
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,620
Brother, I want to tell you something.

109
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,340
The world is tired of dead preaching preachers.

110
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,300
Dead preachers preaching dead sermons to dead congregations.

111
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,320
They're tired of cold services and cold churches.

112
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,000
This world is hungry for reality.

113
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,960
They've had enough of Hollywood.

114
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,080
They've had enough of Nashville.

115
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,460
They've had enough of show business.

116
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,540
How are you dangerous?

117
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,120
You don't, you don't conform.

118
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,700
To proper thought patterns.

119
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,780
You need to be scanned.

120
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,640
Well, neither do you.

121
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,480
And you need to be scanned too.

122
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,420
Oh my goodness.

123
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,040
Well, oh, accident that God has you on at this late hour.

124
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,620
We're decent.

125
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,300
People can't hear you except for those like me that are forced to stay

126
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,000
awake to feed their families.

127
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,980
What am I going to do with this animal?

128
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,160
Oh man, you got it.

129
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,120
You don't want it.

130
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,260
Keep, keep, keep our rulers on.

131
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,960
Control, control.

132
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,860
You must run control.

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,020
Never take a minute just to show a real emotion.

134
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,240
Excellent.

135
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,240
Excellent.

136
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,760
I read you loud and clear.

137
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,220
Now then, you are to take this planet in the name of the Earth.

138
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,000
He's going to bump you up.

139
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,880
He's got a gun, you know.

140
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,980
Well, all right.

141
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,200
If you're going to kill me, hurry up.

142
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,520
I have to take my tonic in two.

143
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,340
You're a good boy, Dan.

144
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,620
I'm going to tell you the way it is.

145
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,900
And I'm not going to be kind or easy.

146
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,040
Your whole attitude stinks, I say.

147
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,560
And the life you lead is completely empty.

148
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,440
Oh yes, dear friends.

149
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,980
Made it to the station finally.

150
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,460
I've, uh...

151
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,800
We're off!

152
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,120
We're off!

153
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,560
word, Buck.

154
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,540
Boy, tell you what, speaking of girls, uh...

155
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,600
You know, Playboy or somebody ought to do a pictorial on the, the women of East Dallas

156
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,360
or the women of Fitzhugh Avenue.

157
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,140
Each time it seems that I head for the station, I run...

158
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,680
No.

159
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:47,820
No.

160
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,880
Different ones.

161
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:57,040
Well, maybe not Playboy, maybe Gem or Buff might be more apropos for the gals that roam the streets out here.

162
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,400
Hustler might be more apropos.

163
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,140
In this case, Tech.

164
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:06,420
You businessmen, subgeniuses from out of town, why, just cruise up and down to fit you and you'll see what we're talking about.

165
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:13,600
I guess the wisdom of Roberts is that they moved here from Harry Hines when they got cast out.

166
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,320
But anyway, I'm exhausted, so Buck, it's all yours.

167
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,880
Well, tonight, remember that call we had last weekend where that fella, he gets on there and says,

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,780
Hey, man, what religion fried your mind?

169
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,280
At least somebody cares.

170
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,820
Yeah, well, we don't mind those hate calls, and we're going to invite a few more tonight.

171
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:41,920
So we got 823-7490 or 823-8801.

172
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,400
And tonight, our theme is call in, look up, look into your holy books.

173
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,180
Or your Bibles, Tibetan Book of the Dead, Koran, whatever.

174
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,300
Even if you've written a real Bible, not just a fake Bible, but a real Bible, then go ahead and read out of that.

175
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:07,520
We'd like you to give us two or three sentences, your favorite passage or a passage you'd like to give to Hour of the Slack to maybe convert us or whatever.

176
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:15,100
So we'll be taking your calls at 823-7490 or 823-8801.

177
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,740
And call Hour of Slack Radio Ministries.

178
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,500
And we got something lighting up here.

179
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,520
Oh, yeah.

180
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Well, why don't we screen that one first, and I'll proceed here.

181
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,660
Friends, help us to help us save us from ourselves.

182
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:46,320
My busy rock, my busy tree, my busy tree.

183
00:10:52,020 --> 00:11:04,740
My busy football, my busy basketball, my busy rugby ball, my busy golf ball.

184
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,300
Now, I want to be a member of your church.

185
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,740
I want to give all I got.

186
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,660
I want to love Bob.

187
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,560
I want to love Bob.

188
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,700
I was in a room just the other day in Dallas.

189
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,520
Well, I did benefit from it, of course.

190
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,000
But so did a whole bunch of old Dallas boys.

191
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,240
But one thing is for sure.

192
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:43,160
And if you let Bob do your thinking for you, you won't have to worry about nothing come July 4th, 1998.

193
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,540
Ha, ha, ha.

194
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,640
When Bob comes down in his giant mothership.

195
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,420
Looking kind of like a big pillbox.

196
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,280
Bob will be landing.

197
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,060
And you can climb right in because he's going to know.

198
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,300
He's going to have your name on a computer printout.

199
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,480
Yes, sir, dear friends.

200
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,800
And that CRT tube available right there at his fingertips.

201
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,920
He can call your name up, and he'll know exactly what you've done for him.

202
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,260
He'll know exactly how much donations you've taken in.

203
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:16,360


204
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,160
He'll know exactly how.

205
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,300
How much money you've given to the church.

206
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:29,700
And he said, yea, the head of the prophet, Dobbs, shall ne'er bleed.

207
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,320
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

208
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,040
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

209
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,940
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

210
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

211
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

212
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,600
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

213
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,620
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

214
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,220
The bleeding hands of our father.

215
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,860
Oh, he's the nicest.

216
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,740
Decapitated injured golfer in the world cup class I know.

217
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,160
Just a bleeding hand of our father.

218
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,600
Well, spooky music will be back in just a minute.

219
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,680
And I want to turn this around and, you know, I don't know.

220
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,520
We'll do it.

221
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,640
I don't know.

222
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,500
Okay, here come the first Texans.

223
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,560
A corpse can't sue you.

224
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,380
And more problems have been caught caused by people shooting.

225
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:18,380


226
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:18,380


227
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,700
Attackers when they simply wound them.

228
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,900
So get police training.

229
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,620
Buy your gun.

230
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,000
Shoot to kill.

231
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,720
And see you next time.

232
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,340
This Apollo flight grossed out at 6 million pounds.

233
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,840
To escape Earth's gravity, it had to achieve a velocity of 6 miles per second.

234
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,140
En route time to the moon was 66 hours.

235
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,280
The arrows are poisoned.

236
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,620
It's always ugly.

237
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,080
It's like rotting fruit.

238
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,540
It's like meat that is spoiled.

239
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,800
It's like a roof that leaks.

240
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,260
A foundation that is rotten.

241
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,220
Poisoned.

242
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,940
They are friendly people.

243
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,120
And are by far more advanced spiritually.

244
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,140
And physically than the people of this planet.

245
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,800
At the present time, they are observing us.

246
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,880
Ah, yes, dear friends.

247
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,140
We're going to try to go to the phones here now.

248
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,180
And see if we can get some combat going on the airwaves.

249
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,940
Ah, yes.

250
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
I hit number two.

251
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,660
Number two.

252
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,160
Hello, dear friend.

253
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,760
I think I punched him into oblivion.

254
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

255
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,480
Dear listener, if you were trying to...

256
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,420
CJ, please call back.

257
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,900
Yeah, it's not our fault.

258
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,400
It's the poltergeist that...

259
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,200
You think we're kidding, too.

260
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,740
Well, wouldn't it just figure that we'd be...

261
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,600
Why don't you go out there and catch a few more of these calls.

262
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,420
Please, dude.

263
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,280
CJ, please call back.

264
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:07,980
Oh, I think...

265
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,800
Here he comes.

266
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,820
Let's try.

267
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,600
Now, what do I do now?

268
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,040
On.

269
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,760
On.

270
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,160
Correct.

271
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,420
Send a message.

272
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,440
Oh dear, listener.

273
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,400
I don't get it, friends.

274
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,180
Let's try.

275
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,060
That should do it.

276
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,580
Is somebody got a phone up on the other end?

277
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,480
You got a phone up there?

278
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,600
Hang up all the phones.

279
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,660
Let's try to get...

280
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,240
Hello?

281
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,780
On or to...

282
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,020
On.

283
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,880
On.

284
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,000
Hello, dear friend.

285
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,040
Hello?

286
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,820
I give up.

287
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,640
Like, we have a good connection.

288
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:44,640


289
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:44,640


290
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:44,640


291
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:44,640


292
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:44,640


293
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:44,640


294
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:44,640


295
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:44,640


296
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:44,640


297
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:54,680
We wish to help us to help ourselves to attain a higher understanding of life and its meaning.

298
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,500
What do you think about Bob?

299
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,100
Who's Bob?

300
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:05,880
All right, well, what do you think about the UFOs which are presently going to,

301
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,640
which are presently in formation to blitz the Earth and put particle beams through the head of everyone that doesn't know Bob?

302
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,080
Hello?

303
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,440
Yes, CJ?

304
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,680
Okay, we're still trying to get you.

305
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,800
You're out of your mind.

306
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:25,100
A spacecraft entered the moon's gravitational field in the sixth segment of the flight.

307
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,100
The gravity of the moon is one-sixth of that on Earth.

308
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:39,820
The orbit around the moon was flown 66 miles above the moon's surface at 6,000 miles an hour.

309
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,260
At 10 after 9, the beeping began.

310
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,620
Okay.

311
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,240
Went down to the reserve fence, watched through binoculars, and we did see this thing.

312
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:58,400
It's about the size of the moon with a small crescent at the bottom that's well lit like starlight.

313
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,680
The top is a dark gray mass.

314
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,440
It came down through the trees, whatever it was.

315
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,040
Have you ever heard of one?

316
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,740
Have you ever been in one?

317
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,940
Have you ever seen one?

318
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,880
Have you but television ever seen one?

319
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,620
No.

320
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,140
If you haven't, it's the greatest sight this side of heaven.

321
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:28,140
The people from this Earth have already seen some of their spacecraft, which they call flying saucers,

322
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,460
and other flying objects which they cannot describe.

323
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,620
These objects are real and are spacecraft.

324
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,540
The astronauts returned to Earth on the sixth.

325
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,320
The day of the week.

326
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,840
No, wait a minute.

327
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,280
No, you wait a minute.

328
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,420
I love that area, and I...

329
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,460
Hello?

330
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,720
Ed?

331
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,740
Hello?

332
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,600
Hello?

333
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,820
Hello, dear friends.

334
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,480
Hello.

335
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,260
Oh, yes.

336
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,620
Hello, I think we got him.

337
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,840
Okay, you're on.

338
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,720
All right.

339
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,400
All right.

340
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,700
Okay, CJ, you're on the air, and you're on our Slack radio ministry, and you are ready...

341
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,280
All right.

342
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,180
...to give us a quotation.

343
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,700
All right, Buck and Sting.

344
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,180
Now, I was reading here through my Bible late one night, okay?

345
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,720
And I ran across this passage, and I figured that, you know, y'all and all your holiness of Slack

346
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,080
might be able to help me decipher this passage, okay?

347
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,980
Now, this is 2 Samuel 11, chapter 11, okay?

348
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,900
We believe you.

349
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,820
Just read it.

350
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,160
Okay.

351
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,520
Okay.

352
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,880
One night, he couldn't get to sleep.

353
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,200
He went to a stroll on the roof of the palace, and he looked out over the city, and he noticed

354
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
a woman of unusual beauty...

355
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,060
It's an emergency from a girl named Bob.

356
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,960
One of the things...

357
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,860
Can't take that emergency.

358
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,780
Tell her to forget it.

359
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,080
Tell her to forget it.

360
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,520
And he noticed a woman of unusual beauty taking her...

361
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,800
It was a woman named Bob.

362
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,480
Did you ever think of that?

363
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,900
...taking her evening bath.

364
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,720
Mm-hmm.

365
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,640
He sent out to find out who she was, and she found out that he was Bathsheba.

366
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,380
Then David sent for her, and he came and...

367
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,220
...and slept with her.

368
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,540
Now, I found this personally to be pretty heavy.

369
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,140
Well, it's pretty heavy, but all it is is just regular old sex hurt, you know?

370
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,360
And that's just...

371
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,420
Sex hurt, it doesn't mean tying them up and whipping them.

372
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,920
It just means doing it till it hurts.

373
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,260
That's easy, I mean, for any Bible scholar.

374
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,740
Thanks a lot for sharing that with us, CJ.

375
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,720
You want to try another one there?

376
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,820
Oh, why not?

377
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,880
Why am I beeping in my head again?

378
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,440
Hit on.

379
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:43,880
Hello?

380
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,360
Hello.

381
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:44,560
Hello.

382
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,540
Give it to us.

383
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,860
Yes, this is, uh...

384
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,540
Okay, this is from the book of the law.

385
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,220
Get it.

386
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:50,920
Right.

387
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,380
Are you familiar with that?

388
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,240
Yeah.

389
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,960
All two.

390
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,660
Okay, well, let me see.

391
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,620
I got a couple of them here.

392
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,260
What is the law?

393
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,380
What is the law?

394
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,580
Not to spill blood.

395
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,660
That is the law.

396
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,320
What is the law?

397
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,340
Do without will.

398
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,540
Not to make...

399
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,560
Not to endlessly intone the law.

400
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,960
That is the law.

401
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,560
All right, well, let's hear yours.

402
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,140
Okay, well, this isn't mine.

403
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,180
This is from, uh...

404
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,780
Mr., uh...

405
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,360
Anyhow.

406
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,320
Um, it says...

407
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,240
I got a couple of them here.

408
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,160
I'm trying to find the first one.

409
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,840
Oh, come on.

410
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,300
It says that, uh...

411
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,300
Remember...

412
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,100
Remember all ye that existence is pure joy

413
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,320
and that the sorrows are but as shadows.

414
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,000
They pass and are done, but there is that which remains.

415
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,800
And I have...

416
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,360
Sexy.

417
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,340
All right.

418
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,620
I know what that was referring to.

419
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,260
I got one that's very appropriate to the Church of the Subgenius.

420
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:37,920
Okay.

421
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,560
It says, fail not your vices in virtuous words.

422
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,980
These vices are my service.

423
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,860
Do ye well, and I will reward you.

424
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,260
Read it again slower.

425
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,000
Read it again slower.

426
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,240
Fail not your vices in virtuous words.

427
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,620
These vices are my service.

428
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,020
Do ye well, and I will reward you here and hereafter.

429
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,440
AII.

430
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,760
Thanks for sharing that with us.

431
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,800
And I have one more?

432
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,660
Nope.

433
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,200
No?

434
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,580
What is that?

435
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,360
What is that?

436
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,840
It was he who wrote to us pain and misery and terror

437
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,120
and sickness and death and a headache that lasts all year.

438
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,120
That's what any deity means to me.

439
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,900
Bring on the deity's terror.

440
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,240
And the smart bulb.

441
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,860
And the forked tongue bulb.

442
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,680
And the straight deal bomb.

443
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,580
Are all gone.

444
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:50,940
Fine.

445
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,440
We're doing it still.

446
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,920
We're not seeing the superstitions of Sal, Ben, or Satchel.

447
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,400
We're keeping it.

448
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,540
We're not keeping it.

449
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,940
We're not keeping it.

450
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,660
We're not keeping it.

451
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,700
Expectations.

452
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,540
He's lining up for the park, folks.

453
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,580
I guess.

454
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:23,620
Yes, the bloody head of Arnold Palmer dictates what the aimless, lifeless body of Arnold Palmer does.

455
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,420
Oh, we should find the devil.

456
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,340
Arnold Palmer is dead.

457
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,060
Ah, yes, dear friends.

458
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,680
We're going to go to that phone line.

459
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,440
Oh, I lost him.

460
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,280
Oh, I guess we're not.

461
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,940
By the way, later on.

462
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,680
the next few calls and Sandy, please call back.

463
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,200
We have a fellow named Sandy

464
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,500
who just called in with something from Revelation,

465
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,660
so we've got to hear this.

466
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,180
We're going to be trying our new

467
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,140
solar collector

468
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,780
that I got from

469
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,780
Dobstown just this past

470
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,260
Tuesday.

471
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,560
I'm holding it right now, and it's a

472
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,440
vase. It's ceramic.

473
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
And it's got this

474
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,520
print of the ooze of

475
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,420
Nunu all over it. And then on the

476
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,400
very top, you can see the

477
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,300
swirling mist, which is

478
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,380
the soles that it's already collected. Anyway, this is a much

479
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,240
stronger one.

480
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,380
I want the callers to be aware

481
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,620
that this is a much stronger

482
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,520
soul sucker than the last one we used.

483
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,640
So

484
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,520
it might be a little too heavy.

485
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,240
Anyway, we'll get to that a little later. We'll be asking

486
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,260
you all for a little bit of solar.

487
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,640
This is KNON 90.9

488
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,600
in Dallas, Texas.

489
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,240
This is Doctors for Bob.

490
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,380
You can't hide from God

491
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,760
because he's bigger than you.

492
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,100
Help me, somebody.

493
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,320
You can't hide from God because he's bigger

494
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,480
than the whole planet.

495
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,360
You can't hide

496
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:03,920
from God.

497
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,560
He's bigger than all

498
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,760
the universe.

499
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,400
You can't hide

500
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,000
from God because he's bigger

501
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,680
than all infinity.

502
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,300
He's bigger than all

503
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,920
reality.

504
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,100
Help me,

505
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,540
somebody.

506
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,940
You can't hide from God.

507
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,260
You can't hide from God

508
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,860
in a reefer.

509
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,660
You can't hide from God in a

510
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,820
glass of alcohol.

511
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,120
You can't hide from God

512
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,840
in a pussy.

513
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,820
Because he's bigger than you.

514
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,440
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

515
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,840
because he's stupider

516
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,640
than you are.

517
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,180
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

518
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,040
because he's got more black and white

519
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,180
little dots in his face than you do.

520
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,860
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

521
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,280
because his face has been mimeographed

522
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,760
and put up in more places

523
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,620
than yours has.

524
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,280
You can't hide from God

525
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,300
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

526
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,960
Because more people worship him than worship you

527
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,620
You can't hide from Dobbs because he's stupid

528
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,960
823-749-0823

529
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,240
8801

530
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,560
Call and give us a quotation from your favorite Bible or Holy Book

531
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,460
And your soul

532
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,240
Are you concerned about a future nuclear war?

533
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,060
Do you disagree with the logic of the arms race?

534
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,560
Do you feel threatened by our leaders' actions?

535
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,940
Do you want to prevent World War III?

536
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,240
You can help by participating in a non-violent demonstration

537
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,740
Staged in downtown Dallas

538
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,320
The annual No Business As Usual Day is just around the corner

539
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,780
We need the support of all individuals

540
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,500
Regardless of race, sex, age

541
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,440
Religious or political background

542
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:05,740
We need to strengthen our beliefs

543
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,340
Because nuclear war does not discriminate when it kills

544
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,300
If you are concerned by the threat of nuclear destruction

545
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,720
You must participate

546
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,680
The No Business As Usual Pledge

547
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,660
They won't listen to reason

548
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,880
They won't be bound by votes

549
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,380
The governments must be stopped from launching World War III

550
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,180
No matter what it takes

551
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,500
What you can do now

552
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,620
Organize your friends

553
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,240
Inform others of this protest

554
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,120
Make signs, banners or chants

555
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,860
Be there

556
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,380
Monday April 21st 830 AM

557
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:35,440
Be there Monday April 21st 830 AM

558
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:35,440


559
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,380
Dallas City Hall

560
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,580
If you would like more information or would like suggestions

561
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:40,540
Call

562
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,720
327-1945

563
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,960
827-3167

564
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,940
Your participation will help make this event a success

565
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,500
Best of God's love

566
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,720
And over here we find the subgenius male

567
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,600
Which is stacked up

568
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,920
I don't think unless you've got stereo

569
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,380
You won't be able to see this

570
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,100
Look at this

571
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,380
This is just one day's worth right there

572
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,040
One day's worth of little dollar bills

573
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,020
Twenty dollar bills

574
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,620
Checks and love offerings

575
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,120
Why you're here

576
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,100
It's bigger than all reality

577
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,480
It's bigger than all infinity

578
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,960
Help me somebody

579
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,360
She ain't got no legs

580
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,820
Pull the lever down and go

581
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,060
My legs are on fire

582
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,160
Need some help pray some

583
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,580
Stop asking for Lotto

584
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,120
No inflation

585
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,640
Answer

586
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,300
Buford

587
00:27:54,300 --> 00:28:00,180
I'm out of here

588
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,260
I feel strong

589
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,900
You can do better

590
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:02,900


591
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:02,900


592
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:02,900


593
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,460
NAMUR

594
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:04,580
You're the killer

595
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:19,600
All right, dear friends.

596
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,560
We're going to go.

597
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,800
We're going to try to go to the phones one more time here.

598
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,160
Okay.

599
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,480
Hello, caller.

600
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,140
Hello, caller.

601
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,620
Hello, caller.

602
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,180
Hello, hello.

603
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,300
We got it.

604
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:37,980
Hello.

605
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,680
This John?

606
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,440
Yo, fret not.

607
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,320
Okay, well, let's hear your quotation, John.

608
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,120
Do you have the soul puller on?

609
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,840
Yeah, we're scanning you right now.

610
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,740
We have to align the mists with your ooze.

611
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,520
Fret not yourself because of evildoers,

612
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,940
and be not envious of the wicked,

613
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,120
for evil man has no power.

614
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,340
No future.

615
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,860
The lamp of the evil will be put out.

616
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,840
Now, well, that sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

617
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,000
It does.

618
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,760
Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just lightly turn this on

619
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,100
and take a little piece of your soul

620
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,280
like we've been taking from all the rest of the callers.

621
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:16,560
You ready?

622
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,100
Uh-huh.

623
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,340
Okay, so...

624
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:24,860
Caller?

625
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,640
Hello?

626
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,240
Hello?

627
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,060
Oh, no.

628
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,640
Oh, no.

629
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,080
How about that, Bucky?

630
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,140
I think you overdid that one.

631
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,020
Didn't pull in too much soul again, friends.

632
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,220
Well, if you've got any soul for Bob,

633
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,460
just call us back with a quotation from your handy holy book.

634
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,980
We're going to play a little tape for you for a few minutes.

635
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,600
823-7490, 823-8801.

636
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,220
And we're going to let you know when it's 12 o'clock.

637
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,020
We're going to continue the subgenius media barrage tape.

638
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,180
Here on KNO and 90.9 FM in Dallas and Fort Worth.

639
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,220
In your ear bowl.

640
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,920
Oh, ye alien sick men.

641
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,360
Oh, give me back my gone cat.

642
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,200
Oh, great daddy-o from outer space.

643
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,540
Oh, give me warning.

644
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,800
Oh, space creatures.

645
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,080
E-I-I-E-I-E.

646
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,440
That's an ingredient.

647
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:37,220
In an unfinished room in the Salem Custom House.

648
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,640
Through me.

649
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,060
Yes, sir. Can I help you?

650
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,020
I doubt it.

651
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,180
Well, in that case, if you'll just...

652
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,780
No one can help me.

653
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,220
Yes, sir.

654
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,540
Not that anyone's ever tried, of course.

655
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,060
Is that so?

656
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,560
Hardly worth anyone's while, really, is it?

657
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,640
I'm sorry, sir.

658
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,860
I'm aware of the percentage of being kind or helpful to a robot

659
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,120
if it doesn't have any gratitude, so please.

660
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:56,980
And you don't.

661
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,820
And think to yourself,

662
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,440
there's no place like home.

663
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,800
There's no place like home.

664
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:14,200
The 140-year-old woman involved in the plot to kill the president.

665
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,160
Obviously, the subgenius foundation is in possession of certain information

666
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,160
that maybe we should be looking into as a committee for

667
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,160
destruction of any...

668
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,040
Oh, shit.

669
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,420
I'll do it!

670
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,300
I know you will!

671
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,380
The story only starts when

672
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:49,420
you find the light of your life.

673
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:49,780
아닌

674
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:57,460
He fixed my house!

675
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,760
The only way to get it there is by describing any poor resident,

676
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,500
Bob Dobbs.

677
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,240
Brought to The Meteor.

678
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,720
I'll tell you in the first paragraph.

679
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,160
So I say to people,

680
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,180
Israel,

681
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,740
and Arnold Palmer's head shall materialize

682
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,300
in the space above your sleeping parlor,

683
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,680
and it shall in need be bloody.

684
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,740
It shall be dripping

685
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,080
with the residual blood

686
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,680
formed earlier in the day

687
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,400
when he,

688
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,580
without the word of Bob.

689
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,800
What are you laughing at?

690
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,800
You're supposed to be slackless children

691
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,720
and quit laughing.

692
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,760
Look, you want me to take away your slack

693
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,400
real quick, young lady?

694
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,280
Let us open the window of the puppet department

695
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,040
and listen.

696
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,880
The world is full of a number of things

697
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,540
and one of them is people.

698
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,040
But people

699
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,340
is the escape that people escape from most.

700
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,820
They take to gin and to histamine,

701
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,100
to aspirin,

702
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,700
Picasso and Tel Aviv.

703
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,220
And some take consolidated gas.

704
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,460
Or the Saturday evening post.

705
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,860
We pity you, we do,

706
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,020
for all the ills that hail you.

707
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,180
But here's good news for you.

708
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,700
You needn't be a failure.

709
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,480
A failure.

710
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,140
Tiddly-I, Tiddly-A,

711
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,380
Tiddly-all your trouble away.

712
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,340
You, too, can be a puppet.

713
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,680
You, too, can be a puppet.

714
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,540
Man, man, silly man,

715
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,620
full of human folly.

716
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,040
Why be a brave old man,

717
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,180
Ku Klux Klan,

718
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,120
when you can be Ku Klux Klan and Ollie?

719
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
Tiddly-I, Tiddly-D,

720
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,140
you can be just as happy as we.

721
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,320
Be a puppet, not an old saran.

722
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,780
Come out of the woodwork, brother.

723
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,980
And join the Brotherwood of Man.

724
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,340
The Brotherwood of Man.

725
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,520
You, too, can be a puppet.

726
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,820
Unspoiled and unproven.

727
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:29,140
Why be bothered by psychiatry?

728
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,240
By a tree?

729
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,540
And have yourself a gun?

730
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,580
And a gun.

731
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,040
I send the angel of the Lord,

732
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,780
I send right now power,

733
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,920
the very glory of God into that home.

734
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,480
I move back the foul spirits of opposition,

735
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,740
the lying spirits, the binding spirits.

736
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,780
I speak authority to you in the name of Jesus Christ.

737
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,460
Don't ask any questions, just do as I say.

738
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,260
All right?

739
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,560
All right?

740
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,600
We're pretty sure he's a psychopath.

741
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,760
Now, how do we spot him?

742
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,560
Well, if he's wearing a Napoleon hat, it's easy.

743
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,500
Otherwise, they come in all sizes and shapes.

744
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,860
From 11-year-old girls to 80-year-old men.

745
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,000
They all look perfectly normal.

746
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,160
I keep telling you all,

747
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,580
this is a sick and perverted nation.

748
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,260
All tired.

749
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,780
And nobody wants to be a part of this.

750
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,880
Nobody wants to listen to me.

751
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,940
Nobody wants to hear about Bob.

752
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,800
I try to tell everybody what's going on,

753
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,540
and they won't listen to me.

754
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,880
Well, to tell you the truth,

755
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,260
I can't stand it anymore.

756
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,900
Bob.

757
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,020
Bob.

758
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:56,900
Bob.

759
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,660
Bob.

760
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,840
Bob.

761
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,920
Bob, take care of me, Bob.

762
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,720
Just, just do away with them all.

763
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,240
I don't want them anymore.

764
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,600
They'll just crawl and lose you to my mind after all.

765
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,360
They don't love you, Bob.

766
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,060
They don't love you like I do.

767
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,840
They don't love you like I do.

768
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:28,920
They don't love you like I do.

769
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,020
Bob.

770
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,160
Bob.

771
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:33,460


772
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,800
Bob.

773
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,360
Bobby.

774
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,020
Bobby.

775
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,040
Bobby.

776
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,140
Bob.

777
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,960
Boy destruction.

778
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,060
Everybody's crazy now.

779
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,520
Now, you're gone.

780
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,580
容 Macdonald just got caught,

781
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:54,920
counting his life to the head by a dog

782
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,820
and getting hyper dyslexic.

783
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,980
¡Uh-huh!

784
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,360
I just seems to love Pape Super Click to me more.

785
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,440
Get me out of this population.

786
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,100
Speaker 선

787
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,760
I'll be safe on the pleasure vessels of the sex goddesses from Planet X when that day of judgment comes.

788
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,740
Ah, yes, and you unbelievers will fry in a hell of your own making.

789
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,540
And how do I know this?

790
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,340
Why am I so sure?

791
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,800
Because I have faith, my friend, faith in Bob.

792
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,520
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

793
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,940
Nay, nay, you let that Bob signal from space beam straight into your skull,

794
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,720
oh, unfettered by your stupid notions of good or evil or job or free will.

795
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,760
For the word of Bob is a direct word.

796
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,920
It is not written in some roundabout symbolic manner.

797
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,020
You don't try to figure out what it means, my friend.

798
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,760
You just do what it says.

799
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,980
Because Bob said it, I believed it, and that settles it.

800
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,680
Let there be slack.

801
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,120
823-7490.

802
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,580
823.

803
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,420
823-78801.

804
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,060
Praise Bob.

805
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,800
Oh, I think I got him back.

806
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:09,260
You want to go ahead and try to keep this soul on here?

807
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,220
Have I got him?

808
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,820
Okay, we'll try him.

809
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,000
Hello, caller.

810
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,200
Hello.

811
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,220
Hello.

812
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,900
Caller, you are on.

813
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,980
Who's this?

814
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,320
Gary?

815
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:27,420
I want to read a quote from a book called Prometheus Rising by Robert Anton Wilson.

816
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,600
Fire away, dude.

817
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,780
Okay, it says,

818
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:38,020
Reality is a temporary resultant of continuous struggles between rival gangs of programmers.

819
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,200
Hmm, I like that one.

820
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,700
You ready for the soul sucker?

821
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,220
Yeah.

822
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,060
Yeah.

823
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,100
Yeah.

824
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:48,900
Yeah.

825
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,240
Yeah.

826
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,240


827
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,240


828
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,240


829
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,240


830
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,240


831
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,240


832
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:50,860
Yeah.

833
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,360
Yeah.

834
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,400
Yeah.

835
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,200
Yeah.

836
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,460
Yeah.

837
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,380
Yeah.

838
00:38:59,300 --> 00:38:59,740
Yeah.

839
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,820
Sure.

840
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,420
Shit.

841
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,860
Just give me more founder swords.

842
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,000
Yeah.

843
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,540
Oh, man.

844
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:13,700
Well.

845
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,820
Hello.

846
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,180
What's more like that?

847
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,240
Say that, God?

848
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:18,820
So young.

849
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,600
What's that?

850
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:21,680
Dignified.

851
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:22,240


852
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:22,240


853
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:22,560
Right.

854
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,360
Well, that's them right.

855
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:23,360


856
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:23,700
Yeah.

857
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:32,020
It's not just the child zombies that murdered their mediocrity parents and then cruise the streets with bloody feet.

858
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:43,180
It's not just those starry old vics on the park benches with looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars of Belsen and Auschwitz.

859
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,420
It's not just the anesthesiologist's frenigy.

860
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:55,480
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you.

861
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,340
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan.

862
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:08,080
It's not just the broken headlights, snapped antennae, and human excrement on your car hood.

863
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,240
It's not just that the old ways were best.

864
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,400
It's not just the bastardization and perversion of every honest means of survival.

865
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:18,400


866
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,280
It's not just the self-expression.

867
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,560
It's not just the kill-a-shit ganja from the dark side of the bush.

868
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:31,320
It's not just the penoid snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop.

869
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,160
It's not just the wide-screen technicolor corporate daisy chain that has defiled the entire planet.

870
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,480
It's not just Mongo in the Congo with fa-fa-fas the size of basketballs.

871
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,340
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness.

872
00:40:52,760 --> 00:41:00,000
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland, non-entity son-of-a-bitch who thinks workers are property.

873
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,120
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil.

874
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:14,460
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature without realizing that nature is an open-ditch latrine in midsummer.

875
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:21,460
It's not just some asshole with a pipe and a thing I know more than you do dog grin all over his homogenized face.

876
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:30,400
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world that the you certainly never made.

877
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,220
It's not just the doorway to doom.

878
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,380
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

879
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:44,020
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max.

880
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,440
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.

881
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,440
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum-show.

882
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:57,140
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.

883
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,060
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.

884
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:08,800
Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus, you'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there, if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.

885
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,980
Not off.

886
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,200
He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

887
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,080
In his back pocket. Just you try it.

888
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:24,380
Ah, yes. Dear friends, that was Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

889
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:35,860
And we're gonna try to take this next caller here, take his soul off to subgenius soul land, or the land where the enemy souls...

890
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,280
Hi, Ethan.

891
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,120
Oh, no.

892
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:38,980
Oh, no.

893
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,500
He's on hold.

894
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,160
How can he be on hold? Oh, somebody's got the phone up.

895
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:44,560
Hang it.

896
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:49,580
Hello?

897
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:50,740
Yeah.

898
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:54,800
Ethan, we finally got you on the air. You've been hung up on how many times now?

899
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:55,900
Five now.

900
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:01,980
Oh, heck. Well, let's hear that thing from Revelations you got for us.

901
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,480
Alright. And I looked, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven.

902
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,960
Speak up real loud, as loud as you can.

903
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:13,360
Alright. And I looked, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a loud voice,

904
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa to those who dwell on earth because of the remaining blast of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound.

905
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,940
Man, that's scary. That's scary. Are you ready for the soul sucker?

906
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:27,480
Yeah.

907
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:35,580
Okay, now, if it hurts or anything, remember to shout so that I can take it off because we've lost two callers tonight.

908
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,300
Alright.

909
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:36,600
You ready?

910
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,060
Yeah.

911
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,560
Okay, now, you just wait you don't get behind the smoother.

912
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,140
And now come with me, and we'll just get started in the background.

913
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:14,140


914
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,980
I got coke bottles that, that's live and they're squirming and they're driving down to the birthday.

915
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,500
Don't do it.

916
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,720
Bob!

917
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,340
Bob! We want Bob! Where's Bob? We want Bob!

918
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,240
Right now! We want Bob!

919
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,720
Okay, Bob's probably not gonna be here in physical manifestation.

920
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,340
Oh!

921
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:41,220
Oh, where is Bob? He's everywhere.

922
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:48,260
Check yourself and feel if your Bob gland and make sure it's overactive like it's supposed to be.

923
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,600
This is the headquarters for the Church of the Subgenius.

924
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,860
Now wait a minute.

925
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,340
No, wait a minute. I love that area and I...

926
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,340
I represent a group of scientists who work with but one purpose.

927
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,940
To put an end to war.

928
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,660
Naturally, such a goal can be a...

929
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:10,960
Spurred.

930
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:11,760
Mm-hmm.

931
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,240
Men of vision. Men such as you, Doctor.

932
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,440
Gathered here, exchanging information daily.

933
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,220
Putting aside all thoughts of personal success.

934
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,660
We hope to achieve exciting new techniques.

935
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,620
Leap years ahead of the others.

936
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:32,340
I don't think I need tell you how effective our voices will be when the world learns of our achievements.

937
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,540
Well, there you have it.

938
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,460
Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?

939
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:40,840
The future of the Subgenius.

940
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,800
However, let me assure you, Doctor, that we are dedicated men and women.

941
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,240
And as such, we can accomplish wonders.

942
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:52,560
Like any other church, the search of the Subgenius has divine tenets.

943
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,700
Divine rules.

944
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,120
Divine orders.

945
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,980
The first rule of the Subgenius Church is...

946
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,720
Too much is always better than not enough.

947
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,960
Can I get her too much?

948
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,560
Too much!

949
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,100
What is it always better than?

950
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,200
Not enough!

951
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,340
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

952
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,420
Welcome to the End Times.

953
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,960
In today's End Time essay,

954
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,620
we will be covering the difference between

955
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,240
the Brofram

956
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,500
and the Bloodyhead Launcher Society itself.

957
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,000
As seen here in our first slide,

958
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,840
the Bloodyhead Launcher Society goes on forever.

959
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:58,320
There is no end, and there's no use resisting.

960
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,180
The End Times

961
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:06,540
The End Times

962
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,900
The End Times

963
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:07,940
The End Times

964
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:14,640
The End Times

965
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,640
The End Times

966
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,080
The End Times

967
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:16,080


968
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:16,480
The End Times

969
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,420
The End Times

970
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:24,500
She jumps, Mercy.

971
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,160
Study guys.

972
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,440
Study.

973
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,220
Study.

974
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,720
It's a game called

975
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,320
Siege of Hell.

976
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,420
These analogu-

977
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:37,920
swoje

978
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,000
my life away from you.

979
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,460
Speak really loud.

980
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,220
No one takes my life away from me.

981
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,240
I give it up of my own

982
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,320
free will. I have the right

983
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,420
to give it up, and I have the right

984
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,220
to take it back.

985
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,540
This is what Bob has commanded me to do.

986
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,320
Thanks for sharing that with us.

987
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,260
That was real good.

988
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,500
I like that sucker.

989
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,760
You ready for the soul sucker?

990
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,000
Now,

991
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,400
now,

992
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,280
now remember, you don't want to get sucked entirely

993
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,520
into this machine, so

994
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,420
you want to start howling if I

995
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,860
get too much into you. Okay, you ready?

996
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:15,440
I'm ready.

997
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,020
Now, yes, dear friends,

998
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,380
those are the things I want to tell you about

999
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,300
today. The very many

1000
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,160
things. The things that Bob

1001
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,340
knows. The things that you

1002
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,540
know and when you know

1003
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,120
that you know it, because

1004
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,060
everybody does have that plan,

1005
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:35,860
that mystical

1006
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,520
Bob plan in their feet.

1007
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,760
That one that tells them what to do

1008
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,100
if they don't think with it.

1009
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,640
But somewhere along in the past,

1010
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,580
man got confused

1011
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,040
and decided to start thinking

1012
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,900
with his brain, and when that happened,

1013
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,160
oh, dear friends, that was

1014
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,800
a very sad time

1015
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,280
in the history of man.

1016
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,920
Because when man

1017
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,660
stands on his brain and thinks

1018
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:00,460
with his feet,

1019
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,720
then he'll know exactly

1020
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,440
which way to go and

1021
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,640
how to find Bob.

1022
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,160
You gotta massage that foot gland,

1023
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,540
and the only way to massage it

1024
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,600
is to walk on it. Yes, sir.

1025
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,940
Ha-ha, dear friends.

1026
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,140
You gotta walk on the foot glands

1027
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,560
for Bob, because when you're

1028
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,580
walking and Bob's

1029
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,840
talking, then you'll know

1030
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,360
all you need to know

1031
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,540
about what to do after

1032
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,700
the holocaust.

1033
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,420
After the aliens come and

1034
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,440
take us and give us all

1035
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,820
them giant,

1036
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,300
pills, and all them

1037
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,780
fantastic machines

1038
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,000
that's supposed to run our lives

1039
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,040
in that big, white stone that

1040
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,820
everybody's gonna know personally

1041
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,900
in their very own home.

1042
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,080
Ah, yes, dear friends,

1043
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,420
that stone, that's the stone.

1044
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,340
That's the stone that you think

1045
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,200
you might know and you think might

1046
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,380
help you. But by God's

1047
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,140
dear friends, that's the

1048
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,340
stone that's gonna ruin your very

1049
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,260
life. You think

1050
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:04,980
you know who Big Brother is?

1051
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,100
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

1052
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,280
Dear friends, I wanna tell you

1053
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,620
tonight, you don't know.

1054
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,720
You don't know nothing.

1055
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:13,900
Come on, Tim.

1056
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,120
Those UFOs, they're flying all over your house, sir.

1057
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,840
That's right, and they know about Bob,

1058
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,320
and they're gonna be dropping

1059
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,100
the...

1060
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:24,660
Doctors...

1061
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:25,460
...

1062
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,100
...

1063
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:26,860
...

1064
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:29,500
...

1065
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,080
...

1066
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,080


1067
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,080


1068
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,080


1069
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,080


1070
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,080


1071
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,100
...

1072
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:30,280
...

1073
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:30,300
...

1074
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:30,300


1075
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:30,300


1076
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,240
...

1077
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,420
...

1078
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:35,420


1079
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:35,420


1080
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,560
...

1081
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,200
...

1082
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:44,500
...

1083
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,000
...

1084
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,000


1085
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,000


1086
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,000


1087
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,080
...

1088
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,440
...

1089
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:49,480
...

1090
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:49,960
...

1091
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,040
Ah, yes, Wendy Carlos

1092
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,900
bangs planets on the head in the background.

1093
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,920
We've got another call in, I think

1094
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,520
we're gonna try to go for here.

1095
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,200
We got two.

1096
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,560
Two? Two calls, well...

1097
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,260
I hope some...

1098
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:04,400

1099
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:04,420

1107
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:05,420


1108
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,720
decent quote this time.

1109
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,220
I mean, no offense to the ones that have been in here,

1110
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,160
but I want to hear some bloodthirsty...

1111
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:12,920
Caller? Caller.

1112
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,240
I want to hear some bloodthirsty Bible

1113
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,100

1114
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,140

1121

00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,720
Yeah, louder.

1123
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,840
Oh, hello. Speak up. Go.

Uh, is, uh, do you have to,

listen, I'm a bad

1127
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,240
actor, you know. Oh, no problem.

1128
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,040
Did you have a question about feet or not?

1129
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,700
Oh, feet, yeah.

1130
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,160
Uh, well,

1131
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,260
do you have to have a

1132
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,920
foot fetish, like, to, um,

1133
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,840
be a subgenius, or is it...

1134
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,200
No, no, this is your foot gland. It doesn't

1135
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,660
have anything to do with... Well,

1136
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,160
yeah, I'd like to just tell him, see, you could have an elbow

1137
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,700
fetish or whatever, as long as you also...

1138
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,720
have a foot fetish. Oh, well, see,

1139
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,800
I've, uh, I've got a foot

1140
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,740
fetish, but I don't have an elbow fetish.

1141
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,200
Well, that's, uh,

1142
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,200
that'll do. You're in, you're in the church.

1143
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,100
Well, um, why, uh,

1144
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,360
how, how can

1145
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,080
you find out if somebody else has, has

1146
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,180
one, you know? Or, uh, somebody

1147
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,040
else is a subgenius without actually,

1148
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,180
like, uh, asking them

1149
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,080
what they do with their extra toe jam

1150
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,120
and stuff. What would you do

1151
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,260
if, if I put you on the soul sucker right

1152
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,700
now, and it started to really... Yeah.

1153
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,980
really hurt? Would you start to yell? Well, right now,

1154
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:37,820
uh... Ready? Here you go.

1155
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,200
We are

1156
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:57,420
Hello, caller.

1157
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,560
On line two.

1158
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,560
Yeah. Identify yourself?

1159
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,280
Uh, this is Ed Casey.

1160
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,840
Ed Casey. Yes. And you've got a problem

1161
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,000
with green energy. Yes. I called

1162
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,900
last week about this green energy blob,

1163
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,560
and he said to ignore it.

1164
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,960
But it's gotten worse because it's sucking all the

1165
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,000
slack out of the show.

1166
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,940
Sucking all the slack out of the show. There's a green energy

1167
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,180
blob over... Over my speaker.

1168
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,300
I cannot get any slack out of this show.

1169
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,120
I'm really... How much did your speaker

1170
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:24,760
cost you?

1171
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,740
It was free. It was free?

1172
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,880
It was free. Maybe it's, maybe it's sort of the

1173
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,660
conspiracy's guilt trip on you.

1174
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,680
To, that you didn't... No, I'm not...

1175
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,580
I didn't pay for the speaker. And maybe they're trying to suck

1176
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,620
all the slack out of the show.

1177
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,560
So maybe I think you ought to go down to your local

1178
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,200
uh...

1179
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,900
uh... church of

1180
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,600
of, uh, of sound warehousing

1181
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,380
and, uh, make a donation.

1182
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,360
Sorry.

1183
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,960
I'm desperate for slack. I am addicted to it.

1184
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,840
Have you ever sent any money to us?

1185
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,840
The church?

1186
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,760
You? Yes.

1187
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,760
Well, like, I plan to.

1188
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,780
Well, can we just take it out of you

1189
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,660
in Seoul? Can we just take it out of you?

1190
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,220
Can we just take it out of you in Seoul?

1191
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,700
As long as it doesn't hurt.

1192
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,380
If it hurts, will you scream?

1193
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,900
I will scream.

1194
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,080
All right, well, let's try it.

1195
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,080
It's like a rabbit.

1196
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,460
Oh, heck, I hurt the poor guy.

1197
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,160
You all right?

1198
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,320
Let's try it again.

1199
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:50,440
Let's try it again.

1200
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,340
Guess who was singing some song I was singing with Shen yong shuhl?

1201
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,080
S-Se除 Ос

1202
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:05,480
I do not

1203
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,560
I do not

1204
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:11,560
I don't feel so hot.

1205
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,120
Let's try it again.

1206
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,660
I don't feel so hot.

1207
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,420
Say it again.

1208
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,580
What's on freedom?

1209
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:49,640
What's on freedom?

1210
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:18,480
What's on freedom?

1211
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,660
What's on freedom?

1212
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:09,040
What's on freedom?

1213
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,200
What's on freedom?

1214
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:17,780
What's on freedom?

1215
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:27,740
What's on freedom?

1216
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,240
What's on freedom?

1217
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,900
What's on freedom?

1218
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:38,400
Was only through tribulations like this

1219
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,740
can it be appropriately dramatized

1220
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,140
what the dangers are

1221
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:45,180
of embarking on an occult religion.

1222
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,620
Does that question all your answers?

1223
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:50,400
Yes, it does.

1224
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:50,400


1225
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,120
I think that, well, something like that, yes.

1226
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,500
Have you a short question, please?

1227
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,400
What is a heliopter?

1228
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,400

These are doctors for Wotan.
