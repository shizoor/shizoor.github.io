1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,820
Well, I guess it's about time to crank up the little dials and go back, way, way back

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,180
to your subgenius radio ministry hour of life.

3
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,860
Praise God!

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,820
Over and out.

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,420
Yeah, big.

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,820
We got this groovy tune, man.

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,500
You know a song?

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,500
No, that's, we got a, let's take a picture, man.

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:33,900
Oh, man.

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,520
Anyway, dig, we got this groovy singer's name, Tune Up Time.

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,580
Tune Up Time.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,460
Dig, we got this groovy tune named Tune Up Time.

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:54,600
Give me a key, give me a key.

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,280
Come on.

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,760
Come on.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,180
What is that, Funky?

17
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,100
The Self Genius Hour of Slash.

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,400
And we'll all get married squared.

19
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,020
At the math short duration marriage ceremony.

20
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,980
Yes, it's all too much.

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,160
But remember, too much is always better than not enough.

22
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:14,500
The troops live under the chronic thunder.

23
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,180
From sin to truth they are.

24
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,260
Moving from place to place.

25
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,080
When they come close to.

26
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,500
They swing a different weed off the road.

27
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,340
Bob.

28
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,380
Bob.

29
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,080
Bob.

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,380
Bob.

31
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:54,680
Bob.

32
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,500
Bob.

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,320
Bob.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,800
Bob.

35
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,660
Bob.

36
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,040
Bob.

37
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:01,600
Bob.

38
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,780
Bob.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,800
Bob.

40
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,160


41
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,460
Bob.

42
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:05,960
Bob.

43
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,960
Feel real good, y'all.

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,280
I'm gonna tell it all through the neighborhood.

45
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,720
Gonna fly like a bird on a wing.

46
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,120
Hold on to your halfûtter.

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,660
Say, say, say...

48
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,800
Soooo

49
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,220
Oh, yes, dear friends, it's a swinging, swinging show tonight.

50
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,060
The women and hippie conspiracy show.

51
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,140
And the witches must leave out the witches.

52
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,660
Yes, that Bob Dobbs, he's a swinging, swinging, swinging guy.

53
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,520
Swinging from a rope, dear friends.

54
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,920
With the swinging love courses.

55
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,060
You're in the back of the hole.

56
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,480
Yes.

57
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,520
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

58
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,500
Women beat their men.

59
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,460
The men beat on their drums.

60
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,080
The dominatrix sleeps tonight.

61
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,440
Hang on to your scro-tie, boys.

62
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,780
It's going to be a rough one tonight.

63
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,780
Ah, yes, because...

64
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,620
To chant the mantra of Bulldada,

65
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,060
first kneel on the floor, placing both hands behind you,

66
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,640
grasping both buttocks muscles.

67
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,580
Inhale deeply, constricting the diaphragm,

68
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,640
and at the top of your lungs, expel air,

69
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,680
producing these sounds.

70
00:05:49,780 --> 00:06:02,160
And exhale under the humer's lash.

71
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,040
Eggs are engulfed by the air.

72
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,320
And feel carried away to the upper abdomen,

73
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,340
there are four superlike sounds.

74
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:13,260


75
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,040
my voice is more 내

76
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
sound.

77
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,820
You're all right.

78
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,260
Yeah, you're not so bad.

79
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,460
Not nearly as bad as that man Bob, that's for sure, friends.

80
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:45,980
Switching little woman heads out here so that we can always know just what we're doing.

81
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,520
And what we're doing, as I said, is a little bit of a theme show tonight.

82
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:58,620
We just found a lot of nice stuff that came bubbling up out of the mess on the big table there and out of those files.

83
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:06,460
And it turned into, well, the hippie women witches.

84
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,860
Hour of slack.

85
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,880
I guess they got us by the glands, boys.

86
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,360
Specifically.

87
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,060
Especially this time, of course, the witches of Cleveland.

88
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:25,160
Sister Mary Squared, Princess We Are Doe, queen of all the UFOs.

89
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,380
And Sister Melodious Chop.

90
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,700
You'll be hearing all three of them tonight.

91
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:42,440
As well as Lonesome Cowboy Dave on that show from WCSB in Cleveland that yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, was so lucky to guest upon.

92
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,940
And Pope Sternodocs.

93
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,800
Heard howling and basing in the background.

94
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:57,300
And all of that fallout, dear friends, from the frightening rant and rave number two in Cleveland.

95
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,040
You just never know what they're going to do next.

96
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,920
I sure don't.

97
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:09,580
Now a strange, unearthly creature returns to petrify every human being who crosses her path.

98
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,280
It's Princess We Are Doe.

99
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,900
Bob!

100
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,540
Bob!

101
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,240
Bob!

102
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,000
Bob!

103
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:19,680
Bob!

104
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,420
Bob!

105
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,100
Bob!

106
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,420
Bob!

107
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,720
Bob!

108
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,760
Bob!

109
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,260
Bob!

110
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:28,480


111
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,120
Bob!

112
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,040
Bob!

113
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,360
Bob!

114
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,040
Bob!

115
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,260
Bob!

116
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:31,660
!

117
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:43,800
Seriously, before I say goodnight, I like your cousin Monica.

118
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,740
But isn't she a bit kooky?

119
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,080
Well, I supposed outsiders, she does appear a little strange, but...

120
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,520
But does she believe in all that voodoo?

121
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,540
Stick it right in your ass.

122
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:01,740
This truth that I'm about to give you has exploded in power.

123
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,700
Woo!

124
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,580
Oh, and I should cut in and give credits.

125
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,880
More credits than could ever possibly be due.

126
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:53,300
Uh, we start off with a tiny bit of Jimi Hendrix doing the tune-up song, and he's in the background here.

127
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,520
Followed by bits and pieces, a lot of bits and pieces we got in off tapes from the, uh,

128
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,740
neo-psychedelic mind orgasm.

129
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,640
The Princess We Are Go and Mary Squared show tape.

130
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,600
The amazing and still sort of anonymous Lookout Miami collab.

131
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,820
A lot of cool bits of music just burbling up.

132
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,920
Forms of Insanity from Cleveland, a little bit.

133
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,260
And Joe Riley there, St. Joe Riley, uh, with the mantra.

134
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,800
The wonderful stooge mantra.

135
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,840
And, uh, oh yes, dear friends.

136
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,800
What's coming up, I should, I should, uh, actually introduce this little bit of tape that's coming up.

137
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,640
We got it off of, uh, Arnold Mathis' new tape, or old new tape.

138
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,700
End of the World.

139
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,500
Enterprises.

140
00:10:47,660 --> 00:11:05,100
And, uh, it's a recording of none other than the Axis, one of the Elder Gods, uh, describing the advent of, uh, the queen of all the UFOs, Princess Wee, and her sex goddesses, and the fromp goddesses, and the food goddesses.

141
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:14,700
Uh, and also discussing your heritage as a descendant of the Yeti, the abominable, so-called abominable snow people.

142
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,200
You are a son of a hybrid under Bob.

143
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:43,500
Now listen closely, uh, because he says of Princess Wee Ardo that aeons ago from beyond the balloon of space, he refers to the balloon of space a couple of times and states that her mission is to mate with the dust of this planet and mold it in many and varied ways.

144
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,780
The hybrid makes a lot of sense.

145
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,700
The hybrid, the fellow man, the Y'timson, is her crowning achievement...

146
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,920
But, uh, cub other stories than efforts to get Y'timson, especially in theë

147
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,020
But, uh, cub other stories like this one says it's so much better, so let's just asked the Axis.

148
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,500
From the havel space, she take a eons ago from beyond the balloon of space.

149
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:12,460
Her mission, to mate with the dust of this planet and mold it many and varied ways.

150
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,760
The hybrid man so mind you that she leans on the surface.

151
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:14,760


152
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:14,760


153
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,220
is her crowning achievement.

154
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,580
Through a process of elimination

155
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,000
over tens of thousands of years,

156
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,040
she fashioned a critter

157
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,200
with the appendages necessary

158
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,680
to facilitate the worldwide space program

159
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,420
that is now in its final stage.

160
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,660
On November 28, 2001,

161
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,120
the select of this planet

162
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,400
will join her aboard the spaceships

163
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,800
that will blast through the window in space

164
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,860
to see beyond the balloon of space.

165
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,300
Who are you?

166
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,940
Where are you going?

167
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,940
You think you know the answer.

168
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,220
But do you?

169
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,980
Do you know that you're a...

170
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,900
a hybrid?

171
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,480
A hybrid?

172
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:11,500


173
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,060
A creature?

174
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,100
Son of a hybrid.

175
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,880
The granddaughter of a hybrid.

176
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,480
You know the beginnings,

177
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,040
the real beginnings

178
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,580
of life on this planet?

179
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,360
The beginnings

180
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,500
that you can't know,

181
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,960
hence you don't know.

182
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,920
Where did you come from?

183
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,660
Where are you going?

184
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,540
Where are you going?

185
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:44,540


186
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,460
Perhaps some mindless evolution

187
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,180
you conclude causes you to be?

188
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,940
Where is the Earth going?

189
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,080
Where is the universe going?

190
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,640
Do you know?

191
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,480
Do you think these things are knowable?

192
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,700
So therefore you preclude thinking about them?

193
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,640
I'm Bishop Joey.

194
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,320
You can speak to me.

195
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:11,660
That's what we need.

196
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,140
We're going to be on the same stupid channel here on UHFVHF.

197
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,320
And next week we're getting Playboy Channel.

198
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,440
And really, let's...

199
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,260
We want to clear up the confusion.

200
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,140
Where have you been talking more shit?

201
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,780
I've been on the box, man.

202
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,200
I've been...

203
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,260
The technological complexities behind this whole...

204
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,460
Look at the wires and stuff here.

205
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,640
They're all fused together.

206
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,340
You wouldn't believe it.

207
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,640
They came in here with a...

208
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,080
But you got there.

209
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,260
I'll give you...

210
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,240
Okay.

211
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,080
Those subgenius shows, I hate it.

212
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,420
You can't hear what they're saying over the sound effects and things.

213
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:41,640
You can't hear what they're saying over the sound effects and things.

214
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,100
There's just so damn many sound effects.

215
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,400
But you got there.

216
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,020
And he does, too.

217
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,680
Now that...

218
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,660
But look at hers.

219
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,420
Whoa.

220
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,920
Now, dude.

221
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,640
That's a crescent...

222
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,900
That's like five crescent moons lined up in a row with all the goddesses of Hecate and all that witchy stuff danced around it.

223
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,840
Wittershins in the midnight moonlight.

224
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,100
Oh, man.

225
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,280
If you guys only knew...

226
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,040
Moons lined up in a row with all the...

227
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,880
If you only...

228
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,280
If you...

229
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,620
If you could have seen with your eyes, well...

230
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:11,740
Well, beauty would not have to think like you've seenWe'd have to think with...

231
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,060
What these eyes have seen.

232
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,180
Oh.

233
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
My God, what have I just seen?

234
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,020
Wow.

235
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,020


236
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,840
Bum.

237
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,100
Oh, my god.

238
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,660
D'you feel that?

239
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,400
Yeah, you kind of feel it up close.

240
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:22,780
The bird is soict up, you feel it's fortunately going to be in the king's arm...

241
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,520
What?

242
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,620
was he making?

243
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:24,620


244
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:24,620


245
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,440
¿Qué dij inputsonofatí?

246
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:26,840
It's...

247
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,220
The one down the earth?

248
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,280
Big pretty cats.

249
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:33,400
Bumbs, and big, big spider being eaten.

250
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,940
But you get to see...

251
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,320
You don't get any of it, see?

252
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,280
And then there's Bird B film in...

253
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,980
Ooh, Kiki!

254
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,640
Not me

255
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,540
But the people they say

256
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,420
That the men are leading

257
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,960
The women astray

258
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,060
But I say

259
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,700
That the women of today

260
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,640
Smarter than the man

261
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,240
In every way

262
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,140
Oh yes, smarter

263
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,860
Well, God made man

264
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,660
But he used the market to do it

265
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,500
H in the plan

266
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,500
What are you to prove it?

267
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,580
I can walk like an ape

268
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,360
Talk like an ape

269
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,620
Do what monkeys do

270
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,900
Well, God made man

271
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,920
But a monkey supplies the blue

272
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,060
Hey, hey

273
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,080
Hey, hey

274
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,780
Hey, hey

275
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,780
Hey, hey

276
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,900
The jim-jamp-jumping jive

277
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,500
Makes you hep-hep on the mellow side

278
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,620
Skiddle-a-boo, skiddle-a-diddle-a-diddle-a-diddle-a-diddle

279
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,020
Going, going, going, going, da-da

280
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,520
Now I told you about the jumping jive

281
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,160
Jim-jamp-jump, the jumping jive

282
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,860
I know you dug this mellow jive

283
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,220
Cause you dig it on the mellow side

284
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,380
The Lord is my happening

285
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,640
He's where it's all at

286
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,120
He tricks me sweetly

287
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,820
He never bugs me

288
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,040
He says, make it

289
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,180
When the duds put me all down

290
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,400
I keep my cool

291
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,360
Cause he straights with me

292
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,240
Even though my head's torn up

293
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,960
And the world's a plastic mushroom

294
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,160
And I'm crawling on my face

295
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,200
Everything is cool

296
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,780
Cause he's there digging me

297
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,180
When everybody's faking and stabbing

298
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,400
He's super cool

299
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,620
And I'm crawling on my face

300
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,600
And he's with me, baby

301
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,580
He craves my face when it's ugly, man

302
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,520
He lays abundance on me

303
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,640
Baby, ain't no way I can get hung up

304
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,860
He's my lifetime trick

305
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,280
Bob?

306
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,200
Bob?

307
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:01,860
Bob?

308
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,700
Bob?

309
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,460
Bob?

310
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:03,980
Bob?

311
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,620
Bob?

312
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:05,520
Bob?

313
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,200
Bob?

314
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,380
Bob?

315
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:06,620
Bob?

316
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:06,620


317
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,180
Bob?

318
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,960
Mom!

319
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,300
Mom!

320
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,140
Mom!

321
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,120
Mom!

322
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,120
Mom!

323
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,380
Mom!

324
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,060
Mom!

325
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:19,500


326
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,520
Mom!

327
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,940
I'm gonna get into that baby.

328
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,900
Why balk at anything, friends?

329
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,460
Take it off and keep it off.

330
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,740
You'll find hair growing in places you never had before.

331
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,040
You'll have organs you never had before.

332
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,260
Alright, alright, now what do we mean as marriage?

333
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:49,840
If Reverend Son Young Lee has increased his age and married 20,000 total strangers to each other,

334
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,800
in order to get the organs into America,

335
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,140
then we do this short grace marriage.

336
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,260
24 hour marriage ceremony.

337
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,780
As a wife, one sub-Jesus came up to me and just pointed out,

338
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,960
he said, well, my girlfriend told me,

339
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,020


340
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,020


341
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,020


342
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,020


343
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,020


344
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,020


345
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,340
right after I got her name tattooed on my arm,

346
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,920
so I'm gonna have to marry a conga.

347
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,680
And if a man conga,

348
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,760
that means that's gonna be his bride for tonight.

349
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,800
So, you know,

350
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,020
you can be grand about it,

351
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,640
but you've got a drink in your hand.

352
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,560
And those drinks mean more to you

353
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,060
than any human being

354
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,700
ever will in your life.

355
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,800
Go ahead and marry the

356
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,960
the booze, man.

357
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,060
You know, be shy about it.

358
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,500
Step right up!

359
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,960
You don't have to get married!

360
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,780
I think it's a good marriage ceremony.

361
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,040
Why don't you see them standing there with their hands in their pockets?

362
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,700
You don't have to get married.

363
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,500
This is all right.

364
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,100
You can't marry yourself!

365
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,760
And that is where it happened.

366
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,860
Suddenly, time compressed.

367
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,720
Lust dripping from her mouth.

368
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,960
Lost, out of control,

369
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,640
dancing,

370
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,060
sex chasing in circles like mad dogs,

371
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,660
faster and faster,

372
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,020
trying to catch her breath.

373
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:31,760
I was robbed of

374
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,000
natürlich

375
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,340
of orange-red flames erupting from the Earth's nucleus

376
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,800
to reach hundreds of feet into a darkened sky.

377
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,680
New, baroque, fainted dancers over me,

378
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,820
just inches away,

379
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,800
sensuously begging me to cross over.

380
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,880
Suck my lips.

381
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,740
Taste my wine.

382
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,520
The gargantuan crystal chandelier

383
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,020
swaying back and forth,

384
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,100
whipping the chains that held it,

385
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,760
looked like it was about to drop.

386
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,660
I heard the sound of a deep, grinding moan

387
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,140
from the bowels of the temple

388
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,520
as a large pillar slowly turned

389
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,940
and then suddenly fell down across the floor

390
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,440
where naked, painted dancers stood just moments before,

391
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,860
creating a barrier between us.

392
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:28,340
Screaming only added excitement to the orgasmic dance

393
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,020
of the painted nymphs.

394
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,000
The temple shook so violently it began to crumble.

395
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,920
Four deaths,

396
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,060
three

397
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,740
and three.

398
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,660
The temple was about to collapse.

399
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,360
My right arm, in tremendous pain,

400
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,080
frantically clung to an opening in the wall

401
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,400
as I watched a gigantic gas fire cloud

402
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,500
coming toward me in a tremendous speed,

403
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,920
arms and hands twisting and turning

404
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,320
in the midst of the inferno,

405
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,560
desperately trying to reach each other,

406
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,520
our fingertips almost barely touching.

407
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,940
Have you ever been in one of these things,

408
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,240
these ACE people, you know, the ACE?

409
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,700
Well, actually, yes.

410
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,660
You know what that stands for?

411
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,660
This is what they say.

412
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,920
Association for Consciousness Exploration.

413
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,780
You know what that means.

414
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,660
Wink, wink.

415
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,420
Wink, wink.

416
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,420
I know what that means.

417
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,300
What does that mean?

418
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,880
Exploring the frontiers of your consideration.

419
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,740
Does it?

420
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,160
I thought it had something to do with like the hammer in the,

421
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,800
when you wrap the hammer in like a bed sheet

422
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,980
or like a little tiny napkin or something,

423
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,060
and if you're trying to find illumination

424
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,080
and you can't find it,

425
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,500
and you have to lift the hammer gently and tap.

426
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,360
That's right.

427
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,560
You tap your forehead.

428
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,000
Just gently.

429
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,800
Just gently.

430
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,300
Just enough to cause a little swelling.

431
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,940
And these people, these people know how,

432
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,120
just exactly what spots on your head,

433
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,140
actually they put a little pebble between the,

434
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,800
they've used, the experts take a ball peen hammer and a pebble

435
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,700
and put it against a certain spot on your head,

436
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,440
different spots, depending on whether they want you to feel good or bad,

437
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,560
or praise Bob or help honey.

438
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,000
And then they just little, you know,

439
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
kind of like a Three Stooges sound effect,

440
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,540
like when they pull your eyelash out, it goes,

441
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,220
you know, kind of like.

442
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,780
And that's, you know,

443
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,080
that's how they, we bring about the contracted consciousness

444
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,800
and leave the little dents, little,

445
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,760
and we do them in circles and.

446
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,040
And by these dents, they are known.

447
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,820
By these dents shall ye know them.

448
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,280
That's right.

449
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,160
He will come with one sandal only and a pipe,

450
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,360
and smoke it forever.

451
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,780
If you'd like a picture of the future,

452
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,960
imagine a pipe smoking in a human face forever.

453
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,120
I have, unfortunately.

454
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,840
Winston, I mean, pipe smoking in a human face forever.

455
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,940
Pipe smoking in a human face forever.

456
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,760
Now, that's one thing I've been wanting to take away.

457
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,220
I've been wanting to take it off with you

458
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,420
for quite some long time.

459
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,160
Take it all off.

460
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,100
I was wondering.

461
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,060
Pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe.

462
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,400
By their dents, ye shall know them.

463
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,980
Why would you want to know all these people?

464
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,840
I mean, ain't it better just to come up and maybe say,

465
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,240
introduce yourself to someone and have, you know,

466
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,280
pal around and stuff like that, you know.

467
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,320
Well, this thing, this is why you sell things to each other.

468
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,980
You can, you can just, it's like an orgy of selling.

469
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,640
Selling, it's a social intercourse, you might say.

470
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,500
I see, I see.

471
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,340
Pipe smoke.

472
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:21,720
A blast.

473
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,420
Well, if I go to that subgenius show, will I meet some of them loose subgenius girls?

474
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,520
Yep.

475
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,420
I'm tired of these science fiction conventions.

476
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,000
They're boring.

477
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,160
I want to go in one of them sub gum conventions.

478
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,160
That'll be fun.

479
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,380
They're boring.

480
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,480
They're boring.

481
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,440
They're boring.

482
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,320
They're boring.

483
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,100
They're boring.

484
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,320
Oh, I was getting cramped up there.

485
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,360
You know, performer loose.

486
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,760
You didn't have to do that, though.

487
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,320
They're boring.

488
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,500
Oh, sheesh.

489
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,040
I'm sorry.

490
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,380
I'm really sorry.

491
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,580
It's something I ate.

492
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,940
That's okay.

493
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,580
I mean, we have to come up here in all kinds of strange conditions, and you're a real trooper.

494
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:14,120
Rev boy, I can say that to all these faceless, mindless cretins barking out here in the lonely

495
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,260
darkness out here.

496
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,360
But, you know, the work with them, we wouldn't have an audience.

497
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,560
If you want light in your life.

498
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,200
But, you know, the work with them, we wouldn't have an audience.

499
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,260
Pardon?

500
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,080
I said if it weren't for them boneless cretins, we wouldn't have an audience, right?

501
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,060
Oh, we don't have an audience.

502
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,580
The boneless cretin, an endangered species.

503
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,980
This is a wraparound.

504
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,220
Give to those who have.

505
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,820
This studio, nothing goes out.

506
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,300
This is a big joke.

507
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,200
We was putting you all.

508
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,420
This is a studio.

509
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,720
Is that the way you guys do the show?

510
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,920
Uh-huh.

511
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,980
And what about certain disabilities?

512
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,900
Uh, the dealing with any of the others impaired.

513
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:57,140
We're trying to help those who are afflicted with dealing with, who are, who have the dealing

514
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,160
with any of the others disability.

515
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,820
The Church of the Subgenius is there to help you not have to deal with any of the others.

516
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:09,980
Get the others, the others to, you know, if they see that you're, that you're dealing

517
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,780
with any of the others disabled, we want people to just leave you alone.

518
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,660
If we could just educate folks.

519
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:24,380
When they see someone who is dealing with any of the others disabled, just don't mess

520
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,180
with them, you know.

521
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:31,920
Let them do their, whatever those strange people do, just leave them alone and you'll

522
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,560
be happy and they'll be happy.

523
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,640
That's all we're trying to preach, you know.

524
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,240
It's just by, let bygones be bygones and just let people get along, you know.

525
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,200
I respond for every night.

526
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,340
It's just, it's a peaceful, it's like nonviolent protest, you know.

527
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,640
I think they're peaceful.

528
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,720
I think they're parasites to those.

529
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,160
They're parasites to the environment.

530
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:54,700
Those handicapped people should be cut off and never, ever, ever spoken to or wheeled

531
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,780
around or talked to again.

532
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,600
That's right.

533
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,320
Kill them.

534
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,700
I think, I think, I think, I think they're parasites to those.

535
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,760
As you're someone squaring off.

536
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,940
Repent, quit your job and square off, my friend.

537
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,780
Square off a week.

538
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,060
If you're lonesome tonight, what can you do Saturday night?

539
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,620
If you're lonesome tonight, you can look forward to Saturday night.

540
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:16,620


541
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,820
And stroke your ego just thinking about it.

542
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,400
Mm, mm, mm.

543
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,400
Is there going to be like a salad bar and a thing like that?

544
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,440
Or is it like a ticket drink thing?

545
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,400
Or like a ticket dance matchup?

546
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:36,480
They sell alcohol, the dumb drinks, and they sell smart drinks, which are these new Mondo 2000.

547
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,840
It's like vitamins and pentamines and peptides.

548
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,940
Synthetic brain.

549
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,520
It's like monkey brains.

550
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,380
Yes.

551
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:44,800
And things.

552
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,560
All of them.

553
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,720
Actually, it keeps you alive forever.

554
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,100
It's called life extension and mind extension.

555
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,000
Oh, just what I want.

556
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,380
You won't ever die and you'll be much more intelligent and none of the drugs will make you feel bad.

557
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,740
That's the story anyway.

558
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,080
And that's why they call it the smart bar because they sell those smart drinks.

559
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,940
And this is the cool and happening thing.

560
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,820
You know, this is the latest new trend that the Church of the Sub...

561
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:15,700
You can always tell when a trend is about to get new when the Church of the Subgenius latches onto it like a lamprey or a leech.

562
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:24,860
And ride piggyback kind of rides it like a monkey on its back until it's bled all the slack from it and given it to its own members.

563
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:34,380
So this is how we, you, the subgeniuses and subgenius sympathizers can show up at the smart bar and leech off all the potential slack in that trendy ride scene.

564
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,740
Slack, sex, and money.

565
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,800
Praise God, praise God.

566
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,160
And you'll have it all.

567
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:55,040
Amazing face that's known as Bob.

568
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:03,720
You promised slack to me.

569
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,020
I took your advice.

570
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:18,500
And quit my job.

571
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:33,440
Now I'll work twice as hard for thee.

572
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,200
I'll be back in a minute.

573
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:44,740
I'll be back in a minute.

574
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,880
I'll be back in a minute.

575
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,600
When it's good to see you here tonight.

576
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,880
But I got to say it's all about right.

577
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:59,600
Behind the scenes of the things you see is a lot of hard-work heresy.

578
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,260
Now Bob is great.

579
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,860
And Bobby is good.

580
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,860
But he don't slack near like I should.

581
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,840
He should be eating Bob out of the flying bed.

582
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,880
I'm crossing assets, smart bar said.

583
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,780
Whoa, give it back.

584
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,760
Where do I go to get my slack?

585
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,680
Whoa, give me back.

586
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,780
Like another ranch, the place to run.

587
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,520
I went to a party that was wrong.

588
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,400
Because everybody wanted to hear Bob's song.

589
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,460
And had me play it till my fingers bled.

590
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,900
When nothing paid and no one said no.

591
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,360
Give it back.

592
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,340
Where do I go to get my slack?

593
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,140
Say it, whoa, give me back.

594
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,320
Like another ranch, the place to run.

595
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,260
I worked all night.

596
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,820
Here's another ranch.

597
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,960
I wanted to sleep but they said you can't.

598
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,500
You got to pack up a room or two.

599
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,400
And put up a table in for your crew.

600
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,500
Whoa, give it back.

601
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,480
Where do I go to get my slack?

602
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,280
Say, whoa, give me back.

603
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,360
Like another ranch, the place to run.

604
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:40,240
Whoa, give me back.

605
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,240


606
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,240


607
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,880
I wanted to sleep but they said you can't.

608
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,440
You got to pack up a room or two.

609
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,160
You got to pack up a room or two.

610
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,040
You got to pack up a room or two.

611
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,180
You got to pack up a room or two.

612
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,700
So I'll give people to you.

613
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,860
Because we are through.

614
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,880
You'll have to find a world to stay.

615
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,120
We're going to enjoy the ranch and wave.

616
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,140
Whoa, give it back.

617
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,240
Where do we go to get our slack?

618
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,460
Say, whoa, give me back.

619
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,400
Not another event to run.

620
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,560
Say, whoa, give it back.

621
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,520
Where do we go to get our slack?

622
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,540
Say, whoa, give me back.

623
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,720
Not another event to run.

624
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,720
Not another big event to run.

625
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,580
Not another ranch, the place to run.

626
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,560
Give it back.

627
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,020
and you'll have it all

628
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,240
I loved you at first glance

629
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,760
Now, back to parasitic relationships

630
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,240
These drinks

631
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,820
I've heard some of these drinks

632
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,480
can cause extreme damage

633
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,120
to like the fifth lumbar

634
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,720
and the lower axle area

635
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,060
if you haven't had your axle

636
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,920
That's what the conspiracy

637
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,220
Food and Drug Administration wants you to believe

638
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,120
Actually, the things won't hurt you a bit

639
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,240
They just want to control them so they can raise the price

640
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,620
just like they did with

641
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,000
FROP and things like that

642
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,640
I see, so again

643
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,040
the veil of conspiracy

644
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,000
the haze of that misbegotten

645
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,520
one monolithic

646
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,840
or mini-lithic

647
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,920
it covers up what

648
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,620
is something being covered up again now?

649
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,060
Now the stage is bare

650
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,640
and I'm standing there

651
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,780
with

652
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,240
sex

653
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,260
sex

654
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,720
money

655
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,540
sex

656
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,520
money

657
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,100
sex

658
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,340
money

659
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,020
sex

660
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,480
money

661
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,600
sex

662
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,060
money

663
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:27,500
sex statut

664
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:27,620
sex

665
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:27,940
sex

666
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:27,940


667
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:27,940


668
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:27,940


669
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:27,940


670
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:05,300
Connie finds a fellow, she lies, she marries him, because it keeps him from sinning.

671
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:13,340
And that's what I like to do tonight, is find my true yeti, my mate.

672
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,100
There's Connie's Custom Carving Service.

673
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:22,420
If you've got the prize, we've got the size.

674
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:28,440
The bigger, the fatter, the harder, the wetter.

675
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,600
Happy, I tell you.

676
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,700
Where did you come from?

677
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,460
Where?

678
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,620
Where are you going?

679
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,040
Where is Bob going?

680
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,740
Well, dear friends, I want to give some credits real quick here.

681
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:07,460
So you know what you've been listening to since the last time I gave credits.

682
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,740
We've heard a little bit of KPFA.

683
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,620
This is starting way at the beginning.

684
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:19,100
There was some KPFA, Puzzling Evidence Show, starring Philo Drummond and Bishop Joey.

685
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,900
Talking about St. Stupid there.

686
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,400
And quite a bit of Cuckoo.

687
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,360
And some more good cuts from the Lonesome Cowboy Dave Show.

688
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,900
They're from WCSB in Cleveland.

689
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,660
Oh, what a wonderful show.

690
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,620
ESO Radio, it's also called.

691
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:44,040
And, of course, quite a bit of the little Bob chanting from Princess We Are Doe and Mary Squared.

692
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:48,100
Drifting around in a car, looking for Oberlin.

693
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,060
And, uh...

694
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,400
The Lord is...

695
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,220
Is my happening.

696
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,920
That hippie Lord prayer.

697
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,000
We don't know who did that, but it was donated to the church.

698
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:06,180
With several nice tape pieces by Reverend Susie the Flusie, who was in town this weekend.

699
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:16,060
She also gave us the tape of the guy talking about the naked dancing of the nudity of my heart.

700
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:21,340
That's Rexino Mondo from an incredible kook album he did called...

701
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:22,760
Pay.

702
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:23,940
Pay.

703
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,020
Messenger of Pay.

704
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:33,220
Which was his kook testament to Debbie Reynolds.

705
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:33,880
Yes.

706
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,180
We may hear more of that in the weeks to come.

707
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,760
Hard work heresy.

708
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,480
Song there by Sister Melodious Chops at the Rant Raven in Cleveland.

709
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,680
As well as Sister Mary Squared there.

710
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,360
Ranting with...

711
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,240
Of all things, Pope Sternodot.

712
00:37:52,420 --> 00:38:01,320
and the world beat drummers repercussion in the background ah yes and that lovely

713
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,260
a sister Mary squared we'll hear just a little bit more of her coming

714
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:35,200
are you tired of studying bitches pretending like they know you on television asking you to call the 1-900 number well

715
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:47,100
Connie doesn't know you from Adam but she'll moan so loud you can put the phone down and use both hands

716
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,180
wouldn't you like to be married to a woman like God

717
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,020
Connie is opposed to a woman like Bobby

718
00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:16,920
what if you'll marry me Dr. Lequeuze Pope Sterno Frederick Craig are you there will you help me someone please hurt me baby tell me I'm pretty I wanna holler at the town students all

719
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,480
seems like they're gonna kick us out of here in a few minutes

720
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,000
I figured that

721
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:28,280
your ramp number three might coincide with my ramp number four if you know what I mean sister

722
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:37,120
oh ho ho two and two do equal four but a five has gotten me ten and I do know how to work it

723
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:52,240
hey old Connie as I have said earlier we are a cell set that is selling sex and there is no one on this earth that can sell sex like Bob and Connie

724
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:52,420


725
00:39:54,540 --> 00:40:13,940
now we're not launching a Sam Snead head up here tonight we're not launching a Lee Torito head that wouldn't make any sense we're launching a living bleeding fast-free coagulated bleeding head of Arnold Palmer

726
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,120
and oh boy they're dealing heavily with some damn stuff

727
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,400
what was the last time you had sex with a man called Bob?

728
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,580
I don't know if you can get stuck on ground?

729
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,400
this may be your chance!

730
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,500
someone in this audience is going to be...

731
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,540
is going to catch this head and probably grossly make out with it

732
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
now he's got some alright

733
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,420
Sterno is lining up for some time

734
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,240
he's lining up for some time

735
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,520
he's testing the wind

736
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,540
he's centering himself

737
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,020
he's...

738
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:59,540
And the name of Fongtang, Ra, Bob, Jehovah One, Connie, He-Dog, Poop-Dog, and our fond

739
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,480
of Ultrasaurus.

740
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,700
Let the head be launched!

741
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,860
Oh my god, the head!

742
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,300
We're in play animation.

743
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,340
Look at that.

744
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,320
He's actually touching the head.

745
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,600
The head is glowing.

746
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,440
The head has been launched twice.

747
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,340
They had to be launched twice.

748
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,280
They're picking a stone.

749
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,660
It's a very grisly religion, isn't it?

750
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,380
The head is being picked.

751
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,420
The demonic lights of the stones are going off.

752
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:37,100
They're holding it by the filthy, tripping, unprofitable fangs that roar in from the stone.

753
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,960
It is being passed around.

754
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,080
No one has made out that the head doesn't appear to kiss the head.

755
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,420
Dr. LeHune, would you care to show the book the new event is?

756
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,040
Is your heart dniill with pain?

757
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,740
Shall I come baclmet?

758
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,400
Shall he come back again?

759
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,320
Shall the king come back again?

760
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,180
I believe he will.

761
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,020
I believe Elvis will be at the SmartBar Saturday night.

762
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,300
Of course he's always in disguise.

763
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,540
He looks like this fat pink now.

764
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:15,440
. ? etai Studios.

765
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,480
and Bob will be playing lead guitar, saxophone, and drums, respectively.

766
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,700
And Jimi Hendrix will be there tomorrow night.

767
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:27,140
I thought that was like a little two-sides hologram thing you guys were going to put up.

768
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,700
There's no trickery, no fakery.

769
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,940
We don't use camera tricks.

770
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,160
Did Reverend Martin Heed go to your church?

771
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,300
Reverend Martin Heed?

772
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,180
I believe it was.

773
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,860
Heed have been Reverend Martin, I believe.

774
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,540
Yeah, I don't know.

775
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:41,880
I'm sure.

776
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,800
I'll check the computer tomorrow.

777
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,620
Oh, he's ordained.

778
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,100
That's right.

779
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,020
Did I say that?

780
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,220
Didn't pick up on it.

781
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,200
Excuse me.

782
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,460
That was a good one.

783
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,400
Can I have another one?

784
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,780
Well, I suppose one's coming up soon.

785
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,320
Here, wait a minute.

786
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,700
We have a question coming in.

787
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,800
Is it okay to use Bob's name in vain?

788
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,620
That's the only way you can really use it.

789
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:09,680
Intravenously.

790
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,380
Right, yeah.

791
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,340
I mean, some people like to...

792
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:12,820
Skin pop.

793
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,480
Skin pop, yeah.

794
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,180
I was going to say pop, pop, skin pops and Bob.

795
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,860
But the dots really don't, you know, I mean, usually just a...

796
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,400
You want at least a whole dot of Bob.

797
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,060
If you're going to...

798
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,120
You know, he's a half-tone pattern in his face is.

799
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,200
And if you...

800
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,740
One dot on an 8x10 size is usually about...

801
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,180
In case you're wondering what's going on.

802
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:36,560
Like Reverend Ron said before, three will kill an elephant, but Bob can take five.

803
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,340
And keep on driving.

804
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,420
All right.

805
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:41,900
Come on.

806
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:47,740
And I want you to know that when Bob smokes his pipe, you smoke along with him.

807
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,920
And when I smoke my pipe, I smoke with Bob.

808
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,340
Thank you.

809
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,080
This is an ugly church.

810
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,740
We are an ugly country.

811
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:07,200
And sex is messy.

812
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,520
Praise the messy sex.

813
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,960
This is a church.

814
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,460
You scared me there, informant.

815
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,080
Say, guys, let's face it.

816
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,220
Today's clothes are designed to look good on today's good-looking men.

817
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,780
When's the last time you saw a male model that parts his...

818
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,660
Teeth in the middle?

819
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:49,180
When you're ugly, it's hard to find clothes that go with your look unless you shop at Ugly Men's Clothing Store.

820
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,200
He's an ugly man.

821
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,020
Ugly Men's Clothing Store, where ugly men can find clothes designed for them.

822
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,480
Even starvation won't stare you in the face when you wear one of our special designer ties.

823
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:06,680
Your own mother will forget you have to lift your nose to eat when she sees these ugly short-sleeved shirts.

824
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,160
He's an ugly man.

825
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,880
So, if you're the kind of guy who has to sneak up on...

826
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,420
a mirror to shave in the morning,

827
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:20,280
or if you've ever gone into a cornfield and scared the crows so much they brought back the corn they took the year before,

828
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,580
then you should be shopping at the Ugly Men's Clothing Store.

829
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,240
He's an ugly man.

830
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:31,640
Ugly Men's Clothing now has two locations downtown at the bus terminal and in the county at the bus terminal.

831
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:37,680
My guest tonight is the Reverend Ivan Stang from the First Church of the Subgenius.

832
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,240
Praise Bob.

833
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,020
Praise Bob.

834
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,240
And, uh...

835
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,800
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

836
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:41,880
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

837
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:41,880


838
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,160
Is still hanging out, going through some 45s here.

839
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:49,240
And, uh, I have pretty much given up my show tonight for whatever takes place.

840
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:55,980
And, uh, if you can lis... if you're hearing the sound of my voice, if you're listening to the sound of my voice,

841
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:03,440
you have been given a task to witness to, um, the church and to Bob, I believe.

842
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,560
It's all for Bob.

843
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,760
Maybe there's a really core message you could get to about...

844
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,660
For the people who are... who...

845
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,420
are gifted enough to be listening to this broadcast at this moment.

846
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,460
The lucky devils. Literally. Devils. That's what they're all gonna be.

847
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,020
A last-minute me... well, all I can say there is...

848
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,240
be there or be square.

849
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,000
You could stay all night.

850
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,680
Yes, I really do.

851
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,140
Or next to me.

852
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:36,040
One of the things that Bob's name is good for is to repeat over and over again.

853
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:36,900
It's a mantra.

854
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:37,540
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

855
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,020
It's a mantra, and you can repeat it over and over again.

856
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,860
Well, didn't Indiana Jones do that? When... when they came out?

857
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:45,560
The guy was trying to cl... get his heart out of his chest, and Indiana Jones said,

858
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,900
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

859
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,000
Yeah.

860
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,980
And it stopped him from doing that.

861
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,240
Yeah.

862
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,020
And yanking his chest. His heart. Right on his...

863
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:57,080
Well, he still had that hand print with all the fingers sort of still stuck in there.

864
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,460
What the hell are y'all talking about?

865
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,480
It's... it's good to... to repeat.

866
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:05,300
And then you can repeat it and repeat it and repeat it and repeat it and repeat it until...

867
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,180
until you remember your own name.

868
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:10,020
That's exactly it. That's what it's good for.

869
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:10,360
Well, shoot. Shoot. Shoot.

870
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:15,380
You repeat Bob's name until you remember your own, and you will... you will remember yourself.

871
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:21,120
The superior rational has remembered you, and you must only...

872
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,600
You see, most people go through life asleep. They're not truly awake.

873
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,180
Bob is the awake man, and he will slap you awake.

874
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,900
Like, take that, and that, and that.

875
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,280
Ow! Ow! Ow!

876
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,240
And, uh, what an alarm clock he is.

877
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,780
The alarm clock of slack.

878
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,460
Always goes... It goes off three hours late every time.

879
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,380
The catechism of catechism.

880
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,360
Because, you know...

881
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:56,600
If you have that job, that's good, because you can repent and quit it.

882
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,340
And slack off.

883
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,680
For those of you who don't have jobs...

884
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,980
No! Oh, God, no!

885
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,800
Oh, no, no, that's all right. That's all right. No, the 60... I know.

886
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,120
When the... the triple your money back... uh...

887
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,340
No, no, no, that's all right. That's all right. No, the 60... I know. When the... the triple your money back...

888
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:10,680
Yeah...

889
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:20,480
Before the voisins holes you think that you act up for a sweet good,

890
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:20,740
and this you...

891
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:25,120
have that cái has to work...

892
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:25,540
No, I love that and that!

893
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:38,340
That if you don't have to do it, all right...

894
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:46,600
And you see that these disembodied souls show up going, where's my $60?

895
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:52,800
I want my triple money back.

896
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:59,020
I didn't get eternal salvation, Bob.

897
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:07,620
And when that happens, you know, just throw them a new, one of your new subgenius pamphlets, and they'll generally go away.

898
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,520
Why not wait? What if you get to lose a little time, maybe?

899
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,000
Come on. You did sign the application.

900
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,740
These are the times that try men's souls.

901
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,300
Come on. But we can come on.

902
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:26,320
We can try your souls and try them and try them until they fit.

903
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,940
And then we'll give them back to you one size fits all.

904
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,040
I'm falling!

905
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,460
I'm falling!

906
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,120
It's a sample of...

907
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:40,200
Sampling is actually what it is.

908
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,820
The whole...

909
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,440
In the name of Jesus...

910
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:51,600
That's my brother, Reverend Robert Tilton of Dallas, Texas, my good brother, said that what he just said,

911
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:59,600
that means send more to me because the ink stains my brain.

912
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,060
Jesus...

913
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,160
I always thought he was talking about soybeans.

914
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:08,620
Or sorghum or something.

915
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,020
And you clarified that like Indian butter.

916
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,600
He's speaking ancient Hebrew.

917
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,300
In ancient dead languages, that's what he's speaking in tongues.

918
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:18,320
It's armate.

919
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,940
We call it armate.

920
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,140
Don't worry. Don't worry. It's all right.

921
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,480
He likes being tongue.

922
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,860
It was silly. It was silly.

923
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,700
I had just the idea of tonguing a word like that.

924
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,020
That's what the mainstream Christians call the...

925
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:37,600
The mainstream Christians call the...

926
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,000
The mainstream...

927
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,880
But Baptist fanatics call the Charismatics, they call them tonguers.

928
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:42,460
Tonguers.

929
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,500
Yeah, I've had regular type Baptist fanatics go,

930
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,520
look, I'm not one of them nuts that's, you know, tonguers.

931
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,260
I ain't a tonguer. I know. I heard that phrase.

932
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:51,880
Don't get me wrong.

933
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,180
And then the guys, they pull their nostril hairs, they call them taskers.

934
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,160
And then there's a tongue...

935
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,420
There's somebody involved with tungsten...

936
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,180
Those are the guys that braid their nostril hairs.

937
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,680
Yeah.

938
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,820
Those are the Rasta...

939
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,700
The Frappafarians.

940
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:05,800
Yeah.

941
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,080
Frappé.

942
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,320
Frappé.

943
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:07,860


944
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:08,160
Frappé.

945
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,460
Frappé.

946
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:08,540
Frappé.

947
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:08,540


948
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:08,540


949
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:08,540


950
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:08,540


951
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:08,540


952
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,380
Frazzanostrils.

953
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:13,540
Well, this is certainly not culturally hegemonistic in any way.

954
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:19,940
This is like a bright blue, green, purple, and yellow, orange, and green, and red mosaic of spirituality

955
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:24,140
represented through one, like, dumb-looking head with a pipe sticking out of it.

956
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,160
It's sticky.

957
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:29,220
It's redulent with frot fumes.

958
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:29,800
It's...

959
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:30,940
It's...

960
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:34,280
It's got tiny little red hairs on each dot.

961
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,680
Just fantastic.

962
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,160
It's religion.

963
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,600
Right there on the street.

964
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,880
In the road, right in front of everybody.

965
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,920
You'll love it.

966
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,900
You'll love it.

967
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:46,860
You'll love it.

968
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,920
You'll love it.

969
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,120
El saboroso.

970
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,020
You'll love it.

971
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:51,340
You'll love it.

972
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,480
El sabado 23.

973
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,420
You'll love it.

974
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:56,460
Your money, if you give it to this church.

975
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:57,640
Slash.

976
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,460
It's a very simple concept to understand.

977
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,120
But some people just don't get it.

978
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,340
Now, two...

979
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,900
Two and two do equal four.

980
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:14,700
But a five will get you ten if you know how to work it.

981
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:30,020
Now, the conspiracy was minimal top, and they have put up all these commercials, and all these what-have-you, and world leaders, and all kinds of things.

982
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,320
They have taught us that you can avoid the noise.

983
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,940
But no, that is not true.

984
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,120
The noise will always be there.

985
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,240
You cannot avoid the noise.

986
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:54,460
And unfortunately, the noise is not a cute little friendly gesture like anime and ee that comes into existence only when you see pizza commercials.

987
00:52:55,100 --> 00:53:00,360
The noise is your tire going flat.

988
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:07,060
The noise is you failing that math test that you studied so hard for.

989
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:07,060


990
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:19,740
The noise is anyone or anything or any situation that you get yourself into that is unpleasant and does not provide slack.

991
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:25,440
Now, you can't avoid the noise because it will always get you.

992
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:29,880
But you can annoy the void.

993
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:37,040
You can reach into any situation and pull yourself out of it.

994
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:37,040


995
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,220
You can get trapped by the bootstraps.

996
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:45,160
Bob has been drunk so many times that he didn't think he could get enough.

997
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,600
But Connie did just that little bit of trying, and she reached into the void.

998
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:55,440
And hell, first coming, second coming, that's for Jesus.

999
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:00,480
Third, fourth, fifth coming is for mom and Connie.

1000
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:11,660
Fourth, fifth of five, is for Max....

1001
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,380
...and sixth the activity.

1002
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,080
It's more than you and ten times.

1003
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:26,380
And the three of them get into thisature, making it so hard for I think Sugar needs for them to get an idea of what the a-bomb ought to it.

1004
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,960
But you and I, most of all, wait.

1005
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:28,960


1006
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:28,960


1007
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:28,960


1008
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:28,960


1009
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:37,020
But since I got up in the morning to leaveb tried puffing out theオン and thinking I should sit here and still finish the song.

1010
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:48,840
I don't understand what eating dead people if you could clarify this a little bit of large

1011
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:54,400
what does it eating dead people's heads have to do with the church's subgenius I don't know if I

1012
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:00,780
got my notes right on this here but said there was an accident in Austin and palm of redips or

1013
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:06,160
somebody or some other those are all lies all lies but what was what did you hear I heard that

1014
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:12,000
someone they were involved in eating small baby heads or something and they blamed on the church

1015
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,740
of this sub I don't know was the sub phonics or the subgenius I don't know that I don't know

1016
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:20,800
either because there was the guy that made the artwork out of the dead dog in Baltimore and that

1017
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,280
may be the one you're thinking about you know the two dead dogs he's the one who had the mustaches

1018
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,200
on the top of his head and the brain tattooed tentatively a convenience of the famous subgenius

1019
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:36,000
performance artists got in a lot of trouble more than Schwartz Kogler I could tell you right now

1020
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:36,140
I'm not sure if you're going to be able to tell me what you're thinking but I'm not sure if you're

1021
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:36,820
going to be able to tell me what you're thinking but I'm not sure if you're going to be able to tell me

1022
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:36,820


1023
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:41,740
or you may be talking about the launching of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer oh that was quite

1024
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:49,200
an event well it's an ongoing event the head is always being launched I saw in the past figuratively

1025
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:55,960
it takes off doesn't it literally takes off and you know when you talk well you were asking I

1026
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:02,320
think what you were referring to was the doctrine of the zombies eating the dead well see things

1027
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,220
the way the conspiracy world is now this is

1028
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,000
Jane

1029
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,020
or hyper fleets taught on this st.

1030
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:34,520
Jane or hyper fleets of Little Rock Arkansas he said and I'll quote now when I was a zombie things were different when I was a zombie when we rose from the dead we did it at six o'clock in the morning not one o'clock in the afternoon damn straight he's kids nowadays he's damn zombies nowadays now when I was a zombie when we ate the flesh of a woman's corpse we did it with respect for the woman that's right things are going to hell nowadays and on a fast basket on a fastback

1031
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:34,780
stick

1032
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:36,700
yeah

1033
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,000
so

1034
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,540
that's why we put you in that boxcar with

1035
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:50,000
those sliders well I mean I've been enjoying myself since then but I I think it's more of a transfigurable form of impalement I mean I don't really feel like I'm losing you know stigmata from any wound yet are

1036
00:56:50,520 --> 00:57:06,000
because you have to see you haven't spent your you haven't bought your are rather procure your love offering your membership card and that's true I have while I ain't paid up so to speak you know if that's it to me yeah I'm more of an effective

1037
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,120
yes

1038
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:06,120


1039
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:06,120


1040
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:06,120


1041
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:06,120


1042
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:06,120


1043
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,140
now that I'm dismembered.

1044
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:10,980
Consider yourself a blessed...

1045
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,080
Yeah, you are truly blessed.

1046
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:13,560
I'm blessed.

1047
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,940
You are truly blessed.

1048
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:22,860
And I think I'm truly blasted.

1049
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,980
It's strange.

1050
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,040
You know, we've never had anyone in this studio

1051
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,260
that can make their body vibrate that way.

1052
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,640
I noticed when you do a little...

1053
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,600
And aside for a moment,

1054
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,160
that you begin to change color

1055
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,320
and your perforations change also.

1056
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:49,080
Well, see, I'm in touch with my true Yeti self.

1057
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,500
All subgeniuses are descendants of the Yetis,

1058
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,820
the mighty Yetis of Atlantis,

1059
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:56,820
who are like super extreme versions,

1060
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,520
caricature cartoon versions

1061
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,760
of the way their Yeti descendants are.

1062
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,180
You know, I look almost human.

1063
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,680
But, well,

1064
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,140
within reason.

1065
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:10,580
And as being in touch with my true Yeti self,

1066
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,740
I'm able to duplicate some of the physical endowments

1067
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,340
of the Yeti,

1068
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,620
such as, as you can see here,

1069
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,700
changing my hair color,

1070
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,660
ruffling up the ridges on my back,

1071
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,400
puffing up certain...

1072
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:21,920
It's wild.

1073
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,960
...and the migrating side orifices,

1074
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,020
as well as the elbow appendages.

1075
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,460
It's strange as hell, really.

1076
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,220
It is.

1077
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,640
Did you grow a new appendage, man?

1078
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,000
Did you?

1079
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,760
Did you?

1080
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:35,220
Did you?

1081
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:35,220


1082
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:35,660
Lucy?

1083
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,360
Lucy?

1084
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,260
Did you?

1085
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,340
Did you grow a new appendage?

1086
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:38,760
Did you?

1087
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:39,160
Did you?

1088
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,860
Have you seen a boy named Vicky?

1089
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,160
That coffee got the...

1090
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,200
No, it's...

1091
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:48,840
No, it's...

1092
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,020
Where the land of England

1093
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,080
touches the land of Vermont.

1094
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,520
Of Vermont.

1095
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,560
Hi, man.

1096
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,620
What's going on?

1097
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,200
What's going on?

1098
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,280
This is getting too weird.

1099
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,000
I mean, this is like...

1100
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,620
This is like...

1101
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:07,000
The bold surrealism factor is...

1102
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,800
I don't think he...

1103
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,600
I can't even...

1104
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,580
It's not making any...

1105
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,460
Even to...

1106
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,700
And as it says here...

1107
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,340
As it says here...

1108
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:33,960
I'd like to remind you beings...

1109
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:34,600
I'd like to remind you beings...

1110
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,100
That you're listening...

1111
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:36,500
That you're listening...

1112
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,500
Listening to...

1113
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,260
Listening to...

1114
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,000
Listening to...

1115
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,260
The...

1116
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,380
The Subgenius Radio Ministry

1117
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:45,280
Hour of Slack, dear friends.

1118
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,160
From here in beautiful Dallas, Texas,

1119
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:51,640
this is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1120
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:54,740
And the Hour of Slack, as you may not know,

1121
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:58,720
is the output, radio output,

1122
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,860
of the Church of the Subgenius

1123
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:04,000
under that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1124
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:04,600
And you can...

1125
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,240
You can get free information

1126
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,240
about Subgenius books, magazines, tapes,

1127
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,820
and videos, and so forth.

1128
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,400
Free information, dear friends.

1129
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:16,100
From...

1130
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,340
I'm about to give that address.

1131
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,900
Just write to Bob.

1132
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,800
Address that to Bob at

1133
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,340
Post Office Box

1134
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,320
140306

1135
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,860
Dallas, Texas

1136
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,440
75214

1137
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,340
Once again, that's

1138
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:33,680
Bob...

1139
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,860
Bob at Post Office Box

1140
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,020
140306

1141
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,640
Dallas, Texas

1142
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,380
75214

1143
01:00:47,380 --> 01:01:03,300
I believe we are on an irreversible trend

1144
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,580
towards the future.

1145
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:06,200
and democracy.

1146
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,440
But that could change.

1147
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,800
That is what he said.

1148
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,720
That is what

1149
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,840
J. Danforth Quayle,

1150
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,400
44th Vice President

1151
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,380
of the United States,

1152
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:22,080
said.

1153
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:27,800
He was born a Hoosier,

1154
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,320
raised and educated

1155
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,320
in Indiana.

1156
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:34,560
And this is what he said.

1157
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:43,280
what he said. This is what Dan Quayle said to the United Negro College Fund. What a waste

1158
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:53,940
it is to lose one's mind, or not to have a mind. How true that is. While visiting Hawaii,

1159
01:01:54,240 --> 01:02:03,720
he said, Hawaii has always been a very pivotal role in the Pacific. It is in the Pacific.

1160
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:15,240
It is a part of the United States that is an island that is right here. That is what

1161
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:32,240
he said. To the Samoans, Danforth Quayle said, you all look like happy campers to me. Happy

1162
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,460
campers you are.

1163
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:43,740
Happy campers you have been. And as far as I'm concerned, happy campers you will always

1164
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:55,240
be. And about his homeland, he said, it's rural America. It's where I came from. We

1165
01:02:55,240 --> 01:03:03,540
always refer to ourselves as real America. Rural America. Real America.

1166
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:07,100
Real, real America.
