🎵 For Christ was not our Savior, nor born on Christmas Day 🎵

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,400

🎵 To think of cruel injustices all done in Jesus' name 🎵

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,380

neo-pagan reformed choir of Miskatonic University.

41
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,000
This is of course the Alec brand.

42
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,720
It's going to be an official Christmas show,

43
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,540
and we know that he, but we can't find a copy of it

44
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,160
for the Christmas tape, which to cause subgeniuses.

45
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,000
I've noticed that the rival want, they say,

46
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,580
well non-Christians shouldn't say, even say Merry Christmas,

47
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,300
they shouldn't celebrate it because it's a Christian holiday.

48
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,600
Like the ancient Egyptians floated on the current of their belief,

49
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,520
for they thought they would never die,

50
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,600
but be reborn as gargling sarcophagi,

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,460
horrible mummies to march across the earth and wreak and spew vengeance.

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,340
Give me the pyroflagellator.

53
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,620
All of the little tiny dead deities march down the side of the subgenius church.

54
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,800
See, within the great pyramid, the secret chamber of the subgenius.

55
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:54,820
My God.

56
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,780
What light and steam come from the special effects department

57
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,980
located below the pyramid?

58
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,280
I don't know.

59
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,720
Here, inside the heart of the mighty structure,

60
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,140
puzzling evidence broadcasts from the inner chamber of the great pyramid.

61
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,380
Yeah, I'll teach you all how to talk on the radio.

62
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:08,880
Come on down.

63
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,140
Yes, these giant pyramids are actually radio stations of a primitive nature,

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,520
which broadcast by the strange...

65
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,420
I'll play rock and roll until everybody falls apart.

66
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,840
I'll copy that old Procter and Berger movie.

67
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,960
Then they would show the strange films to the walls of the...

68
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,840
Come on, let's watch it, G-man.

69
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,820
Chris Vaughn.

70
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,640
Oh, yes, dear friends.

71
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,300
This is Li Liqi, a Chinese subgenius.

72
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,860
And you are listening to the Hour of Slack on KNON in Dallas, Texas.

73
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,940
Remember, Bob and the comrades of all people.

74
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,320
Here in China, just like in America,

75
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,560
the people need slack.

76
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,280
In Chinese, we call slack .

77
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,280
But it must be true slack,

78
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,800
not the best slack.

79
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,820
The slack of the conspiracy.

80
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,340
Chris Vaughn, help me somebody.

81
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,480
One, two, Santa's coming for you.

82
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,560
Three, four, you better lock your door.

83
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,300
Five, six, grab a crucifix.

84
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,420
Six, seven, eight, better stay out late.

85
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,880
Nine, ten, Santa's coming again.

86
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,280
Daddy, when's Santa be showing with his big red sack?

87
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,340
.

88
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,340


89
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,180
Way up north where the cold wind blows.

90
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,260
There's a little old man that you all know.

91
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,460
He's been busting his nuts the whole damn year.

92
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,520
Stamping on tools, riding his gear.

93
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,560
Come, Prancer, open it, say, oh, what a great book.

94
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,740
It's that time of year, guess I've got all the luck.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,900
You, Mrs. Claus, are you ready at last?

96
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,500
Your coal is ready.

97
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,900
I'm bumped up with gas.

98
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,880
Christmas time is my time of year.

99
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,960
It's your sweet boy's cooking, let's get into gear.

100
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,000
Say his red sack is packed and he's ready to roll.

101
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,120
You're the love damn women from their heads to their toes.

102
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,720
Time to pack up the sled.

103
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,100
Make that be trip.

104
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,700
No time to complain.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,220
Don't you give me no lift.

106
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,760
Dear, count on me.

107
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,360
It's Christmas time.

108
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,320
Deliver my loan if I don't, it's a crime.

109
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,740
Through the curtain on the sky, I'm flying my sled.

110
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,840
Don't need no radar, I'm using my head.

111
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,180
To direct my nose to your chiseled plum.

112
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,140
I tickle your fancy till the morning comes.

113
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,060

You're the love damn women from their heads to their toes.

117
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,400
Well, I come down and cheer me just once a year.

118
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,600
With my big red sack and belly full of beer.

119
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,460
I'm gonna bring all the women lots of Christmas cheer.

120
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,880
Roll it in.

121
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,360
Ready, set, hit the cheer.

122
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,700
Yeah!

123
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,660
This is the story of old Saint Nick.

124
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,760
With his big red sack and his candy stick.

125
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,900
Flying back home with his beard so white.

126
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,000
He's licking that boom tang all Christmas night.

127
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,960
Oh, it's Christmas time, it's my time of year.

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,280


138
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,320
What will the Christmas game look like?

139

Well, when I go to bed

168

Every Christmas Eve I pray

169

To Santa Claus for the same old thing

170
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,180
I wake up in the morning

171
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,080
I see my wife under the Christmas tree

172
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,760
She's the best-looking present in the whole wide world

173
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,120
Who's that, Jack?

174

My wife

With a bow around her belly and a beautiful smile

176
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,020
She's a bee's knees brother, I think I'd stay awhile

177
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,880
She's the finest woman that you'll ever meet

178
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,480
And a stocking stuffer that can't be beat

179

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,140
guitar solo

185
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,140


186
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,480
guitar solo

187
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,480
Now, are we, is Christmas, I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

188
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,800
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

189
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,300
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie, but the present subgenie

190
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,760
tried to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now

191
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,580
and sell everything to the pigs.

192
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,520
Oh, yes, once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

193
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,340
And it was something else in between there, but before it was, after it was a pagan holiday

194
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,600
and before it was a shopping season, it was something else, but

195
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,180
I think they started a war over it.

196
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:36,980
Yeah, yeah. Well, friends, we've got our own special Christmas carol that we're gonna play

197
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,620
that we're inventing as we go right now.

198
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,180
X is missed.

199
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,400
From the town.

200
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,080
Snap!

201
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,220
Sound system!

202
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,820
Sound system!

203
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,540
Sound system!

204
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,720
Sound system!

205
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:47,720


206
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,100
Sound system!

207
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,160
Sound system!

208
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,880
It's HeBob.

209
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,980
Hey, kids, you can help the mighty subgenius Vice overthrow the evil normals

210
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,240
with new Bob Dobbs action figure with rocket pipes.

211
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:03,940
What I wouldn't do.

212
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,620
From Bob Cob-

213
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,060
Get new more chocolatey pebbles from my new now!

214
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,620
Buy my chocolate space cadet.

215
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,860
Life support system down to zero cocoa.

216
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,340
Feeling spacey?

217
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,480
Have some of my new cocoa pebbles.

218
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,240
Now so chocolatey.

219
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,360
Smells cocoa-licious.

220
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,420
Well, friends, what do you think?

221
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,620
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?

222
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:45,920
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob,

223
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,520
as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures?

224
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,320
We're each so separate, we're each so separate, we're each so separate, we're each so separate, we're each so separate.

225
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:54,900
New.

226
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,520
R2-D2, we wish you a Merry Christmas.

227
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,500
R2-D2, we love you, it's true.

228
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,160
R2-D2, we love you, it's true.

229
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:15,900
R2-D2, we love you, it's true.

230
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,600
R2-D2, we wish you a Merry Christmas.

231
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,520
We hope our little message gets to you.

232
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,320
We look up at the winter star.

233
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,960
We know that's where you are.

234
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:35,080
Our chimney's big and round, so you can come right down.

235
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,020
And if our wish comes true, we'll spend Christmas Eve with you.

236
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,660
Our hearts will sing with glee as we decorate the Christmas tree.

237
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,000
R2-D2, we wish you a Merry Christmas.

238
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,780
R2-D2, we love you, it's true.

239
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,020
R2-D2, we wish you a Merry Christmas.

240
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,940
We hope our little message gets to you.

241
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,440
And if the snow becomes too deep, just give a little beep.

242
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,580
We'll go in by the fire and warm your little wine.

243
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,160
Spreading Christmas cheer.

244
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,720
We'll be easy with you here.

245
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,240
We'll dance and sing and play.

246
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,460
From Christmas Eve till Christmas Day.

247
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,640
R2-D2, we love you, it's true.

248
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,060
R2-D2, we wish you a Merry Christmas.

249
00:17:51,820 --> 00:18:00,080
R2-D2, we wish you a Merry Christmas.

250
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,060
We hope our little message gets to you.

251
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,880
We love you, R2.

252
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,300
R2-D2, we love you, it's true.

253
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,620
We hope our little message gets to you.

254
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,380
The presents are for you.

255
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,900
Merry Christmas, R2.

256
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,460
Joseph, Joseph, you from Tonka.

257
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,940
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob.

258
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,500
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.

259
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,720
Shut up, pink boy!

260
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,220
No way, I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.

261
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,240
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien fool.

262
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,600
Bob Dobbs comes with rockets, pipe, head launcher,

263
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,560
Janeer device, all I got is a fighting Jesus

264
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,040
and other action figures sold separately.

265
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,040
Some assembly required, batteries not included.

266
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,520
This toy falls apart in three days.

267
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,340
He-Bob!

268
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,220
...and the bastards of the universe.

269
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,520
Too much is always better than not enough.

270
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,660
...from Bob Dobbs.

271
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,760
...and I came down so separately.

272
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,660
Gorgeous.

273
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,600
We girls can blow from head to toe.

274
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,720
Light Barbie.

275
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,580
...bron Stoner.

276
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:13,620
What do you see here?

277
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,640
Ken Dolls sold separately.

278
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,140
He-Man, He-Man.

279
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,060
Now to test my thunder punch.

280
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,120
You hear it here, but you feel it there.

281
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,320
Skeletor figure, Castle Grayskull and Thunder Punch He-Man figure each sold separately.

282
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,240
You put the castle together.

283
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,380
With He-Man over there, Grayskull will be mine.

284
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,940
Like I said, bone face.

285
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,860
You hear the thunder here, but I feel the punch here.

286
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,200
Thunder Punch He-Man, new from the Masters of the Universe collection.

287
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,760
Skeletor and Castle Grayskull.

288
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,620
They sell each sold separately.

289
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,320
Too much is always better than not.

290
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:45,740
...and wrestling.

291
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,820
...will return.

292
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,780
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.

293
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,660
...of Santa Claus.

294
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,920
Here's Robot, a robot you can program to perform eight different functions.

295
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,700
Upsy Baby.

296
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,540
Upsy Baby, the doll that stands up.

297
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,520
She's new, from Kenner.

298
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,660
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

299
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,640
We must buy our toys.

300
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,740
We have devised a marketing scheme for children.

301
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,380
So fun times!

302
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,100
Children's toys.

303
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,120
They won't talk until they need things.

304
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,860
They will powerful resist us.

305
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,500
They will progress against us.

306
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,120
I think kiddos like this stuff.

307
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,140
Doesn't suggestion count?

308
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,440
You have got open arms.

309
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,620
You can't slide up.

310
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,580
No.

311
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:30,900
Thank you.

312
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,180
Thank you.

313
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,540
Thank you.

314
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,340
Thank you.

315
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,740
Thank you.

316
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,300
Thank you.

317
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:30,700
Thank you.

318
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,200
Thank you.

319
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,040
Thank you.

320
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,520
Thank you.

321
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,100
Thank you.

322
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,980
Thank you.

323
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,660
No, don't play the tape.

324
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,660
Not that show.

325
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,200
August 21st, 1973.

326
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,540
No, well, close.

327
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,360
You mean you aren't going to church again today?

328
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,200
Baby, don't bother me.

329
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,540
That was what I was saying.

330
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,080
You know this is the only day off.

331
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,220
Y'all don't have to live in church to be saved.

332
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,560
That was my 20th birthday.

333
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,580
If you aren't careful, you're going to miss out with the Lord.

334
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,980
It's my wife.

335
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,420
I told her my name was Daniel.

336
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,120
Come on, Kim.

337
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,400
Oh, no.

338
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,680
No, that was when she left with Kim.

339
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,800
Well, my son, you heard the word.

340
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,840
I think we're all going to miss out on the Lord.

341
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,520
You were warned.

342
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,960
Were you so foolish that you think you could outwit the law of God?

343
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,800
No, we actually are not.

344
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,200
You have returned and have been saved as a bar.

345
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,000
See, friends, here's the thing.

346
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,400
When they told us...

347
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:16,800
Sorry.

348
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,100
So this song's always four.

349
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,420
I killed Rudolph and I'm glad that I did.

350
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,380
I shot him in the brain when he was playing reindeer games.

351
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,580
I killed Rudolph and you know I'm glad that you did.

352
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,880
Now I can go down to Burger King.

353
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,340
I can say that I killed demon courts.

354
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,240
Get him on a plate with a little bit of horse.

355
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,700
Then I get water.

356
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,000
As they grab the window, I'll pull out my car and I'll say to the lady.

357
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,100
Uh, Rudolph for all the no's.

358
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,980
I'm glad I just shot him in the brain when he was playing reindeer games.

359
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,020
I killed Rudolph and you know I'm glad that you did.

360
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,800
Now I can have him when I go to Burger King.

361
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,580
I got two items, drum and chime only.

362
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,560
Now he's gone and he's got a heffaloni.

363
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,100
I killed Rudolph.

364
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,780
I'm glad that I did.

365
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,700
I killed Rudolph.

366
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,560
Get him on a big mac.

367
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,540
aaaaaaaaaaacckkkk

368
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,160
Uh, right after we're over those.

369
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:43,780
I don't know.

370
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,360
I don't know.

371
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,380
I don't know.

372
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,600
I don't know.

373
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,600
I don't know.

374
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,280
I don't know.

375
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,380
It's Christmas time

376
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,740
and there's no need

377
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,080
to be afraid.

378
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,980
At Christmas

379
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,100
time, we

380
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,960
let in light and we

381
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,000
banish shame.

382
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,260
But in our world

383
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,660
of plenty,

384
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,860
we can spread a

385
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,320
smile of joy.

386
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,020
Throw your arms around

387
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,180
the world at Christmas

388
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,020
time.

389
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,700
But

390
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,700
say a prayer

391
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,480
to pray

392
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,600
for the other ones.

393
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,680
At Christmas

394
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,800
time, it's

395
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,460
hard, but when you're

396
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,520
having fun,

397
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,520
there's a world

398
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,400
outside your window

399
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,560
and it's a world

400
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,040
of dread and fear

401
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,100
where the only

402
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,660
water flowing

403
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,400
is the bitter stain

404
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,760
of tear.

405
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,340
And the Christmas bells

406
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,520
that ring there

407
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,260
are the clanging chimes

408
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,860
of doom.

409
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,880
Well, tonight, thank God,

410
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,320
it's them instead of

411
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,720
you.

412
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,320
And there won't

413
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,240
be snow in Africa

414
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,080
this Christmas

415
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,700
time.

416
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,340
The greatest gift

417
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,240
they'll get this year

418
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,200
is life.

419
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,480
Oh,

420
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,040
oh, oh.

421
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,140
Well, nothing

422
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,720
ever grows.

423
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,860
No rain or rivers

424
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,380
flow.

425
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,400
Do they know

426
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,200
it's Christmas time

427
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,460
at all?

428
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,780
Here's to you.

429
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,840
Raise your glass

430
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,960
for everyone.

431
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,160
Here's to them underneath

432
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,840
that burning sun.

433
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,500
Do they know it's Christmas

434
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,260
time at all?

435
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,980
The light shines

436
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:32,980


437
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:32,980


438
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:32,980


439
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,320
Their

440
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,920
Christ in

441
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,760
Israel Hell.

442
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,060
And what a

443
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,980
bleak

444
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:43,980


445
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,320
way.

446
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,400
It's really

447
00:32:51,660 --> 00:33:06,980
Be the world. Let them know it's Christmas time.

448
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,800
See, friends, here's the thing.

449
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,820
When they told us that we were damned and we're going to go to hell,

450
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,220
you know, what else could we do but start a church?

451
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,180
Uh, yes.

452
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,280
But the glory and the splendor that could have...

453
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,480
Switch over to some, uh...

454
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,740
What have we got here on turntable one, I think?

455
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:48,060
Throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity is an awful price to pay.

456
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,740
It is an awful price to pay.

457
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,960
Mom, Buck's calling you.

458
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,460
And we do...

459
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,700
We're going to seriously address this issue,

460
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,680
but in the meantime, we have the problem of who is the Santa Bob?

461
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,980
Were there any readings here on the Santa?

462
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:05,280
Santa Bob?

463
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,240
Didn't you have I'm-a-Bob on the show last week?

464
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,740
No, that was the show before, and we had to pay...

465
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,540
Yeah, that's right.

466
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,900
That's right, we did have the I'm-a-Bob on the show last week.

467
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,560
It's a...

468
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,900
It's a Bob and a Euro Bob.

469
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,200
Santa Bob and Maria.

470
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,960
But, you know, we ought to talk a little bit about where-bobs and I'm-a-bobs tonight, Reverend Stang.

471
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,720
I can sense a little bit of that coming on Red Reverend Stang.

472
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,020
The where-bobs and I'm-a...

473
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,400
Those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.

474
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:34,980
Santa Bob.

475
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,160
Santa Bob.

476
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,160


477
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,160


478
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,160


479
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,160


480
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,160


481
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,160


482
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,160


483
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,140
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.

484
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:42,340
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous errands,

485
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:49,640
the grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

486
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:53,740
And they stop using the locks of their doors, and they just kind of float in through the keyhole.

487
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,180
Oh, friends, it's tough.

488
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:01,000
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.

489
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,420
You gotta send your money to the Santa Bob.

490
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,160
As a matter of fact...

491
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:13,400
The people across the street from me told their kids that Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.

492
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,320
Can you believe that?

493
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,460
The kids were asking if their parents...

494
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,000
Maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.

495
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,660
And the mom said, no, no, he won't because he bills us.

496
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,660
We can't afford that.

497
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,580
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.

498
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,260
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

499
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:32,980
Yeah.

500
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,020
What kind of a Christmas season...

501
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,220
The reason is this, where Santa Claus is starting to bill...

502
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,760
And the delivery, can you imagine the delivery costs of bringing that stuff up from the North Pole?

503
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,280
That's going to be added on, too, friends.

504
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,660
Even the Gimme Bob sort of pale into comparison with that.

505
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,300
Yeah.

506
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,280
Oh, friend, Sam is on a diet.

507
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,340
And they, uh, and this person, you know, I knew there was something that they weren't saying.

508
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,720
And finally, he goes, well, I just hope that...

509
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,500
It was something like, I just hope that, you know,

510
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,140
I just hope that, you know, I just hope that, you know,

511
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:05,140


512
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:05,480
I just hope that, you know, I just hope that, you know,

513
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:05,940
Let's go to the yaşpang.

514
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,860
or something like that.

515
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,520
He just hung up.

516
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,240
He hung up.

517
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,380
That was the key point,

518
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,320
is that he didn't want to hear what I had to say back about that,

519
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,380
because, you know, see, a subgenius has so much faith

520
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,320
that he not only can accept somebody making fun of Bob,

521
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,940
stomping on a picture of Bob,

522
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,920
he'll do it himself.

523
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,280
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.

524
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,940
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.

525
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,120
Now, we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertainers,

526
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:42,580
tapes but we sub-geni may be bad but our way of bad is holy is holy compared to

527
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:48,140
the evil of so not all at all by any means but so many American fundamentalist

528
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,200
charismatic day evangelicals etc in general of course they and their

529
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:59,360
corresponding types in Iran Russia Libya South Africa etc if you ask me are

530
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:04,580
actually the ace up the devil's sleeve wolves and sheeps clothing friends just

531
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:10,120
like Jesus warned about by we're Jesus and Bob like we say our old drinking

532
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:15,140
buddies got nothing against Jesus it's just his fan club and now we aren't

533
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,720
saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve he's more like the smear on God's

534
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:24,820
handkerchief just like you were me but the uptight rival cults they don't think

535
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,920
God has a handkerchief oh no because God's perfect he doesn't even sneeze

536
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,340
we're made in his image except that we have all these nasty parts attached

537
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:34,560
to us we're made in his image except that we have all these nasty parts attached

538
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:42,660
to us we have to go in the secret room bathroom do awful things but God he's

539
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,640
clean and pure according to them oh and he's male but he doesn't excrete juices

540
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,000
and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do cuz we sin oh yeah we all

541
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,220
sin we're bad we're worthless we're no good to God unless we sign a contract

542
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:02,980
with his agent well friend Jesus himself he spouted just about as many great

543
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,540
punchlines as Bob probably not as many as Bob's punchlines but he's a good

544
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:15,880
punchlines as Bob probably not as many as Bob's punchlines but he's a good

545
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,080
luck has it but literally it's horrible inside his body it's scary I do that

546
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,220
sweet up but uh but when the father of God He makes the she picture of myself

547
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,220


548
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,220


549
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,220


550
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,260
new

551
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:34,520
boy

552
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,520
That, in fact, was probably his main point, now lost in antiquity,

553
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,700
that you were the son or daughter of God just as much as Jesus was.

554
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,120
Or Bob, see?

555
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,420
But that's too humanistic for the conspiracy Christians,

556
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,260
so they wiped out the subgenius Gnostic Christians.

557
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,420
Anyway, I'm going to get off my soapbox.

558
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,400
We'll get into the hideous theological discussions

559
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,220
coming up next week as we attack the Bobbies.

560
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,920
I interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement.

561
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,500
We turn.

562
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:09,380
Hey, Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.

563
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,880
One of the greatest moments of my life!

564
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,400
To introduce the world's greatest,

565
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,520
the world heavyweight champion,

566
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,820
Humphumer, Rudy Ray Ma!

567
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:36,160
Right on, right on, right on, right on.

568
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,580
Right on, right on.

569
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,240
I am yours truly, Rudy Ray Ma,

570
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,480
bold and still beauty.

571
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,940
Baby, I want to talk to you for this Christmas,

572
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,840
because Christmas holds a lot of memories for me.

573
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,720
Baby, I've had a lot of hard times at Christmas time.

574
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,260
I can remember me and my brother when I was about six years old.

575
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,100
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece,

576
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,200
and the health department made us take them down.

577
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,680
Baby, me and my brother wore tennis shoes so long.

578
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,240
Let me tell you how long we wore them.

579
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,460
We wore tennis shoes Indian summer, Easter, Thanksgiving,

580
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,200
Halloween day, New Year's, and Christmas.

581
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,800
Baby, we wore our tennis shoes so long

582
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,280
till we wore them out up to the name on the ankle.

583
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,160
When we got ready to lay down,

584
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,200
we didn't take them down.

585
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,560
We didn't take them off.

586
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,700
All we had to do was fold them back, baby.

587
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,180
I remember my father well, you know.

588
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,900
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.

589
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,880
He used to have, you know how tall he did?

590
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,380
He used to put a stocking cap on his head

591
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,980
and put a knot right in front of it.

592
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,440
Daddy would wake up with that thumping headache,

593
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,300
and he said, the kids are saying my head's hurting so bad.

594
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,340
He said, I don't know what Santa's gonna get y'all for Christmas,

595
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,440
but he gonna bring you something.

596
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,180
Daddy took that stocking cap off, and he said,

597
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:01,460
$ outside of vegetable где Ş Certainly would've been for Christmas.

598
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:01,460


599
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:01,940
it said, you know what?

600
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,500
He marked my head with a dough open and went outside and shot up there,

601
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,640
and come back inside and told us the biggest lie I ever heard.

602
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,740
Said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.

603
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,140
OFFICER FOR Terraorro Police Officer

604
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,140


605
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,680
Your rampant memory

606
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,440
He was a school boy.

607
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:22,120
And I'd shot up in the air, and come back inside, and told us the biggest lie I ever heard.

608
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,620
On the second day of Christmas, might you look into me

609
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:31,120
Two hundred reds and a tab of yellow sunshine LSD

610
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,840
On the third day of Christmas, might you look into me

611
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:41,660
Three pounds of grass, two hundred reds and a tab of yellow sunshine LSD

612
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,300
On the fourth day of Christmas, might you look into me

613
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:53,560
Four grams of hash, three pounds of grass, two hundred reds and a tab of yellow sunshine LSD

614
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,260
On the fifth day of Christmas, might you look into me

615
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,140
Five valiums

616
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:09,280
Four grams of hash, three pounds of grass, two hundred reds and a tab of yellow sunshine LSD

617
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,040
On the sixth day of Christmas, might you look into me

618
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,440
Six joints of smoke and five valiums

619
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:26,600
Four grams of hash, three pounds of grass, two hundred reds and a tab of yellow sunshine LSD

620
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,360
On the seventh day of Christmas, might you look into me

621
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:40,820
Well, yes, Ivan, thanks for coming out to Dobstown here, and I wanted to show you the St. Jesus Nursery.

622
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,660
Oh, look at these little scamps.

623
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:43,940
And...

624
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,960
To think these used to be slackless children.

625
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,260
What did you kids say?

626
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,700
Great mom!

627
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,300
Oh, yes.

628
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,420
That's so darling.

629
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,060
Does that warm my Bobland or what?

630
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,620
Yeah, hey, would you like to use one of these kids?

631
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,140
Yeah, yeah.

632
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,160
Warm it up a little more?

633
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,880
They're available.

634
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,180
Yeah.

635
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,340
A discount for...

636
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:10,840
Our subscribers, our church family subscribers can adopt one of these little scamps for a mere, oh, couple thousand on top of your usual annual fee.

637
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,420
That's right.

638
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,160
Put them to work.

639
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,520
Take them home, put them to work.

640
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,580
They've been trained, and they'll do all sorts of tricks.

641
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,660
They've been trained to slack off.

642
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,780
Just try to get work out of some of these little guys.

643
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,540
Ha, ha, ha.

644
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,540
To Bob!

645
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,220
Merry Christmas!

646
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:35,480
On the twelfth day of Christmas, might you look into me

647
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,020
Twelve kids are dripping, eleven magic mushrooms

648
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,860
Ten gaudy buttons, nine cups of dropping

649
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,340
Eight spoons of smirking

650
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,600
Seven whites are buzzing

651
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,180
Six joints are smirking

652
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,380
Five, a million

653
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,060
Four grams of ash

654
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,480
Three pounds of grass

655
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,860
Two hundred rips

656
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,520
And a job of yours

657
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,960
One, two, three, four

658
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,620
I think that's from the church of the 67 Chevy, friends.

659
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,240
That's disgraceful, I think.

660
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,520
I really do.

661
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,260
I hope that kid wasn't actually.

662
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,420
Merry Christmas!

663
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,440
Merry Christmas!

664
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:11,700
Merry Christmas!

665
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,580
Merry Christmas!

666
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,320
Merry Christmas!

667
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,320


668
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,320


669
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,320


670
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,300
Merry Christmas!

671
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,340
Merry Christmas!

672
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,000
Merry Christmas!

673
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:19,940
Merry Christmas!

674
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,260
Merry Christmas!

675
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:20,300
Merry Christmas!

676
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,240
Merry Christmas!

677
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:21,580
Merry Christmas!

678
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,000
Merry Christmas!

679
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,620
One day, the rabbit woke up and realized he wanted a hamburger.

680
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,400
Boy!

681
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,960
Said the rabbit to himself.

682
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,980
A hamburger would sure hit the spot right now.

683
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:36,420
But, having never had a hamburger, the rabbit was at a loss as to where one could be found.

684
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,240
I know.

685
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:37,980
He said.

686
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,680
I'll ask my old friend, the chestnut tree.

687
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,920
New from Tonka.

688
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,400
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob.

689
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,840
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.

690
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,200
Shut up, kid boy!

691
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,760
No way I'll ever sell out to the conspiracy.

692
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,660
Taste of the Marrakech, talk to aliens.

693
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:02,280
See, by the time you get halfway through editing a show, friends, you can't remember what was at the beginning of it.

694
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,240
Hug and rock and rustling.

695
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:04,960
Will we?

696
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,360
That is a problem.

697
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,920
And of course, if you're editing ten different Christmas shows together, it's even harder to...

698
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,340
You're a moron.

699
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,280
Oh.

700
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,640
I'm a moron.

701
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,840
All you want to do is sit around and praise Bob.

702
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,720
And ask my son, George.

703
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,640
And then, uh, two minutes.

704
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,460
All sorts of serious problems in the Church of the Subgenius.

705
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,580
Many of which include trying to find the right equipment in the radio station.

706
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:35,780
Trying to keep more than one Reverend Island sang off the mic.

707
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,480
With so many confusing issues in hand.

708
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,820
With so many egos at hand.

709
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,620
Including whether or not the, the, the...

710
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:44,900
The Santa did actually die at the hands of the cavalry.

711
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,620
Uh, that day on the Mount of Skulls.

712
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:54,900
Or whether, um, the overmodulation can be helped at some time in the far future.

713
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,440
I'm doing my best.

714
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,540
So, um, friends, this is a song by this guy.

715
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,300
Oh, I see.

716
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,820
So I can control it.

717
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:00,900
Yeah, I told you.

718
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:01,720
Try to show it here.

719
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,960
Hey, what are you doing?

720
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:03,320
Uh...

721
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,020
Here we can now control the hiss.

722
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,600
That means that their minds can likewise be controlled.

723
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,000
By subliminal messages planted in the hiss that goes out with this show.

724
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

725
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,440
Stay there.

726
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:17,820
Stay there.

727
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,660
Please stay there.

728
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,580
I'll be right back.

729
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,860
Remember, your commanding man, not us.

730
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,300
So be firm.

731
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,840
Oh, yes, friends.

732
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,420
What I'm about to play.

733
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,880
There's really two of me here.

734
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,260
This is a Christmas show.

735
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,720
There are two Doug Wellmans in here.

736
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,100
There's three Doug Wellmans in here.

737
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:00,900
By Pete Warner, the editor of famous magazine called Toilet Suck.

738
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,200
I'm sure you've heard of it.

739
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:07,880
Out of New Jersey, Toilet Suck is a fantastic cultural artifact.

740
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,580
And what we're playing right now.

741
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:10,580


742
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,360
Friends is an album by this fellow.

743
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,420
This is classics of genius mixing.

744
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:24,480
The irritating sounds heard on this recording are not intended to be digested as reenactments of actual events.

745
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,680
Often imitated.

746
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,540
Never quite duplicated.

747
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,980
Sounds based on personal activity.

748
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:31,840
Monsoon familiar mechanized calf Jesus.

749
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,480
Oh, we're doctors.

750
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,740
It is copyrighted.

751
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,360
Oh, we're doctors.

752
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,580
The name of this tune is The Manson Fountain.

753
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,540
Family Christmas.

754
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:46,480
Oh, we're doctors for Bob.

755
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,980
We're doctors and anything we play is music.

756
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,300
Oh, we're doctors for Bob.

757
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:59,080
And anything we mix is a cool industrial noise mix.

758
00:47:59,460 --> 00:47:59,720
Oh.

759
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,420
Oh, no.

760
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:06,840
Hello.

761
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,480
Your local multinational corporation has sent me.

762
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,500
To this remote point in Australia to prove a point.

763
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,080
Conservation can be dangerous.

764
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:20,200
In this remote aboriginal village just outside of Sydney, Australia.

765
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:26,280
The natives were told by their government to slow down in their consumption of gasoline and fossil fuels.

766
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:31,320
Unfortunately, the files in the government energy office on this town were lost.

767
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,920
So nobody bothered to tell them when it was okay to go back to normal energy use.

768
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,200
Sadly enough.

769
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,320
This town has become the victim of what we call an energy surplus.

770
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:51,760
And the natives have been forced to convert many of their dishwashers, lawn mowers and refrigerators into these homemade energy hungry miniature racing guards.

771
00:48:52,220 --> 00:49:02,220
Boys and girls in the village between the ages of 14 and 20 must stay behind the wheels of these primitive high speed and dangerous machines for up to 90 hours at a stretch.

772
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:07,620
Just so their village can receive the next fuel shipment from their local multinational distributor.

773
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,380
And we'll keep on shipping at our usual rates.

774
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,880
Just so this little village can meet and surpass its energy quota.

775
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:19,760
And to think, it's all because they kept lights off when it didn't have to be convenient.

776
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:26,420
This holiday season, why not turn on all the lights in your house and keep them on for the rest of the year.

777
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,360
Maybe you'll make the load a little lighter on us here at Multinational.

778
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,720
And a winter reminder citizens.

779
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:37,000
Carbon monoxide, the silent winter killer, lurks everywhere.

780
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,600
So if you have a gas stove, oil burner or open flame, make sure all the doors and windows in the room are tightly sealed.

781
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,800
So that none of that nasty carbon monoxide can sneak in.

782
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,520
Thanks and happy holidays.

783
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,340
This is Mr. Abernathy signing off from your town to you.

784
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,220
But you could not afford to do otherwise.

785
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,300
The Senate still stands.

786
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,720
From me.

787
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,120
You'd do all our darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth...

788
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:12,120


789
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,960
Sir please give me just one more chance sir.

790
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,180
I don't want to go to Hell, sir!

791
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,220
Sire no, no!

792
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,440
For Godängere only is I going to Hell!

793
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,300
He hitting me.

794
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,120
While he was doing somelavaja.

795
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,520
Bret section in his book was the десятieth volume of the one and only The Patriot.

796
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,040
Where there's no bang.

797
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:36,000
It's not Belfast.

798
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,160
For every Bob particle, there is a Negi particle.

799
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:44,260
And for every Santa Claus particle, there's a Bill that comes in the mail.

800
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,720
No, don't fall for it.

801
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,440
For wherever you find Bob, you must also find Negi.

802
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:50,480
It's true.

803
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:55,100
There's a dark side to the cult and to the Santa Bob.

804
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:01,520
You know, friends, because if you better watch out, you better not cry,

805
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,880
you better not avoid...

806
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:06,920
You can't hide from Santa Claus.

807
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,360
You can't hide from Santa Claus.

808
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,080
That's right, friends.

809
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:09,980
You just better not.

810
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,480
Whatever you do, don't do it.

811
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:14,360
You haven't told him about Jingle Farkin Bells yet.

812
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:14,920
No.

813
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,240
Jingle Farkin Bells, Jingle Farkin Bells, Jingle Jingle Any Day.

814
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:25,720
Oh, what gosh darned fun it is to ride in an old Corvair with a top down in the dead of winter.

815
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,080
Oh, that's another lovely Christmas hamper.

816
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,380
Christmas hamper.

817
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,560
Christmas hamper.

818
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:38,380
Friends, try to imagine somewhere in the snowy north,

819
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:44,300
the Santa Bob trudging mindlessly through the Himalayan snows,

820
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,620
driven by strange forces to complete his nameless errand,

821
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:54,260
and he may show up at your house, my friend,

822
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:58,320
if you've been a bad subgenius or a halfway subgenius,

823
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,500
or if we keep getting tangled up in these other shows.

824
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,780
And have strange microphones.

825
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,440
Oh, well, Hell Swami?

826
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,760
I was wondering.

827
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,640
I didn't mean to cut off your...

828
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,700
I hope the Hell Swami's listening.

829
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,940
Hell Swami was on this old show.

830
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:13,440
I didn't mean to interfere with the freedom of religion or anything.

831
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:19,580
Well, I know, Dr. Stang, that you wouldn't have your heart to do something as big a cause as that.

832
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,560
No, I wonder what happens if I push this, though.

833
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:25,720
It's supposed to close the gateway that will keep those other shows out.

834
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:26,800
Oh, do you think?

835
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,040
It was, too.

836
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:28,740
That was...

837
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,040
No, there they are back there.

838
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,120
Yeah, that was Hell Swami.

839
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,100
Satellite Weavers.

840
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:32,600
Huh?

841
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,720
Sky Satellite, if you're listening.

842
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,860
Friends, we're once again attempting to do our Christmas show in one channel only.

843
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,340
I guess if we turn this mic up all the way...

844
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,400
No, don't do that.

845
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:50,880
This, I think, friends, will be the only show where you'll hear Bob and the Dillentones'

846
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,800
lovely version of White Christmas.

847
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,100
Friends, this is Bob and his band, the Dillentones.

848
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,560
I think you should enjoy this.

849
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,920
All пар avocadoas.

850
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:11,200
Everything in two pictures is all White Christmas, eh?

851
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,200


852
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,460
Irish Music hay movimento.

853
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,440
Open Widesoo

854
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:19,120
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

855
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,500
Just like the ones I used to know

856
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,060
Where the tree tops glisten

857
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,140
And children listen

858
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,100
To her daydreams

859
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:31,500
She will stay in my room this Christmas with me at home.

860
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:43,960
the snow. I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with every Christmas card I write. May your days be

861
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:50,560
merry and bright and may all your Christmases be white.

862
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:21,400
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with every Christmas card I write. May your days be merry

863
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:31,480
and bright and may all your Christmases, all your Christmases, all your Christmases be

864
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:31,480


865
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:31,680
white.

866
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:40,580
May all your Christmases, all your Christmases, all your Christmases, all your Christmases

867
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,260
be white.

868
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,580
five two three

869
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:21,160
California oranges Texas cactus we think you need a little more practice

870
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,400
throw them in the graveyard cover up your feet

871
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,780
J.R. Bob Dobbs can't be beat

872
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:40,140
And that's Bob at Post Office Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas 75214.

873
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,080
I'll give that number again.

874
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:52,080
Write for free information from Bob at Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

875
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:58,540
And that Post Office Box has remained unchanged, lo, these ten years

876
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:01,780
since that old Christmas show was recorded.

877
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,680
That was like show number 260-something.

878
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,820
Long time ago.

879
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:13,420
I believe that tonight we're on show number 610, the last Christmas show.

880
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,740
And here's some credits, friends.

881
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:22,440
A whole lot of the non-Subgenius Christmas special music came from something called

882
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:27,120
the Tarkin Records All-Star Holiday Extravaganza,

883
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,520
a totally weird...

884
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:33,300
A weird compilation of holiday hits by the weirdest bands on the weirdest label,

885
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,420
Tarkin Records.

886
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,780
Here's a contact number.

887
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:42,440
1-800-966-3516.

888
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:47,920
We heard God Rest Ye Wary Citizens by Reverend Zaphon, Pope S. Cecilia,

889
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,800
Trickster Shaman, and Reverend 3.0 here in Dallas.

890
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:55,560
Idnax, Stang, and Civet doing various Christmassy things.

891
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,520
Iron Liver doing Santa's Big Rave.

892
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,200
Red Sack.

893
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,340
The instrumental Sleigh Ride was by The Defenders.
