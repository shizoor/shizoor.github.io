1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,180
There is nothing wrong with the subgenius of slack.

2
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:41,040
From PR News in Washington, I'm doping and making one-sided demands of President Trump and betraying the spirit of last month's insider attack in southern Afghanistan.

3
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,440
Trump crashed early on, but he got back up, demanding Korean spy cam pornography.

4
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,540
Korea says its porn beats Sweden, Russia, and Croatia.

5
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,440
The statement also says Pyongyang still has faith in PR.

6
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,400
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says,

7
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,840
Twi-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,380
Yuri found in his bloodstream.

9
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,140
British Prime Minister Theresa May says she now has signs reading,

10
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,620
My porn is PR News in Washington.

11
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,520
P-N-O-N-E-S

12
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,640

P-N-O-N-E-S

P-N-O-N-E-S

24
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,020
Wee!

25
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,320
Wee!

26
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,800
Wee!

27
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,000
Wee!

28
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,140
Wee!

29
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,980
Wee!

30
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,840
Wee!

31
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,680
Wee!

32
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,120
Wee!

33
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,640
Wee!

34
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,280
Wee!

35
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,280


36
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,280


37
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,280


38
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,360
Lady Luck smiled down at me when I went to see my uncle in Saskatchewan.

39
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:26,960
The chips all fell fortuitously when I went to see my uncle in Saskatchewan.

40
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,980
He hired an alien woman to help him.

41
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:29,980


42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,960
She hired an alien woman to work on his farm.

43
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,300
Her name was Pula Pooka.

44
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,120
She had grace and charm.

45
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,860
She penetrated my skull with gallium arcs and eye probes.

46
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:48,960
I arranged my cortex and before very long, I was sent to work as a slave in the back of the barn.

47
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,060
In the barn, on the barn, in Saskatchewan.

48
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,980
She was visiting from the farm.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,860
I was sent for a trip at night.

50
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,680
At night, what I was temporarily able to do was to make my uncle chocolateers.

51
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:16,100
She'd gotten Tupperware made, my uncle a lick of full dalmatian fruit, filled avoir and

52
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,720
scooped and shake up the Marg separately, and spent a whole day making ан是什麼

53
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,100
for her, so that she could speed up the Gesichter and head back for a lunch.

54
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,900
I figured we didn't have any time to muk at this party.

55
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:21,940
заг

56
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,400
Wee!

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,720
Wee!

58
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:24,720


59
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:24,740
Wee!

60
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,800
Team plat Wouldn't you never quit, Lineenger?

61
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:25,980
Twa

62
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,660
Tций wie, T wär to wūs.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,860
Free will?

64
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,040


65
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,660
On the testicles to feed to her own

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,260
And screaming what the odds are when we strip in the mud

67
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,180
In the barn, on the barn in Saskatchewan

68
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,920
The scabs healed up round my forehead last night

69
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,600
After I went to see my uncle in Saskatchewan

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,480
I'm married to Pula Puka and the future looks bright

71
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,020
Cause I went to see my uncle in Saskatchewan

72
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,180
I went to see my uncle in Saskatchewan

73
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,140
She straps me to a gurney and hooks up a hose

74
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,420
It harvests my semen and I know where it goes

75
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,920
Into 80 gallon tanks where it's temporarily froze

76
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,000
We are insinuating into alien holes

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,380
And the blood flows out around a human nose

78
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,800
Stuff them in the freezer before they decompose

79
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,020
Right in the middle of the night

80
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,200
In the barn, on the farm

81
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,280
In the barn, on the farm in Saskatchewan

82
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,760
In the barn, on the farm in Saskatchewan

83
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,960
This stale town is so

84
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,460
Slippery

85
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,780
So often

86
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,980
Don't know if it has cigarettes on you

87
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:49,980


88
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:49,980


89
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:49,980


90
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,020
Live, die in my own town

91
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,700
Él acudió

92
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,820
He is alive

93
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,000
Give me

94
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,240
who's strangely going by a very weird name on email,

95
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,760
Ramos Smooky.

96
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,900
Anyway, it's Reverend Absinthe.

97
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,560
We haven't seen him in a while.

98
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,720
I married him and his wife together at 1X Day.

99
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,580
And he was saying,

100
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,820
can replacement church membership cards be purchased?

101
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,080
How much are they?

102
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm goddamn sick and tired of mother...

103
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,480
Christian...

104
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,740
cuss words getting in my face with their new, new world odor.

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,340
White Christian nationalism has me down.

106
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,580
And I feel that it's time to strike back with further psychological warfare.

107
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,600
I had kind of reached a detente with the religio pinks, but no.

108
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,120
I figured the demise of any pretense of a justice department

109
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,980
is a good news.

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,420
And there's enough reason to put in my request.

111
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,420
I think my skull is about to implode.

112
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,540
For that matter, do you sell accelerate global warming stickers?

113
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,580
The sooner these monkey boy parasites are off this rock,

114
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,100
the better we'll all be.

115
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:19,160
The demise of humanity may well be preferable to listening to the endless whine of Christian snowflakes

116
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,080
and Trump suckling nincompoops.

117
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,420
Rush fucking Limbaugh got the Medal of Freedom.

118
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:26,820
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,840
It's like real life has become an addendum to the dateline for dominance in Book of the Subgenius.

120
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,800
I'd say you can't make this stuff up.

121
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,560
But sci-fi did.

122
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,520
And I'm including the works of Drummond, Stang, etc. in that genre.

123
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,940
Well, it's dogs.

124
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,160
Meanwhile, while I'm busy plotting and scheming the destruction of the normals,

125
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,580
wringing my hands and scowling furiously,

126
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,140
I need something to wave in their faces.

127
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,980
For that matter, I haven't seen my all-present-life.

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,860
I haven't seen my all-purpose-excuse document in about a zillion years either.

129
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,040
It's in an envelope somewhere with the remainder of a bunch of Xerox stickers

130
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:10,400
Reverend Rash and I made in 1991 and distributed liberally around the walls and poles of Northeast Ohio.

131
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,120
I'm assuming that likely my only option is purchasing a new membership

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,940
for any of several possible reasons.

133
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,800
Don't worry, I'll still avoid events.

134
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,140
The world profits or suffers.

135
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,320
More from the infliction of my presence among the normals

136
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,940
than the congregation benefits from my presence at subgenius events.

137
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,500
Actually, I wrote this guy back and said,

138
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,660
Oh, tell me where your dress is. I'll send you a replacement pack.

139
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,060
I didn't have any problem with him.

140
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:50,300
I've never in my life been so thoroughly fed up with the arrogance, ignorance, denial, and stupidity of humanity,

141
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,960
particularly the God-botherers.

142
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,460
I'm so angry I could shit a porcupine.

143
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:04,420
Now, sometimes I literally weep for the probable loss of the future of mankind.

144
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,040
I wish I was kidding.

145
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,240
I do too, but I'm much more sad about the animals and plants.

146
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,020
My capacity for denial fled the day Trump announced he was running.

147
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,040
It was a foregone conclusion that he was just the Trump-shaped guy

148
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,940
to fill the Trump-shaped gap.

149
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,640
I was the Trump-shaped void in the White House,

150
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,480
predicted by science fiction and comics for most of the last century.

151
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,940
The first three months after his election felt like I was walking through gelatin.

152
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,780
I knew the nightmare was real.

153
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,120
Yours united against the man,

154
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:50,720
Reverend Absinthe, would-be proprietor of the bogus Ohio Institute of Neo-Surreal Absurdism

155
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,940
and Neo-Absurd Surrealism.

156
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,520
Have a good week.

157
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,540
P.S.

158
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,160
This is a long P.S.

159
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,300
When are the dummies going to ask why Jesus isn't backeth yet?

160
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,340
I mean, has it even occurred to them that maybe he's being detained or something?

161
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,280
Maybe he needs their help.

162
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,480
Maybe God Jr. got grounded by Daddy over the New Testament.

163
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,560
Maybe Mr. Satan has him in Savior Jail or something.

164
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,880
Or maybe it's a deadbeat dad sort of thing.

165
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,240
Hey, humans, I'm just popping out for a pack of smokes.

166
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,860
I'll be back in ten minutes, I promise.

167
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,300
Signed, God.

168
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,140
For fuck's sake, where is their sense of time?

169
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,960
It's been two thousand years since Jesus was here,

170
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,860
let alone the old man in the sky.

171
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,920
God hassled the old-timey Jews on pretty much a daily basis,

172
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,180
all up in their business like an omnipotent Gladys Kravitz.

173
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,880
And his whole game,

174
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,820
his whole gig was like setting them up to resist doing something he knew perfectly well

175
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,920
at least one of them would be unable to resist doing.

176
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,520
And then punishing all of them as soon as some poor schlemiel

177
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:12,720
up and breaks whatever no-shell fish on Tuesday and stone women for smoking

178
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,420
bullshit that he made up that month.

179
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,540
He couldn't keep out of their business for ten minutes.

180
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,760
It's been two thousand years, you dopes!

181
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,820
Get wise!

182
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,840
God, the original anti-semite.

183
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,420
Man, we need an attorney.

184
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,700
You think Mayor Rudy is up for starting a class action against old Yee Hoover?

185
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,720
He's probably crazy enough.

186
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,580
I gotta say, the only real reason I want that membership card

187
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,160
is so I can use it to harass that kind of Christians at this point.

188
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,720
I mean, for at least fifteen years I've radiated such an effective aura

189
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,940
of recalcitrant non-convertibility that those idiots just don't care.

190
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,860
They just know better as soon as they see me.

191
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,120
I can't remember the last time someone suggested I find Jesus.

192
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,240
Well, maybe you should go look for the fucker.

193
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,940
He isn't my problem other than that his fan club is all up on my dick.

194
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,120
But now it's their turn.

195
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,500
Look out, street preacher.

196
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:19,780
Welcome to Doutsville population, my fully warrantied and unsettlingly acerbic interruption of your megaphones.

197
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,040
Seriously, I offer a warranty.

198
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,680
They can't have their money back.

199
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,880
If they don't beat it.

200
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,580
I can and have made street preachers give up and leave the streets of Athens.

201
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,780
And I will do so again.

202
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,620
I've had it with this Keystone Cops version of religion.

203
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,240
Believe all the crazy shit you want, but when you start controlling my government,

204
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,900
it becomes my business.

205
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,240
PSS.

206
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,420
Are you ever going to finish High Weirdness Volume 2?

207
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,600
No, that's called the Internet.

208
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,400
PSSS.

209
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,460
You know those Who's John Galt stickers?

210
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,700
I want a Who's Harry Seldon sticker.

211
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,980
That's a reference to the Foundation series by Asimov.

212
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,900
If you aren't familiar with it, the gag will make no damn sense, for which I apologize.

213
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,500
Well, I've read the whole Foundation series.

214
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,940
I know. I get it. It's funny.

215
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,780
Enough of this. I sat down to fire off a paragraph and ended up dumping half my religion gags on you.

216
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,960
And Reverend Absinthe, as you may be hearing now,

217
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,660
I took the opportunity to say,

218
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,680
I took full advantage of that.

219
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,000
I thought that was a great rant.

220
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,800
Oh, here's a bit of my answer to him.

221
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,500
I told him it was a great rant.

222
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,200
And I said, maybe when I'm not drunk, I might read it on the air

223
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,800
from my 1991 Radio Shack home studio here.

224
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,160
Oh, Reverend Absinthe, I hear you.

225
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,580
Imagine how it is for me, living right in the bowels of Ameristan,

226
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,640
in a rural Texas town of 2,400 people,

227
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,160
of whom 90% are Republicans, Christians, white, and...

228
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,740
And, well, most of them are real nice folks.

229
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,500
That's what makes this whole thing so weird.

230
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:09,040
But, yes, indeed, it is all too much like the ridiculously right-wing worlds posited

231
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,180
in my old movie, Let's Visit the World of the Future,

232
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,700
and in Dateline for Dominance and everything.

233
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,040
And, uh...

234
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,200
Yeah.

235
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,500
Okay.

236
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
Okay, okay.

237
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,740
Slack. Slack.

238
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,740
And, friends, the music in the background through all of that

239
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:37,600
was from the album Witch Disco by Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

240
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,480
And you can't get that CD anymore.

241
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,880
Um...

242
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,900
Boy, I miss old Chaz.

243
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,180
Uh...

244
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,680
Let's definitely play that together,

245
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:16,680


246
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:16,680


247
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:16,680


248
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:16,680


249
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:16,680


250
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:16,680


251
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:16,700
And the Chaz type strat, let's do that.

252
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:16,700


253
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:16,820


254
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:16,820


255
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:16,820


256
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:16,820


257
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:16,820


258
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,260
Oooh, fold.

259
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,340
So true.

260
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,060
That's ridiculous.

261
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:23,620
Look at that.

262
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
Because this song isongeous.

263
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:53,360
I want an open mic.

264
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,100
I just open a mic and talk.

265
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,760
Whip it out.

266
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,300
I'll press stop.

267
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,780
Sometimes I like to rap to a fleet five to the bar beat,

268
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,100
like music heard in Greece and points east.

269
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,000
Here's Reverend Watt DeFox's

270
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,520
emergency post X-Day sermon rap.

271
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,120
Come on, you don't really think

272
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,840
only a pink boy would do this kind of shit.

273
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,480
Come on, you don't really think

274
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,340
I jixed it when I thought

275
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,400
what if the X-ists yet again fail to show up?

276
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,140
Bob forbid.

277
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,480
Here's what I'm sure I didn't think.

278
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,300
You don't really think you're gonna come too, do you?

279
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,940
If you think you've got another thing coming,

280
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,520
you got another thing coming.

281
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,020
I never have thought

282
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,720
if you think you're coming too

283
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,700
just because that other thing you got's about to come,

284
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,700
I'm sorry, you're not coming too.

285
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,100
And nobody thought,

286
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,960
not until we know we won't be coming too,

287
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,660
do we have a chance of getting off on it,

288
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,620
whatever it turns out to be.

289
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,860
Come on, you don't think I'd really ask

290
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,020
if you got another thing coming, do you?

291
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,700
No one ever thinks,

292
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,120
reality on line one and on two, too.

293
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,980
Now nobody's thinking,

294
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,940
to-to-to,

295
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,920
I know what else you're not thinking,

296
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,480
going so soon I wouldn't hear of it,

297
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,640
why my little party's just beginning.

298
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,900
Da-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da.

299
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,460
And another thing no one here is thinking is,

300
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,480
what is reality?

301
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,560
I know because I was always a record breaker,

302
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,540
I broke a lot of my parents' records,

303
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,100
and then I came highly record-mended to school.

304
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,980
I sat in the class and I skipped.

305
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,160
I sat and skipped at my desk and skipped again.

306
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,720
I broke all the school's records

307
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,260
for all the school that I skipped.

308
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,000
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

309
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,980
First the Beatles saved me,

310
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,640
then it was Black Sabbath,

311
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,340
and then, of course, it was Jesus,

312
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,520
then I did time in the university

313
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,760
hearing drones until Marshall McLuhan came

314
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,560
and I didn't have to read anymore.

315
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,440
But you would never ask,

316
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,580
what is reality?

317
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,920
Who the fuck cares?

318
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,340
The real Doctors for Bob, that's who.

319
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,460
According to the records in my head,

320
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,200
they're singing,

321
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,180
Doctors for Bob, you're wanted,

322
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,920
alive or kill me, or come on.

323
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,720
They have ways of making you, Bob.

324
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,180
If anybody here is thinking,

325
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,520
Doctors for Bob,

326
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,320
you're still wanted, it's worth repeated.

327
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,720
They have ways to make you, Bob.

328
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,620
Come on.

329
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,580
I have so many, I have so many records.

330
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,480
I broke, I sit and I skip.

331
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,580
Broken, I skip over my records.

332
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,360
Like, paging Doctors for,

333
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,100
skip paging Doctors for Bob?

334
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,960
You don't really think they'll come?

335
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,560
That's asking, who's on first?

336
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,260
I don't know.

337
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,560
No, he's on third.

338
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,060
Then who is on first?

339
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,480
Yes.

340
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,100
Ah, all I know is,

341
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,640
it is not me, and it isn't you.

342
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,660
Prove me wrong.

343
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,340
Fuck me.

344
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:50,960
Please.

345
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,640
I'm kidding.

346
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,860
But I have found the most reliably,

347
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,220
effective, contraceptive is my personality.

348
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,380
You're welcome and thank you, or kill me.

349
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,480
So that was the end.

350
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,860
And then if you will remember,

351
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,760
then don't,

352
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,480
so that was the end.

353
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,720
And then if you will remember,

354
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,020
then don't forget anybody.

355
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,080
Anybody?

356
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,180
Anybody can be a radio.

357
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,240
So tune in to W.O.V.E.

358
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,220
Nobody thinks that we have waves to make you come

359
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,440
on Radio WUV.

360
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,000
We wuv it as wavy as we can wet.

361
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,540
Oh yes we do, don't we?

362
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,040
We all wuv, wubbin' a wiggle potion,

363
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,080
a motion lotion.

364
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,420
Oh yes we all do.

365
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,520
Come on, you don't really think I'm about to come all over queer like?

366
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,780
I'll spare you if you've got a rod that that would spoil.

367
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,440
But, but, but, but, and, uh,

368
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,580
or if your squid would dry and tighten at the sight.

369
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,120
A-dutton, da-dutton, dutton.

370
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,760
You see how hard I'm trying to make slack?

371
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,440
Of course it can't be made,

372
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,660
and trying hard is bullshit, of course.

373
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,720
I bet all I've done spittin' this is reveal my pink boy.

374
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,180
Yeah.

375
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,420
You'll be stepping on me to climb aboard the Exist ship on July 5th next year, or sometime.

376
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,520
Soon anyway.

377
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,720
Remain calm.

378
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,620
Take comfort in knowing I will be trampled alive

379
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,380
as you're running up the ramps to board the Exist flying saucers,

380
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,400
just like it was all a dream of that Who concert in Cleveland or something.

381
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,100
Nothing.

382
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm Reverend What the Fock.

383
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,540
Thank you.

384
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,160
It's fun.

385
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,600
Thank you.

386
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,380
It's another ceramic box.

387
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,380


388
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,380


389
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,380


390
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,380


391
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,380


392
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,380


393
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,380


394
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,380


395
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,380


396
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,380


397
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,380


398
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,380


399
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,380


400
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,380


401
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,380


402
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,000
ней.

403
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,620
åh.

404
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,500
I'll see you next time.

405
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,640
I'll see you next time.

406
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,660
I'll see you next time.

407
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:49,060
I'll see you next time.

408
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,160
I'll see you next time.

409
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,500
I'll see you next time.

410
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,480
I'll see you next time.

411
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,100
I'll see you next time.

412
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:19,560
I'll see you next time.

413
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:25,760
I'll see you next time.

414
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,640
I'll see you next time.

415
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,820
I wish you all could see.

416
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,060
I wish you all could see.

417
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,680
I wish you all could hear.

418
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,040
I wish you all could hear.

419
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
Ah, yes.

420
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880
Ah.

421
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,440
Ah, yes.

422
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,780
It's just this little chromium switch

423
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:48,920
switch.

424
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,340
Yes.

425
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,480
You people are so superstitious.

426
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,780
Full consciousness now.

427
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,440
Existence.

428
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,360
All right.

429
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,500
It's Hour of Slack, number 1,799.

430
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,440
And it's X Day, July 5th.

431
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,240
Caffeinas.

432
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,460
Obviously not 1998.

433
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,020
And that wonderful collage was by Suzy the Flusy.

434
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,380
And there's a whole lot more of that.

435
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,020
Her insanely graceful and complicated edits,

436
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:26,860
which are the envy of all radio sample assemblers.

437
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,120
But this church is very lucky to have

438
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:39,020
the most adept audio collagist in the known universe.

439
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:39,980
Genius.

440
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,380
A capacity for taking infinite pains.

441
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,780
Working for it.

442
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,980
Working on those little tapes

443
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,360
with which she was a student.

444
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:46,880
And razor blades.

445
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,480
Oh wait, they don't do it that way anymore, do they?

446
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,740
Actually, she does.

447
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,280
She does it with the pause button.

448
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,400
Wow.

449
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,540
And computers.

450
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,980
Just hit it with your pause

451
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,100
and the computer does everything else.

452
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:00,580
Yeah.

453
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,260
So it's good that automation

454
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,140
has kept up with this aspect of home industry.

455
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,800
Even here in the latter hind end times.

456
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,020
Here, I'll turn the mic down

457
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,000
and you just have to lean right into it,

458
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,260
Reverend Angry Larry.

459
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,160
Let's try this.

460
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,540
Okay.

461
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,780
Put your nose to the grindstone,

462
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,060
your shoulder to the wheel.

463
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,280
There you go.

464
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,320
And your lips right next to the mic.

465
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,840
You know, talk into it so that we can...

466
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,280
Talk into it so we can understand what you're saying.

467
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:32,880
Yeah, yeah.

468
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,400
So we get a sound test.

469
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,220
I got you.

470
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:35,520
Yeah.

471
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,580
Check, test, test.

472
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,360
Over the microphone.

473
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,740
Don't eat the brown ass.

474
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,580
Check, check, test.

475
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,420
Check off.

476
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,280
Technical.

477
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,400
Every show out here starts this way.

478
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,900
Well, you have to make sure.

479
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,000
It's a show.

480
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,260
It's a struggle.

481
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,900
It's a struggle.

482
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,580
That it's getting through.

483
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,140
It is a struggle.

484
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,060
You have to make sure that you're audible first and above all.

485
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,680
Well, I'm...

486
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,600
So we're planning to have the beer tasting party soon.

487
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,180
Yeah.

488
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,860
Oh, yes.

489
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,500
There'll be...

490
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,360
Well, I started...

491
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,360
Lurching and colliding with the furniture.

492
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:07,600
So the schedule today is this and then is there an Ask Dr. Howell?

493
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,460
Here, let's see.

494
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,040
Let's see that.

495
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,300
It says there is a Bull Dada auction and an Ask Dr. Howell on this day.

496
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,200
There is?

497
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,700
So it says in the...

498
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,600
No, actually this day where it was supposed to be, we were going to be on the flying saucers

499
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,340
destroying the god damn human vermin.

500
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,200
Well, just check the column there on the left.

501
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,160
I saw a print...

502
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,860
Oh, or I forgot about the or part.

503
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,760
Or everybody goes back to bed for a while.

504
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,200
Check.

505
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,600
Five hours in my case.

506
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:35,860
Check.

507
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,680
Followed by hours of cursing...

508
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,180
Check.

509
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,980
Moaning and excuses in the cafe...

510
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,560
Check.

511
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,760
Or various camps and Ask Dr. Howell...

512
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,260
That's me.

513
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,920
Bull Dada auction and rant slash jams.

514
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:57,540
Okay, well, I'm thinking that the rant slash jams will be beer tasting.

515
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,000
Fuel.

516
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,440
Beer tasting, yeah.

517
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,680
You can begin the Bull Dada auction or just put it off to another day if you want.

518
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,700
You have the power.

519
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,840
We don't have much stuff.

520
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,660
We really don't.

521
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh, I thought we had a robot.

522
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,780
Well, we do have a robot.

523
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,240
A robot.

524
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,100
And we have a dick.

525
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,860
Uh-huh.

526
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,720
And we have...

527
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,600
Okay.

528
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,020
Uh-huh.

529
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,740
Yeah.

530
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,680
And some other things.

531
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,700
And what happened to that hideous robot alien baby machine that Legume made?

532
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,940
What's your diagnosis, Doc?

533
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,320
Did Philo leave it in his barn?

534
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:33,840
This is like a disco robot called Strobot that, when in good health, emits a stroblite

535
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,920
dangerous to epileptics and others who are unusually susceptible.

536
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,900
But I think it has no working batteries in it.

537
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,620
We'll have to figure something out.

538
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:41,700
What's your diagnosis, Doc?

539
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:41,740
I don't think we've gotten any results.

540
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:41,740


541
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:41,740


542
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:41,740


543
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:41,740


544
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:41,760
So, uh, it's a robot.

545
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:41,760


546
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:41,760


547
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:41,760


548
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:41,760


549
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:41,760


550
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:41,800
I don't think we've got any information on them now.

551
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,500
I have no idea where that came from.

552
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,420
I'm assuming it was something that didn't sell at the last X Day Drill.

553
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,480
They call him Strobot.

554
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,220
Or someone brought it.

555
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,480
Look at the button on the instep of his left foot.

556
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,220
That controls something.

557
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,220


558
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,140
There's a button on that.

559
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,180
Red button there.

560
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,520
About a foot and a half foot tall toy robot.

561
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,460
It's not a familiar design to me.

562
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,120
No, it's not.

563
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:10,420
It says it's a laser strobot, which means it probably blinks.

564
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,300
The head suggests another head wearing headphones.

565
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,940
You see, it's like a DJ, a disco DJ strobot.

566
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,100
Oh, yeah, that's it.

567
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,040
It's a disco DJ strobot.

568
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,920
And not only that, it says laser strobot.

569
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,660
Laser, that's like quantum.

570
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,600
That means everything futuristic and unexplainable.

571
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:37,040
So power it up, and the mini robo disco should take place.

572
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,580
How many batteries does it require?

573
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:43,860
It takes four AA's, which I have at my camp.

574
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:50,760
Well, we could attempt to revitalize a strobot right here, just to demonstrate.

575
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,540
Are you sure we want to power that thing up?

576
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,680
This actually could have been the vehicle.

577
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:01,900
Bob may have dropped this off for us to experiment with us as a test.

578
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,180
Yes, we never know when the master cometh.

579
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,140
Now, if it starts smoking and catches fire, then we'll know that it was Bob.

580
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,340
Activate it gently.

581
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:20,640
Yeah, remember what happened when they've turned on certain alien artifacts.

582
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,120
He's loading the batteries into the...

583
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,060
The disco robot.

584
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,120
Disco robot, ladies and gentlemen.

585
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:33,200
The thorax is open, and the batteries are going in now.

586
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:43,440
In just a moment, we will test the mechanics of the dusty, apparently not frequently used robot.

587
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,520
My prediction is nothing will happen.

588
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,280
He's got lights.

589
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,320
He's got lights.

590
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:48,620
Oh, good.

591
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,100
Press that red button on his shoe.

592
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,140
That button on his shoe, the little red button.

593
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,280
Oh, friends.

594
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:55,900
This is strobing.

595
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,440
It's so exciting.

596
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,740
If only the radio audience could, or anyone could see the amazing...

597
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,100
Nothing.

598
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,400
It does nothing when you press the button on his shoe.

599
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,000
He's still not doing anything.

600
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,940
There's no strobing, no disco music.

601
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,740
Yep, that's the X-Day robot.

602
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,440
That's our mascot for this X-Day.

603
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,740
A faint light feebly glimmers out as a reward for the installation of all the batteries.

604
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,100
Oh, yeah, he's...

605
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,940
Just a couple of blinks on the arm there, and that's about it.

606
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,800
What is it with those three buttons?

607
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,060
They're just buttons on his chest.

608
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:27,920
Do they do anything?

609
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,300
Oh, they don't do anything.

610
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,860
Those are just molded plastic.

611
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,080
Those are just robo-bling.

612
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,800
I shouldn't look into its fist because, you know, there could be some kind of a hidden laser in there.

613
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,460
It says laser on it.

614
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:48,820
Well, that's too bad about strobot, but you've tried the button on his foot numerous times, I'm sure.

615
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:54,900
He has a hole right here in his fist where he's, like, maybe supposed to hold on to...

616
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,820
He can carry it.

617
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,120
...an offer of peace or a sword.

618
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,060
Okay.

619
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:05,240
Yeah, either a sword or an olive branch, depending on which planet he's been sent to.

620
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,460
Yes, and then when he's...

621
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,680
And when you activate him, it blows up the whole planet.

622
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:19,920
As he dazzles him with strobes which destroy their will and ability to act.

623
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,080
Did somebody out here actually bring this?

624
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,400
Who brought strobot?

625
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,660
I found it in my basement.

626
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,900
Oh, that's you.

627
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,800
You found the strobot down there?

628
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,360
I found it in our basement, and the thing is, there was almost nothing else in our basement.

629
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:32,420
I like this story.

630
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,880
We moved everything to Texas.

631
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,700
What the hell was that thing doing there?

632
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,200
That's not very credible.

633
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,900
Now, there's been a whole next day that I missed.

634
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,280
Holy cow, these batteries are really hot, though.

635
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,040
Yeah, there's an interference.

636
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,620
Oh, it is a booby trap.

637
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,700
Attempting to power a strobot can be harmful...

638
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,800
We would have set this thing down.

639
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,500
...to children and other living things.

640
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:51,520
Yep, pillows.

641
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:51,900
Those are hot.

642
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,360
It would have burned down this entire camp.

643
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,800
Maybe the state of the art.

644
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:55,800


645
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:55,800


646
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:55,800


647
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,520
Oh, wow.

648
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,020


649
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,000
Yeah.

650
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,920
Well, that's one thing.

651
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,040
Bad rule, Ben.

652
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,480
Okay.

653
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,000
We've got a deadly, malfunctioning toy here.

654
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:11,280
Which could easily start a fire or a melting battery scenario with splurting battery acid.

655
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,220
Subgenius parents who want to toughen their kids up will love this toy.

656
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,900
So yeah, look for this in the next subgenius catalog.

657
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,180
Yeah, extreme choking hazard.

658
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,320
Extreme choking hazard and will cause flame.

659
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,180
Many parts unsuitable for toddlers.

660
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,360
Beware of electrocation.

661
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,660
It's not a bad looking robot, though.

662
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,340
It's, you know, I've seen many worse.

663
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,120
Poor strobot.

664
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,880
It does symbolize this particular...

665
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,820
Active life.

666
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,040
...ex-day drill.

667
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,920
Drill.

668
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,600
This non-functioning strobot...

669
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,680
Non-functioning...

670
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,040
...is the perfect mascot for yet another...

671
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,500
...another...

672
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:55,780
...another...

673
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:55,780


674
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:55,780


675
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:55,780


676
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:55,780


677
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,700
...letdown.

678
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,180
Thanks, Bob.

679
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,620
Thanks, Obama.

680
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,420
Thanks...

681
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,820
Well, now you're blaming everyone.

682
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,680
You're blaming Susie for the ticket switcheroo and now poor little strobot.

683
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,700
Thanks, Stang.

684
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,880
I've certainly been hearing that again.

685
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,240
I get so tired of it every year.

686
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:18,800
Thanks for sparing us over for another year so we can get our affairs in order and make

687
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,480
sure little Timmy gets into medical school.

688
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,680
Well, this will give me time to get my destruction evidence music.

689
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:25,780
I'm going to get it.

690
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,120
I'm going to get it.

691
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,120


692
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:33,020
Which is in a museum ready in Glen Rose, Texas, a tourist attraction and destination for Americans

693
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,500
looking for quaint, the queer, the curious, the weird, the...

694
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,040
Showing the final ignoble fate of Noah's Ark.

695
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,080
Right.

696
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,160
We've got the wreck of Noah's Ark.

697
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,900
And we have a fossil robot skeleton.

698
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,420
Yes, you heard me.

699
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,660
A fossil robot skeleton dating from the Lower Cretaceous.

700
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,900
we

701
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,540
although it's not found in exactly

702
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,540
the same excavation

703
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,540
site as the alien skeleton

704
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,500
we're guessing that this robot

705
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,220
was owned by the

706
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,440
alien who's fossil skeleton

707
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,320
we also found also dating

708
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,260
from the lower cretaceous

709
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,400
on display at

710
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,360
Stang Ranch

711
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,760
which will be open to the public

712
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,280
as soon as the creation

713
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,960
museum in Kentucky

714
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,740
is flooded

715
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,400
and washed away

716
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,080
the one that looks like Noah's Ark

717
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,180
didn't they have trouble like that

718
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,560
they were nearly washed away

719
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,820
and then they tried to sue somebody

720
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,680
the almighty God

721
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,980
because someone almost

722
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,180
flooded them out of their ark

723
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,900
God can be bribed

724
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,120
there's

725
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,560
there was a

726
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,120
beautiful old

727
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,940
stone church

728
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,200
in Cleveland

729
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,720
right near

730
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,480
the case western

731
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,280
well the big hospital

732
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,120
Cleveland Clinic

733
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,480
giant famous

734
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
world famous huge complex

735
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,720
what denomination of church was it

736
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,820
I think Catholic

737
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,800
and the hospital wanted

738
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,120
that ground

739
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,880
that hallowed ground for a parking lot

740
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,740
for their hospital they really wanted it

741
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,480
was there a gothic building there

742
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,360
the monks said no

743
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,140
this is the Lord's house

744
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:22,920
and they said no we're going to go to the church

745
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,240
it wasn't right

746
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,200
the hospital offered God

747
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,120
some sort of payment

748
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,240
I'm not sure what

749
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,900
may have been just money

750
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,500
and God sent a lightning bolt

751
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,480
that set fire to that church

752
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,540
and burned it down

753
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,040
honestly

754
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,580
and so now there is a parking lot

755
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,060
for the Cleveland Clinic there

756
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,060
much needed parking lot

757
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,340
one less house

758
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,540
a classic beautiful old house of God

759
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,380
but you might call the hospital

760
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,380
a house of God

761
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,900
more people go to meet their guests a lot of times now

762
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:52,900


763
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,060
maker in hospitals than anywhere else.

764
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,040
Yeah, that's true.

765
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,540
Wait a minute. What does that tell you?

766
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,340
It's just a

767
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,020
slaughterhouse in there.

768
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,660
That's true. Somebody's paying

769
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,000
someone.

770
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,580
The infernal hosts are also

771
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,740
present there around the bed

772
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,400
of the dying

773
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,100
according to Jack T. Chick.

774
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,200
Angels and demons are

775
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,880
standing around ministering

776
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,760
to their patients right up

777
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,300
to the end.

778
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,120
Ready to fight over that struggling

779
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,460
soul. Which will it

780
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,380
be? Bob, the devil, or God?

781
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,240
Remember that one Chick

782
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,900
comic where the demons are saying,

783
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,820
that was a close one, but we got him.

784
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,300
Those were my

785
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,460
demons. Yes.

786
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,360
Cartoony but vicious demons.

787
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,940
Thank goodness for evil.

788
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,580
Save me from heaven.

789
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,600
Ha, ha, ha.

790
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,840
That's what we say.

791
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,400
And after all,

792
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:52,320
heaven

793
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,760
might not be.

794
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,120
Are those batteries still warm?

795
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:55,580
Oh, yeah.

796
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,360
We could have been killed.

797
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,940
They could have blown up right here at me.

798
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,560
Right.

799
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,780
Are you sure you put them

800
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,120
right in the robot?

801
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,200
Are you sure you settled them

802
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,360
correctly in the

803
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,020
place where they were supposed to be?

804
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,920
I mean, you didn't put in one

805
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,720
backwards or anything like that.

806
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,000
No.

807
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,360
Oh, but now I do understand why Stang said,

808
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,980
oh, I have batteries here.

809
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,240
Use these.

810
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,320
Didn't you say a sign up there that says,

811
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,840
no sarcasm allowed?

812
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,000
That's not sarcasm.

813
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,960
No sarcasm.

814
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,440
That's attempted murder.

815
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,680
That's not sarcasm.

816
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,960
I always talk this way.

817
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,320
Sarcasm doesn't become you, Reverend Angry Larry.

818
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,260
Crabbiness.

819
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,580
There you go.

820
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,040
Yes, that defines you.

821
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,560
That's completely right there.

822
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,640
Grumpiness.

823
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,060
Yes.

824
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,260
So angry.

825
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,760
So very angry.

826
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,440
Slightly miffed Lawrence.

827
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,380
That's another identity.

828
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,800
Slightly miffed Lawrence.

829
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,920
For different hours, different days,

830
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,420
different occasions.

831
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,980
That's the pink Angry Larry.

832
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,120
Oh, the slightly miffed?

833
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,380
Yeah.

834
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,320
The peevish and irritated.

835
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,780
The peevish and irritated.

836
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,580
The passive aggressive Lawrence.

837
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,360
The barely visibly vexed.

838
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,540
The get off my lawn Lawrence.

839
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,480
The seething with rage,

840
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,080
vein pulsing, red faced,

841
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,320
homicidal neighbor.

842
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,220
Well, there's some new faces here.

843
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,340
Well, there are more bodies.

844
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,060
Some don't exactly have what you would call faces.

845
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,500
More details just arrived.

846
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,200
And more are here at X Day.

847
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,780
And we have a full program for them,

848
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,420
don't we, Reverend Stang?

849
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,460
Legendary Bob, the auction,

850
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,600
the Bulldada auction,

851
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,080
and the Ask Dr. Howell.

852
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,600
Well, normally at the Bulldada auction

853
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,420
we have boxes and boxes of VHS tapes.

854
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:51,900
Everybody.

855
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,760
Everybody loves those.

856
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,440
Paperback books.

857
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,260
Comics.

858
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,560
Comic books.

859
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,820
I don't see any back here.

860
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,740
Generally huge stacks of DVDs and CDs

861
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,140
that I usually end up buying.

862
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:03,820
DVDs and CDs.

863
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,560
So we don't have those?

864
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,960
Is that what you're saying?

865
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,540
Well, we have that dangerous robot.

866
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,560
And there are some other things.

867
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,020
But no one ever said

868
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,200
Bulldada auction had to be long.

869
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,880
It just said it had to go on.

870
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:21,880


871
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,440
So whatever few items are there,

872
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,260
that will generate excitement.

873
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,940
I'm pretty sure, judging by the clothing

874
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,140
worn by most members of our audience,

875
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,700
that the people we're waiting for

876
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,520
for the auction aren't here yet.

877
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,860
The ones with money.

878
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:38,580
I see.

879
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,080
Yeah.

880
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:43,240
Well, we could certainly postpone the...

881
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,160
Oh, that's small.

882
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,360
Okay, well, good.

883
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,040
There they are, waving their checkbooks.

884
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,840
Waving their money.

885
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,000
They're sitting on their right to purchase

886
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,200
subgenius artifacts at this special time.

887
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,160
We didn't say everyone.

888
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,020
Hey, Bob, I'm seeing color.

889
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,700
The only color Bob sees is green.

890
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,200
Color is money.

891
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,380
They may be pink, but their money is green.

892
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:08,000
How often we've heard this simple apothegm.

893
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,780
Yeah, and yet sometimes I forget those aphorisms.

894
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,680
It's been so...

895
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,780
I've been in this church so long,

896
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,680
I sometimes forget the important things.

897
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,020
One gets wrapped up in the little details.

898
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,140
Right, in these doctrinal...

899
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,280
Arguments over imagery of bears and things like that.

900
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,120
And then we forget the basic things,

901
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,100
like too much is always better than not enough.

902
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,060
And fuck them if they can't take a joke.

903
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:37,620
Almost as bad.

904
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,160
Yes, yes.

905
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,640
Yeah, fuck them if they can't take a joke

906
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,760
are the one rule that we live by.

907
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:48,440
And actually, it is the only rule worth living by.

908
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,980
At least I've...

909
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,140
I've tried all the other ones

910
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,900
and ended up in the hospital most times.

911
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,080
Most of Bob's rules.

912
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,500
Eventually we'll put you in the hospital,

913
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,940
but fuck them if they can't take a joke.

914
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,960
The worst thing that'll happen is

915
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,640
you may have to take some special medicine for a while.

916
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,180
Ah, but don't just eat that hamburger.

917
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,700
Eat the hell out of it.

918
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,620
And see, you took that to heart.

919
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,680
No pun intended.

920
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,020
To a heart attack.

921
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:15,720
Yeah, see?

922
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,480
Right straight to the hospital.

923
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,140
Yeah, I took it to the hospital.

924
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:20,540
But...

925
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,040
The point is that when you eat the hell out of a hamburger,

926
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,140
as it says in our written works,

927
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,920
you're providing slack for yourself,

928
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,660
which has a health value

929
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:35,880
apart from any physiological artery clogging

930
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,020
or anything like that that may be going on.

931
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:41,340
Right, slack is more beneficial to health than food.

932
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,840
It's important.

933
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,380
Well, some food is just not health food.

934
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,540
You've got to admit.

935
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,060
Either everything is anhedonic and tasteless

936
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:50,980
and superficial,

937
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,740
and it's supposed to make you feel virtuous for eating it,

938
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:58,320
or it is full of fats and sugars

939
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,700
and all the chemical craftiness

940
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,160
that our civilization can add to salty bag snacks.

941
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,180
That makes you feel really good.

942
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,800
Yes, it makes you feel you're absorbing those carbohydrates

943
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,520
which internally are being turned into sugars,

944
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,920
creating a huge glycemic spike on the spot.

945
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,600
Yes, my mouth is watering.

946
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,660
Meanwhile, harmful vegetable proteins called lectins

947
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,460
rush to the intestinal wall,

948
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:31,180
which they penetrate since it's only one cellular width through at that point.

949
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,380
The body, thinking itself invaded,

950
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,360
rushes leukocytes to the spot,

951
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,000
and the battle royal of the leaky gut

952
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,160
begins in the mesenteric space outside the intestine.

953
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,220
At least some say.

954
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,100
Well, speaking of food,

955
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:50,740
where's the...

956
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,680
When's the potluck dinner?

957
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,760
Yes, I heard a story of such a feast.

958
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,540
We brought paper plates.

959
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,840
I don't know when the potluck is.

960
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,280
I mean, there's pancakes for Bob, and that's tomorrow.

961
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,360
We brought the pot and the paper plates.

962
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,420
But did you bring the luck?

963
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:07,940
We're out of luck.

964
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,080
Yeah, if you don't have the luck,

965
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,840
then I'm afraid you can only be an interested spectator

966
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,780
in their sumptuous meal.

967
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:17,820
Hmm.

968
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,860
However, that's...

969
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,380
No, when...

970
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:20,720
When...

971
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:20,720


972
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,460
Either here or there.

973
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,300
When would we do that?

974
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,220
And what's the pancake?

975
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,820
The pancake breakfast.

976
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,120
The pancake breakfast is tomorrow.

977
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,200
That hinges on potluck.

978
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:27,340
Pancake.

979
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,540
That's tomorrow.

980
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,720
Big out is tomorrow, not today.

981
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,720
In the morning?

982
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:33,500
Yes.

983
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,020
You can roll these pancakes.

984
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,660
Tomorrow morning is the pancake breakfast.

985
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,200
Yes.

986
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,740
That's when we'll break out the scrapple,

987
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,540
the sacred scrapple, right?

988
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,220
If there is scrapple here.

989
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,180
Hasn't he gone home?

990
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:46,760
Oh, there is.

991
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,920
The pressure's brought up.

992
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,580
Oh, okay, good.

993
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:49,060
All right, okay.

994
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:49,600
All right.

995
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,120
Well...

996
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:50,460
Yeah.

997
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,600
Yeah, tomorrow morning is...

998
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:52,960
After 10.

999
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:53,940
After 10.

1000
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,460
St. Scrapple's Day.

1001
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,020
Is...

1002
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,160
Yes, pancakes for Bob.

1003
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,280
I remember them.

1004
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:05,080
I got up at 6 o'clock this morning.

1005
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,560
That was heroic and noble.

1006
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,940
Princess Louise mimicking a sad violin.

1007
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,520
Uh-huh, 6 o'clock.

1008
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,040
Well, you see, someone thought that 7 o'clock sounded...

1009
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,440
We were going to rise fresh-faced and with our faces...

1010
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,500
I think we were going to rise fresh-faced and with our faces scrubbed to meet our dear friend

1011
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,920
and his armada of alien minions.

1012
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:27,380
Good.

1013
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,560
Let that be a lesson to anyone who wants to form their own religion.

1014
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:35,980
When you pick your day of rupture, don't do it at 7 in the morning.

1015
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,520
Have it be after work, you know, give some time for dinner and run a few errands.

1016
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:41,940
Who knows what time that is to be X-ed?

1017
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:42,520
Exactly.

1018
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,000
Uh...

1019
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,900
That's why you said any day can be X-day.

1020
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,160
When you have a good...

1021
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:50,840
Exactly.

1022
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:56,000
I got a message from Rocknar, Governor Rocknar.

1023
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:56,320
When?

1024
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:56,640
This morning.

1025
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,540
Is he heading this way?

1026
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,700
Oh my God, we were just talking about him yesterday.

1027
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,200
What's he have to say?

1028
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:06,880
He said, every day is X-day when you live in Colorado.

1029
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,920
Okay, is that where he's at now?

1030
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:15,520
Implying that if you have legal marijuana, then every day is X-day.

1031
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,840
The Mile High City.

1032
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:20,020
As if everything's centered around some cheap conspiracy.

1033
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:20,140
Yeah.

1034
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:20,140


1035
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,280
A conspiracy street drug.

1036
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,060
Wow.

1037
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,940
Some form of ketamine.

1038
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,780
Whereas actually, you know, every day is X-day if you have enough froth.

1039
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,000
Why, yes.

1040
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,360
That's different.

1041
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,460
I'm glad you reminded me of that.

1042
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:39,260
Yeah, speaking of which, I need my allergy treatment.

1043
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,260
Well, while you're taking care of that...

1044
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,240
I can tell.

1045
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,060
We can go over tonight's schedule once again.

1046
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,960
Princess, did you bring that inhaler?

1047
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,120
Oh, no, I've got it.

1048
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:50,120


1049
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:50,120


1050
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:50,120


1051
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,380
I've got my inhaler.

1052
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,540
This will work.

1053
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,800
Oh, Hal's got one too.

1054
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:56,980
Allergies.

1055
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,100
I need more allergies.

1056
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,320
Quick, I need to hit a...

1057
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:00,840
There's a script.

1058
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,120
Ah, here is the poem that was...

1059
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,820
And it's for the...

1060
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,180
This is for the butt hurt bears.

1061
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:09,840
Right.

1062
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,580
Actually, the princess...

1063
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:16,960
When we offer them at the auction, the bull dada auction.

1064
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,560
Princess, we recited that.

1065
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,100
Oh, I see.

1066
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,100


1067
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,100


1068
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,100


1069
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,100


1070
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,100


1071
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,100


1072
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,100


1073
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,100


1074
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,100


1075
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,100


1076
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,100


1077
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,100


1078
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,280
I see the instructions there.

1079
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,140
You also recited them.

1080
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:23,440
Yeah.

1081
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:23,880
Oh.

1082
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,240
And now there's a request that I recite them.

1083
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,240
But that has to be during the...

1084
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,760
Well, here, you hand me the inhaler and you can go and recite it.

1085
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,680
During the bull dada auction, this is not...

1086
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,880
Now is not the time to do it.

1087
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:44,380
When one is hawking the butt hurt bears, then one reads this copy.

1088
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,360
It's pollen.

1089
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,020
You can't get up.

1090
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:50,100
It's pollen.

1091
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,100


1092
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,100


1093
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,100


1094
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,520
I better leave that allergy alone.

1095
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,220
Never had allergies before.

1096
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:59,140
You have liquid refreshment there at your stand.

1097
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:05,680
I've been a hermit in a cedar forest, honestly, for the last year.

1098
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,120
In a cedar chest.

1099
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,840
Cedar and juniper forest, hiding out deep in the woods.

1100
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,080
I'm not exaggerating or kidding.

1101
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:19,400
It affected me in a way that never happened when I was only there every...

1102
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,100
Every year.

1103
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:20,500
Every year.

1104
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:20,500


1105
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,220
I spent there the whole summer.

1106
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,640
Cedarized your lungs.

1107
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,320
Yeah.

1108
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,760
The pollen got in.

1109
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:33,020
The cactus mites got in.

1110
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,000
Dreadful.

1111
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:34,840
Simply dreadful.

1112
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:41,640
The deadly bubonic mice bugs got in.

1113
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,840
Everything got in.

1114
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:43,560
Those...

1115
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,420
A rattlesnake started to come in the kitchen door one day.

1116
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,100
When Princess We opened the door, the snake was there.

1117
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,100


1118
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,100


1119
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,100


1120
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,100


1121
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,100


1122
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,100


1123
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,100


1124
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,100


1125
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,100


1126
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,100


1127
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,100


1128
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,100


1129
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,100


1130
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,100


1131
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,100


1132
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,980
She slammed the door in the snake's face.

1133
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,560
An old rare rattlesnake.

1134
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,400
He slithered off.

1135
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,400
And then she didn't emerge from the house for another 24 hours.

1136
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,080
Yes.

1137
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,700
Same sort of thing happened to me.

1138
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,080
Looking for a nice cool spot.

1139
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:03,800
With rattlesnake?

1140
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,300
No, it was with a tarantula.

1141
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,300
Oh, tarantula.

1142
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,020
But listen, when you're a kid, you don't...

1143
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:12,980
I used to spend my summers in Athens, Arcadia, Louisiana.

1144
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:19,260
And I remember going out to the kitchen to get a glass of milk and there was a tarantula

1145
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,080
walking across the...

1146
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,080


1147
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,080


1148
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,080


1149
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,080


1150
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,080


1151
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,080


1152
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,080


1153
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,080


1154
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,080


1155
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,080


1156
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,800
They can't hurt you.

1157
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,120
They're friendly.

1158
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:22,460
Oh, I know.

1159
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,320
But when you're a kid, you think about when you're sleeping that you're going to wake

1160
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,600
up and one's going to be on your face.

1161
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:27,600
Yes.

1162
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,380
So, yeah.

1163
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:28,980
Or on your shoulder.

1164
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,720
Everyone wants to be a radioactive one.

1165
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,060
Maybe you should...

1166
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,180
That's what I'm getting at.

1167
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,560
Maybe you should have let it bite you.

1168
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,140
Maybe it did.

1169
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,400
That's the reason why I'm from another planet.

1170
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:39,940
It's a mild sting.

1171
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:43,240
Or I get abducted every once in a while from, you know...

1172
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,280
The fangs do penetrate.

1173
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:48,040
There is an injection of venom.

1174
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,140
Oh, okay.

1175
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:50,760
They...

1176
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:58,320
The aliens programmed me to only dream about being abducted.

1177
00:52:59,100 --> 00:52:59,980
How often?

1178
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,180
So that way they didn't have to actually abduct me.

1179
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,100
How frequently?

1180
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,960
They just give me the night hag dreams.

1181
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,480
Always?

1182
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,880
Now they're night greys.

1183
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:08,640
Every night?

1184
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:09,500
No.

1185
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,560
Only...

1186
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:10,660
Some nights?

1187
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,620
You only have to go through that once.

1188
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,780
Selected nights.

1189
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,620
I'm still rubbing my fundament from that old probe.

1190
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,520
That dream probe.

1191
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,300
Ouch.

1192
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:20,780
That was actually a dream.

1193
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,540
It could have been.

1194
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,380
Well, they said so.

1195
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,820
Of course they said so.

1196
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:24,640
They programmed me to believe it was just a dream.

1197
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:24,640


1198
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,000
It's just a dream.

1199
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,940
Whitley-Striper thing.

1200
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:26,360
Yeah.

1201
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,820
What we did to you, it didn't really happen.

1202
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:29,820
It's just a dream.

1203
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,240
Yeah.

1204
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,840
Aliens programmed me not to be able to see flying saucers when everybody else can.

1205
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,240
And Bigfoot.

1206
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:38,720
That's true.

1207
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:45,500
Well, I mean, everybody else said they saw the flying saucer and I didn't see anything.

1208
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,540
That fateful night.

1209
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:51,540
In windswept South Dakota.

1210
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,240
Saucer hell.

1211
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,340
And that was a saucer sighting, eh?

1212
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,020
Yep.

1213
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:05,060
I actually spent that night on horseback with an Indian named Lorenzo Black Lance looking

1214
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,460
for a flying saucer.

1215
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:12,220
At the age of 22, yes, that happened to me.

1216
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:17,340
I rode around the prairie with an Indian looking for a flying saucer.

1217
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,500
And I remember thinking...

1218
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:24,280
I'm writing to myself, I'm riding around the prairie with an Indian, Native American,

1219
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:31,500
Lakota specifically, looking for a flying saucer just like Richard Dreyfuss in Close

1220
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:32,660
Encounters.

1221
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,820
I hadn't seen it, but Lorenzo had.

1222
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,960
And he was like Richard Dreyfuss.

1223
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:38,900
He couldn't let it go.

1224
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,000
He had to see it again.

1225
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,180
But of course it didn't come back.

1226
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:43,920
They never do.

1227
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,240
And for many years, when you wanted to.

1228
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,480
As we learned this morning.

1229
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:48,480


1230
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,440
They'll always do it.

1231
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,060
That's when they play hard to get.

1232
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:55,840
Teasing.

1233
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,680
Who?

1234
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:56,980
Who?

1235
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:58,280
The aliens.

1236
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:58,640
The aliens.

1237
00:54:59,080 --> 00:54:59,280
Oh, yeah.

1238
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,220
Whichever alien.

1239
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,460
All of them, basically.

1240
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,280
The X's are the only ones we care about.

1241
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,900
These were probably no count greys and crap.

1242
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,120
You know, just all the...

1243
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,660
Who cares about that?

1244
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,780
Those are...

1245
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:18,320
They're aliens, but they're the kind that crash their saucers.

1246
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:22,300
They have mechanical objects that they fly around with.

1247
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:22,600
Oh, thank you.

1248
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,060
You ain't nothing but a rabbit.

1249
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,000
You ain't no Fred Ho-Mod.

1250
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,480
You ain't nothing but a...

1251
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,800
Or so says Lemur.

1252
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:41,620
Friends, we're going to close with some music from the 22 X Day Drill from a loose jam that

1253
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,460
I recorded the night of July 4th.

1254
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:46,720
The jam is good, but the recording is...

1255
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,300
Reelistic.

1256
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:54,440
In that Dr. Philodrummond and yours truly were standing a bit too close to the mic and

1257
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,340
blabbering at each other almost as loud as the band.

1258
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,420
So it sounds just like you're really there at the campground.

1259
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:08,420
I have no photos, but what's left of my memory insists that it's Reverend Angry Larry playing

1260
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:11,480
both bass and drums simultaneously.

1261
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,020
He really does that.

1262
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:18,180
And the strange Reverend X on guitar.

1263
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:23,340
With a kind of Zoot Horn Rollo or Winged Eel Fingerling style.

1264
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,820
Princess Wee Ar Doe is the flautist standing there on one leg like a stork.

1265
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,560
I'm not sure who else might have been involved.

1266
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:37,680
Anyway, this one is entitled Rev-X is a Frop God.

1267
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,820
Open Skull tamper de Roi de Mar.

1268
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,800
I was just looking to find out what was Mr. Rock doing in there earlier

1269
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:57,900
in that shout is how does the talk stop.

1270
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:04,960
Steve coalえ r tutti.

1271
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,260
He himself poop, 알아 da.

1272
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,060
orbitals boot made potty?

1273
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:13,680
Who knows.

1274
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:14,660
There must have been an era or something.

1275
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,660
He just went into town on a bull,, because he thought nothing most especially

1276
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:16,800
of golf, that would be proud of him you know.

1277
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,160
Imagine while he's smoking Pets pee then laughing, but shit locks you when you

1278
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:18,160


1279
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:18,160


1280
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:18,160


1281
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:18,160


1282
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:18,280
Th which the son escape from here.

1283
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,640
Red Max is like a fool!

1284
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,480
He's better than Megamax!

1285
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,000
Red Max is getting drunk now!

1286
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:54,960
You know what?

1287
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,140
You got it, man.

1288
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:58,540
You got it.

1289
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,320
You got it.

1290
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,340
What is that?

1291
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:07,540
You don't get culture like that just anywhere.

1292
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,600
What is it?

1293
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,080
It looks like it needs static.

1294
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,120
It's like it needs static.

1295
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:15,760
Oh, okay.

1296
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,320
It's like it needs static.

1297
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:17,920
Okay.

1298
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:18,240


1299
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:26,460
As I always say, the church lost 5,000 pounds.

1300
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:28,860
Sorry?

1301
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:40,980
So there are at least three levers in your average pair of nail clippers.

1302
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,140
Oh, I see.

1303
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:45,140
Every pair of nail clippers.

1304
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,160
And one wheel.

1305
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,280
Or is it a wheel?

1306
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,620
Is it the thing that allows you to turn the thing around?

1307
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,760
Is that actually a wheel or is that not a wheel?

1308
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,340
What is it?

1309
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,040
It's not a wheel.

1310
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,100
It's a steering wheel.

1311
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,380
It doesn't carry any weight.

1312
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,500
It's just kind of a lever.

1313
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,740
It's like a circle.

1314
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,120
It's like a...

1315
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,620
It's like a lever when you wouldn't...

1316
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:10,720
Uh...

1317
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:11,600
What's that?

1318
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,240
Your wheels.

1319
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,200
Your wheels.

1320
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,960
Your wheels.

1321
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,980
Your wheels.

1322
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,640
Your wheel.

1323
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:18,800
Your wheel.

1324
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:18,880
Your wheel.

1325
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:18,880


1326
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:29,660
You're not turning the thing around.

1327
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:30,240
Uh...

1328
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,160
I'm sorry.

1329
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,560
We don't feel right.

1330
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:37,560
What do you mean?

1331
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,800
You have access to rock time.

1332
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,620
I hold the seven bladed windbreaker.

1333
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,660
The wheels that turn are behind me.

1334
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,560
I think backwards.

1335
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,840
Thank you, Onan, for a nice, dreamy good night.

1337
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:17,980
Praise Bob.
