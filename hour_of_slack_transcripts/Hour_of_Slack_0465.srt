1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:17,400
You are now about to begin a great adventure, the journey out of a mile.

2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,500
Oh boy.

3
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,580
Oh yeah.

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,440
Oh yeah.

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,400
Yeah.

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,000
Everything's gonna be all right this morning.

7
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,960
Have a listen.

8
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:57,080
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,400
Sponsored by the church.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,260
Oh, the subgenius.

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,700
This little radio is a monotropical, highly complex one-way homing device.

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,880
It will be scanning the airwaves, seeking out a complicated set of alternating frequencies coming from...

13
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,980
Showtime, kid.

14
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,660
Kill me, I'm here! Kill me!

15
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,000
Radio contact is practically impossible.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,180
We have scratched records in static, but like wrinkles and memories.

17
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,700
Oh, well, I wasn't really prepared for this. Let's see.

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,600
What...

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,980
Hey, go on, here.

20
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,680
Let's see, is there anything else?

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,860
Oh, the helmet, tell me.

22
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,520
In one huge federation.

23
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,820
We are happy people.

24
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,800
We dance and sing and drink.

25
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,440
We are not monsters anymore.

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,520
No, not anymore.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,180
We like to play with the etch-a-sketch.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,640
Yeah, that's it.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,180
We have a few little wrinkly guys.

30
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,820
Yeah, we did Coyolas and stuff.

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,880
Hey, here we go.

32
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,820
We're counting down.

33
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,880
So, run for it, right?

34
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,620
Yes, I'm not rolling tape.

35
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,160
Oh, no.

36
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:12,600
Who, me?

37
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,800
And on your three.

38
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,180
Two.

39
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,820
Hello, and welcome to radio...

40
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,660
No, that doesn't work, sorry.

41
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:22,740
Is it?

42
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,900
We suggest those wishing to leave their turn to their radio dial, which is not what I was written.

43
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,300
No.

44
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,480
No.

45
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:29,880
No.

46
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


47
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


48
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


49
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


50
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


51
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,320
It says there, but it doesn't work.

53
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:31,960
No, ma'am.

54
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,160
Sorry, friends, we're having a little bit of trouble getting started here.

55
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,020
Well, let me just read this through before I read it.

56
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,800
I think it's a good idea.

57
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,900
Yes, go ahead, Barbara.

58
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,700
We're going to start again.

59
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,800
This comedy ride may contain material that is hatterous.

60
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:47,820
Great.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,660
Yeah, comedy.

62
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,540
This isn't...

63
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,260
It's not supposed to be a comedy show.

64
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,300
This is like a...

65
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,280
I was waiting for you to do something else silly.

66
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:55,940
Sorry.

67
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,540
Okay.

68
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,720
I didn't know if that was a real one or not.

69
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,200
No, it is.

70
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,740
It's not a real one.

71
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,180
No, friends.

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,900
That's not a...

73
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,320
It's not a real one.

74
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,100
That is, in fact, from the radio shorts tape happening somewhere back in there.

75
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,640
And...

76
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:14,320
But I wanted to just get the church off to a proper start here.

77
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,600
Oh, yes.

78
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,160
Well, I just got out of the shower.

79
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,420
My hair's all wet.

80
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,680
I'm probably going to get electrocuted by these headphones.

81
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,640
I bet you wouldn't mind.

82
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:29,980
I need her.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,740
You wouldn't care.

84
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,660
No, no.

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,640
But...

86
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,680
Let's see.

87
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,920
But I've got my incredibly strong cup of coffee here.

88
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,340
And we're ready.

89
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,220
Ready to do a show.

90
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:52,340
Things are getting back to normal here at the Subgenius Foundation headquarters in Dallas.

91
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,480
Yes, we've been answering the three and a half foot stack of mail seen here in the background.

92
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,700
And we've got about half done with it yet.

93
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,460
So far, I've got a huge stack of new tapes has come out of that.

94
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:16,200
And an even huger stack of wonderful written things to share with you, dear listener.

95
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,060
Oh, but are you puzzled, dear friend?

96
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,900
Why not talk to Bob?

97
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,460
About being...

98
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,260
A real subgenius?

99
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,080
Puzzled, you say?

100
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,760
Yes, I am.

101
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,760
There are so many conflicting ideas about religion.

102
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,900
Will you please tell me what it really is to be a genuine subgenius?

103
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,780
Well, my friend, as it says in Bob 1315,

104
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:57,640
I have given you an example that ye should do as I say, not as I do.

105
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,580
But, you say, an example is always better than an explanation.

106
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,320
And you, Bob, were perfect.

107
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,280
But, at the same time, you were divinely idiotic.

108
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,540
What about us ordinary abnormal people?

109
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,880
My friend, as Bob said in Prescriptures 1-8,

110
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:28,460
Hast thou considered my servant Stagg, that there is none like him in the earth, a twisted and uprightly bent man?

111
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,260
One that feareth, Bob, and turns away from boredom?

112
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,540
Oh, yes, you say.

113
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,460
But Stagg lived way back in ancient days when conditions were different.

114
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,700
What about, what about these modern times?

115
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,840
Well, my friend, I can answer you that from Galoshes 1-27-28.

116
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:58,440
A servant of Dobbs saluteth you, always laboring fervently for you in sex-return.

117
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,620
That ye may stand perfect and eager to buy in all the will of Dobbs.

118
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,820
Slack in ye the hope of glory, whom we preach, warning every subgenius and teaching every subgenius in all idiocy,

119
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,260
that we may present every man perfect in slack Dobbs.

120
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,700
Ah, yes.

121
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,260
And does that mean that you can become a real subgenius?

122
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,860
Well, friend, you just listened to Mark of the Johns 9-23.

123
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,200
If thou canst believe,

124
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,100
and have thirty dollars to spare,

125
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:37,000
then all things are possible to him that believeth and spendeth.

126
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,800
Ah, yes.

127
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,180
And you know, it's so beautiful to be back here with you on the radio.

128
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,300
I'd like to share with you this lovely piece of music we just got in.

129
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,540
This is just the most heartwarming piece,

130
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,460
and it makes me think of the Kennedy mask that I bought today while I was out at the supermarket.

131
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,920
This is a little piece by a band from Richmond, Virginia, called The Trouble with Larry.

132
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,820
And I think it's gonna bless your heart.

133
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,180
I think it's gonna bless your heart.

134
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,420
I think it's gonna bless your heart.

135
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,480
I think it's gonna bless your heart.

136
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,820
I want a 62-link gun

137
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,340
With a drop-top painted black

138
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,180
And a .458

139
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,180


140
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,560
I don't need no redneck Cadillac

141
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,640
Driving to Dallas

142
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,940
At the school book building

143
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,640
Way back on sixth floor

144
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,220
Through the daily buzzer and off into history

145
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,820
Kennedy Death Card

146
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,200
Kennedy Death Card

147
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,960
Kennedy Death Card

148
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,060
Kennedy Death Card

149
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,400
I'll be riding at the back

150
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,780
With my Jackie by my side

151
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,840
I won't care if I die

152
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,480
I'll be wearing a smile

153
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,260
Mile after mile

154
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,200
I'll be riding high

155
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,180
in the day

156
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,900
my Kennedy Death Car.

157
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,000
Kennedy Death Car.

158
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,340
Kennedy Death Car.

159
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,220
Kennedy Death Car.

160
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:20,040
And I'll stop and take some time with Jack Rudy's rabbi and watch Marina smile.

161
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,500
Spies of curtain rush.

162
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,280
Make it in 63.

163
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,120
On the cusp of history.

164
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,080
In my Kennedy Death Car.

165
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,420
Kennedy Death Car.

166
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,520
Kennedy Death Car.

167
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,440
Kennedy Death Car.

168
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,800
You know.

169
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,780
Time goes slowly.

170
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,220
Sometimes it freezes.

171
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,600
Into one deadly frame.

172
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,360
Through blood and agony we reach immortality.

173
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,600
162 acres.

174
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,320
With a drop top painted black.

175
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,520
And a 454.

176
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,400
With hardly felt trees.

177
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,400


178
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,800
I don't need no Rhythmic Cadillac.

179
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,820
Kennedy Death Car.

180
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,900
Kennedy Death Car.

181
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,040
Kennedy Death Car.

182
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,120
Kennedy Death Car.

183
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,080
Kennedy Death Car.

184
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,040
Here boy.

185
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,940
Womits Bib almost killed.

186
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,600
And he plenty here.

187
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,020
Has yummy speed.

188
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,020


189
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,020


190
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,800
I thought it must be a dream.

191
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,760
I saw a sun in the sky.

192
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,360
Hi.

193
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,220
Your light?

194
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,180
Your majesty.

195
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:12,400
Yes?

196
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,760
I have a new estate.

197
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,500
Majesty, the law clearly states that sorcerers are to be put to death.

198
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:18,500


199
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,860
I'm going to rule.

200
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,020
No, not even seven kills, I know.

201
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,000
Surely some managed to escape.

202
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,720
Find one.

203
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,940
One there again.

204
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,820
I don't know who to fight.

205
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,180
This is puzzling evidence, show.

206
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,160
I'm not sure.

207
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,620
No, this is reverent staying, show.

208
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,980
I'm just using puzzling evidence as tapes.

209
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,700
And where does it all go?

210
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,580
Well, it goes sometimes over to the east coast in a direct hiccup.

211
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,220
Wait, what's going on?

212
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,380
Yeah.

213
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,720
W-R-E-K.

214
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,800
There'll be a show crash and we'll just see if this works.

215
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,740
No, not another show crash.

216
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,740
It should be plugged in.

217
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,060
What again?

218
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,400
Looks like we've got the...

219
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,700
I hate it when they mix all the shows together.

220
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,320
There we go.

221
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,220
Show antenna plugged in.

222
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
No, let's not do this.

223
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,820
Let's split these trash bags over the microphones.

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,140
We do get kind of juicy when we start playing.

225
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,480
We are visiting the program of Suzy the Cluesy on W-R-E-K.

226
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,240
Atlanta 91.1.

227
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,240
And hold on, Jane, we're going to start just a minute.

228
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,080
When do we start ranting and clapping?

229
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,660
Yeah, in a minute.

230
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,060
In a minute.

231
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,440
When they see this light over here go on, then we'll rant.

232
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,840
Wait, I'm going to stop the tape and start over.

233
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:36,880
And in attendance at the show is Papa Joe Mama, Jane or Hypercleet, Ivan Stang.

234
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,380
The subgenius hour.

235
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,880
There they go.

236
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,260
I think they're...

237
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:40,860
Nope.

238
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,160
They can't see us and they can't hear us.

239
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,040
Our mics will be open at times they do not know that the mics are open.

240
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,640
Let's start over.

241
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,320
Let's start over.

242
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,460
Let's start over.

243
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:48,460


244
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,580
And right now, they apparently don't know that we're listening.

245
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,020
Yeah, we're not listening to them.

246
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,740
Notice how Wellman cuts when they're about to say,

247
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,900
The subgenius hour of slack.

248
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,140
But, dear friends, let's have a check out this radio shorts tape.

249
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,480
Eh?

250
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,800
And we'll see what happens.

251
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,740
Tonya thought it would make Nancy look bad.

252
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,940
Every reporter wants to do this.

253
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,200
Right.

254
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,320
Had you heard that story?

255
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,120
Nancy, they did it.

256
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,900
No, that's not true.

257
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,260
Denial is strong.

258
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,540
Getting nowhere fast.

259
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,200
There have been many disgusting statements.

260
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,560
The whole world will believe it's a lie.

261
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:26,840
Why?

262
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,000
Why?

263
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,680
Hopefully, everything's gonna work out.

264
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,920
God will take over and he'll make everything right.

265
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,540
Michael has paid three-quarters of his little boys $200,000.

266
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,100
Why?

267
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,460
Why?

268
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:40,700
Why?

269
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,000
Michael has paid three-quarters of his little boys $200,000.

270
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,340
These statements about me are totally false.

271
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,220
Meanwhile, the FBI is now examining scraps of paper.

272
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,320
Repugnant.

273
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,800
Malicious.

274
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,460
You always say the first thing.

275
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,660
These statements about me are totally false.

276
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,480
Malicious.

277
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,440
You're repugnant.

278
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,320
Deep spirited.

279
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,540
But I wouldn't read too much into it.

280
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,080
But I wouldn't read too much into it.

281
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,220
The truth is I'm not gonna stand here and listen anymore to this foolishness.

282
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,960
I was waiting for you to do something else silly.

283
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:17,740
Sorry.

284
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,900
Sorry.

285
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,360
Okay.

286
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,620
I didn't know if that was a real one or not.

287
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,440
No, it is, it is.

288
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:20,780
Okay.

289
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,420
Three.

290
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:21,560
Two.

291
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,420
One.

292
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:22,620
Ah!

293
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,560
Intolerance is a beautiful thing.

294
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,700
I was a guitar player and an organ player and I wanted to play rock and roll.

295
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,720
I was a guitar player and an organ player and I wanted to play rock and roll.

296
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,180
Intolerance.

297
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,100
Intolerance.

298
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,500
Intolerance.

299
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,660
Is a beautiful thing.

300
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,480
God is intolerance.

301
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,000
God accepts all things equally.

302
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,880
And that's just not true.

303
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,580
Well.

304
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,040
Well.

305
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,060
I don't know what the devil is into it, Hal.

306
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:09,500
But I can assure you the lyrics of those bands, not the music per se, but the lyrics, the message of those bands, is definitely devilish, hedonistic, abusive of women.

307
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,020
Devilish.

308
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,640
Hedonistic.

309
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,140
Abusive.

310
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,720
Of women.

311
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,880
Hedonistic.

312
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,200
Sincere.

313
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,340
Hedonistic.

314
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:13,380
Abusive.

315
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:13,820
Sinister.

316
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,900
And I would certainly think it's demonic.

317
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,540
Demonic.

318
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:16,700
Demonic.

319
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:16,860
Demonic.

320
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,840
God and the Bible.

321
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,740
God and the Bible.

322
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,540
God and the Bible.

323
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,620
God and the Bible.

324
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,040
God and the Bible.

325
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,480
We believe there's one Savior.

326
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,840
His name is Jesus Christ.

327
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,380
His name is Jesus Christ.

328
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,700
It is not Uncle Sam.

329
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:36,420
Uncle Sam is not the great Savior, the great healer, the great deliverer, the great food producer.

330
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,720
We want a nation that fears and honors God.

331
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:56,820
If we can produce the manpower and the momentum to outlaw child killing, we will then have the momentum and the manpower to outlaw pornography, to take the public education arena out of the hands of a pagan elite and restore it to parents and the community.

332
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:07,420
It's an issue of getting the God-fearing community, the Christian community, out of its views, out of its apathy, and into the cultural arena, cultural battlefields of our day.

333
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
I think this is the first blast of the trumpet.

334
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,860
I think this is the first blast of the trumpet.

335
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,980
We are going to see this country enter into the next millennium in convulsion.

336
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,020
Our cities are going to be ravaged.

337
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,020
What we saw in Los Angeles is just the beginning.

338
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,960
We are going to have more and more severe weather patterns hit us.

339
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,460
We're going to see an economic collapse that is going to produce mayhem for millions of people.

340
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,460
Unless we repent, we've got to slow the ramp.

341
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,100
But once he begins to move in judgment, he won't relent.

342
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:48,180
And I can tell you that God has a hundred hurricanes and a hundred droughts and a hundred floods and a hundred terrorists at his disposal.

343
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:55,100
I believe even that the recent beginning stages of terrorism against our nation are the judgment of God against us.

344
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,360
It's like God saying, okay, look, you want to terrorize babies in the womb?

345
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,580
I'm going to let you taste what terrorism really feels like.

346
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,560
I'm going to let you taste what terrorism really feels like.

347
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,980
This is the horrifying nature of sin and judgment.

348
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,700
When Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed...

349
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,740
When Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed by fire, there were little kids who were destroyed.

350
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,940
But it was the raving homosexuals that brought the judgment down.

351
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,860
What's shocking is not that God would bring judgment on the Mississippi Riverbed.

352
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,900
What's shocking is that he hasn't obliterated the whole country yet.

353
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,820
Let's just hope that we wake up before he chooses to do that.

354
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,160
Isn't the providence of God an amazing thing?

355
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,600
Intolerance is a beautiful thing.

356
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,300
Intolerance?

357
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,140
Intolerance is a beautiful thing.

358
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,220
Intolerance is a beautiful thing.

359
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,220


360
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,220


361
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,220


362
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,220


363
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,940
Yes, dear friends, and we're with Radio Shorts on that score.

364
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,960
Indeed, we are with our Radio Shorts on that hideous, hideous score.

365
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,240
The score of this tape, well, one of the Radio Shorts tapes.

366
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,020
And darn it, it doesn't have an address on it.

367
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,960
And why I would love...

368
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,240
I'm going to give you a bunch of addresses for all the material that we have just been playing.

369
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,200
And I think you're going to have your pencils.

370
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,220
Pencils.

371
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,300
Pencils.

372
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,840
I'm ready for that at that time.

373
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:17,480
But, you know, it is quite serious, dear friends, the way that the kids are getting these days.

374
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,900
In fact, I think I should switch to some more family-oriented music for this.

375
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,180
There, that's more like it.

376
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,660
Now, friends, you know, say your child comes home late every night.

377
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,300
It's developed a curious habit lately of listening to heavy metal rock music.

378
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,460
It no longer pays you any attention.

379
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,680
It seems preoccupying.

380
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,360
It spends more and more of its time away from home.

381
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,040
You suspect that your child is experimenting with drugs.

382
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,800
What can a parent do?

383
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,500
Well, like millions of other American youths, your child has most likely joined a satanic cult.

384
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,560
Though you may be shocked when you realize the truth,

385
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,920
it's important to bear in mind that all teenagers at one time or another join cults.

386
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,920
It's something that most parents don't want to face or deal with, so they try to ignore it.

387
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,680
Discussing devil works.

388
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,720
Repair systems.

389
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,400
You can become crafty at that and

390
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:12,680
it's a realำ

391
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,540
people don't want to spend half the time

392
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:13,540


393
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:22,000
Can you imagine going to high schools in rick depending on what school you think you are?

394
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:39,660
You might even want to experience the last lightest melancholy in your childhood,

395
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:39,660


396
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:45,120
with the family. While you and your spouse have been secretly worshipping

397
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,760
Satan in the privacy of your bedroom, you should have been sharing this intimate

398
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,560
ritual with your kids. Children want and need to be involved in abusive rituals

399
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:02,400
to create bonds between other family members that are strong and lasting. Now

400
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,780
that you know what you need to do, where do you begin? By and large, the main

401
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,340
reason your children should worship the devil is to help them develop

402
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:18,380
multiple personality disorders or MPDs. These are very special traits that most

403
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,480
children need and most likely will not receive in school. The more you tear away

404
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,400
at a child's self-image, the stronger it becomes. A child can only develop healthy

405
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,160
MPDs after experiencing years and years of cult abuse. Remember the first time

406
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,760
your parents abused you during a satanic ritual?

407
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,960
Remember how good it felt?

408
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,420
Well, let's talk about the discussion. Choosing the right time to speak with

409
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,680
your child is very important. Probably the best time for a discussion is when

410
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:57,080
your child urgently needs to use the restroom. Sit it down and tell it that it

411
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,260
can take care of its needs after you've had a little chat. Abruptly slap the

412
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,180
child in the face and tell it that it will not be allowed to leave the house

413
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,040
at night anymore.

414
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,740
If the child puts up a fight,

415
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,120
slap it harder. Do not allow the child to go to the bathroom until it agrees to

416
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,080
your demands. When it returns from the restroom, tell your child that it will be

417
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,400
required to attend satanic cult rituals with the family beginning the next day

418
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:29,220
after supper. Slap the child again and send it to bed. Now you may ask, why

419
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,820
practice rituals? Well friends, torture and pain release energy into the family

420
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,680
circle and increase the spiritual power of the individual.

421
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,220
Rituals must be precisely completed as prescribed to prevent the wrath of Satan

422
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,700
and his demons. The main reason for participation in rituals is to destroy

423
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,980
self-esteem and self-confidence. Therefore, if anyone complains that the

424
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,520
rituals make them feel bad, tell them that this is exactly how they're

425
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:02,460
supposed to feel. Now friends, on this family radio station, I cannot describe

426
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,660
to you all of the different rituals that are in this Parents Guide to Satanic Cult.

427
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,360
I do not know the exact description, but I can tell you that this is the first

428
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,780
ritual of the day. This ritual is called the L.M.N.O.P.

429
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,400
Yes, this L.M.N.O.P. is the author of this, which appeared in Baby Sue Magazine.

430
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:22,380
But I can tell you ritual number three, sacrificing the dog. As you and your

431
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,700
children should already know, any dog that is truly loyal is a dog that must

432
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:33,260
be sacrificed. Begin by petting your furry trusting friend and giving him some

433
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:45,060
to the floor. Do not bind the snout of the dog. The dog must be allowed to sing about its pain.

434
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,660
Each person in the family then takes part in removing the dog's skin, taking care not to

435
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:58,200
burst any main arteries. The dog must remain alive during the skinning. Once the dog has been skinned,

436
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:04,900
20 thick needles are inserted through its muscle tissue. The dog's urgent strained cries are

437
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:11,600
heavenly music to Satan's delicate ears. After it's been tortured for a minimum of 90 minutes,

438
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:16,560
throw the dog on the fire and do some serious chanting. When it stops breathing,

439
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,880
the ritual is over. The family can now begin discussing what kind of dog they want next.

440
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,740
And let's see if there's any other. Oh, well, here I can read to you the end of ritual number five,

441
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,460
known as the like father, like son ritual.

442
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,880
Women can never work.

443
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,220
Oh, no, I can't read this because this might offend women. But then we get into this other part.

444
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:46,900
The vials are then heated over an open fire. As soon as the semen boils, LSD is added to it.

445
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,660
Each family member then ingests a small amount of the mixture. Once everyone is tripping,

446
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,320
the family takes turn branding each other with a hot cattle prod.

447
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,140
Remember, any pain that may be experienced is imaginary. The ritual ends with the family playing

448
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,740
jingle jangle on kazoo.

449
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:12,260
The sixth ritual is relatively simple, friends. After donning black gowns and meditating for a few

450
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,340
moments, the family simply tries to kill one another. In this ritual, anything is game.

451
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,220
Individuals may use knives, sticks, bats, or anything they deem useful to them to adequately

452
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:27,920
injure other family members. The only stipulation during this ritual is that each individual must

453
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,560
yell, Satan is Lord, prior to delivering any cuts or blows.

454
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,900
Thus endeth ritual number six. And friends, if you've performed these rituals correctly,

455
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,320
your child will be permanently affected. The things your child should have learned are,

456
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,840
number one, obedience. Number two, the importance of listening to others.

457
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,580
Number three, respect for parents. Number four, how to play a kazoo. And five,

458
00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:00,320
the difference between right and wrong. So the next time you think about going out for dinner

459
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,620
or to a movie, perform a satanic ritual instead.

460
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,820
Only save your family money, you'll save their souls as well.

461
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:15,700
Well, friends, that was from Baby Sue magazine, the new issue of Baby Sue.

462
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,380
And I will give you the address to write to for information on Baby Sue.

463
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:31,080
That's box 1111. That's easy enough, friends. 1111 Decatur, Georgia.

464
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,400
P.O. box 111141.

465
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:42,300
There. Decatur, Georgia. 30031. That's right. That zip is 30031.

466
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:48,960
And I should also give you an address to write for information for this wonderful devil-worshipping

467
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,340
music by The Trouble with Larry. This CD was sent to us by our good friend, Reverend Vogt.

468
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:04,560
Or Vogt. And the address to write for Trouble with Larry information is Good Kitty,

469
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:17,640
records at 201A North Davis Avenue. That's North Davis Avenue. 201A North Davis Avenue in

470
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:25,880
Richmond, Virginia. Yes, Richmond, Virginia. 23220. That's 23220.

471
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:34,660
Oh, and we also heard some radio shorts from, I believe those there. That's the other brain rot.

472
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:41,380
Brain Rot West in San Francisco. I don't have their address handy, but I will next time.

473
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:51,340
Oh, and some wonderful little piece by Reverend Nathan Vincent. And I'm tempted to put some more

474
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,580
Nathan Vincent on right after this lovely instrumental music that Nenslow sent us.

475
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,460
Oh, yes.

476
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,680
So to you, hanger.

477
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:31,680


478
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:31,680


479
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:31,680


480
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:31,680


481
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:31,980
When the pot goesínhmor.

482
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,220
To stay.

483
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:34,880
How special it is.

484
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,120
I'm sorry.

485
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,060
I'm sorry.

486
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,920
I'm sorry.

487
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,680
I'm sorry.

488
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,180
I'm sorry.

489
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,860
I'm sorry.

490
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,760
I'm sorry.

491
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:07,500
I'm sorry.

492
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,060
I'm sorry.

493
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,840
I'm sorry.

494
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,880
I'm sorry.

495
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,240
I'm sorry.

496
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,980
with another golfer about courtesy on the green.

497
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,620
Under least competent persons, we find Timothy Sprouse, 18,

498
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,980
was arrested in Cedar Rapids, Iowa in May

499
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,240
and charged with vandalism for painting graffiti on cars.

500
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:58,000
Sprouse had not used spray paint, but rather ordinary cans of brush-on paint,

501
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,080
and police were consequently able to follow a trail of paint drippings

502
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,120
from a car to the front door of a house on 2nd Avenue,

503
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,140
down the stairs, and into a storage closet

504
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:12,080
where they found the paint-speckled Sprouse hiding.

505
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,640
It doesn't say whether he was using red paint,

506
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,400
but he was certainly caught red-handed, dear friends.

507
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,660
And speaking of family values,

508
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:29,340
here's a couple who brawled over whether the woman who plays Peg Bundy

509
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,060
on Married with Children is prettier than Christina.

510
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,820
Christina Applegate, who plays the daughter.

511
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,820
First, the wife slashed Mr. Rottie in the groin with a wine bottle as they scuffled,

512
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,700
but she dressed his wounds, and they sat down again

513
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,740
to watch another episode of the show Married with Children.

514
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,100
Moments later, the brawl erupted again,

515
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,960
and Rottie, who suffered a broken arm and shoulder,

516
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,400
stabbed his wife in the chest, back, and legs

517
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,360
before they implored neighbors to call an ambulance.

518
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,740
Now, see, friends, you thought that that show,

519
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,180
uh, uh,

520
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,740
Natural Born Killers was some sort of a fictional, fictional thing.

521
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,020
Okay, uh,

522
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,960
and, oh, oh, here's one, this is one I can follow up with, friends.

523
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,900
In March, elementary school teacher Myra Obazi,

524
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,040
now you've heard this one on the Hour of Slack before,

525
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,360
this was a local Dallas piece of news,

526
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,600
uh, elementary school teacher Myra Obazi of Shreveport, Louisiana,

527
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,820
was brought bleeding from the eyes to Parkland Memorial Hospital,

528
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,420
Dallas, by her two sisters,

529
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:37,660
who eventually were charged with having gouged out Obazi's eyes with their fingers

530
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,620
because they thought she was possessed by the spirit of her father.

531
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,440
Detectives were unable to question Obazi for several hours

532
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,140
because she refused to stop chanting,

533
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,580
Thank you, Jesus.

534
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,500
Well, friends, a few weeks ago,

535
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:55,020
the Dallas papers started carrying stories day after day on the trial.

536
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,220
Um, it seems that, in the first day of the trial,

537
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,000
witnesses said that they,

538
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,400
they saw the two sisters holding Ms. Obazi down

539
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,680
in a front yard of an Oak Cliff home

540
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,160
and pushed garlic into her eyes.

541
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,320
Um, the sisters have told family members, friends, and the police

542
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,040
that they were fleeing a voodoo curse,

543
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,240
but don't remember.

544
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,740
They just can't remember how their sister lost her eyes.

545
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,880
And she has said that she doesn't want her sisters prosecuted.

546
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,120
Um, but they say she was possessed.

547
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,920
Her attorney said,

548
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,500
Myra's will,

549
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,440
was not Myra's will.

550
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,120
In the presence of the defendants and other family members,

551
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,340
she changed dramatically.

552
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,260
All the while, according to witnesses,

553
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,840
the sisters pummeled and prayed

554
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,380
with an apparently willing Ms. Obazi.

555
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,980
Almost every witness,

556
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,400
hotel clerks, police officers, strangers,

557
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,740
reported something odd about Ms. Obazi's eyes.

558
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,200
Her eyes were very red,

559
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,400
said Dorothy Hughes, a Dallas teacher,

560
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,920
who ran into the women during a morning walk through her neighborhood.

561
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,980
I just had not seen eyes like...

562
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,560
like that before.

563
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,360
They were blood red.

564
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,500
Waxahachie police officer Nathan Bickerstaff

565
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,540
spotted the women at their next stop about 5 a.m.

566
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,800
Between praise the Lord's hallelujahs and I love Jesus's,

567
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,920
they advised me that their car was possessed by the devil,

568
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,680
he said.

569
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:27,020
Ms. Obazi told him that her sisters got her free from the devil.

570
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,780
Ligalia Jones watched the police come and go,

571
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,800
drove from across the street.

572
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,840
For most of the next seven hours,

573
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,820
Ms. Jones testified,

574
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,240
the sisters shouted and prayed on her block.

575
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,620
At one point, she said,

576
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,500
they pushed garlic into Ms. Obazi's eyes

577
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,880
while she made, quote,

578
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,960
strange noises.

579
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,020
She was sounding like a man,

580
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,100
Ms. Jones said.

581
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,460
Then the next day,

582
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,380
Myra Obazi herself testified,

583
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,700
and here's a picture of her

584
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,720
with dark sunglasses on.

585
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,440
And she really cried,

586
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:06,840
a lot on the stand. She had trouble testifying. She said, I had an evil spirit in me. It was

587
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:12,180
controlling me. She said she did not want her sisters convicted of assault, and she denied that

588
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:17,760
they had hurt her during the two-day trip that took them from Arcadia, Louisiana to the Parkland

589
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,260
emergency room. Several people in the southwest Oak Cliff neighborhood where the sisters ended up

590
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,960
said they saw the sisters hitting her and rubbing cloves of garlic. Oh, they reported that Ms. Obasi

591
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:35,760
spoke in two women's voices and one man's voice. Like Ms. Obasi, the sisters said they could not

592
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:43,420
remember the crucial few minutes when the eyes were removed. Both said that a local hoodoist

593
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:49,660
named Benny, Benny, along with their father, Chester Crawford, had made them afraid that

594
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:55,760
another sister was involved in a cult that sought their deaths. They said Ms. Obasi was first

595
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,760
possessed by a demon.

596
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,380
She drove towards Dallas. Ms. Obasi leaned over the steering wheel, Mrs. Crawford said,

597
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:10,760
and when she turned around, it wasn't her. Ms. Obasi's eyes bulged weirdly, Ms. Crawford said.

598
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:18,660
Her tongue was long and strangely colored. Quote, mist came out of her mouth. Her teeth

599
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:26,160
was black and scattered. By the way, I'm not doing these sisters' accents as they probably

600
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,880
were spoken.

601
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:35,100
But close enough. The evil spirit said it got her and it was going to get us, too, in a gross man's

602
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:41,620
voice. Earlier Tuesday, a doctor who worked at Parkland had explained that removing someone's

603
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:48,200
eyes would, quote, not be exceedingly difficult, unquote, if the victim were properly restrained.

604
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:53,220
The biggest problem would be cutting the optic nerve. But Ms. Johnson testified that neither

605
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,940
she nor her sister ever had long fingernails, which could have been used. Ms. Johnson said,

606
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:05,000
to sever, yes, friends, sever the optic nerve. And the next day, why, those two sisters were found

607
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:17,580
guilty of gouging out their sisters' eyes. The jury just didn't go for it. But the prosecutor said

608
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:24,440
that, oh no, this was the defense lawyer, said Ms. Obasi's reluctance to press charges was based on

609
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,800
her dependence on her family and her sisters.

610
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:38,060
He said, quote, because of family influences, she's blinded to reality. He told jurors that they would

611
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:43,440
send the wrong message by acquitting the sisters. Oh, this, yeah, this is the prosecutor. Oh, yeah,

612
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,420
come on down to Dallas County and say the devil made me do it, he said, and we'll set you free.

613
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:55,640
The jury apparently agreed, convicting both sisters of aggravated assault. And the judge asked the

614
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,800
jurors, quote,

615
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:07,160
what is the price for a pair of eyes? And finally, the very last story, the next day, the sisters were

616
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:15,500
given, here's the price of a pair of eyes, 10 years probation. Ms. Obasi had asked prosecutors not to

617
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:21,240
pursue the case and testified on her sister's behalf. She said she thanked God for the probationary

618
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,280
sentences, but was unhappy with the guilty verdict. I don't agree with that, she said.

619
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,120
I don't agree with that. She said she thanked God for the guilty verdict. I don't agree with that, she said.

620
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:32,940
Oh, and my sisters are my best friends. They love me, and I love them. I know that they did not do this.

621
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:41,500
Only true, oh, and one of the sisters said, and I quote, only true believers in Christ can understand

622
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:49,780
what we went through. If you're a Christian, then you know there's a devil. And the most amazing,

623
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,840
quote, came at the very end of the very last article about the blinded Ms. Obasi.

624
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,760
Ms. Obasi said she looks forward to spending time with her siblings and doesn't fear a recurrence of

625
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:09,020
the demon that she says took her sight. I know it won't come back, Ms. Obasi said. I believe God and

626
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:16,780
his word. If there's anything I want people to realize from this case, it's that God is real.

627
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,820
I am living proof that he's real.

628
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:35,680
Uh, yes, friends, the tales of the two sisters. Or the three sisters, rather. And, uh, let's see,

629
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,060
what other horrible, horrible, horrible news of the weird. Actually, I go through these and mark

630
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:48,400
the ones that I think are particularly interesting. At first, you see, don't you see? In January of

631
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,980
this year, the year of the dog, the city of Beijing, China, prohibited its citizens from

632
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:03,600
trying to hide dogs in their homes. Recently, a park opened north of the city to rent dogs for

633
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:13,640
patrons to walk at the price of about 23 cents for 10 minutes. In April, Feng Kuantang filed a

634
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:18,620
lawsuit in Shenyang, China, asking for damages from the government because inspectors allegedly

635
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:25,200
beat his illegal dog to death in front of him. Well, see, there just ain't no human rights,

636
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,940
ain't even no canine rights in China.

637
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:33,500
Friends, in April, in New Orleans, a fleeing bank robber fired several shots at a police

638
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:40,200
officer, but nearly hit a nearby 38-year-old nun from the Sisters Servants of Mary Convent.

639
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:47,560
The nun's wound was slight because the bullet first passed through the prayer book she was

640
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:55,760
carrying. And here is, uh, these guys got the award for most dysfunctional family. In Oxnard,

641
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,820
California, Dale.

642
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,380
Rochester, 22, was sentenced to three years in prison for raping the pregnant girlfriend of his brother, Ruben.

643
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:08,060
His brothers, Leonard and Samuel, are serving long prison terms for the violent rapes of five women in

644
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:13,780
separate incidents, and Ruben is serving time for robbery and assault. Their father is a local pastor,

645
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:19,340
and their mother, a Christian missionary. And police and prosecutors say there's no evidence of the

646
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:23,840
childhood abuse that typically portends such adult violence.

647
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,120
And, uh...

648
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:36,560
In Italy, Italian physics student, Lino Mizzio, 26, announced in Rome that he had just patented a condom that will play

649
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:42,300
Beethoven if it breaks during use. The condom is coated with a substance that changes electrical

650
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:49,440
conductivity upon rupture, setting off a microchip that produces the sound. Uh, Mizzio said he might

651
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,780
include, instead of music, a verbal warning to the participants to stop what they're doing immediately.

652
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,600
Uh, huh.

653
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,940
Beethoven upon rupture.

654
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,380
Oh, and here, here, I'll, I'll, uh...

655
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:13,560
Well, now, here's some art. Some stories of great art. This is what passes for great art in our world these days, friends.

656
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:24,760
Uh, reviewing a body of art by minimalist Richard Serra in November, of which a large drawing consisting only of a black rectangle within a white circle.

657
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:31,400
A square was typical. A Los Angeles Times critic described the work as known for its, quote,

658
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,580
inflexible austerity,

659
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,740
ungiving impenetrability,

660
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,640
and stubborn bombast.

661
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,060
Also, the work was described as

662
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:40,940
sensuous,

663
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,640
exquisite and delicate,

664
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,280
extremely weighty,

665
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,020
grave and authoritative,

666
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,560
and of fugitive beauty.

667
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,760
That is what an art critic can find to say about a highly enough price to pay.

668
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,840
A modest black square with a white frame.

669
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,160
Oh, and here, great art moves all the way to Beijing, again, in China.

670
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:13,480
Police raided a performance art show that consisted of the artist Ma Liu Ming, naked, cooking potatoes in a pot along with a watch and an earring, and then burying the potatoes.

671
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,960
Li Ming and ten audience members were detained by the authorities.

672
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:24,180
And, uh, here's another. This artist, Ronnie Nicolino, is trying to collect

673
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,360
10,000 bras to string across the Grand Canyon

674
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:36,060
to symbolize the chas- the chasm between human nature and America's obsession with breasts.

675
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,140
Uh, he is now has over 2,000 bras,

676
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,260
but prospects of his getting permission to rig the Grand Canyon are still dim.

677
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,340
Uh, well, dim indeed.

678
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,600
Oh, and here, I gotta go, I gotta do this one.

679
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,120
Recent tragedies befalling people while worshipping.

680
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:09,540
At least 250 Muslims were trampled to death while inching toward a cave for the symbolic stoning of the devil during the annual pilgrimage in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

681
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:21,560
Ten Tanzanian Seventh-day Adventists drowned trying to walk on water as a test of faith near Dal Es Salaam in October.

682
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,760
More than a hundred people drowned near Canaan.

683
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:24,760


684
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,100
Two people were killed in Calcutta in January as two boats returning from a Hindu pilgrimage collided.

685
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:38,160
And three churches were destroyed and 19 worshippers killed during Palm Sunday services when tornadoes struck in Piedmont, Alabama.

686
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,340
Seems like God just ain't fair.

687
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,920
Just- it just ain't fair, my friends.

688
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:53,000
Well, okay, enough news of the weird, and we'll pass on or pass out to, uh, whatever's-

689
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:53,840
Oh, oh, I should!

690
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,760
Hey, would you like to hear a funny joke?

691
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,400
This isn't news anymore, these are jokes, and they come from funny pages.

692
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:05,540
Oh, and now you people remind me to give the address of these things when I get finished here.

693
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,480
What's the difference between Rush Limbaugh and the Hindenburg?

694
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:17,320
One is a flaming Nazi gas bag, the other's just a dirigible.

695
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,120
What do you get when you cross a Jehovah's Witness

696
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,540
with a Unitarian?

697
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,020
Someone who knocks on your door for no reason.

698
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,100
Why did O.J. sit in the Bronco for so long?

699
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:39,400
Because Rodney King told him he better not get out of that car.

700
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,640
Uh, yes, friends, there's, uh, funny pages, actually.

701
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,540
I'm not good at telling jokes, I know it.

702
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,760
I tell, uh, you know, as they say, I tell jokes like a subgenius.

703
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,920
I can only spew and spout,

704
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,080
but I have trouble repeating other people's stuff.

705
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:57,000
In fact, even common ordinary clichés, I always get them mixed up.

706
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,260
I, I mix two into one without knowing it.

707
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,540
But, but here's some subgenius jo-

708
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,700
actually, these weren't originally subgenius jokes, but they work just as well.

709
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:11,800
How does a subgen- how do you know a subgenius has ju- a subgenius gal has just lost her virginity?

710
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,800
Her crayons are still sticky.

711
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,140
Hehehehehe.

712
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:17,800
Eh.

713
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,900
How do most subgenius men make love?

714
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,180
Right-handed.

715
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,860
Uh, why did the subgenius massage parlor go out of business?

716
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,400
It was self-serve.

717
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,520
When is a pink girl good in bed?

718
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,740
When she's trying to dry her shoe polish.

719
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:35,900
Well, well.

720
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,320
Well, well.

721
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,500
How do you, uh, do you know how to get a nun pregnant?

722
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,120
Dress her up like an altar boy.

723
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,460
This traveling salesman is out in the middle of nowhere and his car breaks down.

724
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,880
So he goes up to the nearest farmhouse to ask for a hand.

725
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,960
The farmer says he can take the salesman to town the next day, but he'll have to stay the night.

726
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,100
The farmer says,

727
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,500
There isn't much room, so you'll have to sleep with my son.

728
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,580
The salesman replies,

729
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,620
Oh, I'm in the wrong joke.

730
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,260
Hehehehehe.

731
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:07,900
Heh.

732
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,600
Time packs.

733
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:13,000
We're not the best product in the world, but we're right up there next to it.

734
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,820
Why do you have to take two Mormons with you fishing?

735
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,440
If you only take one, he'll drink all your beer.

736
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,860
Why do men have a urethra?

737
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,160
So oxygen can get to their brains.

738
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,980
What did the missionary bring to the cannibals?

739
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,640
A little taste of religion.

740
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:32,720
And, dear friends, why did Bill Clinton cross the road?

741
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:33,680
To meet the chick.

742
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,960
Did you hear that Michael Jackson was taken to the emer...

743
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,500
Did you hear that Michael Jackson was taken to the emergency room?

744
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,360
He was choking on a small bone.

745
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,300
And finally, what's a feminopsy?

746
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,860
A woman who wouldn't sleep.

747
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:48,880
With Rush.

748
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,240
Thank you.

749
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:56,940
And, uh, yes, those are all from this amazing little newsletter, Funny Pages,

750
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:03,540
which most of the jokes in here are too foul or un-PC, what have you,

751
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:07,020
for me to say on the radio, but I can give you their address,

752
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,100
and you can get information from them.

753
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,440
That's Funny Pages at P.O. Box...

754
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,840
Got that pencil ready?

755
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,260
317-025.

756
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:23,040
That's Box 317-025, Dayton, Ohio.

757
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,900
That's O-H. Dayton, O-H.

758
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,820
45437.

759
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:34,720
Okay? That's 45437 for Funny Pages.

760
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:41,280
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

761
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,720
I was... I forgot.

762
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,660
I...

763
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,240
It seems time has come.

764
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,320
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say time that way, my friends.

765
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,400
And News of the Weird, you can get information about News of the Weird

766
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:57,340
from Chuck Shepherd at P.O. Box 8306.

767
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:03,300
That's Box 8306, St. Petersburg, Florida.

768
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,740
8306, St. Petersburg, Florida, 33738.

769
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,080
That is, once again, 33738.

770
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,600
Yes, friends, and at the end of this broadcast,

771
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:16,520
we will tell you just what all, uh,

772
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:21,660
there is to get from the mighty Church of the Subgenius.

773
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,260
Uh, well, actually, we'll just tell you where to write for that information.

774
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:30,060
But in the meantime, let's just listen to some instrumental music here by So-So Donna.

775
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:04,760
So-So Donna Haddon

776
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,980
That wasn't my part.

777
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:05,980


778
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:07,520
Couldn't you sunbathe a little prettier?

779
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:08,520


780
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,520
You're a dead man, Amy, this welcomed Phineas.

781
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:16,500
Try really hard, you with me.

782
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,580
Thank you.

783
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,740
Thank you.

784
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,620
Thank you.

785
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:51,300
But I think that it's wrong to shut down Robert Tilton for fleecing little old ladies.

786
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,080
Because think about it.

787
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,800
Who's spending the money more wisely?

788
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,940
Bob Tilton or the little old ladies?

789
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,260
Hell, they spend it on him.

790
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,160
It's better spent.

791
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:07,000
Bob Tilton might be tempted to spend it on the church of the subgenius.

792
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:10,360
He might be in here at Starwood for all we know with the long-haired wig on.

793
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,200
I wouldn't put it past him.

794
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,600
He's a slack preacher.

795
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,320
There's another great preacher named Dr. Gene Scott.

796
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:16,980
Dr. Gene Scott.

797
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,460
Anybody familiar with Dr. Gene Scott?

798
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,160
He's the one.

799
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,560
He looks kind of like an old gray-haired hippie.

800
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,560
Wears a cowboy hat.

801
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:31,400
And he actually, he sometimes, like if people aren't calling the number on the screen, thank you.

802
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,360
He'll sit there and go, well, nobody's calling in.

803
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,160
I'm just going to leave.

804
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:36,760
And he'll leave.

805
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,860
They'll show the chair for hours and hours.

806
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:45,340
But other times, he'll say, you want to know what we spend your money on that you're pledging to us with your faith prayers?

807
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,200
Roll that.

808
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:46,740
Take, Bobby.

809
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,240
Hurry up.

810
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:47,540
Roll it.

811
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,580
And then Bobby will roll the tape.

812
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:56,900
And it'll be nice home movies of his racehorses, his girlfriends, his mansion, his swimming pool.

813
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:04,360
And the great Gene Scott would say that he'd go, now all the other TV preachers do the same thing with the money that I do.

814
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,820
But I've got more respect for you as viewers.

815
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,800
Because I know that you don't want a stupid preacher.

816
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,240
Praise.

817
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:15,320
Praise.

818
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,900
Honesty on the airwaves is so hard to come by, dear friends.

819
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,960
I want to have those racehorses.

820
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,920
I want to have that mansion.

821
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,560
All the subgeniuses.

822
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:30,220
We're running around here using old throwaway technology that they consider normal.

823
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,820
They actually invented for the space wars they did back in the 60s.

824
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,360
We could all be space traveling billionaires.

825
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,300
And instead, they've got us working jobs.

826
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,360
A lot of us anyway.

827
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,320
Well, I should speak for myself.

828
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:44,620
This is my job.

829
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,360
It doesn't pay worth it.

830
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:52,020
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

831
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:56,000
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

832
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,480
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready?

833
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:05,660
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

834
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:12,580
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

835
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,980
Stay tuned and praise God.

836
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:15,360
Thanks, Bob.

837
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,860
God is standing there ready to say to you, hey, don't order this.

838
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,380
It ain't what you need.

839
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,840
But we don't listen.

840
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,440
God can heal you.

841
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,020
God can heal our land.

842
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,060
And it's all going to begin with prayer.

843
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:33,840
I am a Christian.

844
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:37,400
And as I read the New Testament of the Bible, I discovered something about Jesus.

845
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,580
Oh, by the way, I'm not supposed to mention the name of Jesus.

846
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,580
We don't want to make this a Protestant affair.

847
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,940
We don't want to make it a Christian affair.

848
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,560
So I'm just going to refer to the Son of God as Bob.

849
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:57,200
As I studied the life of Bob in my Bible,

850
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,440
I discovered that he didn't teach the disciples anything in Greek.

851
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,540
He didn't teach them how to build a great church or how to market it.

852
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,820
He didn't even teach them how to take offerings.

853
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:09,960
You know what he taught them how to do?

854
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,200
He taught them how to pray.

855
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,040
Kill Lord!

856
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:14,660
Kill!

857
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,060
Kill those who do not believe!

858
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:17,520
Kill wretches!

859
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,380
Kill accusers!

860
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,160
Kill long-haired, maggot-infested children of the sixties rejects!

861
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:21,880
Satan, kill your mom!

862
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,040
Satan, kill your children!

863
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:27,900
Lord, help us deal with the death and the emanation of the forces of evil!

864
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:28,960
I pray!

865
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,300
Die, all ye that I pray!

866
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:35,080
Please, Lord, help us in our war against Satan!

867
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:35,960
Kill!

868
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:36,220
Die!

869
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:36,980
Kill!

870
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:37,280
Die!

871
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,600
Kill Satan!

872
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,880
Die for God!

873
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,780
Can't you see what's happening in conspiracy?

874
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,560
A seeking battle of war and God!

875
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,800
But now the war on Satan!

876
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,220
The killing of Satan!

877
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:45,460
They're killing Christians!

878
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,620
They're killing Blacks!

879
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,660
God, they will kill Whites!

880
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:48,300
They kill Jews!

881
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,200
They kill Moslems!

882
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,600
They kill Ori and Iultim, Malus!
