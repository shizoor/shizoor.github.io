1
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,180
What does the phrase number one record mean to you?

2
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,860
The entertainment industry is about money.

3
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,460
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

4
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,160
The self-genius.

5
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:56,100
So I cried.

6
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,640
See that?

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,560
Uh-huh.

8
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,100
That's when all of a sudden he had the difficulty in the third inning.

9
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,080
And those people over there are people who act like a fool when I...

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:13,820
A thousand right-wing talk show hosts in a row talking about how the right-wing talk show host is endangered by the liberal controlled media.

11
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,640
Owned by Westinghouse.

12
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,040
Well, you can get...

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,460
You can...

14
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:19,880
You can...

15
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,340
You can...

16
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,860
You can...

17
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:26,040
When you have a subgenius radio show, you can not only steam and bitch and piss about it.

18
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,320
You can go in there and type up some...

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,760
Nasty little bitter, hate-filled, absolutely awful just rant.

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,120
Then you can take it back.

21
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,960
Then you take a walk around the lake, have a froth stick or something.

22
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,880
Then you come back and make it funny, right?

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,560
You take out all the bitter...

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,140
Well, you take out the unfunny bitterness.

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,300
Let's put it that way.

26
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,360
And then you can...

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,800
Boy, you've got a soapbox.

28
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,320
It may be that nobody's listening at all.

29
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,280
But who cares as long as you think they do?

30
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,420
Faith is all that counts, friend.

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,120
It's just like Dr. Legumes.

32
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,780
He said, you know, when that spike is coming down towards your hand,

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,800
the faith is the only thing that counts.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,720
In fact, when X-Day happens, this is a little-known piece of doctrine.

35
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,340
But, you know, people have asked us,

36
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,900
well, when the aliens come to rupture the subgeniuses up and destroy the pink world,

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,440
do...

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,240
You say it's at 7 a.m., July 5th, 1998.

39
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,300
Well, where does that start?

40
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,620
I mean, is it 7 a.m.?

41
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,820
7 a.m. is different times in different places.

42
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,900
I'm here to put your mind at ease.

43
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,560
It actually will start, according to Bob's memos,

44
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,900
at the International Date Line,

45
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,300
which happens to fall across the Pacific Ocean.

46
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,840
The first subgeniuses to be ruptured up will be the ones in Micronesia.

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,880
The Earth, the saucers will basically hover in place over the Earth,

48
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,500
and as the planet turns underneath it,

49
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,680
they'll zap up people as it hits 7 o'clock.

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,060
It eats.

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,280
It eats.

52
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:07,200
Now, that means those of us in America can watch the Europeans getting ruptured and destroyed on television.

53
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,980
So far, so far...

54
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,700
Now, of course, people have said,

55
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,680
now, where are we going to have the big X-Day gathering for all the American subgeniuses?

56
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,640
You know, there's got to be a place.

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,460
Yeah, Ben, I think so far, Brushwood is the perfect place.

58
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,280
It means that a lot of us...

59
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,600
We just have to come from California.

60
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,080
You really are dangerous like you, baby.

61
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,420
I've got to admit it.

62
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,180
Sugar.

63
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,860
Mom.

64
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,360
Mom.

65
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,480
Mom.

66
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,880
Hey, Ben, watch out for that UFO.

67
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,460
Mom.

68
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,920
Mom.

69
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,200
Sugar.

70
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,300
Mom.

71
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,820
Sweet farm bird,

72
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,720
You're economist more expensive because you weren't

73
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:09,720


74
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,640
across country and culture

75
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:14,660
there.

76
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:16,900
You have never seen another because of very different reasons.

77
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,640
Uh huh.

78
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:27,480
Um, I also have the doctor's office to check on them.

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:27,740
Ah.

80
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:27,960
Right.

81
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,280
And lift your VE

82
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,160
Alien

83
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,420
Antoid

84
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,180
Succubus

85
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,780
Alien

86
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:40,940
Antoid

87
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,000
Succubus

88
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,400
Oh, Megan, you won't be able to tell the difference at all.

89
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,840
We cite goddesses partly because it sounds better to our primary market,

90
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,100
which I'm sorry, you know, it's pretty obvious.

91
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,600
But it's also because they only have one chromosome.

92
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,980
You could not call them male.

93
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,240
Female is the closest thing.

94
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,940
But they'll look like anything you want.

95
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,260
You could be sitting there.

96
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:17,280
Well, I wrote a 40-page essay about what my ideal experience on the escape vessels would be,

97
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,480
and my fellow editors made me cut it because it was too limiting.

98
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,900
It was too juvenile.

99
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,020
It was too ordinary.

100
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,080
It was like all the undergrads.

101
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,000
Underground comics, movies, you know, babes, whatever.

102
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:29,860
Food.

103
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,400
Actually, it was mainly food, now that I think about it.

104
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,880
That may have been part of the...

105
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,980
You know, as Bob said, give me slack or give me food.

106
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,940
Or kill me.

107
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,580
I'm starting to feel that way right about now.

108
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:41,780
Stop.

109
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,280
Stimulate my system.

110
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:50,780
Stop.

111
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,020
Electronic erotica is only a fever away.

112
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,300
Sigou...

113
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,940
ber...

114
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,440
Sigou...

115
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,380
The magic that'll fill the ground

116
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,180
It's an orgasmic pleasure, keeps coming

117
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,120
Machines keep humming

118
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,220
As the time walks and dances

119
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,780
Into a dreamland of dreams

120
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,460
I love to be naked

121
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,680
The microtech jumps up the entire soundscape

122
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,080
For autonomy

123
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,340
Alien, android, succubus

124
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:08,920
Alien, android, succubus

125
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,380
I'm coming

126
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,220
Thank you, Thighmaster

127
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,660
Alien, android, succubus

128
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,520
You please

129
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,120
Hello

130
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,780
Arknights

131
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:37,980
Oh no

132
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:44,260
ättİ

133
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,660
Do you know the technology

134
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:53,660


135
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,680
Nope

136
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,760
Uh, yes, dear friends, hello!

137
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,360
That was Alien Android Succubus from OBE, Out of Band Experience.

138
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,020
And you can get more OBE.

139
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,660
What a pleasant, pleasant band they are, too.

140
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:18,320
By calling, in this case, you make a phone call to 1617-LICK-OBE.

141
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,180
That's 1617-LICK-OBE.

142
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,620
They've got CDs and cassettes and so forth.

143
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,780
You can get their free information from them about that.

144
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,600
And now it's time to go on with the rest of our subgenius show.

145
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,340
The Alien Android Succubus was intermixed there with the wacky

146
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:39,620
Ex-Day and Sex Goddesses rant from Starwood Radio.

147
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,840
So we're going to have a real wacky, crazy, nutty subgenius show,

148
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,700
just like we always do, and nobody will get hurt, we promise.

149
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,580
Ooh!

150
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,200
Ooh!

151
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,520
Here we are.

152
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,760
How does it look? Pretty good, huh?

153
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,200
It's the pause now.

154
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,840
I don't know why.

155
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,500
I feel so happy.

156
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,320
I think three of you are just what they are as sexual persons.

157
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,980
And by the way, before we start, I'd like to introduce you to a real expert on sex.

158
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,780
The guy who taught me everything I know.

159
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,960
My wife.

160
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,320
Jeanette.

161
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,000
He always introduces me as an expert.

162
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,260
What a babe!

163
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,860
But I don't claim to take any credit for this knowledge,

164
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,360
as I didn't know much either.

165
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,380
Anyway, I'm in the studio listening to what he has to say today.

166
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,700
And I hope his comments will help me to communicate.

167
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,300
Well, thanks, Jeanette.

168
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,400
And now that we've both established the fact that he really is an expert,

169
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,740
we can say any damn thing that we please without any experts contradicting us.

170
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,320
And so I'd like to start with a kind of a simple idea.

171
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,920
One that I think it took us all our lives to learn.

172
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,020
And this is that sexual intercourse is not what you do.

173
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,380
Sexual intercourse is not what you do.

174
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,080
It's not the things that you learn.

175
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:19,120
It doesn't have anything to do with techniques or positions or anything of this kind.

176
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:20,820
What?

177
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,340
Sexual intercourse has to do with what you are.

178
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,820
We have a journey.

179
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,160
I would like to give you the chance to know about our love.

180
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,900
I will treat you to that.

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,540
I will feel about your son.

182
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,320
I will feel about our child.

183
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,020
And how the kids are.

184
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,900
All of these things are part of what you are.

185
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,200
And all of these things come to bed with you

186
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,960
and make love with you every time that you leave.

187
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,820
I love you.

188
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,980
I love you.

189
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,060
I love you.

190
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,080
I love you.

191
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,640
Oh, the happy moments.

192
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,360
Yeah, it goes to bed.

193
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,060
Yeah, we have our happy time down here.

194
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,720
Let's drink up that espresso.

195
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,460
It's a hap hap happy day.

196
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:00,860
You are here.

197
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,460
Whee!

198
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,800
While others may toil unrelentingly on publication projects.

199
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,720
Happy.

200
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,040
Yes.

201
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,300
Yes.

202
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,140
So is here.

203
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,020
Yeah, it's, it's, yeah, right like you said.

204
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,840
I'm so happy.

205
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,180
I'm so happy.

206
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:21,180


207
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,400
Well, you could think of the show as an eager puppy.

208
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,920
I guess.

209
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,880
Why is it that these little crawlers are never satisfied with the content of the program

210
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,400
and you only command something.

211
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,320
I don't know if it's a favorite organ, but this is the happy segment.

212
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay, begin happy segment now.

213
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,740
It's a happy day.

214
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,040
It's a happy day.

215
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,700
La la la la la la.

216
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,340
Pardon me.

217
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,440
La la la la la la.

218
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,160
Oh, I'll get it.

219
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,980
Can you get that?

220
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,080
Somebody get that.

221
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,720
The sun is shining.

222
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,180
It's a happy day show.

223
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,360
It's all about getting it.

224
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,560
It's a happy day show.

225
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,840
It's a happy day show.

226
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,640
I'm not here.

227
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,220
Everything's about to change.

228
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,020
Okay, I'm not here either.

229
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,900
Is the machine on?

230
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,000
The phone rings and you get it.

231
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,760
All right.

232
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,620
I think it, I think it stopped ringing.

233
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,180
I think it's okay.

234
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:00,600
I knew you'd get it in the end.

235
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,740
Hey, why don't you answer the phone, ma'am?

236
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,760
Wait a minute.

237
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,140
I'm sorry, I can't move out of my wheelchair.

238
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,920
That phone is, is tormenting me.

239
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,620
You should hear something.

240
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,360
It's like that, it's like that phone back in the knob, man.

241
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,800
Keep America ringing all day long.

242
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,380
Watch Truth Will Come a-Winging on a song.

243
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,820
I'm not here.

244
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:19,820


245
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:19,820


246
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:19,820


247
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:19,820


248
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:19,820


249
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
Smile while the phone is ding-dinging.

250
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,340
Carry, carry your car.

251
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,180
Keep the melody ringing and singing in your heart.

252
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,440
Hello.

253
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:32,700
Hi.

254
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,900
Hello there.

255
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,900
What's seeking?

256
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,080
Huh?

257
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,520
Huh?

258
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,460
Hey, look.

259
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,480
Uh, you got that 30 pound codfish underneath the living room couch?

260
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,620
What's this?

261
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,020
Who's this?

262
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,560
You got the wrong number.

263
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:46,960
Oh, wait a minute.

264
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,220
Larry?

265
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:47,960
Huh?

266
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,620
Larry.

267
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
No, this, this is Larry.

268
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:49,800


269
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:49,800


270
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:49,800


271
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:49,800


272
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:49,800


273
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:49,800


274
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:49,800


275
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:49,800


276
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:49,800


277
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:49,800


278
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,020
This is Larry.

279
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,020


280
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,660
You got the wrong number.

281
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,680
Is this the Moose Dough residence?

282
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,680
No.

283
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,680
You got an American flag on your window?

284
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,120
I have a no.

285
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,800
I have a no American flag on my window.

286
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,260
Oh.

287
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,080
Oh.

288
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,620
Well.

289
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,920
Uh, I got this 30 pound codfish, see?

290
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,180
And I'm looking to sell it.

291
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,500
You interested?

292
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,240
Well.

293
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,960
Strictly out of the county, you understand.

294
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,860
You just got the wrong number, mister.

295
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,840
You got a funny, what are you talking to?

296
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,380
Huh?

297
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:13,720
Huh?

298
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,520
What?

299
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:14,860
What?

300
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,000
What's going on?

301
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,680
You got...

302
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,700
You got the wrong number, mister.

303
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:19,800
You got a funny...

304
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:19,800


305
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:19,800


306
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:19,800


307
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:19,800


308
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:21,760
Hello?

309
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:22,980
Uh, hello?

310
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,580
Yeah?

311
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,620
Now, listen.

312
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,480
I only want to say this once.

313
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:34,640
We got your dog, and if you want him back, you'll put 25 dollars in a plain envelope and

314
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,620
leave it at Brigham's at 1145 tomorrow.

315
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:38,740
What?

316
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:40,800
Look.

317
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,380
Can I...

318
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't want to say this any more than I have to.

319
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,620
Look, take the dog and stick it up your...

320
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,100
Hey, listen.

321
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:45,740
Listen.

322
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,160
You listen.

323
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,540
You want us to kill the dog?

324
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:47,860
Kill him.

325
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,120
Kill him.

326
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,900
You did it, bastard. Kill him.

327
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,260
Why?

328
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:52,840
Why?

329
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,680
Don't you want him?

330
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,600
You did it.

331
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,120
Listen.

332
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,280
You kill him.

333
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,460
That's what you do.

334
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,560
That dog is worth at least $100.

335
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,960
Well, good for you.

336
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,400
You sell him.

337
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,240
You want him killed?

338
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,060
Kill him, you'll do it.

339
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,920
You don't care about him?

340
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,680
Why don't you kill him?

341
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,840
Why should I?

342
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,820
Why shouldn't you?

343
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,820
Because you can't kill an animal like that.

344
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,440
Well, you want to kill him. You said you'd kill him.

345
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,780
I don't want to kill him. I want the money.

346
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,500
Yeah, well, you're not going to get neither.

347
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,540
Why not?

348
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,780
You're not going to get the money, all right?

349
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,360
$5?

350
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,660
$5?

351
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,900
You're not going to get anything.

352
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,700
I got to eat.

353
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,200
My kids have got to eat, right?

354
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,660
So you want to kill a dog, right?

355
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,580
You're a dog napper.

356
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,120
Look, man, I tried to get a job.

357
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,260
You're a dog napper, right?

358
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,000
I found him.

359
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,460
Come and work for me.

360
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,560
You want a job?

361
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,100
What?

362
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,680
You work for me. You want a job?

363
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,600
You give me a job?

364
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,700
Yeah, I give you a job.

365
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,120
Do what?

366
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,040
Meet me at the bar at the same place.

367
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,860
What do you give me?

368
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,580
A job to do.

369
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,260
What do you care?

370
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:42,780
You want to eat?

371
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,820
Your kids got to eat, right?

372
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,640
Well, wait.

373
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,020
I got to know what I'm going to do, you know?

374
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,960
What do you care if your kids got to eat?

375
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:48,920
You're still a dog.

376
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,700
Well, wait.

377
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,460
Is it going to be legal?

378
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,100
What?

379
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,300
I ain't got to kill nobody.

380
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,600
I don't.

381
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,120
I'm not worried about you killing nobody.

382
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,040
Then why can't you tell me what you want me to do?

383
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,240
What do you care as long as you get paid for it?

384
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,240
Well, I want to know.

385
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:01,800
Is it going to be...

386
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,340
I want to do decent work, you know?

387
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,400
You want to do decent work?

388
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,100
Yeah.

389
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,240
You didn't do a decent thing then, did you?

390
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,040
Well, maybe not.

391
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,480
Yeah.

392
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,080
Yeah.

393
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,280
Well, wait.

394
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,940
You're going to tell me you've never done anything indecent in your life?

395
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,020
No, I'm not going to tell you anything.

396
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,680
I'm going to tell you something.

397
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:19,680


398
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,720
The ringing of the bells.

399
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,620
The ringing of the bells.

400
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,500
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, pals.

401
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,100
Palsy of the ringing of the dinging of the bells.

402
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,320
You know, Richard Belzer is a good comedian.

403
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,240
Hear the horrid bells, alarum bells.

404
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,900
What a tale of tinge and abulation there.

405
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,620
Kiss the promise he does.

406
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,620
Is that phone fidelity?

407
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,640
Did I get that phone fidelity thing right?

408
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,640
Did I get that show fidelity thing right?

409
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,020
I got fidelity.

410
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,340
I went to a natural born cat.

411
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:48,740
Show us again.

412
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,720
Show infidelity.

413
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,640
Since you last called us?

414
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,240
Yeah.

415
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:52,940
Yeah.

416
00:15:53,020 --> 00:16:01,560
I mean, I mean, Gobi called me at 4.30 in the morning our time to tell me that she had

417
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,740
seen that movie and it made her feel like going out and killing and she wanted to know

418
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,560
which kind of firearm I should, I kid you not.

419
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,180
Wow.

420
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,400
So I was impressed, but I doubt if I'll see it because I think it's just pedantic.

421
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,860
It's not just the good ones anymore.

422
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,100
It's not like Logan's run or anything.

423
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,180
Well, it's like watching news in MTV style.

424
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:20,600
Who cares?

425
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,220
Potato gun.

426
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,340
To work on such a project is wonderful.

427
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,660
To have a set watch.

428
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,240
No dogs in helicopters.

429
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,960
I think Mickey and Mal were used for Magnum, didn't they?

430
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,460
Project.

431
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,180
Magnum oatmeal.

432
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,340
Potatoes.

433
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,800
Magnum.

434
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,540
Drops.

435
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,200
Yeah, it's a cough drop, right?

436
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,760
Magnum, that mossy detective on TV.

437
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,880
Magnum cough drop.

438
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,040
Emil and das cough drop.

439
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,720
Okay, now we have.

440
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,560
We have an error in the first part of the show.

441
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,040
You got a buzzer too.

442
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,020
Oh, okay, go ahead.

443
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,000
They're all in there.

444
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,560
The dinosaurs are all in back of the pen.

445
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,540
Yes, there they are here on Dinosaur Island.

446
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,740
That whole scene at the beginning of Jurassic Park is so fake.

447
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,200
It doesn't take a lot of guys with rifles.

448
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,840
You just say over here and the dinosaurs get in the pen.

449
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,560
Slow people.

450
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,600
Here boy, jump up.

451
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,120
Jump up boy.

452
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,700
That's right.

453
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,280
Good boy.

454
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,840
You just need an island secure enough for them to jump because sometimes when 10 of those guys are jumping off the stools in the cage, man.

455
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:16,980
Yeah.

456
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,340
Well, sometimes.

457
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,400
Man, this is Oregon, man.

458
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,980
They do their best thinking there.

459
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,140
Between their two stools.

460
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,320
So did you get a volume four yet?

461
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,960
We haven't done a two stool show for a decade or so.

462
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,140
All the women.

463
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,020
What did you say?

464
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,600
Did you?

465
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,000
Did you?

466
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,960
Phineas Narco has the floor, the microphone and part of the phone.

467
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,600
I believe the chair has the table.

468
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,900
The table has the floor.

469
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,520
Stop chewing on the end papers and come to your conclusion.

470
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,740
Well, I was wondering if Poe Wing heard my volume four yet.

471
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,860
No, you haven't sent it to me.

472
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
No, he didn't.

473
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,360
But Doug Smith did.

474
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:54,400
And he even created a show for his show called Aunt Bertha versus the Head, which has already been broadcast.

475
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,540
Oh, right.

476
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,160
All right, man.

477
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,520
Yes.

478
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:16,400
And listening there to the KPFA subgenius show in Berkeley with Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence.

479
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,340
And Phineas Narco.

480
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,400
Phineas Narco is the caller.

481
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:26,040
Interspersed there with a nice old classic prank call section.

482
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,880
We don't know who did it, who perpetrated it, called Dog Napper.

483
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,700
An unusual prank call in that there's not too much cussing in it that I had to remove.

484
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,760
We need your help in identifying a pedestrian killed on 285.

485
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,920
285.

486
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,040
Screw you.

487
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,320
285.

488
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,680
285.

489
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:49,680


490
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:49,680


491
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:49,680


492
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:49,680


493
00:18:49,680 --> 00:19:00,200
Yeah, that's an unusual prank call in that the erstwhile victim of the pranker turns the tables and sort of wins the game.

494
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,080
285.

495
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:09,320
Now, what we're hearing in the background here is Silica Jell's piece, Master of the Game.

496
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,120
Between Old Dixie Highway and Connelly Drive.

497
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,100
Drive.

498
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:14,780

499
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,680
Drive.

500
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:15,980
Drive.

501
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,200
Drive.

502
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:16,460
Drive.

503
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:16,460


504
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,320

505
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,560
Drive.

506
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,660
Drive.

507
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,860
Drive.

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:34,640

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,300
Doe Laveel-

534
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:47,300


535
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:47,300


536
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:47,320
Doe Laveel-

537
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:57,840
can get going. Oh, me getting going is always such a long shot. But I've been a little upset

538
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:05,740
about something lately, listeners. I mean, every TV news bite lately has been about D-Day. Hey,

539
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:13,400
what about X-Day? It's a little over four years away, kitties. Four years before the X's towards

540
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,980
come down to smear the human race off the face of the earth like a booger on a pants leg.

541
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:26,040
Oh, you'd think they'd care. You'd think they'd be concerned about the coming global apocalypse.

542
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:33,600
But no, they'd rather sit back on their withered butts and talk about how they defended freedom

543
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:41,080
and the cause of white bread values 50 years ago. And then they turn a blind eye to the near future

544
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,440
and the onrushing Holocaust.

545
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:49,580
Oh, from the signs in the current media retchings, you couldn't tell the doomsday clock has ticked out

546
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:57,660
another year in the 666 mile an hour demolition derby road race to human Armageddon. Well, honey,

547
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:04,240
I'm Armageddon excited just thinking about it. I can whiff a stench of fried pink flesh in the air

548
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:12,960
already. But let me let you in on something. A lifetime supply isn't that good a deal.

549
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:20,080
But the cosmic sweetness and light tone of the media's view of the future rings as hollow as a

550
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:28,660
politician's promises. Oh, sure. There was the stand a few weeks ago with its warmed over Vegas

551
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:34,880
set from that Limburger Lily cool world. But it sure wasn't like what Bob told us X day would be

552
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:43,340
like. I don't think X day is going to be a feel good Christian fundamentalist survivalist,

553
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:50,920
martyr pistol porn hug fest. And what an ineffectual Prince of Darkness they have. I mean, he couldn't

554
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:59,160
morph worth a damn cheesy effects. Only one crucified guy on a billboard to after a lot of build up. And

555
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:06,560
the big payoff sucked. We got treated to way too much of Stephen King's gerbil face good looks. You

556
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,860
know, at least we got to see Miguel Ferrer plug the scenery knowing Ray Walston in the gut with hot

557
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,540
lead. But

558
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:40,800
still, I was unsatisfied. The black and white plot line pointed out the limited vision of their theology. It's either good or it's evil. It's either God or it's Lucifer. I mean, where's Bob in their equation? Bob wasn't involved in the stand because he was setting himself up with a car carrying tithing subgeniuses on the escape vessels. Thank you.

559
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,420
Oh,

560
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


561
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


562
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


563
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


564
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


565
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


566
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


567
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


568
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


569
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


570
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


571
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


572
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


573
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


574
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


575
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


576
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


577
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


578
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


579
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


580
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


581
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


582
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


583
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


584
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


585
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


586
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


587
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


588
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


589
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


590
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


591
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,520


592
00:22:42,540 --> 00:23:12,060
yeah, but the stand sure went over big with a family values types because every Bubba's boy sure could identify that armchair macho Frontier feeling. Oh, they can't wait till the end of the world as they know it to come so they can legally take pot shots at us in the name of their Lord. I say the more the pinker, the bigger the sphincter. This is what they're made of. They'll be easy prey when the excess mom down like spring wheat.

593
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,940
Too bad they won't be more of a challenge because they will be our entertainment.

594
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,240
Oh, yeah.

595
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,760
Oh, yeah.

596
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:42,280
We'll be off with Bob watching this pink human worms duking it out to the crawling spasming near death even before they face the excess abattoirs up there for our pleasure on the big wall size view screens.

597
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:42,520
Oh, yeah.

598
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:42,520


599
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:42,520


600
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:42,520


601
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:58,860
All in feely vision since around and every seat and Bob's theater has its own armrest fingertip burst. Oh pain control buttons. Oh, they'll be looking like the number two scrambled eggs and pork brain special at a greasy spoon diner.

602
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,380
Ha ha.

603
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,240
Oh, yes.

604
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,420
Oh, I feel so wonderful.

605
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,480
Vengeance is a beauty treatment.

606
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:12,120
Oh, and I'm in this fight for life or what's left of it at least.

607
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,580
And I'm going to see to it that you at least live before you die.

608
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,580
Oh, there'll be a certain percentage of unsafe subgeniuses who won't make it off planet.

609
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,520
Oh, of course.

610
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:30,160
That's just because they didn't think their lives were worth that measly membership fee.

611
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,920
Oh, and the rates will soon be going up too.

612
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,480
There's a postage increase and we're not a tax exempt church.

613
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,480
No, we stand for profits.

614
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,100
Even though we don't ever seem to be.

615
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,880
I'm not sure we'll be making any.

616
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,640
But still, with faith in Bob, I'll at least have a good time of it.

617
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:53,140
We'll see to it that you reap reams and reams of pure, easy, light slack.

618
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,920
Oh, would you rather be separated like a fool from his money or like the wheat from the chaff?

619
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,260
You can get more flies with honey than with vinegar.

620
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,140
Oh, but you can get all of the flies with slack.

621
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,040
If you lack slack.

622
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:21,260
Get it back, Jack, by writing to the Subgenius Ministries International Headquarters in the sprawling mega-burb of Dallas, Texas, where slack is more precious than ever.

623
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,880
Oh, the church is still thriving underground beneath their very repressive feet.

624
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:36,640
Yet still, the bonded federal employees are mindlessly delivering the mail to the sacred P.O. box like everything's okay.

625
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,020
They haven't got their orders.

626
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,240
They haven't got their orders to disrupt vital church communications.

627
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,580
But it's only a matter of time before they crush that vital lifeline.

628
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,380
Oh, so, sisters and brothers, hearken to my voice.

629
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:57,580
And before it's too late for you, write for more information on how you can save your ass from the coming Holocaust.

630
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:04,580
Grab a pencil or write in the dust of your shattered existence there the name Bob.

631
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,740
Oh.

632
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,180
P.O. box.

633
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,960
1-4-0-3-0-6.

634
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,120
Dallas, Texas.

635
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,160
75214.

636
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:31,480
Oh, send a stamped self-addressed envelope to the sacred P.O. box.

637
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,720
And before you know it, you'll be slurping up frop and Fritos on board the escape vessels of the P.O. box.

638
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:36,860
you'll than I am gorgeous around ghosts who sunbathe and

639
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:36,860


640
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:36,860


641
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:36,860


642
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:36,860


643
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,600
with all your new sub-genius friends.

644
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:58,960
Noooo amth рядом with rats.

645
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:06,700
Mo organize your storm to find occupational members of

646
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:06,700


647
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:06,700


648
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,660
Pardon me?

649
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,480
The pills?

650
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,860
Oh, you want those pills.

651
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,360
They always talk about it.

652
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,840
I heard about the Bob pills.

653
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,340
You never come down from one of those Bob pills.

654
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,560
You've got to be careful not to take too much the first time

655
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,780
because it's not going to wear off.

656
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,440
What's inside, and sometimes we have actually had

657
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,280
the fabled legendary bucket of pills at revivals.

658
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,860
Frankly, there wasn't enough of a budget for that at this one.

659
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,200
But we would, and have done this in the past,

660
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,480
we have a bucket of little gel caps, actually big gel caps,

661
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,500
and we cast them into the audience generously.

662
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,820
Now, what's inside those pills is the same thing

663
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,360
that's inside.

664
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,320
It's inside the head of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

665
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,340
Oh, that's right.

666
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,920
We changed the dogma about what was inside his head.

667
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,520
Now we're going to have to put that horrible poison

668
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,600
inside those pills.

669
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,280
Oh.

670
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:26,840
Slack!

671
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,160
You slap yourself!

672
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,460
Slack me on your wildest dreams!

673
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,600
Buy now and slap!

674
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,820
You have the power to find slack!

675
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,300
Good something for nothing!

676
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,600
Credit cards are taken!

677
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,540
Slack!

678
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,520
Send cash!

679
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,080
I want more slack!

680
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,640
Send your money now!

681
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,040
Conspiracy denied me again!

682
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,440
Send your money!

683
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,420
I will have my slack!

684
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,140
Your slack's open and here!

685
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:03,980
Slack!

686
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,540
Not your money!

687
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:05,840
We use your slack!

688
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,280
You slack!

689
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,720
Is that good?

690
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,980
You slack!

691
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,220
You're very old!

692
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,020
All sorts of slack!

693
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,260
Every time, slack imaginable!

694
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,380
You slack!

695
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,740
Is that good?

696
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,020
You slack!

697
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,260
You're very old!

698
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,120
All sorts of slack!

699
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,500
You slack!

700
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,260
Every time, slack imaginable!

701
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,500
Slack!

702
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,880
Slack from the other side of the world!

703
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,000
Attack!

704
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,280
Slack from right next door!

705
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,660
Here you are, Slack town, my dear! Slack town, my lady!

706
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,640
You Slack, my dear, my now!

707
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,140
Use the Slack!

708
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,400
We have used the Slack!

709
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,980
I'll number three!

710
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,680
I want my Slack!

711
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,880
Who in Slack will find recognition with the fruit of order?

712
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,600
Use Slack!

713
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:11,880
Slack!

714
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,720
If you have the chance, you can have your Slack.

715
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,660
Money in Slack.

716
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,560
Something for nothing.

717
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,260
Slack is great!

718
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,420
Slack.

719
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,700
Slack is government control.

720
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,660
For your home.

721
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:45,300
protection. I want more slack. Slack is not for everyone. You cannot take my slack away.

722
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,760
Slack can be taken by prescription.

723
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:08,600
Yes, dear friends, used slack there. Some used slack left over from our good friends

724
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:17,260
out-of-band experience, or OBE, which you can reach by dialing.

725
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:24,880
If you're interested in their types and CDs, and you should be, you can call up old Reverend

726
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:34,060
Bill Miller at 1-617-LICK-OBE. Easy enough, right?

727
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,440
And other times, you know, it's like you've done that, right?

728
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:43,460
So, I guess the point of the subject is the matter of the speech, I suppose, but you're

729
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,640
damned if I know of, like, anything of pink.

730
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,740
Later on, I feel like you can sit there.

731
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,620
You're blue, right?

732
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:56,020
So, yeah, I guess, like, you know, I started feeling real good about myself again, you

733
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,800
know, because it's like, man, I got my car going again, and stuff is all right.

734
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,780
I felt like, you know, you know, screw it, man, if you don't like it, you know.

735
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,420
So, something...

736
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,080
Me, man.

737
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,260
Yeah, so something me.

738
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,800
Like, I don't care what it was.

739
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,100
Like, sue me or blow me, I don't care.

740
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,800
But, I do remember this.

741
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,280
Please, man.

742
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,700
I don't remember what I'm feeling now.

743
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,660
They're not really doing a very good job tonight, are they?

744
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,860
The whole thing was because they were, like, invaded by, like, this poisonous kind of thing.

745
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,000
It was a big pus ball.

746
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,320
It was a big pus ball.

747
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,540
It was a big pus ball.

748
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:01,540


749
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:01,540


750
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:07,000
I was going to Jacksonville to buy a green green bag for a friend of mine.

751
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,700
Now, y'all know the mystical components of a green green bag.

752
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,700
Green green green green green green green green green.

753
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,600
I love that song.

754
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,320
Black cat balls.

755
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,460
A lamp in our gym.

756
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,740
Four kinds of feelings.

757
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,520
And a magic mushroom.

758
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,560
You don't want to get it over here, do you?

759
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,100
All right, baby.

760
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:50,380
So, they said they'd take the old green green bag and put it on a man's doorstep after Epiphany Day.

761
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,680
You know what?

762
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,720
What's he doing?

763
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,620
What's he doing?

764
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:54,640
What's he doing?

765
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,300
What's he doing?

766
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:55,300


767
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:55,300


768
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:55,300


769
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:55,300


770
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,260
If he don't come back and die the very next day, then it don't work and come back again.

771
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,540
Lonesome Cowboy Dave here.

772
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:25,040
And Chaz, I think, going on about the green green bag there.

773
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,320
On WCSB Cleveland.

774
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,500
It's the blues, my friend.

775
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,920
It's retarded.

776
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,960
I don't make noise.

777
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,960
Let's get them balls.

778
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,940
I'm going here.

779
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,260
I'm so going here.

780
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,600
Don't look back through the glass.

781
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,800
I don't know where you're going.

782
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,040
I'm out here.

783
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,200
Out here.

784
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,760
Then at the restaurant, there was crews packed in brief ice and they had to stop mice.

785
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,760
But that old green green bag must have not worked too good because the very next day, the cats come back and it was alive.

786
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,620
dale whoения

787
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,320
I'm gonna be the last man

788
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,780
And his spirit is stucked in that old Greek rib bag just to make one old woman die

789
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,180
Put a curse on me

790
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,140
Did one times three

791
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,040
Three times three

792
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,980
Three times three

793
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,820
Got nine lives

794
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,720
But y'all gonna die

795
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,020
Three times three

796
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:23,680
And this reminds me of when we found my daughter's cat's skeleton this morning, yes

797
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:31,580
It's been, uh, this will be the third dead cat we've found on this radio show

798
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,660
Over an eight year period

799
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,880
We're all gonna die, friends

800
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,340
And end up little wads of wet fur on the ground

801
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:46,960
The only recognizable piece of a cat you can see is the skull

802
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,240
And the fur

803
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,940
It had been rained on a bit

804
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,940
We don't know what happened to Princess

805
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,180
But, well, we know she's dead

806
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,200
You know it could happen to you any time, my friend

807
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,340
You may tie your shoes this morning

808
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,800
But the Undertaker may tie them tonight

809
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,700
Are you ready to meet Bob?

810
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,220
Move here for my man

811
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,800
Move here for my man

812
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,300
That's him

813
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,980
He's here

814
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,860
Here he comes

815
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,420
That's him

816
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,880
That's him

817
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,140
He's here now

818
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,960
The All-Knowing Big

819
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,660
The All-Knowing Big

820
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,320
The All-Knowing Big

821
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,380
The All-Knowing Big

822
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,160
The All-Knowing Big

823
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,720
The All-Knowing Big

824
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,340
The All-Knowing Big

825
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:53,700
The All-Knowing Big

826
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,900
The All-Knowing Big

827
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:22,440
The All-Knowing Bee

828
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:55,280
The All-Knowing Bee

829
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:55,760
Let me tell you something.

830
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,860
Let me tell you something.

831
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,640
The All-Knowing Bee

832
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,400
The All-Knowing Bee

833
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,280
Asked Bryce

834
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,320
The All-Knowing Bee

835
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,020
The All-Knowing Bee

836
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,160
Asked Bryce

837
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,280
Asked Bryce

838
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,280


839
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,280


840
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,060
Ask Frank.

841
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,160
Call Frank.

842
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,040
Ask him.

843
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,940
Even facts, Frank.

844
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,400
We must ask.

845
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,340
I hear him now.

846
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,220
We must.

847
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,080
Ask Frank.

848
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,660
Call Frank.

849
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,740
Even facts, Frank.

850
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,320
Nah, don't mess with Frank, man.

851
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,560
He'll tell you.

852
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:54,680
Yeah, I think the thing to do is to ask R. Stevie more about the all-knowing Bean.

853
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,320
Bean.

854
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,920
And that's who that is.

855
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,120
That's R. Stevie Moore.

856
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:06,320
The famous first of the independent crazy men, one might say.

857
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,880
And you can write for those crazy rhythms from R. Stevie Moore's cassette club at...

858
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,640
Captain Beefheart.

859
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,100
What?

860
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,060
At...

861
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,520
Let's get this going up right here.

862
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,640
At...

863
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,320
Yes, R. Stevie Moore.

864
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,120
At 429 Valley Road.

865
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,680
That's 429 Valley Road in Upper Montclair, New Jersey.

866
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,680
Yes, he's still there and still cranking it out.

867
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,140
At Upper Montclair, New Jersey, 07043.

868
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,960
429 Valley Road, 07043.

869
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,740
Gosh, this music is just so...

870
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,260
I don't know.

871
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,060
It's inspiring in some peculiar way.

872
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,100
And it just makes me...

873
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,920
I'm so happy-go-lucky, you know?

874
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,500
It's so...

875
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,200
It's some subgenius or something.

876
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,680
It's something like that.

877
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:09,920
Let's see what Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence have to say about Aunt Bertha and the nuclear war.

878
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,840
Thank y'all.

879
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,200
Uh, sure.

880
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,620
Billy.

881
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,160
Follow along in your script.

882
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,960
Billy and Timmy are poking through the nuclear rubble.

883
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,820
Looking for candy bars in the radioactive slant.

884
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,720
Billy and Timmy turn left on Central Street.

885
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:34,100
Aunt Bertha, blinded by the flash, uses them to guide her through the rubble.

886
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:41,480
Aunt Bertha's leg is pinned in PS-127's doorway, collapsing upon her during the blast.

887
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:50,220
Also, Aunt Bertha was a victim of a shower of glass from the windows of the school, which embedded itself in her elderly flesh.

888
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,960
The buzzer of the school continues to sound.

889
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,900
As Aunt Bertha...

890
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,060
Lies writhing on the ground pinned by the front species.

891
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,860
And the speaker says over and over again, today is August 12th, 2076.

892
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:06,260
Which is odd, because it's only 1996.

893
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,660
Wow.

894
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,160
So scary.

895
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:20,180
And you know, a coleopterist or beetle-like race will dwell in humanity's disused cities.

896
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,040
That beetle is a beetle.

897
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,520
Yes, these neotenous beetles.

898
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,440
Somebody get that phone.

899
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,100
They're fetal beetles, as our caller pointed out.

900
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,860
Oh, oh, just a moment.

901
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,760
We'll continue with our fetal-beetle recital in a moment.

902
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,600
At first.

903
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,920
At first.

904
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,420
Picture if you will.

905
00:42:53,040 --> 00:43:05,020
A lone outcast spurned by his so-called peers, coddled by his fawning mother, berated by his masculine father, and lost in a world without slack or meaning.

906
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,900
His name, Doug Smith.

907
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:14,420
A lonely child in an average home in an average town on a lonely planet called Earth.

908
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:20,320
His fate, to be swept up in the pre-apocalyptic world of the mighty church of the subgenius.

909
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,020
None know why he alone is...

910
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,320
chosen.

911
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,360
For none can fathom the myriad plots of this most devious of cults.

912
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,640
But even the spawn of the...

913
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,200
normals...

914
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,380
must bow and bend beneath the moronic will of J.R.

915
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,280
Bob Dobbs.

916
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,140
In a story we are forced to call,

917
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,920
A Pink Boy Comes to Bobolon.

918
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,740
Last week, Doug realized his dream. He became a member of a worldwide religious cult.

919
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:52,920
More than that, he was gifted with an actual ordainment as a high priest.

920
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,360
And doctor of forbidden science.

921
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,040
Now he feels full of fervor and belonging as he sets out in a seemingly brighter world.

922
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:05,360
Armed with the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs and his lackey editor, Reverend Ivan Stang.

923
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,760
This week, episode four.

924
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,340
Now, upon this block, I'll found my church.

925
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:18,660
The scene? A dingy and damp strip mall in a seedy rundown portion of an average American town.

926
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,660
Now, upon this block, I'll found my church.

927
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,040
Too bad there's only three stores left open.

928
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,560
I...

929
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,200
I am the Bob man, Cuckoo Cachoo.

930
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:34,600
Join the Church of the Subgenius or face bubbling, icky, cosmic space vengeance, puny ones.

931
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,660
The world ends tomorrow and you may die if you don't give up Bob his props.

932
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,980
The Church of the Subgenius offers eternal salvation or triple your money back.

933
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,420
What do you say to that?

934
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,060
Damn! No one's here yet.

935
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,160
Hey, none of the stores are even open.

936
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:52,940
Oh yeah.

937
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,920
It's Sunday.

938
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,220
Uh, guess I'll go get a chili dog and wait.

939
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:03,800
Later that day, Doug returned, his heart full of fire and his stomach churning with indigestion.

940
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,580
Okay, now this place is open and jumping with the after church crowd.

941
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,440
All right.

942
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,260
Hear ye sinners! The hour of judgment is at hand.

943
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,660
Your only hope of salvation is me and Bob.

944
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,960
And do you know how you can be saved when the saucers come?

945
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,460
Well, here's what I'm gonna do.

946
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,660
I'm gonna tell ya.

947
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,840
For just 20 bucks, that's right, 20 bucks, you'll save yourself from the end of the world.

948
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,620
That's right.

949
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,020
And if you donate now, we'll save your pet gerbil too.

950
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,680
After all, you gotta have some extra pleasure when the sex goddesses get boring.

951
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,460
Remember, just 20 bucks or triple your money back.

952
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,860
Do I hear an amen, brother?

953
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,120
Crap!

954
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,880
No one is paying any attention.

955
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,080
Uh, I'll switch to plan C.

956
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,860
Let's see, it's in my notes somewhere.

957
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,820
Uh, uh, uh, okay.

958
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:49,980
Yeah!

959
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:50,380
Ah!

960
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,120
You all burn in laser fire unless you give it up to Bob!

961
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,760
The true path to salvation is through slack and a small donation to this ministry.

962
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,840
It's all true.

963
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,900
Two weeks ago, it was a pathetic wimp, but Bob died with...

964
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,960
And now you're a pathetic crazy wimp!

965
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,160
I heard that.

966
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,080
I see you going into that dollar store.

967
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,620
You think plastic owls on your, on your lawn are, are gonna protect you when the, when the...

968
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,200
Uh, uh, when the saucers land?

969
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,360
Uh, uh, oh friends, be, be sore afraid at that which you see.

970
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,200
Uh, uh, uh, must come to pass, does come to pass because you'll be up the creek without a paddle.

971
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,980
Up your butt with a coconut!

972
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:28,900
You suck!

973
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:35,220
Uh, uh, you all wish you had a coconut up your butt when the aliens, uh, uh, um, this, this isn't working.

974
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,700
Uh, curse you, Bob, I'm closing my eyes.

975
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:41,000
And when I open them, I want a flock of followers to do my deviant bidding.

976
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,900
Praise Bob!

977
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,700
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

978
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,280
Woof!

979
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,840
Ah, nothing but a bunch of dogs.

980
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,000
Hey!

981
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,100
Hey!

982
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,520
You look kind of friendly little fella.

983
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,460
Uh, uh, eww!

984
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,460
Yuck!

985
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,980
Over my leg, just like Dad.

986
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,800
Stupid, stupid dogs!

987
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:00,540
Woof!

988
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,220
You people, you stinking zombies!

989
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,380
You normals!

990
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,240
Woof!

991
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:05,760
Ow!

992
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:13,240
That's it, I'm getting another chili dog, uh, uh, and come back after the effects of their recent religious brain spew wears off.

993
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:18,980
Returning from his nitrate-filled repast, Doug repeats his previous promise.

994
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:23,160
He's a little bit of a failure, hoping for an act of GHVH1 to change the outcome.

995
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,040
Alright.

996
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,080
One more try.

997
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,920
Hey, people!

998
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:30,920
Look here.

999
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,160
I'm trying to save you, okay?

1000
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,220
You and your stupid, pathetic souls.

1001
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:37,500
You know what it's like to boil in your own fluids for all eternity?

1002
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,320
Well, neither do I.

1003
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,120
But I'm sure it's not fun, and for a measly 20 bucks, you don't have to worry about boiling in fluids.

1004
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,340
After all, what good are fluids if you don't share them with someone else?

1005
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:47,760
Yeah.

1006
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,680
So, uh, for 40 dollars, I can let you soak in smegma with someone you love.

1007
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,020
So, so how about it?

1008
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,060
Come on, or I'll hit you with my chubby stick!

1009
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,100
Hey, mister, your fly's open.

1010
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:57,520
Huh?

1011
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,500
Timmy, get over here.

1012
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,740
That man's not right in the head.

1013
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:02,580
That's right.

1014
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,400
I'm crazy.

1015
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:03,980
Crazy.

1016
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:04,520
Mad.

1017
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,360
Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs with the power of, uh, uh, of, of, uh...

1018
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:08,940
Excuse me?

1019
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:09,460
What?

1020
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:17,100
I was just wondering how your apocalyptic message ties in with what was foretold by the prophet.

1021
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,460
Ezekiel.

1022
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,580
Uh, um, uh, uh, come again?

1023
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,240
The prophet Ezekiel.

1024
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,560
And your message today.

1025
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,840
How are they related?

1026
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,620
Um, uh, I'm not sure what you mean.

1027
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,040
Never mind, never mind.

1028
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:45,240
How does your religion correlate with the anarcho-matriarchal societies of far-off and ancient Sumatra?

1029
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,760
Um, uh, I think it's here in the stark fist.

1030
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,660
Uh, uh, hold on, hold on.

1031
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,760
Uh, uh, nope, not here.

1032
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:57,040
Uh, nope, uh, sorry, nothing about Sumatra.

1033
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,240
Lots about sex, Atlantis, and Tibet, though.

1034
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,260
Then fear for your soul, unenlightened one.

1035
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,640
I'm Jeff Smith.

1036
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,760
I bid you peace.

1037
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,180
Uh, what the hell was that all about?

1038
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:15,160
Uh, I guess I'll go get another chili dog before they close.

1039
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:15,220
Uh, I guess I'll go get another chili dog before they close.

1040
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:25,580
Doug approached the sardonically simple Pinewood fast food stand where he has been consuming beef byproducts all day under the cruel, capricious sun.

1041
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,600
Uh, one chili dog, please.

1042
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,120
Uh, with extra relish.

1043
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,300
Uh, you, uh, want onions with that, boy?

1044
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:31,980
No.

1045
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,480
How about some kraut?

1046
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,600
Uh, sour that is.

1047
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,460
No! All I want is a chili dog!

1048
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,560
Ah, it's you!

1049
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,560
What the hell are you doing here, Mr. Man in Black?

1050
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,040
It's, I say, it's my shift.

1051
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,320
Didn't you check out the sign?

1052
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,920
Not too swill of dizzy folks.

1053
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,340
Bob's Burger Barn? Wow, a franchise!

1054
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:55,100
Yup. Yet another one of the stores in Bob's multinational conglomerate. Amalgamation, that is.

1055
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,080
But that, I say, that's beside the point, boy.

1056
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,000
You, uh, you suck.

1057
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,340
Yeah, I couldn't do anything to get their, their, their stupid attention.

1058
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:08,000
Those normals just are impossible to preach to.

1059
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,080
Bullpucky, son. I can do it, boy.

1060
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,300
Mind the store while I go open up a whole can of whoopin' hot dogs.

1061
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,520
Oh, okay.

1062
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:25,040
Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock. Boring, isn't it?

1063
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,900
Later, somewhere in the Crimean, oh, uh, uh, I mean, shopping mall.

1064
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,880
Where is he? All I see is that kraut over there. Oh, here he comes!

1065
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:44,260
See, son, it's not impossible. I got $117.54 and a whole mess of coupons.

1066
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,760
Save me, Reverend! Save me!

1067
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:50,120
Yeah, but you can do it. By the way, you owe me $4.25 for mine in the shop.

1068
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,120
Okay, that's fine, son.

1069
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:55,120
I, I got confused and can't find what I'm looking for in my notes, and, and, and, you know...

1070
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:55,500
Notes?!

1071
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,900
Now, no self-respecting subgenius uses notes by hand. Well, some of them do.

1072
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,940
But, uh, hand over that paper before I ream you.

1073
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,980
Paper! Ream! Ha, ha, that's a joke, son. I'm too fast for you, boy.

1074
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,620
You're so funny, Reverend.

1075
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,580
Back off, lady. I ain't got no time for no romance right now.

1076
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,200
Listen here, son. Get yourself dirty.

1077
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,120
I'll give you $13 and head on down to the book crevice.

1078
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,060
And get you a copy of the book of the subgenius. Then memorize it.

1079
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,440
And then forget it. Forget all about it.

1080
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,880
Then it'll be imprinted on your subconscious mind, and that's all the notes you're ever gonna need, son.

1081
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,240
But, but I don't have $13, and you still owe me that $4.25.

1082
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,120
All right. Here's your $4.25 out of that. Uh, will you take, uh, ca-cappuccino coupons?

1083
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:37,800
Teeth. Teeth. Uh, sorry, I ain't got no teeth right now. Lady, you got any teeth?

1084
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,000
Reverend, let me get you...

1085
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,060
Uh, here's a gold tooth there for you, son.

1086
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,660
That's a tip. Thanks. I can give it back to Dad.

1087
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,680
All right. Uh, I'll tell you what.

1088
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,180
Get the rest of the money, and you get out there for Bob's sake, and you preach for your supper.

1089
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,520
You got that? Get out there. Get this flock.

1090
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,740
Yeah! Yeah! Get out there and preach.

1091
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,960
Give your money to the Church of the Subgenius, or, or, or, or me.

1092
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:05,120
Mell it, you stinking sinners. Uh, here comes Dougie.

1093
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,360
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha. Drop your purse. You're, you're done.

1094
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,980
Tune in next week for the next exciting episode of...

1095
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,540
the continuing story we are forced to call...

1096
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,600
A Pink Boy Comes to Bob-a-lon.

1097
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:19,420
Same Bob time, same Bob station.

1098
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:28,020
Oh, man. Well, like I say, friends, I don't know what to think about this, uh, Pink Boy Goes to Bob-a-lon thing.

1099
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:34,740
It's, it's so beautifully written, and yet so subgeniously performed.

1100
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,440
You know what I mean, yeah?

1101
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,800
Yes, and, uh...

1102
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,800
I'm just 18 and I haven't got a worry.

1103
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,660
They tell me get a job, but I figure what's the hurry?

1104
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,960
I got three square meals and my roof is partly made for work.

1105
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,760
I got a car, a PCR, well, you know I'll probably get more.

1106
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,120
I'm living at home with my parents.

1107
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,820
I really like it here.

1108
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,360
I got a free ride.

1109
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,060
I'm living at home with my parents.

1110
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,820
I really like it here.

1111
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,000
I'm living at home with my parents.

1112
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,480
Because I couldn't make it outside.

1113
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,400
I just don't care where my parents get the money.

1114
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,920
They say I'm good.

1115
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,360
I know someday, well, I'll be kind of funny.

1116
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,320
Because I know all I need is a little piece of plastic.

1117
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:55,240
But when they say you've got to work, now isn't that a little drastic?

1118
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,740
Because I'm living for my parents.

1119
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,460
I really like it here.

1120
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,700
Living for my parents.

1121
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,960
I've got to be right.

1122
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:05,700
Living for my parents.

1123
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,440
I really like it here.

1124
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,500
Living for my parents.

1125
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,180
Because I couldn't make it outside.

1126
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,100
I really like it here.

1127
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,780
I've been losing them.

1128
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:15,880
My brain's going dead.

1129
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,360
Well, I'll just stay in bed all day long.

1130
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,540
And make up a solo.

1131
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,060
A really cool solo.

1132
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,220
A rock band can play in this song.

1133
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,720
Lower lip hangers.

1134
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,000
Noудard Walk story where I like of learning more than get long.

00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,700
I love you.

1140
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,080
I'm living on my own now because I couldn't make it outside.

1141
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:46,800
I'm living on my own now because I couldn't make it outside.

1142
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,540
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1143
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,320
Living at Home with My Parents by Dr. Bizarro there.

1144
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:00,980
And before that, of course, a little bit of KPFA.

1145
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,740
Oh, no, there wasn't.

1146
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:07,340
It was just A Pink Boy Goes to Babylon by John Ling

1147
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:12,680
and his friends don't know much more about that particular one

1148
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:18,420
and have conflicting feelings about it, but yet we share it with you.

1149
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:24,160
We did hear some KPFA Berkeley subgenius show

1150
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,960
with Dr. Howland puzzling evidence as usual.

1151
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,740
And friends, you are, as usual, listening to the subgenius radio ministry

1152
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:37,100
Hour of Slack broadcast here from Dallas, Texas,

1153
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,000
by the Church of the Subgenius.

1154
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:44,300
And if you want to write for some free information regarding...

1155
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,260
Yeah, here it is.

1156
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,140
You got that pencil ready?

1157
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,640
You can get the free catalog by writing to...

1158
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:02,800
Bob at Post Office Box 140306.

1159
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,080
That's Bob at Box 140306.

1160
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,580
In Dallas, Texas.

1161
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,580
Beautiful Dallas, Texas.

1162
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,540
Zip code 75214.

1163
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:24,460
And it's slick, it's groovy, and it's sick,

1164
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:27,200
and it's groovy, and...

1165
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,900
It prays, Bob.

1166
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,040
And it's drowsy, and it's drippy.

1167
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,040


1168
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,040


1169
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,040


1170
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,040


1171
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,040


1172
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,040


1173
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,040


1174
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,600
They hung up.

1175
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,900
What a hangup they had.

1176
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:48,060
They never wanted to go all the way down there into Dobstown.

1177
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:50,180
You've heard about Dobstown, haven't you, son?

1178
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,180
Yeah, I got off the boat in Dobstown to get some mangoes.

1179
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,300
They call it subgenius land.

1180
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,740
Right, that's right.

1181
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,740
Yeah, that's right.

1182
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,360
Where the mangoes grow in the mangrove groves.

1183
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,680
And the sap is thick and green.

1184
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,360
It drips down the trees.

1185
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:06,620
Okay.

1186
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:13,680
that you can smell it in the breeze and the air never smelt more clean as you walk in the sand

1187
