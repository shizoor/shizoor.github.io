00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:02,600
Apes Ma

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,880
Your cage is too dirty, Apes Ma

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,080
Remember when you were young

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,920
And you used to break out of your cage

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,040
Well you know, you're not strong enough to do that anymore now

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,460
You're not strong enough to do that anymore now

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:26,800
Apes Ma

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,700
And the little girl that named you years ago has died now

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,160
The little girl that named you years ago has died now

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,280
Remember when she named you and it was in the paper?

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,260
Apes Ma

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,980
Remember when she named you?

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,960
Apes Ma

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,180
And it was in the paper?

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,140
Apes Ma

16
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,340
You're eating too much

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,380
You're going to the bathroom too much

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,280
You're eating too much

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,620
And Apes Ma

20
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,980
And you're going to the bathroom too much

21
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,180
Your cage isn't getting any bigger

22
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,280
Your cage isn't getting any bigger, Apes Ma

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,900
And Apes Ma

24
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,100
Your cage isn't getting any bigger, Apes Ma

25
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,380
And Apes Ma

26
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,400
And Apes Ma

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,920
And Apes Ma

28
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,780
And Apes Ma

29
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,120
And Apes Ma

30
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,400
From PR News in Washington

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,760
I'm playing it safe for the first time in 17 years

32
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,260
Secretary of State John Kerry is working to get one for the first time in 17 years

33
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,400
the record books. PR reports the U.S. is seeking his extradition to face charges in California.

34
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,040
He's also suspected of being a top assassin in a group of hitmen who call themselves PR News.

35
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,940
Kerry said, we are working for many years too long. John Kerry may be unraveling.

36
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,420
The blast shook the blast, though NATO says it's still investigating whether the incident was a

37
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:28,060
hostile PR News or an accident. These are the bone-chilling numbers 15, 31, 25, 74, one half.

38
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:34,860
Ted Cruz reportedly said today that lawyers, said Cruz, says has been fully focused on fighting

39
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,140
Texans' interests. A group of nuns at a Spanish convent got an unexpected phone call from Pope

40
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:46,380
Francis who wished them a happy new year. Francis had to leave a message in which he says, this is PR News.

41
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,300
The

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,500
old pope horse was just pulling through and a man wore a pig leg forever.

43
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,500
I'm on the run with a hobo from here, brings a filthy chatter.

44
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,060
Oh, I don't care.

45
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,640
No place there and I don't think it even matters.

46
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,700
My skin's blazing through and my clothes in tatters.

47
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,580
And the railroads look like Hawaii at the hill of letters.

48
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,120
One shoe fell on the gravel, one stick pulled down.

49
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,480
A ray of age fell down on a pair of ears.

50
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
And you go shine through my whole watch pocket.

51
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,780
Oh, I don't care.

52
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm on the run with a hobo from here, brings a filthy chatter.

53
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,400


54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,400


55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,400


56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,400


57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,400


58
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,800
Sing em girl, baby girl, pass me by in tears.

59
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,840
Jack rabbit raised his folded ears.

60
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,600
A beautiful sagebrushed jack rabbit.

61
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,560
An oriole sang like an orange, his breast to the worms.

62
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,520
And his tail caught evening like a hammer.

63
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,620
And his wings took to air like a bomber.

64
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,400
Oh, I don't care.

65
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:20,400


66
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:20,400


67
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,220
nehmen

68
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,300
And it rained on O- κ

69
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,640
And my rain can't cost me a cup of water

70
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,260
He was home like I could be love

71
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,020
When I got into town I was just mad

72
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,900
I'm the roundhouse man

73
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,960
I'm the roundhouse man

74
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,640
I once was your father

75
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,120
I was thegressed��

76
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,720
I'm thegressed there

77
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:47,720


78
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,700
All wooden candy improvement

79
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,380
Uh-oh Woo

80
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:50,380


81
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,520
I love it, read a sign, Payless Parker

82
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,620
Knickers twisted around, under a fly, a youngster cocked her eye

83
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,680
Got me for me if I'm not crazy, it's my daughter

84
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,980
Come little one, little, little, little finger, give me one

85
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,580
And I'll buy you a cherry phosphate

86
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,540
Take you down to the home line in water

87
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,820
No little one's hit on the goddess, but a cold, awful tale

88
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,560
That comes with the way your peg legs stutter

89
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Oh shank, I'd buy a high hat beaver mug

90
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,080
And a mustache man, an entire friend

91
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,320
Woke up in vomit and beer and a banana bin

92
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,400
And a soft glass with brown skin

93
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,500
47 babies with napping black eyes

94
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,440
And beautiful lefty skin

95
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,500
And here it is, I'm with you, my daughter

96
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,360
30 years away can make a seaman's eyes

97
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,000
A roundhouse man's eyes go out

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,500
It's all water, it's all water

99
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:33,500
quienes ovat

100
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:56,480


101
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:56,480


102
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,820
We'll be right back.

103
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Now don't be a fool. One of you could survive.

104
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,400
If you f*** well, the living kill me.

105
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,880
I won't kill you.

106
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,780
I'll just f*** you a bit.

107
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,100
I understand.

108
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,440
F*** is often ugly.

109
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,340
But to torture men.

110
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,600
Is this what your master f*** demands as worship?

111
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,020
These cells are very old.

112
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,340
A hundred years ago,

113
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,480
an ancestor of mine tortured over 600 men, women and children.

114
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,320
The god of hate.

115
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,340
Yes, of reality, of truth.

116
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,100
But I don't want to learn.

117
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,840
I'm afraid.

118
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,900
Can't you understand?

119
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,980
I want to help save your soul so you can join me in the glories of...

120
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,180
Mom.

121
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,800
No, never.

122
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,020
The way is not easy, I know.

123
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,000
But I will take you by the hand.

124
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,620
And lead you through the cruel light,

125
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,300
into the velvet dark.

126
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,480
THE CAMEL WERE A NIGHTY

127
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,380
IN THE PARTY OF SPECIAL THINGS TO DO

128
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:52,840
R strictly++

129
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,480
When the sick winds blow, the flag don't wiggle

130
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,380
In the party of special things to do

131
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,400
I met the ace of love

132
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,600
He took me to his plantation

133
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,440
For the love without separation

134
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,480
In the party of special things to do

135
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,500
Special things to do

136
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
It could happen to me

137
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,540
It could happen to you

138
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,520
I met the ace of love

139
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,820
He said I want you to go to a party of special things to do

140
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,060
Special things to do

141
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,560
Oh yeah

142
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,000
And when you're through

143
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,800
I'll be here waiting for you

144
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,980
He'll take these sparks

145
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,380
So that my distant cousins will get along with you

146
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:48,940
Oh

147
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,580
Watch out for the mirror man

148
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,300
And elixir too

149
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,180
When I got to the party of special things to do

150
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,820
It wasn't hard to find elixir too

151
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,120
I met all the cards

152
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,940
The wild cards

153
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,280
The one-eyed jill

154
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,800
The red queen

155
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,380
She turned her head

156
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,040
You know what I mean

157
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,300
She turned her back and said

158
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,780
I got a brand new game

159
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,620
I want to lay on you

160
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,100
Oh

161
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,900
I met them all

162
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,580
At the party of special things to do

163
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,360
When I wasn't done

164
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,880
I was far from through

165
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,380
I returned to the ace of love

166
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,940
Now I'm with you

167
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,220
I met them all

168
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,140
I met them all

169
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,820
I met them all

170
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,240
At the party of special things to do

171
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,220
Special things to do

172
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,340
The camel wore a nighting

173
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,640
At the party of special things to do

174
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,180
Special things to do

175
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,080
Special things to do

176
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,720
At the party of special things to do

177
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,040
I met Alexa Sue

178
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,560
I met the mirror man

179
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,840
I met the wild cards

180
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,740
I met them all

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,180
I met them all

182
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,180
I met them all

183
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,280
I met them all

184
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,100
I met them all

185
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,060
At the party of special things to do

186
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,140
Special things to do

187
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,020
Oh yeah

188
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,880
Oh yeah

189
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,220
Oh yeah

190
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,480
Oh yeah

191
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:41,980
Oh yeah

192
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,560
Oh yeah

193
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,140
Oh yeah

194
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,140


195
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,080
Oh yeah

196
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,160
Oh yeah

197
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,900
Oh yeah

198
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,760
Oh yeah

199
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,140
Oh yeah

200
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,100
Oh yeah

201
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:04,920
Oh yeah

202
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,220
Oh yeah

203
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,440
Oh yeah

204
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:10,440


205
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:10,440


206
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:10,440


207
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:10,440


208
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,780
Oh yeah

209
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:14,880
Oh yeah

210
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:14,980
Oh yeah

211
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:14,980


212
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:14,980


213
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:14,980


214
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:14,980


215
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:14,980


216
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:14,980


217
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:14,980


218
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,160
Oh yeah

219
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,160


220
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,160


221
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,160


222
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,160


223
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,160


224
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,160


225
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,160


226
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,160


227
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,320
The party of special things to do

228
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,680
performed by

229
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,220
Esra Mohawk.

230
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,500
It's Captain Beefheart's song, of course.

231
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,260
A lot of us old-timer subgeniuses

232
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,460
would admit we owe the Captain Beefheart a lot.

233
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,700
Before that, well, there was collage by Reverend Exister.

234
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,580
We heard King of Siam doing the Captain Beefheart song

235
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,520
Orange Claw Hammer.

236
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,040
Because here's what happened, friends.

237
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,580
I was doing a lot of subgenius recording sorting.

238
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,140
And I found a home-burned CD yesterday

239
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,840
bearing only the unmistakable scrawl of puzzling evidence

240
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,780
with the phrase,

241
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,020
Philly women sing Captain Beefheart.

242
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,740
He must have handed me that at some point in years past.

243
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,720
In fact, it's from 2005.

244
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,860
I thought, great, he didn't even write

245
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,660
the actual title.

246
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,180
The album.

247
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,340
So I googled Philly women sing Captain Beefheart.

248
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,680
And that's the title.

249
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,740
Actually, the title is

250
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,120
Mama Kangaroo Philly women sing Captain Beefheart.

251
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,800
And it's great.

252
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,480
I've got some more of those songs ready to go.

253
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,600
But I wanted to mention some other stuff

254
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,840
before we get going on that.

255
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,360
Princess Wee and I watched a non-Imax copy

256
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,880
of a movie last night.

257
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,640
It was something called

258
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,240
IMAX Undersea,

259
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,600
which was a great documentary

260
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,180
with the fabulous psychedelic footage

261
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,740
of unearthly sea monsters

262
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,240
that live around coral reefs,

263
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,240
like stonefish and frogfish and stuff.

264
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,940
Things that make the ugliest monster hunter monster

265
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,860
look cute.

266
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,400
But of course, the movie had that same sad ending

267
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,920
that all great documentaries about the sea

268
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,360
have these days,

269
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:43,620
which is, of course,

270
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,980
that the acid and carbon dioxide we've drummed up

271
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,000
is about to screw everything, us included.

272
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,900
And probably whether we do anything about it or not,

273
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,260
because it's already too late.

274
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,560
And when everybody in Asia has a car,

275
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,880
and well, that's when everybody everywhere

276
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,600
will start to slowly starve to death

277
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,900
and nothing in the world is going to stop that

278
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,180
la-li-la-la-la.

279
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,320
So it's a good thing we believe

280
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,840
the next day is almost here, right?

281
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,320
Incidentally, I have dibs on the Great Barrier Reef

282
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,620
or whatever is left of it.

283
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,800
By this July.

284
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,260
And have I mentioned on this show

285
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,280
that I have dibs on Death Valley, too?

286
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,580
Because believe it or not,

287
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,220
Death Valley, even Death Valley,

288
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,880
is starting to die

289
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,040
because of the crap from nearby Las Vegas.

290
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,040
The usual acid rain and such

291
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,380
killing the sensitive cryobacteria and whatnot

292
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,580
that holds the sand from blowing around

293
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,680
and turning the whole area into the Gobi Desert

294
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,980
like the Chinese let happen.

295
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,480
Oh, well.

296
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,260
Easy come, easy go.

297
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,340
Right, humans?

298
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,800
Let's all go down to Goblin Valley State Park in Utah

299
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,840
and knock down any rocks we see

300
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,640
that have thinner waistlines than we do.

301
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,760
As you can see, I sometimes lose my sense of humor

302
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,180
when I start hugging and raping trees.

303
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,160
I'm a tree raper, see?

304
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,560
I'm worried about these kind of things.

305
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,460
I was reading an article about

306
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,980
climate change in the news,

307
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,260
and of course I read the Yahoo comments,

308
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,280
which I am going to read one or two of.

309
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,900
Now, however,

310
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,840
and this is something I don't always see,

311
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,020
I do a lot of research on my fellow Americans

312
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,280
by reading what some of them,

313
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,380
the ones with the spare time to do this,

314
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,280
write at the end of news articles

315
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,040
to give their expert opinions.

316
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:51,440
Well, I saw about five stupidly funny comments

317
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,540
that they were each posted like five times

318
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,960
by five different people

319
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,340
before I stopped looking.

320
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,800
So it was kind of interesting,

321
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,980
but here's one of them.

322
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,740
I should put on different music for this.

323
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,220
Here's some Hawaiian slap guitar.

324
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,100
Corbin Critics is a load of garbage

325
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,540
and America knows it.

326
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,240
It's all about politics.

327
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,920
It has nothing to do with science.

328
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,100
They want you to think the earth is overpopulated.

329
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,420
This is not true.

330
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,380
All caps.

331
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,900
Seven billion people standing side by side

332
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,540
can fit in a city the size of Jacksonville, Florida.

333
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,060
So that means this whole world's population

334
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,860
can fit in one state,

335
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,820
if need it be.

336
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,200
The same people pushing climate change

337
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,840
is the same people doing the polluting.

338
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,180
They want the carbon credit scam to pass

339
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,340
because they will make billions,

340
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,360
if not more,

341
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,240
off the regular people like you and me.

342
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,800
Actually, buddy,

343
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
I think you're assuming a bit much there.

344
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,540
That means you will have to pay more

345
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,060
on electric and gas bills and other bills.

346
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,500
Also making carbon dioxide,

347
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,780
the major factor in climate change,

348
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,620
is outright stupid.

349
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,320
If anything,

350
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,720
carbon dioxide encourages plant growth.

351
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,280
Humans breathe in O2

352
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,020
and breathe out CO2,

353
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,340
while plants breathe in,

354
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,200
breath in our CO2

355
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,180
and breath out O2.

356
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,740
God's design.

357
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,080
All natural synergy systems.

358
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,780
Must be his word for the day.

359
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,380
Just like the moon and the earth.

360
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,140
Our earth being just at the right angle

361
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,100
and the right distance from the sun.

362
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,840
There's,

363
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,700
there are millions of other synergy factors

364
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,660
that allow life to exist on earth.

365
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,920
But I guess I am just crazy

366
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,800
and life is all just random

367
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,940
and was an accident.

368
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,460
And I would have to agree with you

369
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,200
on all three of those points, sir.

370
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,360
Here's another good one.

371
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:09,680
Yeah.

372
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,120
Oh.

373
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,300
Two more weeks and they'll come back

374
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,760
to tell us all those millions of people

375
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,240
who lost their jobs and health insurance

376
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,300
to Obamacare

377
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,340
are really victims of global warming.

378
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,080
And that the only solution is to

379
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,320
immediate confiscation of all owned firearms.

380
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,180
Well, friend, let's check back in two weeks

381
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,560
and see how that pans out.

382
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,560
I recall the same people saying

383
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,340
if Obama was re-elected,

384
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,600
that gas would be over $5 a gallon.

385
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,280
Thanks, Obama.

386
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,580
What is that?

387
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:40,860
Um.

388
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,640
To these people, friends, I guess.

389
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,960
Obama's already taken their guns

390
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,680
and masturbated to their selfies.

391
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,620
To them.

392
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,020
Oh, and speaking of selfies,

393
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,200
Princess We should be in here to talk about this,

394
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,180
but she's busy on doing something else.

395
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,020
There's a,

396
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,660
some, I would,

397
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,640
I heard tell that there was this

398
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,820
naughty subgenius Facebook page

399
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,680
of naughty body part selfies.

400
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,560
And I asked if I could see it.

401
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,900
And they let me in.

402
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,420
And now I'm really sorry.

403
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,380
Because I'm old.

404
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,860
And, um,

405
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,480
I'm not going to post any nude pictures of myself

406
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,340
taken after 1998.

407
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,840
Nothing I can do about the ones that one day,

408
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,980
that one day I went to work.

409
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,100
So, friends, whatever you do,

410
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,180
don't even think about it.

411
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,260
I will admit, the four ladies in there are really cute.

412
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,360
But the, the, the boys are,

413
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,620
if anything, too prolific.

414
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,320
And they're posting.

415
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:42,900
Thank you.

416
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,280
Someone's in the kitchen with Bob.

417
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,020
Someone's in the kitchen with Bob.

418
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,800
Someone's in the kitchen with Bob.

419
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,900
Bob's in the kitchen with Bob.

420
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,980
Bob's in the kitchen with Bob.

421
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,020
Bob's in the kitchen with Bob.

422
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,080
What'd you think?

423
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,980
Too sensationalistic?

424
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,720
Or maybe it wasn't sensationalistic enough.

425
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,000
Oh, no, not you too.

426
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,920
Did you hear it?

427
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,360
Hear what?

428
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,300
Someone's in the kitchen with Bob.

429
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:08,940
Oh.

430
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,340
You're so excited about being back there.

431
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,520
You've completely fallen under Bob's evil spell.

432
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,840
I have no idea what you're talking about.

433
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,760
All I'm doing is getting on the air

434
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,100
and giving people the straight dope about Bob.

435
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,960
The revolution will be broadcast.

436
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,180
I'll leave you to your pirate nerd radio.

437
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,300
Someone's in the kitchen with Bob.

438
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,980
Someone's in the kitchen with Bob.

439
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,840
Someone's in the kitchen with Bob.

440
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,860
Bob's in the kitchen with someone.

441
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,760
Bob's in the kitchen with someone.

442
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,200
I mean, there's a fine line between eccentricity and downright suicide.

443
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:41,500
Oops, here he goes.

444
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:41,500


445
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:41,500


446
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,000
I got the title foolhardiness.

447
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,420
No, no, I walk that line every Saturday night.

448
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,320
Bob's in the kitchen with Bob.

449
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,220
Every Saturday night.

450
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,120
Bob's in the kitchen with Bob.

451
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,980
Every Saturday night.

452
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,980
There's a fine line between

453
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,740
Bob's in the kitchen with Bob.

454
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,640
It was sensationalistic.

455
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,940
Bob's in the kitchen with Bob.

456
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,700
It was sensationalistic.

457
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,940
Did you hear it?

458
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,720
Bob's in the kitchen with Bob.

459
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,340
Hey, you's, you're so excited about being negative.

460
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,520
Hey, you's, you're so excited about being.

461
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,920
Hey, you's, you're so excited about being.

462
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,280
Hey, you's, you're so excited about being.

463
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:11,320
Hey, you's, you's so excited about someone who loves you.

464
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,260
I don't want any of those kids to have to go through that same humiliation I went through.

465
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,580
So what you're saying is...

466
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,040
Aim low.

467
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,160
Aim low.

468
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,480
That's great advice. Aim low.

469
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,520
Aim low. If I got a college diploma, you think I'd be here right now?

470
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
No, I'd be in Area 51 with Bob.

471
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,760
I wouldn't be here. I'd be back engineering alien technology.

472
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,980
I wouldn't be wasting my homemade duct tape on coffee machines and toast.

473
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,060
Whatever, dude.

474
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,020
Good day, sir.

475
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,380
I said good day, sir.

476
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,120
You know how you're talking right now?

477
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:28,840
Yes.

478
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,400
That's what I want, all right?

479
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,340
Just be yourself. Nothing more, nothing less, all right?

480
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,940
I can't just be myself.

481
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,620
Well, you're doing it right now.

482
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,540
No, I'm not.

483
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,460
This is just a character I came up with.

484
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,560
I came up with it to help me deal with you.

485
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,920
Don't you get it?

486
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,980
No one wants to know the real me.

487
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,380
Well, why not?

488
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,940
Because I'm weird.

489
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,080
You know, I worked very hard to conceal my weirdness from the world.

490
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,640
And now you just want me to unleash it on everyone.

491
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,280
Everyone is a little bit weird.

492
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,460
I collect Bob.

493
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,400
It sounds like a fun hobby.

494
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,960
And rubber Bob.

495
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,940
I put Bob on practically everything.

496
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,100
Even Bob.

497
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,760
That's an acquired taste.

498
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,740
It's hardly that weird.

499
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,820
I still have the Bob.

500
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,160
Mother knitted me when I was a baby.

501
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:15,980
Well, that's sweet.

502
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,220
And I'm wearing Bob right now.

503
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,280
Oh, man.

504
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:25,580
It turns me on when that guy says he's wearing Bob right now.

505
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:26,820
Me too.

506
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:27,840
That's weird.

507
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,480
It's creepy.

508
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,700
It's like that subgenius selfies.

509
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,240
Nude selfies.

510
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,060
Facebook thing.

511
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,060
Hey, where's my background music?

512
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,000
This, uh...

513
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:46,140
Yeah, this background music, it was another CD I found buried in my stuff.

514
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,680
I believe it's some form of Hawaiian slack key guitar.

515
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,280
That's really the name of the type of Hawaiian guitar playing.

516
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:01,000
This is by someone named Steve Bagsby in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

517
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,560
So it sounds kind of like regular old country western music, don't it?

518
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,460
But it's got Easter Island heads and it's called...

519
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,560
Easter Island heads with Devo hats.

520
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,820
Yeah, that's right.

521
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,880
Well, all the Easter Island heads originally had Devo hats.

522
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,520
Yes, I know.

523
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,020
Because they knew that Devo was right about everything.

524
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,300
Yes.

525
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,100
And everything is getting dumber.

526
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,460
What?

527
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,180
I thought that these were all going to be instrumental.

528
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,500
Me too.

529
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,420
I guess...

530
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:32,980
We were counting on that.

531
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,220
And I also thought Dave was going to be calling in any second now.

532
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,120
Yeah, where's our Dave?

533
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,320
We could be listening to...

534
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,680
Captain Beefheart Girls singing Captain Beefheart music.

535
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,520
I suppose.

536
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,140
Now, friends, I have to warn my listeners.

537
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,860
Whether Dave calls in or not,

538
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,100
you better watch out because Princess Wee is in a fighting mood.

539
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,660
She's had a bad day today.

540
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,420
And, uh...

541
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,280
Yeah.

542
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,340
I've had to explain to her things like...

543
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,940
Frozen okra is okay.

544
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,040
Doesn't mean the same thing as...

545
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:17,800
If you serve frozen okra in that soup instead of fresh, chopped, expensive, rotten okra,

546
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,820
I am going to divorce you and beat you.

547
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,080
And then divorce you again.

548
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,520
But...

549
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,300
That didn't happen.

550
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,220
I'll tell you what.

551
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,380
If that cowboy don't call in, I'm going to put that Captain Beefheart music back on.

552
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,120
There's a great version of Abba Zabba.

553
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,340
I'm getting lonesome for Dave.

554
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,280
Yeah.

555
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:38,680
Yeah.

556
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,200
What happened to him?

557
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,980
No one can know.

558
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,940
No one can know what happened to Dave.

559
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,300
No one can ever know?

560
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:51,860
No.

561
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,960
No one can ever know.

562
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,060
So I'm going to go back to track eight on this thing.

563
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,440
It's all, like, queued up.

564
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,460
And all I have...

565
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:00,580
Oh!

566
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,380
Speaking of queued up, that little cutie Dave just queued it on.

567
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,340
It's not my snout.

568
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,320
It was.

569
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,680
I was just about to play another Captain Beefheart song sung by ladies.

570
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,280
It's someone's snout.

571
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,040
But it's not mine.

572
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,180
You see...

573
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,200
How should I put this?

574
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,380
I have no real snout.

575
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,560
It's an attachment that you provided for me.

576
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,000
And I'm glad to have.

577
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,060
But yet at the same time, I'm a little bit unhappy.

578
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,620
Is it just Snipes' snout?

579
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,660
And you know why?

580
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,140
I don't know why.

581
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,760
Do you know why?

582
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,700
Why?

583
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,700
It doesn't work!

584
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,060
Your snout?

585
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,240
No.

586
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,460
It doesn't work.

587
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,660
Not worth a smiley damn.

588
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,460
If I had all the pimples in the world, I'd still be standing back and growling at her.

589
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,200
You know what I mean?

590
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,680
It's just one of those confused type of...

591
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,480
How can you put it in so many words?

592
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,600
So your old factory is not in...

593
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:07,900
Yeah.

594
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,060
Super snout.

595
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,900
Well, you've got a burnt nostril, don't you?

596
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:21,240
You were the one who told me it was the power that I would gain of all the things.

597
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,920
Your old factory became your old factory?

598
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:26,940
Yeah.

599
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,920
I can't get a damn lick of work out of these guys anymore.

600
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,860
That's no fair.

601
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,440
Can you taste anything?

602
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,480
My own urine, my friend.

603
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,600
And I could not resist saying,

604
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,600
that's because it is a known homeopathic medicine.

605
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,660
What are you talking about?

606
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,160
What?

607
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,340
Oh, we're talking about the Church of the Subgenius.

608
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,360
No.

609
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,100
The Church of the Subgenius is the antidote to all placebos.

610
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,560
What can you taste?

611
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,680
It will prevent...

612
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,940
If you had a placebo that used to do you some good, make your rheumatism quit hurting,

613
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,900
we are here to wreck that free medicine.

614
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,620
Or expensive.

615
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,440
Actually, placebos work better the more expensive they are.

616
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,600
So, Dave, I have...

617
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:08,580
We will call...

618
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,980
I've got a little vial of miracle water I could sell you

619
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,860
for more than you owe the government.

620
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,520
For more than you owe everybody.

621
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,740
I could...

622
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,720
But that special magic water...

623
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,780
Because it's been blessed by Bob.

624
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,900
Is it like Pont de Leon's Fountain of Youth?

625
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,880
Yes, it will restore your sense of smell.

626
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,920
Of course, you'll want your money back immediately when that happens.

627
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,620
Because...

628
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,400
Well, I have to buy...

629
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:38,560
You've got to...

630
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:38,560


631
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,400
You've got to miss some bad smells if your snout's not working, Dave.

632
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,860
I don't know if you really want that back.

633
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,300
Well, would I...

634
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:50,340
If I were to do it, for instance, would I need to change my cup size, my brassiere size?

635
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,900
That doesn't have anything to do with it.

636
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,240
Why would you ask a nonsensical question like that?

637
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,120
Sometimes you...

638
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,880
Sometimes...

639
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,660
I hate to say this, but every now and then, sometimes Dave doesn't make sense.

640
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,240
I know.

641
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,500
Isn't it amazing?

642
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,420
Well, it is a known fact.

643
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,340
It is a known fact.

644
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:08,540
It is a known fact.

645
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:08,540


646
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:08,540


647
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:08,540


648
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:08,540


649
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:08,540


650
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:08,540


651
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:08,540


652
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,880
It is something to factor in, at least.

653
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,580
That when your senses are at optimum, usually your breasts swell with pride.

654
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,760
Something like that.

655
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,120
That's what's missing from my life, Dave.

656
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,180
Hey, did you read the funny news article in the paper?

657
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,100
Dead air.

658
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:34,560
Did you read the funny news article in the paper that the former president, Carter, Jimmy Carter,

659
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,440
has declared that he...

660
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,020
He only...

661
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:44,840
When he wants to say something to his fellow former world leaders, he sends it through

662
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,320
the U.S. mail because he's afraid they're reading his email.

663
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,040
Carter said they're afraid they're reading his email?

664
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah, and I'd have to say, um, duh.

665
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,200
Duh?

666
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,680
You're an ex-president.

667
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,940
If anybody's email's getting read, it's going to be yours, dude.

668
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,720
If for your own good, if for nothing else.

669
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,360
Keep you from embarrassing...

670
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,660
He's 93 years old.

671
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,260
He could be kind of embarrassed.

672
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,180
He's embarrassing at this point.

673
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:16,600
And it was embarrassing for him to worry about his email and not worry about his regular snail mail.

674
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:23,500
Well, it's harder to read snail mail because you have to leave, like, claw marks on the envelope and stuff.

675
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:24,960
People are...

676
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,740
I've been reading other people's snail mail for years.

677
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,800
It was addressed to me, but anybody could have read it.

678
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,860
But this is the future, man.

679
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,600
This is now.

680
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,960
And Carter's just making a statement.

681
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,280
He's probably got enough brain.

682
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:44,900
He's got some power left to know that the NSA and these other alphabet groups are tickling his swine, so to speak.

683
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,880
They're looking for parts that don't fit or parts that fit too well.

684
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,960
You know what I mean?

685
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,780
I have...

686
00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:00,420
I downloaded a comment about that very thing, and this explains everything, okay, Dave?

687
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:08,200
This is an anonymous person blogging or leaving a message.

688
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,820
I'm at the end of that article.

689
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:25,560
And he said that all the data comments from all Yahoo News blogs goes right into the, quote, mega, unquote, computer at NSA, CIA, FBI headquarters.

690
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,000
It's all the same computer.

691
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,600
Every commenter here is then profiled.

692
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,160
When the time comes, and it, quote, will, unquote, be coming.

693
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,280
For those who are classified in the, quote,

694
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,960
red, unquote, category, and that would be everyone here.

695
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,780
You too, Dave.

696
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,660
Mm-hmm.

697
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,420
You'll be receiving a knock on your door by those ex-military men now dressed in their full battle gear,

698
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,020
pumped up on steroids and psychotropics,

699
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:57,880
armed to the teeth with a bad attitude and frothing at the mouth.

700
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,460
Not unlike this writer.

701
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,000
Their plan is simple.

702
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:08,340
Pay you a, quote, neighborly visit with the intention of sending you on a one-way trip.

703
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:08,980
To hell.

704
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,500
And there was comment to that one who said,

705
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,200
Obama has already created a hell.

706
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,820
Yeah, I mean, it's really terrible out there.

707
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,540
You know, it's just so bad because of Obama.

708
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,620
You know, the tanks are in the street and we're being marched to FEMA camps every day.

709
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,580
I look, I guess they're not coming for me today.

710
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,940
I mean, yeah, right.

711
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,600
That's what I'm worried about is Obama.

712
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,140
Yeah, right.

713
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,300
Well, now this other person says here,

714
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,940
to the POTUS, all that is good is evil.

715
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,200
And all that is evil is good.

716
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,080
That's why America is being overthrown and replaced with a socialistic dictatorship

717
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,140
in which its people cannot be trusted and must be watched.

718
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,160
That's why Granny at the airport gets a cavity scan

719
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,940
and the two good old boys in Boston was able to get it done.

720
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:04,240
Well, I would just say that if you're being asked to pay taxes and you're poor as hell

721
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,060
and you even get food stamps and they've reduced,

722
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,760
you have some kind of employment and stuff like that.

723
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,160
Well, that's your fault for being a poor.

724
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,380
This is definitely not a socialist country.

725
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,160
It isn't neo-hessian aggregate of corporate.

726
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:17,800
I'm sorry.

727
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,220
I'm sorry.

728
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,560
I'm sorry.

729
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,460
Well, Dave, that would all seem obvious to some of us,

730
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,420
but we're not hanging out in the same diner.

731
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,740
It makes me wonder if there's not many of us.

732
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,500
These old guys.

733
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,080
Oh, well, I will find out.

734
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:33,900
I don't know.

735
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,800
There's not much we can.

736
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,040
Granny does get a seat.

737
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,400
She's got a cavity scan while long-haired hippies like me just breeze through,

738
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,160
and that's true.

739
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,180
That is true.

740
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,540
Princess Wee's mom always gets.

741
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,320
Every time.

742
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,300
Yeah, they always check out Princess Wee's dangerous-looking mom.

743
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,120
And then we come breezing through fresh in from Amsterdam or Iraq or someplace,

744
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,900
and they just kind of wave you through.

745
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,900
Hey, have a good trip.

746
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,880
Yeah.

747
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,260
Okay, bye.

748
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,940
Okay, ladies.

749
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,100
Up against the wall.

750
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,140
And now it turns out.

751
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,920
And now it turns out.

752
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,720
Don't you think?

753
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,100
Huh?

754
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,900
It is funny.

755
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,560
Full body cavity search on old ladies.

756
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,740
I do think that is a fun thing to do.

757
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,500
Yeah, like move your walker aside, man.

758
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,880
Well, that's to prove that they're not being unfair to terrorists, you know.

759
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,040
Well, you got to hold them kind of like a hammerlock, you know,

760
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,600
because without the walker, they're going to flop all over the place.

761
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,700
Then they're going to resist you pulling off their clothes,

762
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,420
especially if they're wearing diapers.

763
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,480
They get mad.

764
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,040
They get mad.

765
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,580
So you got to like,

766
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,520
Oh, and they laugh at the pictures.

767
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,540
They laugh at the x-ray pictures of your sagging belly and stuff.

768
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:46,940
Yeah.

769
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,460
I mean, they really do.

770
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,260
Parts of your body on the internet like it was cheese.

771
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,400
Well, that's the part that I'm surprised I haven't seen more humorously distorted,

772
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,200
you know, slipped out x-rays from, you know,

773
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,040
the Travel Safety Association of America.

774
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,100
I mean, they're not going to be able to find that.

775
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,100


776
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:18,860
And yet my friends, the subgeniuses, have lately been voluntarily posting embarrassing pictures of their sagging bellies

777
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:23,900
on a special Facebook page that they're expecting to get taken down.

778
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,460
Yeah.

779
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,720
But they're having as much fun with it in the meantime.

780
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,040
And Dave, you're not invited and don't be.

781
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,460
I'm not going to show my flab on Facebook.

782
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,900
I was sorry that I looked.

783
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,980
I'm not even.

784
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,360
I'm facial, let alone having a flab book that I carry.

785
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,940
Well, actually, cat feather, that was well worth it.

786
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,220
But the rest of it, just, I don't know.

787
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:53,000
I don't really need to see Reverend Bruce Perry and Reverend 80 and my other friends.

788
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,140
Look, I totally understand.

789
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:55,620
That's horrible.

790
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,700
All these boys and girls have been playing together for years and years and years,

791
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,460
and they've never been able to show each other their each other's naughty bits.

792
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:04,960
Just like hands?

793
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:05,880
No.

794
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,040
They do it all the time.

795
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,980
They do it all the time at X Day.

796
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,020
They can go naked if they want.

797
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,740
But not the way that you do it today.

798
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,260
Right.

799
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,140
They have to do it on photography, and it has to be available to the NSA at all times.

800
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,540
Yes.

801
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:16,940
You've got to Photoshop it.

802
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,300
And they're having so much fun saying, here's mine.

803
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
Can I see yours?

804
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,720
I think it's great.

805
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,720
They don't want to see yours.

806
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,960
They just want to show theirs.

807
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,140
That's all there is to it.

808
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
I think it's great.

809
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,560
That was going on on the internet seven or eight years ago.

810
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,660
I'm sorry I looked.

811
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,900
Yeah, really.

812
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,680
I won't be looking again.

813
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,500
I've had the content in 20 years now.

814
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,940
Check out the new colostomy bag, baby.

815
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,880
You won't have to worry about it long.

816
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,380
They're going to get taken down.

817
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:44,860
Right.

818
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,180
So far, they're mostly young.

819
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,260
I no longer have a real aperture there, you know.

820
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,700
I don't know.

821
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,560
Now, another thing I read on the internet today was that the founding fathers created

822
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,160
the forerunner of the U.S. Postal Service to escape the prying eyes of the British colonial authorities.

823
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,400
And yet now.

824
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:15,520
Every piece of mail is photocopied so that a digital record exists of anything sent through the post office.

825
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,640
Did you know that?

826
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,100
It says right here on the internet.

827
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:25,700
Anything that is photocopied and Xeroxed on a machine also has a record made of it within the machine itself.

828
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:32,620
That includes the Xerox machines or photocopied machines at the post, you know, at the supermarket, convenience stores.

829
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,600
Right.

830
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,700
And.

831
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,560
We'll think of the content.

832
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,600
Much of the content.

833
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:43,980
You create by being a brilliant person and being really witty and cool and writing your stuff in a certain in certain places.

834
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,940
That is the property of the server.

835
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,420
And I don't mean the divine X-Bark either.

836
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,240
I'm talking about.

837
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,140
I'm in the internet server.

838
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,200
Captain Schlempe.

839
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:52,940
Yeah.

840
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,840
I will.

841
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,600
Well, you.

842
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,160
That's because you always just say, just click, just click.

843
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,580
You never read this stuff.

844
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,640
And it's not too far from the bottom.

845
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,440
Well, if you read this stuff, you'll.

846
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
Just die of fright.

847
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:16,960
But it also says here, along with not only is every time you photocopy something, there's a record made within the machine itself.

848
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:26,000
There's supposedly some time of code that is presented on the paper copy that isn't discernible to the naked eye.

849
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:31,420
Now, if it's not discernible and it's on all of our paper copies, I'm not sure why it's there.

850
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,180
But it goes on.

851
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,260
This person ties this to the.

852
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,180
Conspiracy of the stores charging everyone a dime for a paper bag.

853
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,040
Which now they're.

854
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:48,900
And in fact, it says they are getting really nitpicky and exercising their personal preferences.

855
00:39:49,040 --> 00:40:01,760
They were considering fining people one thousand dollars if a garbage collector found a plastic or glass beverage container in the garbage can instead of in the recycling can.

856
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:03,540
Huh?

857
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,500
And everyone.

858
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,360
You're talking a lot.

859
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:06,400
You're talking a lot.

860
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,420
You're talking a lot.

861
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:06,420


862
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:06,420


863
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:06,420


864
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:06,420


865
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:06,420


866
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:06,420


867
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:06,420


868
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:12,280
Most posts on YouTube will be in a concentration camp very soon.

869
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,600
That's what I read on a Yahoo post.

870
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,000
Or you did I say YouTube?

871
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,300
Same difference.

872
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,800
This guy, this other guy.

873
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,740
Now, you'll like this one, Dave, because this guy speaks for all of us.

874
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,980
When I spoke up and said, now, what do we do?

875
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,280
I was labeled as a nut burger or an ignoramus on social media.

876
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:33,620
Yes.

877
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,180
Even here on Yahoo.

878
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:42,620
What most people don't realize is this is our last chance to change our nation to a decent and enduring country.

879
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,680
God bless this country.

880
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,540
Nad the nut burgers.

881
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,020
I think God bless this country and the nut burgers.

882
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,420
And I would say that go nut burgers.

883
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,000
Go.

884
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,200
And I think it's great.

885
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,760
You know, common parlance.

886
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,480
Now, I forgot where the nut burgers.

887
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,300
I thought I invented that term.

888
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,080
And yet it's been.

889
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:05,700
It's been co-opted.

890
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,500
But yeah, that's what we are.

891
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:07,720
Right.

892
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,500
The nut burgers.

893
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,900
I thought the nut burgers were the ones you get at the veggie.

894
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,020
The veggie choice at the Greek fish fry.

895
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:22,680
If you just went to the Greek fish fry or else you wouldn't be making such a Lenten assumption.

896
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,920
Well, there's only one more.

897
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,200
And then Lent's over.

898
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:32,120
And we're not going to eat meat on Friday night like sinners.

899
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,940
Like as if we didn't even.

900
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:35,560
We don't care.

901
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,480
The soft genius does not eat meat on Friday.

902
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,740
He eats feet.

903
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,280
Another body part left nearby.

904
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,220
We devour souls on Friday.

905
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,920
The souls of feet.

906
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,760
The feet of Christian innocent children.

907
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,040
And even a few guilty little Jewish kids too.

908
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,300
Anyway.

909
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:57,920
Wait.

910
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,920
Princess, I'm glad you're back in a good mood again.

911
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,960
She was trying to butt my head off.

912
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,020
We're getting in the car tonight.

913
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:10,600
God.

914
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,000
You were saying something about how staying doesn't know how to you know what the right way with you know what.

915
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,640
I was trying to figure out what was.

916
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,120
Obviously, you don't know either.

917
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,260
Poor princess.

918
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,800
We no wonder she's so mean.

919
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:33,180
I was going to say something very, very soliloquous.

920
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:34,880
As if.

921
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,240
Go ahead.

922
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:35,500
I was talking.

923
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,440
Huh?

924
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,160
Go ahead.

925
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,060
You've got scary music on in the background.

926
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,120
She's a.

927
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,620
Well, the scary music doesn't work with the but I'll do it anyway.

928
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,080
Right.

929
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:44,620
Yeah.

930
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:44,820
Yeah.

931
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,740
She was a testy little tart.

932
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,200
Angry about something she couldn't put her finger on.

933
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,500
It looked like she had a mitts and everything.

934
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,680
So I tell them she had a check with Dr.

935
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,400
Reverie.

936
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,100
Reverie.

937
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,020
Reverie.

938
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:57,520
Reverie.

939
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:57,780
Reverie.

940
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,200
Reverie.

941
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,280


942
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,200
That's all I wanted to say right at that moment.

943
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,280
Oh, I was hoping you were.

944
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:04,560
Had.

945
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:04,660
Had.

946
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:04,880
Had.

947
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,460
Were reading off of a whole paragraph that you whipped out.

948
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,940
I thought the music worked with that perfectly.

949
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:16,560
So when you start saying the names like then I go, ah, this must be where I'm supposed

950
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,480
to turn the music up.

951
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,160
Well, don't you get those instructions too?

952
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,360
That's what it said in the radio.

953
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,260
That's what it says.

954
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,420
It does say that in the manual.

955
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:26,620
The newsletter.

956
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,360
That's where the fade goes and then up and under the swell, the music bars.

957
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,860
The mute.

958
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:33,700
The swell.

959
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,340
All the noise is in your head.

960
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,260
Oh dear.

961
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,740
This country is just fluctuating so hard.

962
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,720
It can hardly keep my.

963
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,000
I'm on the rhythm system right now.

964
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,080
I try and do two, four or five different numbers every day.

965
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:56,700
I'm working with the alchemical zip number nine now because anytime you say nine times

966
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:03,120
anything, the resulting number is nine if you add the dangling things and then they

967
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:08,280
go backwards and forwards the same repetitious way as you go up into the thousands of millions.

968
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,180
Isn't it amazing how God made it that way?

969
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:11,880
I call it the perfect number.

970
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,480
That's because God made it that way.

971
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,620
That's why it's perfect number.

972
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,060
Because God made those numbers.

973
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:18,980
It's no accident.

974
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,860
You think all that math is just an accident that people made up?

975
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,700
You think that we use base ten just because we got ten fingers and ten toes?

976
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,820
You think it's just some accident?

977
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,560
That's God's math.

978
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,820
That's what God does.

979
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,560
Because God has ten fingers, ten toes.

980
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,160
Well, wait.

981
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:40,600
That's probably true, though, because they're finding all these giant bodies right now.

982
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,680
Did you know that there's a bunch of giant bodies in Ohio?

983
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,340
I think I did hear a little.

984
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,960
Is this recent or ancient news or both?

985
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,240
It's both together.

986
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:57,740
I guess there's some books out that are actually researched that aren't just, you know, seeing yetis at every X day, you know, and stuff.

987
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,280
Right.

988
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,720
And I'm like, ooh, really, you know, man, these are some big bones.

989
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,180
Let's check them out, you know.

990
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,220
Well, what did they—

991
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:05,580
So I don't know.

992
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,260
What did they—

993
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,480
You're not just going to leave me hanging.

994
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:13,140
Somebody discovered cyclops skeletons, and you're just going to leave me this—

995
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,500
Just dangle us here?

996
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,920
In the popular mythology, there are a bunch around in northeastern Ohio.

997
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:23,200
There's one not far from—well, it's about 20 miles from where I live.

998
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,600
And I asked these people who live there, and everyone with a straight face,

999
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,120
tells me, yes, there's a grave of a giant, and they say there are other giants.

1000
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:41,220
Well, there used to be mounds and everything there, and the, you know, the Christians cut them all down when they found out Indians made them.

1001
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:44,100
They didn't—for some reason, they didn't think that's who made them.

1002
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,740
But some of these other things—

1003
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,840
Well, everybody knows Indians are the devil.

1004
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,180
Well, they must have thought they were the devil.

1005
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,840
I mean, American Indians, not—well, Indian Indians are the devil, too.

1006
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,680
Well, they're all heathens, you know.

1007
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,760
Yeah, they're all heathens, right.

1008
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,060
Especially the—

1009
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:57,400
No offense.

1010
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,740
No offense to Reverend Heathen.

1011
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,320
We're all heathens of some kind or another, but—

1012
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:05,960
But giants.

1013
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:12,400
This thing is seven feet long, and the tibia is real, real, real big, and this is, you know—

1014
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,940
Isn't God's work wonderful?

1015
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:25,000
There were giants in the earth in those days, and they lived 900 years because they breathed the pure air, and they had the Adamic diet.

1016
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,800
It wasn't all tainted by—

1017
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:28,600
Tofu.

1018
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,320
But gravity.

1019
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,760
Gravity was the thing that brought them down, finally.

1020
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,840
Well, gravity was lighter back then because Earth hadn't gained so much weight.

1021
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:42,780
It wasn't so fat, and so it didn't pull so hard, and people could grow taller.

1022
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,940
Now you notice they're all, like, falling over in Walmarts, just tipping right over in their little go-karts.

1023
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:54,060
Because when they reach for food, because they're so top-heavy, and they fall down, and they're giants.

1024
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,360
But they're giant across instead of giant.

1025
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,000
They're up.

1026
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,260
The teeth were like little bells.

1027
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,620
I'm growing more giant that way myself.

1028
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:05,360
I've been trying to exercise, but—

1029
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,760
You know, even my exercise machine actually makes fun of me.

1030
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,720
It depicts me as being asleep all the time.

1031
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:14,340
Honest.

1032
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,160
We turn on this exercise machine, and there's a little cartoon of Stang.

1033
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,540
I made the original cartoon.

1034
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,240
Handsome, studly, rock star-looking guy.

1035
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,480
Now he's this pot-bellied little figure that's, like, slumped over on his feet.

1036
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,020
All the time.

1037
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,440
Princess We exercises a lot more.

1038
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:37,000
So it shows her as looking upright and awake, but it scolds her.

1039
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,940
Too busy to exercise yesterday, We?

1040
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,600
Oh, a late night owl, are we?

1041
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,520
Have you brushed your teeth yet?

1042
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,480
Yeah, it's the nanny state extends into the computer.

1043
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,260
Well, we bought that—well, no, somebody gave us that computer.

1044
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,200
See, it's a trap.

1045
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,820
That's how I got started on that video game.

1046
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,660
And now I'm an addict.

1047
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,100
And it's because somebody gave us—

1048
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,000
Do you think that woman meant to give it to her?

1049
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,960
Did the government tell her to give it to us, that We exercise?

1050
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,820
Ah, it's all a plot, right?

1051
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,580
Knowing that I would get distracted away from my subversive church of the subgenius thing

1052
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:19,400
and concentrate on slaying of imaginary animals that only exist in pixels.

1053
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,940
And forget about it and become their easy fodder once again.

1054
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,720
That's why you become their easy fodder.

1055
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,800
Well, and again, the question—

1056
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,060
The question arises.

1057
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,080
Okay, so I'm manipulating these pixels, wasting my time.

1058
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,560
Who's wasting their time manipulating me in my para—

1059
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,920
Who's manipulating them manipulating, yeah.

1060
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:41,940
Parapixel.

1061
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:42,840
Yeah.

1062
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,720
I'm just made of three-dimensional—

1063
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,300
I think about that a lot.

1064
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,180
Except, you know, posthumously, I think, sometimes.

1065
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:55,640
But that makes me wonder, like, who's pulling the strings or the string colors that are right around here?

1066
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,780
Yeah, you can almost get—

1067
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,000
You can get religion that way.

1068
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:04,920
It's like some giant mandala bursting with crappy rays or something.

1069
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,940
Or is it more like, you know, when you don't like oatmeal when you're little,

1070
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,440
it doesn't mean that you, you know, actually committed murder or anything.

1071
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,320
And does the Big Bang—

1072
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,180
It doesn't mean you're hurting anybody.

1073
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,260
Huh?

1074
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,400
The Big Bang, okay, that proves God, right?

1075
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,760
It proves that God—

1076
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,920
God has to go to the bathroom every now and then.

1077
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:30,660
Wham!

1078
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:40,520
Suddenly, in one trillionth of a second, everything goes from a single sizeless point to an expanding mess.

1079
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:46,940
In which God made two plus two equal four instead of five.

1080
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,120
And he made the Earth at exactly the right angle.

1081
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,520
And the Moon, just the right way next to—

1082
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,740
Actually, wasn't the Moon something they think slightly—

1083
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,940
Clammed into the Earth?

1084
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:58,800
Well, look—

1085
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,700
Tore off a chunk?

1086
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:08,260
In the Velikovsky and much of the 40 and Skidoo boy that surrounded Velikovsky when they thought he was crazy and stuff,

1087
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:12,160
was that the Moon is a chunk of something else that got trapped in orbit.

1088
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,680
And is it relatively new in mankind's history?

1089
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,800
I mean, that part just blew my mind.

1090
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,740
And there's not a lot there to blow.

1091
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,980
On windy days.

1092
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,360
I'm not going to go there.

1093
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,040
Uh.

1094
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,120
Don't go there.

1095
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,560
My pappy is a Velikovsky nut.

1096
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,200
Did you know?

1097
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,040
Did I ever tell you that?

1098
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:39,160
My father, who is, like the president, a Harvard-educated lawyer—

1099
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,800
Well, he's not a—

1100
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,420
Actually, he never was a constitutional law professor.

1101
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,960
My father wasn't.

1102
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,700
He was a labor lawyer.

1103
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,020
But he was also a scientist.

1104
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,880
He still is, I should say.

1105
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,800
And he's a Velikovsky nut.

1106
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:54,880
Yeah, he is.

1107
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,300
He gets really mad.

1108
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:56,520
He's really mad.

1109
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:56,940
If I—

1110
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,500
I don't even—

1111
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,820
I'm so polite, I don't say,

1112
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,940
Well, now, pappy, I think Velikovsky's just one of them kooks.

1113
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,400
I've read the—

1114
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,640
I've skimmed those paperback books, too.

1115
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,140
Instead, I've said,

1116
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:13,240
You know, Velikovsky is not regarded highly by mainstream astronomers,

1117
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,740
which is a factual statement.

1118
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,980
Whether Velikovsky is right or wrong,

1119
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,900
he's not generally highly regarded.

1120
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,220
I might as well have said that George Washington never—

1121
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,560
chopped down that cherry tree.

1122
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,860
Actually, if I said that, my father would say,

1123
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,420
Duh.

1124
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,440
Here, let me—

1125
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,380
Here's a book of other American history that's a bunch of lies.

1126
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,060
He gave me one of those books of lies in American history.

1127
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,040
He did?

1128
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:41,600
Yeah.

1129
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,080
My own father did.

1130
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,500
And he's not—

1131
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,200
He's not exactly the same—

1132
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,240
He doesn't usually vote in the same magical system that I do.

1133
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,540
But he did have a problem when he was wearing the tinfoil hat by the swimming pool

1134
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,840
and did barbecue.

1135
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,500
Certain parts of that area.

1136
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,660
Well, it worked, though.

1137
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,320
Your thinking cap, so to speak.

1138
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,060
Well, those things work.

1139
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:06,020
I've been wearing one on and off for a long time.

1140
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,580
I never get anything beamed or—

1141
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,720
No, I don't get any extra voices in my head.

1142
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,320
Ever.

1143
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,560
But in August in Texas, it must be like a broiler cook in your brain.

1144
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,860
Well, that, sure.

1145
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:20,980
So that's what probably causes the malpractices and—

1146
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,800
What, the hot weather in the South?

1147
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,840
Do you think that—

1148
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,280
Are you one of those people who—

1149
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,300
Do you associate Southerners with ignorance and foolishness?

1150
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:34,740
Because you need to wake up and take a walk down your own street there in Ashtabula, Ohio,

1151
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,760
if you think that.

1152
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,180
No, I don't really think that.

1153
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,020
I know you don't.

1154
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,300
I'd like—

1155
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,180
I have to say that every now and then.

1156
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,560
Pappy, whip me if I don't.

1157
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,520
If I—

1158
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,840
You know, I would say it's a place with a lot better food much of the time, but not always.

1159
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:50,820
That's right.

1160
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:51,680
Well, they—

1161
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,180
Yeah, and they don't always let you have any of it.

1162
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,520
Of course not.

1163
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,340
No.

1164
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:57,620
No.

1165
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,600
No, because it's poor.

1166
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:04,680
The reason people are poor is because of their culture, the urban culture.

1167
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,540
You know what I really mean?

1168
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,120
It's because their culture.

1169
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,120
That's why they're poor.

1170
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,580
They could bring themselves up.

1171
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:22,720
Of course, with rural white people, it's not their culture that keeps them poor and downtrodden and ignorant and full of anger and hate.

1172
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,940
And taking, you know, and—

1173
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,640
Soaking up a lot more welfare than anyone else.

1174
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,380
No, that's not their culture that's the problem.

1175
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:38,620
Yeah, I don't think you should ever deep fry a peanut butter jelly sandwich and then put mayonnaise on it, you know?

1176
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,160
Hey, you're not making fun of my Elvis, are you?

1177
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,640
You can make fun of my God.

1178
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,300
You can make fun of my government, but you can't make fun of my Elvis.

1179
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,500
I thought you called him a Gog.

1180
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,720
And then I thought—

1181
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,000
You can make fun of May Gog.

1182
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,100
—in Ukraine again.

1183
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:54,840
You can make fun of Gog and May Gog.

1184
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,400
And even Tobor, which is another robot.

1185
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,840
But you can't make fun of my Elvis.

1186
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:06,300
That's something my friend Sterno heard down south in Little Rock.

1187
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,880
He heard a man say that.

1188
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,400
He said, you can make fun of my God and my flag, but don't make fun of my Elvis.

1189
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:21,240
And he also overheard the phrase, if you don't settle down now, I'm going to slap you naked and hide your clothes.

1190
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,020
Slap you naked and hide your clothes?

1191
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:24,340
I slap you.

1192
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,500
I'll slap you.

1193
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,280
If you don't settle down now, I'm going to slap you naked and hide your clothes.

1194
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,660
He heard that—overheard that in a diner.

1195
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,560
This is beautiful.

1196
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,140
See, this is why I love the earthy parts of the American language.

1197
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,920
The different ways and different parts of this land where children can be attacked by—

1198
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,100
Anything.

1199
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,860
—nearly criminal parents.

1200
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,720
And I suppose the next one was, let me get out this here belt I got.

1201
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,740
Let me show you something.

1202
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,720
The blueness of the wound cleanses the way of the evil.

1203
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,800
Go down—go over by that tree and get me a switch.

1204
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:02,880
I'm about to whoop you one.

1205
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:10,100
Hey, speaking of crazy rednecks, remember that—you know that Pastor Phillips of the Westboro Baptist Church died,

1206
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,040
and people protested at his funeral.

1207
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:17,460
Or rather, they held signs that said, we are sorry for your loss.

1208
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,720
And the funny thing is—

1209
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,640
I thought you were going to say, God hates Westboro Baptists.

1210
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,180
No, God hates facts.

1211
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,760
F-A-Q-S.

1212
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:30,380
God hates frequently asked questions.

1213
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,640
He would refer you to the fact page.

1214
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,560
That was what they were all upset about.

1215
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,620
But, yeah.

1216
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,620
Oh, my gosh, look at this.

1217
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:44,860
Dave, it's almost time for us to go, and yet, is Dr. Sinister here?

1218
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,340
Dr. Sinister is not here yet.

1219
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:52,580
No sign of the car and the remote cameras.

1220
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,660
This is when I get to say—

1221
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,520
Which is something I don't usually remember to say.

1222
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:03,840
Our friends who listen only by internet will probably get an extra ten minutes of this show, at least.

1223
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:05,620
Yeah.

1224
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:18,200
Whereas the ones—our beloved radio station friends like WREK in Atlanta and WORT in Madison and WREK in Champaign are—

1225
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:24,500
they'll have to get the short, truncated version because I've got to keep it down to an hour.

1226
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:25,960
Yeah.

1227
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,620
Sometimes I do that by removing—if it's one minute too long, I remove a PR news.

1228
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,740
But if it's a show like this where I don't know what's going on or what's happening—

1229
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:34,880
Hey!

1230
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,540
It's a strange world you're living in right now, Reverend Fang.

1231
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,940
Everywhere you look, things have changed.

1232
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,380
One little thing, a skelter.

1233
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,620
One little thing, not the way it used to be, maybe.

1234
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,800
It's a hard, hard world.

1235
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,760
A hard, hard world.

1236
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,500
Like album ownership.

1237
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,200
It's tough and rigid, like a snake.

1238
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,720
Winds around the front and back of your head and then comes back again and smiles and goes—

1239
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,200
And says—

1240
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,400
There.

1241
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,280
I said it.

1242
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,000
I did it.

1243
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:18,740
And Dave, we really—I should hang you up and just play some music now because this is what happens now.

1244
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:22,440
Or we cut to the next show depending on which station you're listening to.

1245
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,800
Yeah, because I thought you were—

1246
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,640
You're supposed to do a station ID right now.

1247
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,620
I did, but I edited it out.

1248
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:32,920
But that was in the past.

1249
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,260
You said it would be in the future.

1250
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,600
Well, that's the—the future.

1251
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,640
