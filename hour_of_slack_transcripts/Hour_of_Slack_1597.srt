00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Your FBI hopes through this series of programs to enlist each of you as a volunteer in the army of women engaging in serious crimes like murder, robbery, and

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,520
THE SOUL GENIUS

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,260
POWER OF SWATCH

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:24,040
Neither your FBI, nor any local law enforcement agency, can prevent those parasites from attempting to get easy money from you, the decent citizen.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,780
Only you can do that.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,280
Do it by always following Bob.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,200
But that trick never worked!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,900
Yeah, yeah.

9
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,600
No, no, no.

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,020
Don't smell ass

11
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,260
Don't smell ass

12
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,240
Don't smell ass

13
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:20,360
That means you seethey're still doing it.

14
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,440
You hole girl is not having much time to spare!

15
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,340
IwiÄ…z

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:27,720
I tots

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,400
Died for our sins, Creation Science Polka!

18
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:27,700
The Bible says the Earth is only 6,000 years old.

19
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:37,160
Deny and Jesus Christ will roast your balls on burning coals!

20
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,480
Come on everyone, join the fun!

21
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,520
Ignorance has almost won!

22
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,460
Get geology from a nun!

23
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,080
Creation Science Polka!

24
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,460
Take your children out of school!

25
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,480
Homespun dogma is so cruel!

26
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,580
Prop them up, watch them drool!

27
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,080
Creation Science Polka!

28
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,660
Archive tickets to the

29
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:10,660


30
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,760
hab drool!

31
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,440


32
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,440


33
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,220
next to me. That's pretty good now, ain't it?

34
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,040
Thank you, the Rudy Schwartz Project

35
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,760
with that creation science polka.

36
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,160
And I'm sitting here in Tarzan's radio station

37
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,240
at Stang Ranch with Dammit the Dog

38
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,080
doing a solo show. We're jumping

39
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,160
time streams again this time. Part of the show is in the now

40
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,800
recorded in Texas.

41
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,380
And part of it is then, last July,

42
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,720
at the 21st X Day Drill, formerly known as

43
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,180
19X Day. But apparently there will be

44
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,860
a 20X Day. I'll talk about that more later.

45
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,720
But specifically,

46
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,680
I'm going to be playing an hour of slack that was done before a live audience with

47
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,840
this same Tarzan's equipment.

48
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,560
At Wisteria Campground. But without me,

49
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,100
as you'll hear, I was indisposed.

50
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,000
Instead, our hosts here

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,880
are Dr. Hal, Reverend Baby Bear, and

52
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,140
Reverend Argus Fox.

53
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,280
Tiny Shoes is the one about the...

54
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,780
Great! The Bull Dada swag is increasing

55
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,980
all the time. How beautiful!

56
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,720
How beautiful!

57
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:40,860


58
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:40,980
How beautiful!

59
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,060
If you have a beautiful piece of original artwork that you'd like to be sold to a

60
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,500
worthless subgenius...

61
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,480
Oh, it's not for sale.

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,120
Oh, pardon me.

63
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,680
That's a gift.

64
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,180
Oh, okay. I didn't realize that.

65
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,380
Pardon me. Excuse me.

66
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,140
Yeah, I put the gobble up that way.

67
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:00,680
All right. Well, yeah. Some of the swag gets snagged by the auctioneers.

68
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,880
It's the auctioneer's privilege to take all the good stuff and then sell the rest

69
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,040
to the unwitting audience participants.

70
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,160
Oops.

71
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,220
Oops.

72
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:10,720
Oops.

73
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:10,960
Oops.

74
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:18,800
I did hear that we missed a crate of stuff that fell off the truck on the way.

75
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,400
Well, I found an assortment of really interesting sticks, and I think we can...

76
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,920
Oh, no. That's even worse.

77
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,620
They're not going to hear you if you don't have a microphone.

78
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,300
Reverend Stang is saying it didn't fall off a truck. It jumped out of an aircraft.

79
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,100
He's over here with his briefcase full of money.

80
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,600
He's over here with his briefcase full of money.

81
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,140
Just drunkenly handling, you know...

82
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,120
It's disgusting.

83
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,940
...stolen $100 bills.

84
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,700
Well, not stolen.

85
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,880
Piles and piles of money.

86
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,380
Donated, of course.

87
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,900
Yes, these are charity offerings, for the greatest of these is charity.

88
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,780
Well, they're just in his possession.

89
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,420
From you to us.

90
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,720
Not saying that he stole them.

91
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,440
No, no one stole, more or less.

92
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,720
It was an archaeological find.

93
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,580
It's like those evangelical preachers that stand up and...

94
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,600
...talk about their hovercopters and jet boots and, you know...

95
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,680
I wish God would have all these things in heaven.

96
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,780
...and say, don't be jealous of me.

97
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,860
I've been blessed by the Lord, and please send me more money.

98
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,260
Yes, the Lord's going to call me unless you send me $10,000 by Thursday.

99
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,740
Praise the Lord.

100
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,060
Mm-hmm.

101
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:40,560
But how come this Lord says very explicitly somewhere else in the very explicit New Testament...

102
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,660
...that you can't take all that rich guy stuff with you?

103
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,640
That it's easier for a camel to...

104
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,320
Well, you're just not trying hard enough.

105
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:56,480
...to get squozed through the eye of a needle than it is for you, rich guy, to get into heaven.

106
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,520
Oh, here comes Stag.

107
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,420
Oh, he's coming to steal my microphone.

108
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,520
Gonna shove his orange.

109
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,200
Oh, don't dispossess.

110
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,960
Baby bear, what are you doing?

111
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,060
I'm pushing the order out of the chair.

112
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,540
According to Pappy Stag...

113
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,120
There is on the ground...

114
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,600
All right, let's hear it.

115
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:24,960
According to Pappy Stag, the eye of a needle was actually the name of a gate in Jerusalem.

116
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:31,680
And it was a narrow gate, and it was hard to get your camel through it.

117
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,960
But a rich guy could shove his goddamn camel through the eye of a needle if he pushed hard enough.

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,240
So that's all.

119
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,640
I have to say, you guys go ahead and do my goddamn job for me.

120
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,940
Well, all right, so there was a gate named the Needle in Jerusalem.

121
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,560
That's, I suppose, somewhat helpful in the ancient parable.

122
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,440
His breath smells like bar.

123
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,640
Just go lie down right over there.

124
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,780
Don't pay any attention to what that old man does.

125
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,020
Just put a sheet over him.

126
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,900
Yes, he's been roistering with his barroom companions again.

127
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,520
He's had three Dr. Peppers and an apple cider.

128
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,620
Oh, father, where are you now?

129
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,600
Smells of cigar and brandy from the sitting room.

130
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,860
Den of iniquity.

131
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,780
He's wrapping his belt around his fist.

132
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,500
Look out.

133
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,160
Oh, he's a mean old man.

134
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,600
He's on a tear.

135
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,080
He's a mean old man.

136
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,040
He's a mean dude.

137
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,120
He's a mean old man with a ponytail.

138
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,160
That's how you show him who's boss.

139
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,200
You yank it.

140
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,740
You yank his ponytail.

141
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,340
Well, you could try it.

142
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,700
Don't let me keep you back.

143
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,120
I'm not going to.

144
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,240
You can make the experiment.

145
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,460
There aren't gloves thick enough, man.

146
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,700
Wait, I thought the ponytail was gone.

147
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,760
Was that a hoax?

148
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,920
No, he's going to.

149
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,960
There, see?

150
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,060
Flogged by the cue of Stang.

151
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,900
I thought your braid was gone.

152
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,880
Oh, now he's even.

153
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,700
That was a hoax.

154
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:00,760
Oh, he won't hit the girl.

155
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,220
Flashing baby bear.

156
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,340
He won't hit the girl.

157
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,700
See, he's not a sexist old coot.

158
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,120
Boy, you get some alcohol.

159
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:10,680
He's got some alcohol in him.

160
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,960
And he gets more than licorice.

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,820
Mean old Uncle Stang.

162
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,280
Gets a little antsy in his pantsy.

163
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,860
He's just flat out nasty.

164
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,800
And that shirt that he hasn't washed since the first X-Day.

165
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:31,580
So everybody who gets the X-Day brochure gets different inserts.

166
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,080
They are randomized.

167
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,040
And you never know what you're going to get on the inside.

168
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,100
So collect them, trade them, swap them.

169
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,380
I like this family eating little lizards.

170
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,540
Yes.

171
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,560
Not the baby lizards.

172
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,220
The nuclear family eating little lizards.

173
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,040
It reminds me of the Fallout games.

174
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,080
It's pronounced nuclear.

175
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,800
Nuclear.

176
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,240
Nuclear families.

177
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,280
They're not randomized, but the particular one that baby bear got was customized.

178
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,280
By you.

179
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:00,580
By her.

180
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,480
Oh, you took all the ones with her in it and put them in.

181
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,100
No random chance here.

182
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,540
This is special.

183
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,600
There are some.

184
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,020
This is the stuff that was intended for you to see.

185
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,040
For my eyes only.

186
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,620
Princess We thought this was a good selection for you.

187
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,780
Princess We has just been crowned by Anna Mall.

188
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,940
Wow, look at that.

189
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,480
With a space tiara.

190
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,720
Flowing with a double diadem.

191
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,280
It's beautiful.

192
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:29,940
What you said.

193
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,780
It's radiant.

194
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,340
She's glowing with slack.

195
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,680
Queen of the Saucers.

196
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,380
It blocks the Nenslo rays.

197
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,380
I can feel his hate from over here.

198
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,400
It also keeps your head cool.

199
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,460
Probably not.

200
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,400
I can't imagine that standing in the sun with tinfoil on your head for a while is going to be a cooling experience.

201
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,020
My first X-Day was the robot costume party.

202
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,900
And I had, that was also the roasting, broiling hot X-Day.

203
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,940
And I had the brilliant idea of making my robot ghost costume out of one of those emergency blankets.

204
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,280
He's coming back for the microphone.

205
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:10,780
He's coming back for the microphone again.

206
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,420
Look at him, sneaking around.

207
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,220
Before he does that, I wanted to say that was a beautiful, beautiful robot costume.

208
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,040
I was roasted alive inside that thing.

209
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,360
Well, you're suffering for art.

210
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,640
It was a terrible idea.

211
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,860
It looked great.

212
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,640
It's painful.

213
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,100
And Dr. Fid Chooley has fought for his velvet painting.

214
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,700
What have we got?

215
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,600
Look, now we have some stuff.

216
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,080
Is this for the Bulldada auction?

217
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,040
Oh, I don't like that.

218
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,660
Oh, look at that.

219
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,960
I don't care for it.

220
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,100
It's quite incredible.

221
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:49,680
Fid Chooley has presented a velvet painting of what looks to be a pose of the clown.

222
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:51,560
Here.

223
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,080
Give me.

224
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,540
Easily worth hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,680
Bible man VHS tapes.

226
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,360
Okay, what are the baby bears showing now?

227
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,600
Bible man.

228
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,740
I have some Bible man VHS tapes.

229
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,120
Wow, a trooper's head?

230
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,200
Bible man tapes.

231
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,600
See if the trooper's hat fits you.

232
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,700
Silencing the gossip queen.

233
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,300
The six lies of the fibber.

234
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,560
You wouldn't want to model this, I suppose.

235
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,780
Miles Peterson was a man who had it all.

236
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,460
Wealth, status, success.

237
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,060
Still, something was lacking.

238
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,980
Then, in his darkest hour,

239
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,440
the word of a single book gave Miles Peterson the burning desire to...

240
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,360
Oh, no, God.

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,040
The Bible.

242
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,660
Yes, you can, too.

243
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,700
Great for ages nine through three and nine.

244
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,360
The book that is greater than any two-edged sword.

245
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,340
The Holy Bible.

246
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,040
Donald Trump's second favorite book, The Bible.

247
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,960
That guy kind of resembles the Joker.

248
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,360
His first being Uncle John's bathroom reader.

249
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,820
He's got green hair.

250
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,880
I wonder if this is endemic among Christians.

251
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,780
Oh, no, there's the fibbler.

252
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,200
This is the bad guy atheist who tries to make you disbelieve the Christian Bible.

253
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,700
He's got green hair, and he's the fibbler,

254
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,820
known for spreading lies and causing havoc.

255
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,260
And his target is the church kids.

256
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,120
In this episode, the fibbler's lying influence causes tremendous turmoil

257
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,960
that only Bible Man can put in order.

258
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,380
When Bible Man lands, he pounds the fibbler into jelly

259
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,840
with knowledge of God's word.

260
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,260
I actually saw Bible Man live.

261
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,500
I never heard of him.

262
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:40,500


263
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:40,500


264
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:40,500


265
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:40,500


266
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:40,500


267
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
I've never heard of him until this moment.

268
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,820
He's an incredible human being.

269
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,600
A metahuman.

270
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,100
That's what he is.

271
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,140
You can't say superhuman anymore.

272
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,940
He's a great man and an incredible Bible.

273
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,900
I met a human.

274
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,240
Because they have a bunch of category tags attached to their DNA,

275
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,820
like Tumblr posts.

276
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
And his colors are purple and yellow,

277
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,260
the spectrum's most beautiful hues.

278
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,280
We also have Radar Men from the Moon, Volume 1.

279
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,620
I remember that.

280
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,020
You can start off your collection from,

281
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,600
from Volume 1 of the series.

282
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,840
Radar Men from the Moon starred Commando Cody, right?

283
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,080
The guy who has a rocket belt suit?

284
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,400
Yes.

285
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,060
George Wallace, Commando Cody.

286
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:28,080
I'm curious as to why the fibbler appears to look sort of Jewish in this picture.

287
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,320
Whoa!

288
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,820
Does that occur to you?

289
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,540
Whoa!

290
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,540
It seems, I don't know.

291
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,960
Are they trying to say, suggest something here?

292
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,000
Dr. Howell, they're going to say things about...

293
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,200
They're going to say things about this on that internet.

294
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,460
Oh, well, I'm already double-damned by them and dipped in sheep shit.

295
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,520
We can't upset those internets there.

296
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,480
I've already been upset by me.

297
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,600
They even tried to get others angry at me.

298
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
I assume the fibbler is supposed to be like the Riddler.

299
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,800
He's like the name of something.

300
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,720
Christian Joker or something.

301
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,980
Namby Pamby invented Straw Man,

302
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,020
who they can easily defeat in their own self-contained universe.

303
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,800
Oh!

304
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,480
That's who it is.

305
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,480
It's Willie Ames.

306
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,160
It's a...

307
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,720
Willie Ames?

308
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,320
Yeah, Eight is Enough and Charles in Charge.

309
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,040
He was the kid in the Blue Lagoon who got to...

310
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Oh, yeah!

311
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,380
Willie Ames, and now he's the fibbler?

312
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,220
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

313
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:24,420
Oh, no, no, no, no.

314
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,180
He's Bible Man.

315
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,540
Oh, no, he's Bible Man.

316
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,780
No, he's moved up to the hero.

317
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,780
He was always a handsome guy, so now he's Bible Man.

318
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,320
Look at that chiseled jaw.

319
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,560
That's all that sticks out of the costume.

320
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,720
In the Batman comics, you know, the villains are always the best,

321
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,140
the best part of the show.

322
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,880
This lady looks awesome.

323
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,900
The Gossip Queen?

324
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,060
She's another villain.

325
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,420
After he stomps the fibbler, he's got to fight the Gossip Queen.

326
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,600
What does it say about her?

327
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,560
The evil bitterness beams of the Gossip Queen batter...

328
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,960
Batter Bible Man?

329
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,240
What?

330
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,220
What is this sentence trying to say?

331
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,760
Her bitterness beams batter Bible Man.

332
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,920
Battered Bible Man.

333
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
The Gossip Queen batter Bible Man.

334
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,100
And just think, if you have a VHS player,

335
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,980
you can treat yourself to these episodes.

336
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,240
Even more pointless than Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.

337
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,040
Wow, look at the swag.

338
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,600
We've got a robot without a head.

339
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,440
Like the baby bear costume.

340
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,520
And a gumball machine.

341
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,760
A baby bear costume.

342
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,560
And a specima.

343
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,300
Specima.

344
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,900
Specima.

345
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,160
Specima.

346
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,520
Misspells.

347
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,180
Spagamma.

348
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,100
I'll say.

349
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:43,700
Specima.

350
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,140
Specima.

351
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,340
Specima.

352
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,280
And another rubber stamp.

353
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,500
I'm gonna rub you out.

354
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,600
I'm gonna rub you out.

355
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,880
He's also got out some expensive frisbees.

356
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,280
Surefire selling.

357
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,480
Red Button's comedy album.

358
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,200
Oh God, the desperation.

359
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:01,700
Love Daddy.

360
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,780
And the amazing Spider-Man LP.

361
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,000
A rock comic.

362
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,240
Hey!

363
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,240
Goodness gracious.

364
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,880
That one's hot.

365
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,340
Half off.

366
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,680
Do not damage the merchandise.

367
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:11,820
Easy, Stan.

368
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,580
Control your natural exuberance.

369
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,620
Watch it, drunkie.

370
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,240
Watch him dance.

371
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,000
Here, put that...

372
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,480
Someone get his chair.

373
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,860
That vinyl album back.

374
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,840
Which record was that that flew out of it?

375
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,300
I feel it was...

376
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,180
I see the Buddha on it.

377
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,720
The Amazing Spider-Man?

378
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,260
Yeah.

379
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,280
That was Spider-Man?

380
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:31,640
Okay.

381
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,060
Well, that one comes with...

382
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,400
Does it still come with the comic book?

383
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,660
It might be worth something now.

384
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,640
I'm sure it's...

385
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,340
It's worth extra.

386
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:38,940
Now it's...

387
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,500
Because it's broken.

388
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,900
To scratch, yes.

389
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,500
Yeah.

390
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,460
So...

391
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,280
Up to several scratches.

392
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
What's that...

393
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,120
The giant stamp?

394
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:47,780
Yes.

395
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,940
It's a business unit.

396
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,820
Business unit?

397
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,060
I don't know.

398
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,400
That's just the first thing that it says.

399
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:54,500
Oh, look.

400
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,540
It comes with the comic book.

401
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,860
It's got like payment date and approvals and signatures.

402
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,980
It's all the bureaucracy that...

403
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,980
All the bureaucracy possible in one stamp.

404
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,100
Constantly fill out form after form after form at your own pace.

405
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,800
Have a...

406
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,120
Bureaucracygasm.

407
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,880
Throw your own bureaucracy party.

408
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,640
That's a Bill Griffith book.

409
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,360
I wanted to get one of those.

410
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,520
Wow.

411
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,880
Bill Griffith's new book.

412
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,660
About his mother.

413
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah.

414
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,060
And her affair with...

415
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,760
My mother's secret love affair with a famous cartoonist.

416
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,500
Who was...

417
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,860
By Bill Griffith, author of Zippy the Pinhead.

418
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,340
And...

419
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,040
I wouldn't want to give away any spoilers for that, but it's...

420
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,440
The UFO experience.

421
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,920
Really interesting story.

422
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,060
So you've read that, huh?

423
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:37,640
I have.

424
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,760
I've read some excerpts from it.

425
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,880
Uh...

426
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,600
Bill Griffith has posted several pages from it on his Facebook page.

427
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,660
My alien pin friend.

428
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,240
Did you ever read that A.E. Van Vogt story called Dear Pin Pal?

429
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,900
About a guy having correspondence with an alien.

430
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,840
And turns out to be a prisoner on an alien prison planet.

431
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,280
It sounds familiar.

432
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,840
It's quite interesting because the alien in one of his latter letters says,

433
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,980
You know what, Pin Pal?

434
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,860
We have a problem.

435
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,840
We have a process here where we can perform a brain exchange.

436
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,220
And all it requires is that we write a letter to an alien.

437
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,300
And by the time you're reading this, it'll be me reading this.

438
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,840
And you'll be in jail on planet Scander.

439
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,000
And it turns out that, yes, that did happen.

440
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:34,480
But he exchanged himself with a pathetic guy in a wheelchair who was just about to die.

441
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,360
And now as a crusty alien, he's going to live for thousands of years.

442
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:39,800
And...

443
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,300
I'm more of a gooey alien kind of guy.

444
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,120
Well, this one, he's not fully described, but he says,

445
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,480
Here, I enclose my picture.

446
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,160
Chunky metallic chap.

447
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:50,860
Eh?

448
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,660
I found a hot ticket item for subgeniuses to bid on.

449
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,500
It's a dog tag that proves that you have had your rabies vaccine.

450
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,620
And that your bark is worse than your bite.

451
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,540
And you can finally finish high school now that you've gotten your rabies vaccine.

452
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,840
It would just be really helpful.

453
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,980
That you could establish that up front.

454
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,060
You know, when you're at a party and you want to make friends.

455
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,880
Let everyone know that you're not rabid, rabid, rabid, rabid.

456
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,500
And the wonder shows in DVD.

457
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:28,520
A wonderfully delightful satanic trip down into an acid-filled pit of despair.

458
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,140
And it has a little book.

459
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,040
Which comes with DVD.

460
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,240
Yeah, yeah, physical media.

461
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,820
Does the DVD come with a book or does the book come with DVD?

462
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,740
That's a very...

463
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,320
That's a very good question.

464
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,360
You feel cheated if you had the book without the DVDs.

465
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,100
But not if you had the DVDs without the book.

466
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,520
With your own eyes.

467
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,900
I never heard of this either.

468
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,640
It's called Wondershoesen.

469
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,760
And it shows some strange characters in a shoe.

470
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,540
Well, how about that?

471
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,720
Special features.

472
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,700
Commentaries on genocide and time travel.

473
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,100
Yeah, Dino Stamatopoulos and David Cross and...

474
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,080
Extra annoying games.

475
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,540
John Lee.

476
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,640
And over an hour...

477
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,380
More of time wasting.

478
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,320
So it's an incredibly disturbing program.

479
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,920
It looks hella entertaining to me.

480
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,060
It's wonderful.

481
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,400
It's one of my favorite programs of all time.

482
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,080
Great.

483
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,280
Well, just this also is available in the Bulldada auction.

484
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,600
Oh, and we've got lewd items.

485
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,500
From Dr. Sonsomniac.

486
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,300
Is this for sale?

487
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,940
This utterly pornographic little metal thing.

488
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,400
Oh, it's articulated.

489
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,740
Oh, goodness.

490
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,880
Oh, my.

491
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,460
My delicate sensibilities.

492
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,400
It's a...

493
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,040
Oh, that's an idea.

494
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
Yeah, I should touch it.

495
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,360
Made in Taiwan, it says.

496
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,940
Those Taiwanese polluting us with their...

497
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,040
It's rather well-sculpted.

498
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,440
Look at this little fellow go.

499
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,960
Well, it's a loving...

500
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,560
He's got a little penis.

501
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,820
His little penis is...

502
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,540
It's a loving couple engaged in a loving act.

503
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,460
It's a how-to.

504
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,500
Okay.

505
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,320
This is how you do it.

506
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,900
This was just donated to us?

507
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,480
Yeah.

508
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,140
I wish...

509
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,500
Dr. Sonsomniac gave us...

510
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,740
This obscene little toy of...

511
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,840
Well, it's a couple.

512
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,280
It shows how to make a baby.

513
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,580
And I wish I had had this during the wedding last year, Reverend Fox.

514
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,360
I would have demonstrated to you and asked her how to, you know, make little yetis.

515
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,900
Obviously, you hadn't figured it out because you're not pregnant.

516
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,540
Physical demonstrations versus all of the...

517
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,280
Well, it's well-sculpted.

518
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,100
Descriptive information that was provided for hours and hours.

519
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,720
If you thought that the pen...

520
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,420
That the pen...

521
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,600
Turns upside down, the lady's clothes comes off.

522
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,480
If you thought that was amazing...

523
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:43,640
You can get those in Chinatown.

524
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,060
You will find this fascinating.

525
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,260
Yeah, this one would actually be like hardcore pornography because it's...

526
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:49,720
Yes, it is.

527
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,220
It's penetration.

528
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,840
Yeah, are you sick of all that softcore tchotchke bullcrap?

529
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,380
You can now just...

530
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,020
You can't get more explicit than this.

531
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,820
Carry it around on your keys, you know, give it to your friends to let them into your house.

532
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:07,080
It also, in the fullest of its extent, varies between intromission and cunnilingus.

533
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,180
Yeah, this is the guest key.

534
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,340
What?

535
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,900
I see you're sticking that in.

536
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,140
They won't lose this.

537
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,060
Oh.

538
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,560
What?

539
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,380
The gang needs this.

540
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,520
Okay, well, there it goes.

541
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,360
Into the...

542
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,100
I said auctioneer's privilege.

543
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,120
I'm not going to auction this because it's not only instructional for people my age,

544
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,300
it's kind of a reminder.

545
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,720
Well, look at this.

546
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,100
The power of exposure to the earth is a whimsical thing.

547
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,220
Wow, a unicycle riding...

548
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,900
What are those things called?

549
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,120
Oh, look at him teeter and totter.

550
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,380
Tiny tot...

551
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,280
Oh, he toddles along.

552
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,440
Hmm.

553
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:38,740
Child.

554
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,200
Free.

555
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,480
I'm sorry, there's no disguising that that is a representation of a bear.

556
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,100
That's a monkey.

557
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:46,420
Look, man!

558
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,440
Really?

559
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:48,840
Isn't it a monkey?

560
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,680
You think that's a monkey?

561
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,300
Okay.

562
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:50,820
Yes.

563
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,280
It doesn't look bearish to you?

564
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,740
Bears have ears up here.

565
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,800
Ah, you're right.

566
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,280
Monkeys have ears, you know, like us.

567
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,320
But his little hat prevents him...

568
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,900
Well, okay, a monkey then.

569
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,240
That was it.

570
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,080
Closest case.

571
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,220
I found another hot ticket item for subgeniuses to buy,

572
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:14,240
but this one specifically would be well suited for subgenius women.

573
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:14,740
Don't let it stand here.

574
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,040
Well, no, there was the rabies tag for subgenius men,

575
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,640
so when you go according, you know, you can prove you've got your shots.

576
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,120
This one is good for one special ride.

577
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,160
It's a token.

578
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:28,980
A ride?

579
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,600
So a subgenius lady could purchase this and then, you know, attempt to exchange it.

580
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,860
Is there a height line?

581
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,980
God, I hope so.

582
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,200
Let's not hear it.

583
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,560
I can't go there.

584
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,640
It got weird.

585
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,740
Never mind.

586
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,900
I take this joke back.

587
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,660
I'm sorry, lady.

588
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,260
We need more pipelines.

589
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,620
I was just...

590
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,680
We need a pipeline of slack right here in Wisteria.

591
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,700
We're just overflowing with it.

592
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,120
Well, if it ain't here, I don't know where it is.

593
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,240
We need to sell some of this excessive slack.

594
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,780
Right here at X-Day.

595
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,660
I don't even know what I'm wearing.

596
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,620
Look.

597
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,820
Oh, that's actually really neat.

598
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,280
Yes, it's a Canadian Scout Leader's hat.

599
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,180
Whoa, it has a wolf pin on it.

600
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,280
With like a little red tassel.

601
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:11,840
A werewolf pin?

602
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,620
It shows the Canadian werewolf.

603
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,380
It says under the wolf's face, it says, do your best.

604
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,200
It's the beloved Loop Garou of the Northwoods.

605
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,780
I am truly inspired.

606
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,300
They have little mustaches.

607
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:31,520
Well, maybe this item will be yours after the bull data auction.

608
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,120
On a full moon, Canadian werewolves enjoy poutine.

609
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,280
It kind of fits, doesn't it?

610
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,320
Fits your haid.

611
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,860
You have to pinch the crown together like the troopers wear them.

612
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,520
Yeah, a little bit of pinched crown.

613
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,700
And sit it up top your cranium.

614
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,700
Actually, it's quite big.

615
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,780
It's just sort of...

616
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,300
Hmm.

617
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,200
Well, you could line it with special liner.

618
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,000
Well, if she buys it, she has to get it in the auction first.

619
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,580
Well, I'm assuming...

620
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,500
And this is a hot item.

621
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,400
Mm-hmm.

622
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,740
This is going to go.

623
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,720
I mean, look at these people.

624
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,360
They're just salivating over it.

625
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,060
Calm down, you animals.

626
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,180
And now I've seasoned it.

627
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:13,160
I've seasoned it with baby bear lice, and I'm throwing that one in for free.

628
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,800
Well, those are so desirable that most people want to.

629
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,900
Are they head lice or pubic lice?

630
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,640
Well, the hat was on my head.

631
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,480
It's a...

632
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:24,380
Come on, now.

633
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,400
Yeah, but Fid Chooley had it on his head before you.

634
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,160
Oh, crap.

635
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:28,900
Crabs.

636
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,360
Let's not worry about that until some obvious manifestation occurs.

637
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,920
Why would I put a hat on my head that has been sitting upon Fid Chooley's head?

638
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,040
Fid Chooley has more hats than you can shake a slack stick at.

639
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,200
Enthusiasm.

640
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,820
Has it been a half an hour yet?

641
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,180
I'm tired.

642
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,780
Half an hour to what?

643
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,860
Well, you don't have to be here.

644
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,760
I want to take a nap.

645
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,720
You've been helping us, supporting us, but you can cash out any time you need.

646
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,120
Wait, no.

647
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,080
I just was giving you a hard time.

648
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,920
Bring that crazy old stang back.

649
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,060
Here comes Fid Chooley.

650
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,120
No, you're going to...

651
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,520
He'll give you the relief you need.

652
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,520
Heesh, don't say mean things about me.

653
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,520
Fid is here.

654
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,260
I didn't mean it.

655
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,600
I take it back.

656
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
He didn't bring us any frosty beverages.

657
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,900
No, I'm not going to.

658
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,560
No, I didn't...

659
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,480
How dare you ascend upon this altar and not bring us a show?

660
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,940
It's just in the spirit of raillery and humor.

661
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,280
All right, I'm getting up.

662
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,700
I just wanted to sit down.

663
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:15,820
It's humor.

664
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,720
You see how easy it is to be misunderstood.

665
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:30,080
And Baby Bear retreats to her cave to hibernate throughout the rest of this evening.

666
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:35,240
Well, thanks to Baby Bear for sitting in at this historic session.

667
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,880
A truly wonderful evening.

668
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:37,880


669
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,480
Oh, yes, give her her program.

670
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,620
Example of subgenius woman.

671
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,160
100% uber femme.

672
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,140
Baby Bear cannot be stopped in her blood-filled rampage against the humans.

673
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,180
Who would want to?

674
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,080
I'd try.

675
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,160
I know what I'd get.

676
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,540
It'd be worth it.

677
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,360
It'd be worth it every time.

678
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,980
Two sibilants, sibilants, check, check, sibilants.

679
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,760
It's so great that we're accumulating all this wonderful...

680
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,100
Bulldada auction material.

681
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:16,660
But there's still time for you to donate more if you have it and care to surprise the happy

682
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:21,040
subgeniuses with an unexpected treasure or treat.

683
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:27,000
Treasures can be found anywhere, you know, here in nature, in other people's camps, you

684
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,240
know.

685
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,540
Bring them on up.

686
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,300
A few years ago, we actually had a pair of underwear show up.

687
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,160
And I believe it was Sweets McGee's underwear.

688
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,740
And he said, you can't sell them.

689
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,060
You can't sell that.

690
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,340
And, well, I think we proved him wrong on that.

691
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,500
So he had to buy his own underwear back at, I believe, the inflated price of $6.

692
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,160
After all, Bob could sell anything.

693
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:55,060
Why can't subgeniuses who are reputedly little Bobs also sell everything?

694
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,620
Just little baby Bobs.

695
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,160
Popping their heads out of holes.

696
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,800
Nudge them gently back into those holes.

697
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,360
Lest they back out like crawdaddies and get away.

698
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,720
This is like Lullaby Man.

699
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,140
No, that's not music, I'm getting all sleepy, too.

700
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,000
What?

701
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,720
Oh yeah.

702
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,600
Oh.

703
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:15,900


704
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:16,120
.

705
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,400
.

706
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:19,760
.

707
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:19,760


708
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:19,760


709
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:19,760


710
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:19,760


711
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:19,760


712
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:19,760


713
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:19,760


714
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:19,760


715
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:19,760


716
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:19,980
.

717
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,820
.

718
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:21,840
.

719
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,040
.

720
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,640
.

721
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:22,940
.

722
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:24,920
.

723
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,640
.

724
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:27,640


725
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:27,640


726
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:27,640


727
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:27,640


728
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,820
Well, it's been a while since time began

729
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,340
But that struggle against nature

730
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,400
For some nature of his man

731
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Tectonic plate, he's meant to see perfect sand

732
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,640
Nature has the power, nature has the upper hand

733
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Nature!

734
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,020
I hate it!

735
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,740
Nature!

736
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,020
I hate it!

737
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,820
Well, the forces of nature come in many degrees

738
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,360
Maybe a forest fire, plague, or killer bees

739
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,620
Maybe an earthquake, or maybe typhoon

740
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,460
Tornadoes, volcanoes, rays of blood soon

741
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,640
Nature!

742
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,260
I hate it!

743
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:41,980
Nature!

744
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,340
I hate it!

745
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:44,700


746
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:44,700


747
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,700
Here's a baby's dioxide

748
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,200
Blue glitters

749
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,360
Wipe out a whole species

750
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,800
How does that make you feel?

751
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,560
Guard your hole in the earth

752
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,700
Feel that whole thing

753
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:07,700


754
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:07,700


755
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:07,700


756
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:07,700


757
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:07,700


758
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:13,880
These Amer aiming with primal nickname

759
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,780
Worldlines

760
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,540
The cameroved demande

761
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,100
And yet here you are

762
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,000
Your love is not to blame

763
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,480
This was all my work

764
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:29,140
The been lowered down, lowered voice

765
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:36,700
for the pain of the sordid and all black

766
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,500
Thank you.

767
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,040
Thank you.

768
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,240
Thank you.

769
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,980
Thank you.

770
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,800
Thank you.

771
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,860
Thank you.

772
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,920
Thank you.

773
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,200
I don't want to get off the stage.

774
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,500
Who told me

775
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:06,680
to get off the stage?

776
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,500
I don't want to get off the stage.

777
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,720
Am I just paranoid?

778
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,800
Nature, I hate it.

779
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,260
The great, great

780
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,000
Swinging Love Corpses tune

781
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,640
that was recorded live in St. Louis.

782
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,360
I forget where.

783
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,040
That's a great recording.

784
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,080
An unusually sincere

785
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,240
Swinging Love Corpses song.

786
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,460
Most of them, I think,

787
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,420
were probably co-written by

788
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,000
the Drummond brothers, Philo and Fink

789
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,540
and their cousin,

790
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,500
Matt, or Ray Hay,

791
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,360
I should say,

792
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,520
Dr. Ray Hay.

793
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,400
I think Nature, I Hate It

794
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,160
is more of a Dr. Ray Hay song.

795
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,340
It was him singing it.

796
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,000
And now, the news.

797
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,500
From PR News in Washington,

798
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,880
I'm the significant breakdown

799
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,020
in safety procedures.

800
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,020
The Prime Minister of Israel

801
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,680
is reporting another deadly germ.

802
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,020
Those scientists contained

803
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,240
an extremely dangerous

804
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,040
strain of flu called anthrax.

805
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,500
So there was no PR News

806
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,640
for six weeks.

807
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,520
Dr. Tom was disheartened,

808
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,520
disappointed, and angry.

809
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,460
Officials say there was no public

810
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,360
PR report for six weeks.

811
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,280
NBA star LeBron James is fuming

812
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,020
to become one of the worst players

813
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,560
in Cleveland.

814
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,220
Dow is 29-4,

815
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,520
16-40-19.

816
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,860
It's been 19 years

817
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,560
since World War II.

818
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,900
Chrysler is recalling more than

819
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,700
half a million SUVs for problems

820
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,200
with PR News in Washington.

821
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,680
Dr. Ray Hay is reporting

822
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,060
more than enough to remind

823
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:48,020
us of this surreal

824
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,020


825
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,020


826
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,960
Bridget W Dako,

827
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:48,960


828
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:48,960


829
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:48,960


830
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:48,960


831
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:48,960


832
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:48,960


833
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:48,960


834
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:48,960


835
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:48,960


836
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,800
Mullacic,

837
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,020
A Fey grinder and

838
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,040
inter Municipal

839
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,040


840
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,820
Bricht,

841
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:01,820


842
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:01,820


843
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:01,820


844
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:01,820


845
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:01,820


846
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:01,820


847
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:01,820


848
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:01,820


849
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,320
ball option

850
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,520
again too early

851
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:03,520


852
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:03,520


853
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,520
helped crowd

854
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:06,520


855
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,740
Bye-bye.

856
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,620
Bye-bye.

857
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,120
Bye-bye.

858
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,440
P-Dog, you can do anything!

859
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,420
That was the name of that tune.

860
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,520
Which is by Dr. Shoggoth.

861
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,720
We've heard

862
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,180
hollering in

863
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,220
Thorazine Urine

864
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,280
Podcrush shows

865
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,500
and playing strange instruments

866
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,480
breaking the

867
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,660
giant metal dobson.

868
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,680
We'll have

869
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,960
more X-Day recordings

870
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,700
next show, I'm sure.

871
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,620
Coming up now, though?

872
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:00,780
Hmm.

873
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,100
Could this be Reverend Jimmy Ryan?

874
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,820
We'll be right back.

875
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,560
We'll be right back.

876
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,460
We'll be right back.

877
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,300
We'll be right back.

878
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,820
We'll be right back.

879
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:37,900
We'll be right back.

880
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,780
Edited by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

881
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,800
This was published in 2006.

882
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,120
And then the

883
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,600
publisher almost immediately went out of

884
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,460
business. Then it was republished by

885
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,220
somebody else, and then they went out of business.

886
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,360
So, it's out of business, man.

887
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,160
You can find copies of this wonderful

888
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,940
book for

889
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,580
a lot of money. Some days.

890
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,400
Other days, you can find copies for a penny.

891
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,820
It's funny how

892
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,660
internet robots work.

893
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,620
Oh, before I get to reading, I wanted to mention

894
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,020
some

895
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,280
some

896
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,500
some

897
00:41:36,520 --> 00:42:06,520


898
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:13,360
but the Starwood people voted to not collide with the subgeniuses.

899
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,040
I prefer to think that they, well, they may collide

900
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,340
but then they wrap their arms around each other

901
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:23,240
and do jig-jig and have little babies, subgeniuses and pagans.

902
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,220
I've seen it happen a whole bunch of times.

903
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,660
That's how Princess Wee and I got together anyway.

904
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,840
Yeah, Starwood is July 11th through 17th.

905
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,360
I'm sure there'll be a big preaching revival or two.

906
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,200
Usually we do two shows there.

907
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:42,160
One formal on the main stage and one super psychedelic crazy one

908
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,100
inside the buffer dome with the projections.

909
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,440
And yeah.

910
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,920
Oh, and in Cleveland there's going to be a subgenius ranting

911
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,300
at the Winter Star Ball.

912
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,920
I'm not sure exactly when that's going to be.

913
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,620
It's in February.

914
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:05,340
The Reverend Baby Bear is going to be filling the space.

915
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,840
Subgenius shoes at that one.

916
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:13,940
She was going to last year, but Reverend Gooch died that day.

917
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,960
The guy that was running the festival suddenly up and died.

918
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,700
Not a good time for subgenius comedy preaching.

919
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,540
We have a couple of new videos on YouTube.

920
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,320
I have a video channel called RevStang

921
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:35,040
and the older stuff on it is intensely subgenius.

922
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,040
More recent things reflect my other interests.

923
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,100
For five years I did microbe pornography.

924
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,040
And right now I've got bug porn on RevStang YouTube channel.

925
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,760
There's a new seven minute short called

926
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,200
The Big Beautiful Bugs of Stang Ranch.

927
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,380
It's inspired by the Hellstrom Chronicle

928
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,240
and another movie called Microcosmos,

929
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,660
which are professional bug porn.

930
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,340
Great stuff.

931
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,200
It's part of a trilogy.

932
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,580
There's a second one that I just uploaded called

933
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:14,360
The Baleful Badass Bugs of Stang Ranch.

934
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,460
That's the scary one.

935
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,460
That one has scary music.

936
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,020
The Beautiful Bugs has beautiful bugs and beautiful music.

937
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,680
And yet the scary bugs are often the very same bugs.

938
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,140
They're not the same shot stuff.

939
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,900
And the last one will be the Batty Bulldada Bugs of Stang Ranch,

940
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,120
which will have Rudy Schwartz.

941
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:35,340
Bats.

942
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:35,760
Bats.

943
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:35,760


944
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,200
And the last one is the Bats Project music.

945
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,340
The scary one used Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

946
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,120
Oh, and there's also a real short one.

947
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:48,660
You can see the house where the new Mega Fist Temple Lodge

948
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,800
of the Church of the Subgenius is located.

949
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,820
It's the ninth one actually.

950
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:57,480
Of course, Philo's house or office is always a Mega Fist Temple Lodge.

951
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,840
He's fixing to move.

952
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:05,340
But you can see our facility and our helpers in a YouTube video called,

953
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:10,400
Surprise Home Invasion of Stang Ranch by Goats.

954
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,860
And of course, there's a Subgenius TV channel on Roku.

955
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:21,180
It's not called Subgenius TV channel and it's not all Subgenius.

956
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:30,300
It's called OSI 74 and it has a lot of bad film hosted by horror hosts,

957
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,700
such as Mr. Lobo.

958
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,320
And there's a show done by Mr. Lobo called,

959
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:42,420
Slizzy P. Martini of GWAR, who also hosts a great bad film.

960
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,160
So yeah, there's all that going on.

961
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:49,620
Oh, and the Slack Friday begins right after Thanksgiving.

962
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:54,420
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, you can look at subgenius.com

963
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,400
if you want to see what Slack Friday is all about.

964
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:04,400
Okay, our background music here is once again, Cyber Chump.

965
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:12,760
This one's from a, their Moment of Perfect Happiness is the name of the CD.

966
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,500
And this is CD disc two.

967
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,600
Yes, yes.

968
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:24,300
Nice ambient stuff there for reading the word of Bob, folks.

969
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,580
Yep, time to read the word of Bob.

970
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,320
Let's see, I just opened this up randomly at chapter five.

971
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,280
That would be the conspiracy,

972
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,100
the chapter about the conspiracy and about fighting the conspiracy.

973
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:44,200
And all of our book chapters open with a series of heavy quotes,

974
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:52,240
such as Nenslow, the great Nenslow in 1962 uttered,

975
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:57,620
by the time things are the way they are, it's too late to do anything about it.

976
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,700
Wow, he would have been about five and a half years old then.

977
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:11,540
As Bob said to Senator Clayton Hinckley at the 1979 subcommittee hearings,

978
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,860
you'll pry my cold dead fingers out of my other cold dead fingers.

979
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,720
And as I said, inducting initiates into Dobstown in 1986,

980
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,840
I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to, and neither are you, I hope.

981
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,300
And as Dobbs, J.R. Bob Dobbs said in 1986,

982
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:38,540
on the religious duty of annoying initiates in Dobbstown,

983
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,260
I'm an advocate of freedom from speech.

984
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,860
And as Jack Shade of the Leek News Service said,

985
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:57,240
who knows what rough beasts slouching towards rebirth in the hearts of men can do for your country.

986
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,720
If it's legal, it's not free.

987
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,280
If it's free, it's not legal.

988
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:07,100
That was Bob, 1956, at a Hollywood party.

989
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,400
And, uh, I forgot this one.

990
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,100
Question authority. Just don't question your wife.

991
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,660
Princess, we are dough, queen of all the UFOs.

992
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,080
My wife.

993
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:27,120
And in Bob's, the Bob for President campaign of 1974,

994
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,380
Bob said, I spout Jingo and I vote.

995
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,140
And there's another quote from Bob's presidential,

996
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,500
this is a new one, I'm just remembering off the top of my head.

997
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:46,120
Bob said, I'm crazy like a fox guarding the whorehouse.

998
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:51,780
He said that as part of his presidential campaign this year.

999
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:57,660
I'm crazy like the fox guarding the whorehouse.

1000
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,720
Something like that.

1001
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,300
Okay.

1002
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,100
This, the chapter now begins.

1003
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:09,200
Subgenius, subgenie us versus them.

1004
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,300
Shut up, pink boy. Stop right now!

1005
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,780
Too many would-be zealots are still laboring under the impression

1006
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,380
that this is some kind of parody of kook religions.

1007
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:28,580
While perhaps having properly grasped the full implications of the faith in Bob the FIB,

1008
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,280
some are yet preyed, all manner of misconstrued,

1009
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,620
and yet still have misconceptions about other basic subgenius doctrine.

1010
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:41,080
For instance, an otherwise ascended subgenius may understand the serious nature of,

1011
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:46,520
say, excremeditation, yet still think that the concept of acubeating

1012
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,080
is simply a joke thrown into confused conspiracy censors.

1013
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:56,540
And there's no estimating how many rogue subgeniuses still don't believe in Bob at all.

1014
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,900
So let's talk some plain, raw truth.

1015
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,780
Bob lives.

1016
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:07,420
Alien beings are all around us, watching our every move.

1017
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:12,300
There is a conspiracy of unimaginable proportions

1018
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,880
that working solely to rob you of your very abnormality.

1019
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,060
The president, any president, is a Bolshevik clone.

1020
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:27,200
Russia, nevertheless, has been taken over by demon-possessed Christians.

1021
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,260
Utter stupidity can make you rich.

1022
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,980
Boy, we've sure been seeing that one proved lightly.

1023
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:40,680
Your own evil ghost twin is standing beside you right now.

1024
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:47,300
There is a hollow earth which holds an advanced race of super-creatures and humans

1025
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,600
from before the Ice Age, long before the history of man.

1026
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,420
They have to be stopped.

1027
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:54,080
And this is just the surface, friends, the tip of the iceberg,

1028
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:59,640
one drop in the billion buckets of the blood of subgenius martyrs everywhere.

1029
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:08,520
By 1998, the real 1998, if the world itself isn't in Bob's hands,

1030
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:13,580
if a world steering committee composed entirely of subgeniuses

1031
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:17,040
isn't on hand to intercept the gifts of the angelic host from Planet X

1032
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,500
when they arise in that year,

1033
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:25,340
then there will hardly be any reason at all for the immortality drug riots

1034
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:28,320
that we know will be erupting about then,

1035
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,240
fighting and killing to get the elixir of life,

1036
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,560
and the death of longevity will hardly seem worth it.

1037
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:37,480
You won't want to live two more years, much less forever.

1038
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:44,820
Of course, this generation may be remembered as the one that didn't quite make it.

1039
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,020
We don't know whether we'll get a chance to enjoy the immortality drugs or not,

1040
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:54,900
but our children will if they don't kill each other fighting over it.

1041
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,880
For their sake, for their precious innocent pink hearts,

1042
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:08,020
subgenius must take its rightful place as the one world religion foretold in the Bible.

1043
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:16,140
For when the X's finally come up from the skies,

1044
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:21,700
the ones they transform into overmen must be subgeniuses,

1045
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:26,740
or you can kiss your sweet ass-surance of sanity goodbye.

1046
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,840
So shut up and listen!

1047
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,980
Listen and look for yourself.

1048
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:38,720
You don't even need us to translate the handwriting on the wall.

1049
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:44,620
What's going on is very grotesquely obvious to even the most subjugated idiot.

1050
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,400
Face it, it's all falling apart.

1051
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,280
The plan failed.

1052
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,760
The 60's didn't work at all.

1053
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:58,440
They were just a kind of decoy to make us think everything would get solved eventually.

1054
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,420
Sure, they made everyone hip.

1055
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,220
A lot of hornet's nests got stirred up.

1056
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:09,420
Those liberals and modernists got their turn on the soapbox.

1057
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:16,560
The almost exposed peni and jumping bosoms of the underwear-shunning hep ones

1058
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:24,440
made the more uptight normals spin around to be faced with a mirror-image anti-world of their own repressions.

1059
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,420
We had a whole new breed of moderately subjugated idiots.

1060
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,540
Long-haired people in the 70's.

1061
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:37,320
A whitewashed, promiscuous breed that reduced the boiling point of the 60's to a slow simmer.

1062
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:45,160
A simmer which, thanks to the conspiracy that had those soon-to-be disco dipshits under control from the word go,

1063
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:54,620
will soon lurch once again into a far more complicated, far less comfortable civil war between normals and abnormals.

1064
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,420
Yes, cults!

1065
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,460
Cults are breeding!

1066
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,140
Everyone is bored with being tolerant.

1067
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,100
The hate is hungry.

1068
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,320
It must be fed.

1069
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:07,800
Maybe the slackless people in the horrible grip of the conspiracy work instinct can't win,

1070
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:13,340
but by God they can sure find an outlet for resentment by seeking out a few others like them.

1071
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:22,640
A cult not necessarily of religion, but rather of work, or diet, or music, or self-help, or just hate.

1072
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,120
You can always find something to be a member.

1073
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:36,620
As long as it's a small enough and large enough group that it has not too much and yet not too little in common with the common man.

1074
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:47,360
Canned guilt over unhip sex race god thoughts can be neatly shelved by pride over doing your own thing.

1075
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:55,040
Some particular obsessive brain hobby, but that cool individuality is a big sham.

1076
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:09,020
What most people ended up with after the 60s wasn't liberation, it was just a deep personal hole burrowed for privacy during the blindly hopeful, vehemently peaceful, PG-rated reign of the healthy mediocrity.

1077
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,760
Now it's the future.

1078
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,600
Now!

1079
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:14,780
Wow.

1080
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:23,160
That was written by me in 1980 in the stark fist of removal.

1081
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,340
Magazine that we used to publish.

1082
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,360
Wow, I was kind of ahead of my time.

1083
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,260
Hmm, oh well.

1084
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:37,460
Now it's decades later and everything has deteriorated on schedule.

1085
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,000
We know the enemy far better.

1086
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,040
Here's how you recognize him.

1087
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:51,020
It's anybody who says that you must be part of their clique, or their clench, or their church, or their country, or their species, or their planet in order to have slack.

1088
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,940
Anybody that is, except us!

1089
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,740
For we alone bear the knowledge of the ultimate secret, the true truth.

1090
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:11,680
No matter our age, gender, education, weight, gullibility, or number of sex organs, or personalities, our very deepest sub-subconscious memories are shared in common.

1091
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,160
And what they collectively tell us isn't pretty.

1092
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:19,780
In fact, it's enough to make you want to turn your stomach inside out.

1093
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,560
Again!

1094
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:23,940
Wow.

1095
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:31,120
Well, I reckon we should read some more from the book of the...

1096
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,100
Well, this is the book of the subgenius.

1097
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,300
This is the one that's out of print.

1098
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,260
I'm not going to read from the book of the subgenius because that's still in print.

1099
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:49,760
And I actually still get royalty checks for that, although I've got to split them with Palmer, Freydes, and Dr. Philodrummond, and Hellswami Satellite Weavers, and Puzzling Everything.

1100
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:50,720
And I'm going to have to have a dance and...

1101
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,940
Stun that post, I'm not done with you.

1102
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,640
Yes, we'll talk about the conspiracy next time.

1103
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,060
And, uh, for now...

1104
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:00,800
This.

1105
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:49,780


1106
00:57:49,780 --> 00:58:19,780


1107
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:49,780


1108
00:58:49,780 --> 00:59:19,780


1109
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:49,780


1110
00:59:49,780 --> 01:00:19,780


1111
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:49,780


1112
01:00:49,780 --> 01:01:19,780


1113
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:46,540
