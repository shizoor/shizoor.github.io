1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Well, right now, this minute, I'm going to do something that may overthrow the entire radio business.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:12,740
I'm going to read you a commercial, but I'm not going to say a word about laboratory tests or quote you statistics or make medical claims.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,360
All I'm going to say simply and honestly is this.

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,040
Ladies and gentlemen, try, just try, the finest money can buy.

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,140
Every advanced technique and control is concentrated on the subgenius.

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,460
This hour of slack.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:29,800
Watch.

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,260
Is this an hour of slack now?

9
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,040
Should I turn this thing to manual record?

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,160
Maybe I should.

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,380
From PR News in Washington, I'm secretly awaiting secret punishment.

12
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,580
The trial has entered the secreting phase for decades.

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,320
Prosecutors say they may call 20 leaking secret witnesses.

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,600
Officials blame that 23% increase largely on the insurgency and insurgents.

15
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,380
Not the large, strong PR News stimulus.

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,020
The United Nations says Thailand's king convicted of stark stimulate says this is PR.

17
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,980
In a country that has seen a great deal of PR news.

18
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,600
And violence.

19
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:33,600
Thai official banged the king's long cock in a seaside palace, leaving only in a wheelchair.

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,100
The Dow Jones 5 9 18 36 34 16 3.

21
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,700
The nation's economy says this is PR News.

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,860
I just turned hell up.

23
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,840
Yes, it's true.

24
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,920
I'm always kind of up.

25
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,140
That hour.

26
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,580
Unlike all other hours.

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,520
Specifically distinguished.

28
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,960
I think this is where.

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,240
I'm.

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,520
I think this is OK for me.

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,300
By its slack for quality.

32
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,800
Yes.

33
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,860
The slack for sound.

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,300
And hence, given the appealing.

35
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,360
So, Ricky, the hour of slack.

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,640
Oh, yes.

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,620
The super hour of slack.

38
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,660
The time of relief.

39
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,060
And laxity.

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,840
Relaxation.

41
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,420
The opposite of coming through the airwaves.

42
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,580
Yes.

43
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,380
It's a nerd.

44
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,840
It's a flame war.

45
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,160
No, it's the hour of slug.

46
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,700
Slag.

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,240
Slag.

48
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,040
Yes.

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,860
Slag.

50
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:46,120
And so it was that J.R. Bob Dobbs did sell his remedy of slack.

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,320
Yay.

52
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,800
And prescribe it for all.

53
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,780
Even though the conspiracy might have proscribed it.

54
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,760
Who's your doctor?

55
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,580
My friend.

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,220
What kind of medicament do you want to swallow on the end of that jagged twisted pot metal spoon?

57
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,520
Conspiracy drugs or.

58
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,760
Oh, well, they killed the man.

59
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,820
The man just got here.

60
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,020
How quick they killed the conspiracy drug.

61
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,700
They killed us.

62
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,000
We're dead.

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:26,220
No, actually, we were live in front of an audience at Wisteria Campground doing hour of slack using Tarzan's radio station.

64
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,900
The one I'm using now.

65
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,200
At Wisteria Campground.

66
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,860
I said that on July 2nd, the second day of 16 X Day Trill.

67
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:51,980
And that's where we'll be for most of this show, which includes performances by Evolution Control Committee, the Mutant Mountain Boys, the Slot Rods and Reverend Dow Jones with multiple fisted tales of Connie doing Florida Man.

68
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,600
The only thing not from next day is PR news and collages.

69
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,300
By the great Lee Murr.

70
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:06,160
But now at 16 X Day Live, Andrew the Impale with a truly inspiring nerd anthem.

71
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,980
We're going to we're going to conclude the part of my my brand new stuff with a song called Sapio Sexual.

72
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:20,900
Now, as many of you know, Sapio Sexual is a person who gets off on on intelligence, somebody who digs the nerds.

73
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,780
All right.

74
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,920
Sapio Sexual, that is now.

75
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,460
There's going to be.

76
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,740
A lot of letters in this song come flying past you.

77
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,660
They are DNA sequence.

78
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,900
They're genetic code.

79
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,500
You do not need to memorize them.

80
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,620
There will not be a test.

81
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,140
All right.

82
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,880
C.T.G.A.

83
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,060
I got some fresh DNA.

84
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,700
I got it for you.

85
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,020
A.T.C.G.

86
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,380
Why don't you come get with me?

87
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,900
Got nothing better to do.

88
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,420
You're C.C.T.G.A.T.T.A.

89
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,440
C would go nice with my C.C.T.G.A.T.A.T.

90
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,060
My advice.

91
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,900
Let's get down today in a sapiosexual way.

92
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,220
What kind of girl?

93
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,220
She's a sapiosexual.

94
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,240
Yeah, I know what that means.

95
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,240
And that's hot, hot.

96
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,780
At least to her, because she digs intellectuals.

97
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,260
Yeah, she likes the geeks.

98
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,020
Well, you're new to the scene.

99
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,240
You might be kind of keen.

100
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,520
Do you know what I mean?

101
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,540
When I say I like them genes.

102
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,040
O.C.T.G.A.

103
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,080
I got some fresh DNA.

104
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,660
I got it for you.

105
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,800
A.T.C.G.

106
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,120
Why don't you come get with me?

107
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,600
Got nothing better to do.

108
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,480
You're C.C.T.G.A.T.T.A.A.C.

109
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,800
Would go nice with my C.C.T.G.A.T.A.T.

110
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,400
My advice.

111
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,100
Let's get down today in a sapiosexual way.

112
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,160
Sometimes girls take all that time to pretty up.

113
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,280
But they're just for today.

114
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,520
And it's gonna fade.

115
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,840
Some other girls, they only want to shake it up.

116
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,240
Get drunk and laid.

117
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,580
Well, that's a lie.

118
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:56,580


119
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:56,580


120
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,120
That ain't for me.

121
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,360
The woman that I seek.

122
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,700
She might be up till three.

123
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,320
But with a book of poetry.

124
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,080
And my C.C.T.A.T.

125
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,040
I got some fresh DNA.

126
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,520
I got it for you.

127
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,700
O.A.T.C.G.

128
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,860
Why don't you come get with me?

129
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,320
Got nothing better to do.

130
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,140
You're C.C.T.G.A.T.T.A.A.C.

131
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,420
Would go nice with my C.C.T.G.A.T.A.T.

132
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:17,980
My advice.

133
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,700
Let's get down today in a sapiosexual way.

134
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,600
You saw that I caught under your subtle reference.

135
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,460
To a movie that not more than 10,000 people have seen.

136
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,840
Among there and there and there.

137
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,220
Well, I know the difference.

138
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,320
So how'd you like to mix it up with me?

139
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,000
And I see.

140
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,680
If you want the kind of guy that makes you laugh.

141
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,040
Takes you by surprise.

142
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,900
And you realize.

143
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,300
He wants you because of the mind you have.

144
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,120
Now can you empathize?

145
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,720
There's no need to be scared.

146
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,800
Let's be fair.

147
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,000
We'd make a nifty pair.

148
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,440
If you have the MC.

149
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
If you have the MC.

150
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,000
For my C.C.T.G.A.T.

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,820
I got some fresh DNA.

152
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,360
I got it for you.

153
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,440
A.T.C.G.

154
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,700
Why don't you come get with me?

155
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,100
Got nothing better to do.

156
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,760
You're C.C.T.G.A.T.T.A.C.

157
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,140
Would go nice with my C.C.T.G.A.T.T.

158
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,820
C.C.T.G.A.T.T.A.T.T.

159
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,340
My advice.

160
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,560
Let's get down today.

161
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,000
In a sapiosexual way.

162
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,160
I said let's get it down today.

163
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,580
In a sapiosexual way.

164
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,960
That was Andrew D. Impale.

165
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,580
Live from the C.C.T.G.A.T.T.

166
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,540
at 60 next day.

167
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,360
And now back to our man live

168
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,400
at Wisteria.

169
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,580
Dr. Howland Owl.

170
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,640
Well we're trying but

171
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,380
unfortunately technical difficulties

172
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,480
are constraining the

173
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,000
broadcast at this point.

174
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
We are experiencing

175
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,240
descended testicle difficulties

176
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,760
with this broadcast.

177
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,060
Speak for yourself.

178
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,060
I've uh

179
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,760
I don't have as much to deal

180
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,000
with in that respect as

181
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,420
everybody.

182
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,100
You mean like Adolf Hitler and so on?

183
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,060
Jawohl.

184
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,360
Jawohl Herr Kamin.

185
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,400
We discussed the difficulty of

186
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,640
Hitler's testicles

187
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
in an earlier broadcast.

188
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,540
Yes. We don't need to cover that.

189
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,240
We're not going to come back to that

190
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
cheesy old subject this time.

191
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,860
Although sometimes it is

192
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,540
important to use the

193
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,540
flensing knife of truth

194
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,460
to separate fact from legend.

195
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,260
Well apparently the chair

196
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,440
tried to take the floor

197
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,940
but we tabled the motion.

198
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,440
It does sound kind of fuzzy

199
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,560
outside of these headphones.

200
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,180
I'm monitoring my little mini recorder.

201
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,580
How much is your own unique

202
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,920
biological auditory hookup?

203
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,300
And uh

204
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,160
it sounds like it's overmodulated or something.

205
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,300
Well there

206
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,840
can be overmodulation

207
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,020
and undermodulation but you see

208
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,960
what gets through in any case.

209
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,960
The show's already started.

210
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,660
Nobody else can hear it but uh

211
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,740
except for me.

212
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,720
As if anyone cares.

213
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,820
Even Dr. Howell can't hear it.

214
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,900
Well I lack headphones

215
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,840
but I don't lack enthusiasm

216
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,380
and uh we are here to add

217
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,820
our little widow's mite

218
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,900
to the assembled

219
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,360
riches of our broadcast monument.

220
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,960
Praise Bishop Stick who has

221
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,560
stuck with it until it was the problem was solved.

222
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,680
Neither rain nor lightning nor mud

223
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,320
could keep Stick back.

224
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,740
Rock and Stick.

225
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,360
The two basics of life friends.

226
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,800
Dr. LeGaym and Professor Chaz taught us of

227
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,940
the two basics, rock and stick.

228
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,880
Although they actually left out

229
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,880
the important third element

230
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,380
which is beasts.

231
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,060
Everything if you look around you

232
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,800
is made of either a rock

233
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,540
or a stick.

234
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,060
The structure is mostly sticks

235
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,260
but the tables and chairs are mostly

236
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,080
descendants of rocks

237
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,240
or extractions from rocks.

238
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,740
Or rotted sticks.

239
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,120
Yes, if they're sticks don't forget them.

240
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
But who is using these things?

241
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,660
Beasts are.

242
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,280
And what about a bone fishing hook?

243
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,520
That's not rock or stick, that's beasts.

244
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,620
You can get a bone of your own

245
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,540
but sure a bone fishing hook

246
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,520
would be a rock or stick.

247
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,080
I think it's a good question.

248
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,820
I'm not sure we can categorize it.

249
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,000
Here with bones we mineralize

250
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,820
and go back a little bit to our mineral origin.

251
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,600
But the upper level parasite

252
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,200
or whatever you call it

253
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,320
is feeding on the vegetable world

254
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,980
which derives from the animal world

255
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,960
and from the fourth of the ancient four elements.

256
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,580
Those being earth, air, fire and water,

257
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,420
is fire.

258
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,420
Or an energy.

259
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,860
Earth represents the solidity of matter.

260
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,120
Now it's getting really complicated.

261
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,880
Air the gaseous or vacuity of matter.

262
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,000
And water of course the fluvial element.

263
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,960
I don't know if I can memorize all this stuff Dr. Howell.

264
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,760
It was easy when it was just rock and stick.

265
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,900
Think of high school chemistry.

266
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,080
Solid, liquid and gas.

267
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,180
I know but it was like rock, stick, earth, water, fire, air.

268
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,760
And then the fire of course is the energy

269
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,640
that makes it all happen.

270
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,500
And of course we're leaving out the most important thing.

271
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,480
The most important thing of all.

272
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,840
Bob.

273
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,160
Well we were trying to.

274
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,960
Earth, water, fire, air,

275
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,980
beast, stick, rock.

276
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,240
Bob perches on top of the entire unruly mass.

277
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,100
And money.

278
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,160
Yeah well.

279
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,140
And froth.

280
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,020
Money is.

281
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,160
See it gets more and more complicated.

282
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,840
The longer you go on about it

283
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,400
the more complicated it is.

284
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,600
You're simply adding in infra designations

285
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,360
as we divide the Cretaceous into the Tyronean

286
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,320
and the Maastrichtian and so forth.

287
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,900
There we go again.

288
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,660
So you see there you are.

289
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,740
I was fine as long as it was the Cretaceous.

290
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,440
Well back when I was a kid there was only 20 dinosaurs

291
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,800
and I knew all their names.

292
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,260
Because their names and sizes were printed on the bellies.

293
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,380
Well that's what Jack T. Chick says to this day.

294
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,160
That there were only about 20 dinosaurs

295
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,540
and they all fit on Noah's Ark.

296
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,400
However even Chick would not insist that they had a ventral stamp

297
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,820
like the best plastic dinosaurs do.

298
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,060
Or a caudal stamp on which you can read the longer names.

299
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,260
What?

300
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,780
You mean those weren't on the dinosaurs themselves?

301
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,440
We have no way of knowing because that's a soft tissue

302
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,540
which did not in most cases fossilize.

303
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,980
But in recent times dinosaur skin and integument has been preserved.

304
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah that's what I thought.

305
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,240
I've seen them.

306
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,060
I've rubbed them.

307
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,420
I've felt of dinosaurs skin.

308
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,480
How can you keep from feeling them up?

309
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,240
You know it's just the temptation is overwhelming.

310
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,360
But for example

311
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,680
the small Jorah Venator.

312
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,880
A small scaly predatory runner.

313
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,540
Found several years ago.

314
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,920
They have most of the skin of this creature.

315
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,580
No feathers or any nonsense like that.

316
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,960
It is scaly.

317
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,380
And an entire Edmontosaurus has been found.

318
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,380
Which is the skin, the mummy.

319
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,320
They have it all.

320
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,700
They have the feet, the pads.

321
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,840
Where was that?

322
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,140
I recently read a book about it.

323
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,680
The Judith River.

324
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,280
You know where all that stuff comes out.

325
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,560
Well they have that great mummy trackadon

326
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,600
at the Museum of Natural History in New York.

327
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:02,820
Yes.

328
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,360
That was found by Roland T. Bird in the 1920s.

329
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,620
Have you seen the...

330
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,120
Now kids you'll be tested on this.

331
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,720
So you know you should be taking notes.

332
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,560
Oh I'm not.

333
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,700
I should be taking notes.

334
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,420
Have you been to the Los Angeles Natural History Museum since they reopened?

335
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:21,460
The Page Museum.

336
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,300
I haven't been there for years.

337
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,400
I'd love to though.

338
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,900
They've redone their dinosaur and giant mammal section.

339
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,740
It's fabulous.

340
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,780
They've got a mummy dinosaur.

341
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,160
There's a little section where you can feel the skin.

342
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,860
Well it's not the skin.

343
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,040
It's a rock impression.

344
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,280
That's right.

345
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,340
It's either an impression, a fossil endocast, or the fossilized skin itself.

346
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,840
I got so turned on thinking,

347
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,700
Oh yeah I'm going to get the feel of a dinosaur.

348
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,280
But then you get there and it's just a mummy.

349
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,640
It's a mold.

350
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,820
It's probably not even the real thing.

351
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,180
It's just a mold of the mold.

352
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,760
The pattern is one hexagonal bump.

353
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,300
It's not really a scale.

354
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,020
But it's a bump surrounded by six hexagonal bumps.

355
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,920
And there it is.

356
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,840
But in many cases, since dinosaurs tend to be gnarly,

357
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:17,980
these central bumps are replaced by osteoderms which project from the skin.

358
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,220
And a lot of them have that.

359
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,580
In fact maybe all of them.

360
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:30,160
But not the osteoderms found in crocodilians, such as alligators and crocodiles.

361
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:36,820
Those actually are attachments for muscles which help the creature lift its body off the ground.

362
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
Believe it or not.

363
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,900
I only recently found this out.

364
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,420
Their skin was a muscle?

365
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,260
The osteoderm has muscle attachment on the inside.

366
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,420
They're not just ornaments, bosses,

367
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,040
that protrude from the skin.

368
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,460
They're anchor points for additional muscles

369
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:02,020
which help lift the whole heavy, trundling body up off the ground.

370
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,100
So they can do what they call the high walk or the high run.

371
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,060
That's what I'm missing.

372
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,860
I'm missing that part of my integument.

373
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,740
Prehistoric crocodile, Dinosuchus, formerly called Phobosuchus riograndis,

374
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,220
had those damn osteoderms and did the high walk.

375
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,640
As it burst out of the water, being an ambush predator,

376
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,460
to gobble up entire dinosaurs.

377
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,760
And almost caught that poor Australian guy that narrates all those dinosaur, chased by dinosaurs.

378
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,180
Yeah, I didn't see that episode.

379
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,560
Oh my gosh, I'm being chased by this gigantic, enormous crocodile.

380
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,780
Let's see if we can get a good close up of his mouth as he claps down on my leg.

381
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,120
Yes, exactly.

382
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,780
Oh my gosh.

383
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,720
Oh, that hurts, but why look at those fine teeth, eh?

384
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,920
Did you see that guy? He picks up the giant scorpion and it's whipping around and trying to get him.

385
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,920
Now this is really an extraordinary specimen and we're going to make sure...

386
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,180
And then he does manage to get stuck.

387
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,640
Oh, I do believe he's killed me.

388
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,580
Yeah.

389
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,480
Uh, when dinosaurs ruled the hour of slack.

390
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,280
Well, it's just the beginning.

391
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:18,760
A primitive beginning, as you will, from which we can advance into remote, dim and rough.

392
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,920
And frightening futurity.

393
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,040
Yeah, the future. There's not much of it left, is there, Dr. Howe?

394
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,160
Yes, it's true.

395
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,240
For them. For those others who are outside.

396
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,520
Then it becomes an eschatological problem.

397
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,800
Like what lies outside the universe, for example?

398
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,020
What came before and after the beginning and end of time?

399
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,320
What mean little future will there be?

400
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:48,640
What insignificant puff of less than vapor a million times attenuated?

401
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:55,220
Instead of the nice, solid reality we enjoy now and will right up to the moment of the rupture.

402
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,240
What is reality?

403
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,600
Well, we'll know it when it's gone.

404
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,340
Right.

405
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,760
Just as if the atmosphere were suddenly whisked away, you would be aware of it.

406
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,300
And isn't that the way slack is?

407
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,080
You go, I don't know what slack is. All of a sudden...

408
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,420
Slack's all that keeps you going.

409
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,640
Something goes wrong, your back goes out. You can't get a good night's sleep because you've got a bad back.

410
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,620
And all of a sudden you know in your heart what slack is.

411
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,360
What?

412
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,740
You are buoyed up by slack.

413
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,360
And should it suddenly disappear, you would plummet to earth.

414
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,600
Spiritually, metaphorically, and probably actually as well.

415
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:43,680
You know, Cotton Mather said in his Magnalia Christiana that the only reason we don't immediately fall down to hell for all our sins is that God is holding us up.

416
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,620
But at any time, he could just get tired of it and let go.

417
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:55,420
And down we would slither through the ground, rocketing and thumping past stones and roots and end up in the fiery, eternal regions.

418
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:01,100
Simply because God, for one instant, had withdrawn his infinite charity.

419
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:06,420
Now, without believing this malarkey, one can certainly see what he was aiming at.

420
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:13,460
The truth shrouded in credulity, superstition, and fanaticism is that slack holds you up.

421
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,160
Dr. Howell, I'd like to make a confession.

422
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,100
Uh-oh.

423
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:23,540
Dr. When I was 16, all my buddies were taking this drug called LSD.

424
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,500
How many times, my boy? Oh, it's drugs you're talking about.

425
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:35,920
Dr. Yeah, LSD. And they would take LSD and go to football practice or take your SATs on LSD.

426
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:44,100
But I, the first time I tried it, I had that same problem that the theologians were talking about.

427
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,140
I realized this is not a good thing.

428
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,140


429
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,000
It's a heroic dose. It was a lot more than it probably was supposed to be.

430
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,280
It was like the kind that you read about in anti-drug pamphlets.

431
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:04,220
And I thought, honestly felt, viscerally, that I was God and had been responsible for the entire creation this whole time.

432
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,860
Dr. So, it's all your fault.

433
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:12,240
Dr. But it was kind of a dream. And the acid had caused me to wake up.

434
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,140
And I couldn't concentrate on holding the reality down.

435
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,140


436
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,000
And I couldn't get it together anymore.

437
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,840
And I was afraid I'd never get that dream going again.

438
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,200
And I'd let everybody down, including myself.

439
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:30,540
And I was just tumbling through a mental outer space, out of control for what seemed like an eternity.

440
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,520
Dr. Momentary qualm. But once the acid wore off, you could put the universe back together.

441
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,960
Dr. Once the acid wore off, I kind of went, wow, I had no idea the moody blues were so good.

442
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
Until now.

443
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,820
Dr. And those blacklight posters, they were throbbing.

444
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,740
Dr. Yeah, they looked like animated GIFs, which hadn't even been invented yet.

445
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,560
Yes, that's probably why they were.

446
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,980
Dr. Yeah.

447
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:11,940
And so we sit here now with our clocks and watches ticking down to either a crisis or an orgasmic release of infinite freedom.

448
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,920
Dr. Why not both?

449
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:18,860
Well, I'm dichotomizing here just for the sake of rhetoric.

450
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,100
It has to be both and even more.

451
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,280
All this training, that's what it comes down to.

452
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,280
So what it means is this?

453
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,360
That you've finally had the speed to hit them all.

454
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:02,460
It's a little hard to say exactly what it's worth, but here's how we StrOod it.

455
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:02,540
Dr. This is mega, super amazing.

456
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:02,540


457
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:02,600
Dr. Are you out of your mind or what?

458
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:04,660
Dr. Titan start nobody.

459
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,300
Dr. Museum.

460
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,300
Dr. Deere Cartel.

461
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,540
Dr. Chiropractor.

462
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,320
Dr. I can't stop 꽂ning this despite his numbers and how far ever he's come in science.

463
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,320


464
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,900
Dr. A week.

465
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:22,720
I have been the butt of your low-hanging jokes for as far back as I can remember.

466
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,440
But I gotta admit that ain't too far.

467
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:46,440
Between the bad salts, booze, and blunt force trauma, about the only thing that sticks to my head anymore is the pillow.

468
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:59,420
And some macaroni and cheese, sometimes, when I'm stabbing my brother over dinner.

469
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,420
And I'm stabbing my brother over dinner.

470
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:09,020
When beer is your coffee, life takes on dimensions that mere muggles can't begin to grok.

471
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:24,420
And when the zombies attack, you throw bricks or raw chunks of truffled concrete.

472
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,660
Whatever you got on hand works, but you can't do nothing.

473
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:44,760
And when you live like me, it's better to forget that your wife collected money for your dead sons while they were still alive.

474
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,660
And tried to bite your dick off when you was too tired for relations.

475
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,000
And I got seven friends a day.

476
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,380
Dying from prescription overdose.

477
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,900
And I got a hundred thousand brothers rotting right now in prison.

478
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:23,120
I stabbed a Bears fan in the spur of the moment and shot my own damn self bowling on a Tuesday night.

479
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,760
I got caught masturbating.

480
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,240
On a public boat ramp.

481
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,380
On a public boat ramp.

482
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:34,380


483
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,160
What I'm trying to say is that if you've been through what I've been through,

484
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,620
you'd get a beer while fleeing cops too.

485
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,760
Because you know it'd be a while before your next one.

486
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:46,840
You dig?

487
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,200
And if you ever let the booze wear off,

488
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,720
and the memories catch up,

489
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,960
you'll catch a hangover that could kill that skunk ape that I saw that night.

490
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,220
Trying to rape that alligator out behind my tool shed.

491
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,940
And you can't hear about me without smirking in your silent dare, but for the grace of God, go on.

492
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,860
And I don't begrudge you your chuckles.

493
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,240
Or each is just as we was created.

494
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,380
But don't act like you don't envy me.

495
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,320
My name brings them to their knees.

496
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,680
Killing from Glengarry, Disconnectic.

497
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,460
St. Paul to San Tropez.

498
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:49,220
I got 400 million hits on Google and 108,000 followers on Twitter.

499
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,480
Watch me come up and I'll be bigger than anonymous.

500
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,540
But I want you to know my name.

501
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,320
I am Florida Man.

502
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,140
I will get a blow job from a hooker with my toddler in the car.

503
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,940
And I will throw eggs at the courthouse.

504
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,800
I will sometimes be attacked by alligators while fleeing police.

505
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,780
I will often be found butt naked.

506
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,440
In the wrong person's house or apartment.

507
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,760
Or on the wrong side of the road proposing to a dead pit bull.

508
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,440
Or making love to it.

509
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,980
And I love my little cock shaped state that you can't take your greedy little eyes off.

510
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,260
We were born in the fountain of youth and washed in the blood of conquest.

511
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,280
Ravished by mad raving pirates.

512
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,180
And stolen from the Seminole.

513
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,120
Plundered by capitalist greed.

514
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:06,360
And nurtured to maturity by drug cartels in the space race.

515
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,580
And now mocked by tourists.

516
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,940
The voice of my land screams freedom through a police gag shackled to a stone.

517
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,440
And if you're too scared to push it to the edge, how can you feel superior when I fall off?

518
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,160
You rely on God's grace to keep you out of danger because you can't handle this hot wedge kitchen.

519
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,100
Like a caged canary laughing at a raging wild turkey.

520
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:43,380
You hold your manhood cheap while I speak.

521
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:51,380
And I'll leave you with the words tattooed across my neck.

522
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,020
Only God can judge this soul.

523
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,660
And yes I know I spell judge wrong.

524
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,180
Just go ahead and do that math yourself because I am Florida Man.

525
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,700
And I will chew your fucking face off.

526
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,160
Get up for Dow Jones.

527
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,080
Get up for Dow Jones.

528
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,080


529
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,660
Get up for Dow Jones.

530
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:35,660


531
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:35,660


532
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:35,660


533
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:35,660


534
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:35,660


535
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:35,660


536
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:35,660


537
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:41,840
Yes friends, that was Reverend Dow Jones delivering his autobiography Florida Man.

538
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:51,360
Backed up by Reverend Angry Larry, Bishop Stick, Suntz Bashaw, Reverend Bad Vibes, Dr. Design Flaw, Robin Mountainboy and possibly other uncountable men.

539
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:51,360


540
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:51,360


541
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:58,500
Fisted Tales of Connie, the band that exists only at Next Day. The music in the background,

542
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:06,680
in fact, is that same band. Now we cut back to exterior day, a medium shot of Reverend Stang at

543
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:13,340
his homemade studio on a picnic table in a cafe displaying a stack of hand-labeled CDs.

544
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:19,860
Look at our wonderful background music we've got available to us. It's audible to you,

545
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,720
but to me, I hear nothing. Really? I thought we were getting it over the speakers. No,

546
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,980
another one of your hallucinations. There's nothing on right now. Oh, okay. I was playing.

547
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:34,700
I often hear it when it's not playing. It's hard to tell. It's loud and echoey when I take the

548
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:41,680
headphones off. I was playing Petra Hayden, or Haden, however it's pronounced, singing movie

549
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:48,180
soundtracks a cappella. Have you heard those? An a cappella fella? No, I hadn't heard. That's

550
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:48,640
something.

551
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,480
But I'm glad they can do it. I can do it, so I'm not surprised they can do it.

552
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,440
Here, I can put on some good old-fashioned subgenius divival preaching music.

553
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,700
Subgenius divival preaching music. It's like an oompa band or something.

554
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:12,040
At the beginning, it has my old entrance theme, if it'll play. I don't use it anymore because...

555
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:19,460
You don't wrestle anymore? No, I quit wrestling, and also the use of this particular background

556
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:19,840
music... You are a wrestler. I'm not a wrestler. You are a wrestler. I'm not a wrestler. I'm not a wrestler. I'm not a wrestler.

557
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:19,840


558
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:25,020
became a terrible cliche. He wrestles with the death angel. Well it was a Darth

559
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:31,280
Vader theme. Like Jacob. It looks like this old old copy isn't gonna cooperate with

560
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,740
my... When we play the Darth Vader theme at my show in San Francisco it means

561
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,480
K-Rob should be delivered a beer immediately. Oh really? Yeah that's the

562
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,700
association I know. It feels so good for to have somebody introduce you as if you

563
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:50,220
were important and then hear that Darth Vader music playing when you walk out

564
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:55,340
on stage. You can do that if you want. Confidence, but like I say it became... Okay

565
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:00,040
that was good for about a year after Empire Strikes Back but then everybody

566
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:07,540
had a VHS of it and it was like that the suspect Zarathustra, it became a cartoon

567
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,660
shorthand for evil and it's like comedy. Evil really? Just

568
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,660
ruthlessness. Yeah you know when you see that. It's a

569
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:22,420
march. The big sheriff, the fat sheriff pulls you over in the movies, yeah, but have a quick

570
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:30,060
clip of the Darth Vader theme. You know, we have a sort of a Spanish-Latino festival in San Francisco's

571
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:36,140
mission district called Carnival, and they have a parade, and I saw this year that

572
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:43,100
limping down the street, a sad little bedraggled band, and they were playing the Darth Vader

573
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:51,800
theme as they marched hesitantly along. On kussus? No, on the instruments, not too well in tune,

574
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:57,980
you know, the drum sometimes off, the slide trombone sometimes wouldn't sustain the note,

575
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,500
but still, actually that version, I wish I had a recording of that. There was something

576
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:09,860
really inspiring about it. Not bad. The Darth Vader theme on kussus. It's a march.

577
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,340
Now that... They're marching along.

578
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,520
They're marching along. They're playing it. Who among ye has a kussu?

579
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:24,600
There they are with kussus. See? And a comb and tissue paper will do work, too.

580
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:32,960
We can, when we march down to the swamp to burn the effigy of J.R. Bob Dodds,

581
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,620
playing the Darth Vader march on kussus.

582
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,280
Well, there are all sorts of marches and funeral marches we could play. We don't have to

583
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,080
advertise.

584
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,680
We don't have to advertise the products of George Lucas out here if we don't want to.

585
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,260
John Philip Sousa would be good.

586
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,780
Well, what about the Bride of Frankenstein?

587
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,620
Nobody knows that.

588
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,060
They won't know it if you never play it.

589
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,180
It's the third cut on this CD, but I'm saving this for the wedding.

590
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,600
Oh, wait, we're not having a wedding this year.

591
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,380
This is our...

592
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,900
Dr. Howell mixed this assembly into a wedding theme for...

593
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,120
Nicky and Bob a couple years ago.

594
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,960
It is true. I did.

595
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,780
Yeah, Bride of Frankenstein, Conan the Barbarian.

596
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,220
I just thought what I would want at my wedding.

597
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,460
Right. I noticed you skipped over Halloween.

598
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:26,920
Yeah, well...

599
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,700
And went straight to Jurassic Park.

600
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,960
Well, of course. That's where my heart lies.

601
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,000
Every day is Halloween for a subgenius.

602
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,040
Jurassic Park is a mean dinosaur.

603
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,900
My son overheard that.

604
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,420
He did?

605
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,260
Yes. Well, he knew better.

606
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,260
He knew exactly what the names of all the dinosaurs were that appeared in that.

607
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,180
In fact, he...

608
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,780
That's good.

609
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,600
It's what...

610
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,300
That movie is what turned him into a filmmaker and a paleontologist.

611
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,800
Well, then it did some good.

612
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,020
And let's remember that Phil Tippett did the animatics on that.

613
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,340
Praise Phil Tippett.

614
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:11,160
He's about the greatest stop-motion guy now living.

615
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:11,680
Yeah.

616
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,680
Yeah.

617
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:12,700
Yeah.

618
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,080
Yeah.

619
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,080


620
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,080


621
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,080


622
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,080


623
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,080


624
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,080


625
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,080


626
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,080


627
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,080


628
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,180
Yeah.

629
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,320
And the greatest scene, I think most people would agree,

630
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,720
is the attack of the walkers in Empire Strikes Back.

631
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,360
A wonderful sustained scene, which is entirely done in stop-motion,

632
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,740
with no computer animation whatsoever.

633
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,920
Are you sure about that, Dr. Al?

634
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,360
Absolutely.

635
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,220
I can't think those things...

636
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,700
Feats were on...

637
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,420
Oh, go-motion rods.

638
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,100
Go-motion.

639
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,820
And manually they'd go in and tweak.

640
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,020
But it still requires a human animator...

641
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,100
A human animator...

642
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,080
...to run the ambience...

643
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,360
Computer.

644
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:48,660
...to say, Tippett, Dutra, others animated those things.

645
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,840
Some of them had go-motion rods.

646
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,080
But, you know, with machines, as with insects,

647
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,380
a slight stutter of motion seen from the clarity,

648
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,540
the strobing of individual frames in succession,

649
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,820
is not inappropriate.

650
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,920
It's only when you're trying to animate a squirrel,

651
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,460
like Ray Harryhausen did.

652
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,140
That really did not work.

653
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,180
Because everybody knows what a squirrel looks like.

654
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,380
I think the squirrel...

655
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,280
It's hard to animate a dog or a baboon or a squirrel.

656
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,360
The elephant-sized squirrel was convincing as an elephant-sized squirrel.

657
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,140
It made a strange sound, which disconcerted even Harryhausen.

658
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,140
That whistling squeal.

659
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,660
But, of course, if we were tiny,

660
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,760
maybe a squirrel would make such a sound and we would hear it.

661
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,280
From NPR News in Washington, I'm shocked at the news.

662
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,960
Speaking through a translator, Mr. Obama,

663
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,340
says he has been censoring the news media.

664
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,620
Uh, uh, and, uh...

665
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,200
Mr. Obama cited what he called

666
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,580
the extraordinary and complex PR news,

667
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,060
which has talked about Washington.

668
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,220
There is no solution.

669
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,940
And that table is too old people to burn or to ship.

670
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,660
They were horrible.

671
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,300
Obama also thanks PR News.

672
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,500
All right, we need our dancing girls.

673
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,320
And listen, no dudes in dresses, okay?

674
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,220
All right, good night.

675
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,660
Because I will check to see if there's, uh...

676
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,220
Ha ha ha.

677
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,120
Ha ha ha.

678
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,120


679
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,120


680
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,120


681
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,120


682
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,120


683
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,120


684
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,120


685
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,120


686
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,120


687
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,120


688
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,120


689
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,120


690
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,120


691
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,880
Meat and two veg.

692
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,440
Ha, yeah, uh, well, if you, uh...

693
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,320
There might be a dress shop in, uh, in downtown, uh...

694
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,980
Wherever we are.

695
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,500
Ohio.

696
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,900
In downtown Ohio.

697
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,660
Are we in downtown Ohio?

698
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,580
I just know that this place right here exists

699
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,380
and it's a long way from Detroit.

700
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,180
All right, where are the slat rods?

701
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,140
All right.

702
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,520
All right.

703
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,020
All right.

704
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,100
All right.

705
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:40,980
All right.

706
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,120
All right.

707
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,120


708
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,120


709
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,120


710
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,120


711
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,120


712
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,120


713
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,120


714
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,120


715
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,420
All right.

716
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,960
All right.

717
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,680
All right.

718
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:02,960
All right.

719
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,820
All right.

720
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,120
All right, let's see.

721
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,740
All right.

722
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:05,740


723
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:05,740


724
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:05,740


725
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:05,740


726
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:05,740


727
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:05,740


728
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,020
All right.

729
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,020


730
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,700
All right.

731
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,160
All right.

732
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:07,860
All right.

733
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,500
All right.

734
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,740
All right.

735
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,600
Thank you.

736
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,480
Thank you.

737
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,420
Thank you.

738
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,960
Thank you.

739
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,020
Thank you.

740
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,680
Thank you.

741
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,180
Thank you.

742
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:42,240
Thank you.

743
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,960
Thank you.

744
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,160
Thank you.

745
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,700
Thank you.

746
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,640
Thank you.

747
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,240
Thank you.

748
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,000
Ah, yes.

749
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,160
Okay, well, is the show over now?

750
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,300
No, no. Oh, my God.

751
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,760
Didn't we have a number of things on the docket?

752
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,840
Why don't we go through those

753
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,140
agenda items first of all?

754
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,740
No, I thought you always get mad

755
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,120
when we talk about識.

756
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,220
read from the schedule.

757
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,260
No, you were just saying a while ago

758
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,520
that not enough people read the schedule

759
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,720
and know what is to transpire,

760
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,300
and clutching a copy of the schedule in their hands,

761
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,720
they come up to you and ask, what's next?

762
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,440
That's because they're subgeniuses,

763
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,440
and that's why they love Bob,

764
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,080
and that's why we love them.

765
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,420
Well, to show some measure of that inordinate love,

766
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,900
why don't we tell them, consulting the schedule itself,

767
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,160
what is to transpire the next few eventful days?

768
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,700
Well, the good stuff is in all caps, you'll notice now.

769
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,580
Like the pig roast on...

770
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,060
That's all I really am here for.

771
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,480
You want to miss that,

772
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,400
simply because you don't like to read the schedule?

773
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,560
There's a pig roast.

774
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,020
The flesh of the sacrificial swine.

775
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,600
Whose name is Dave this year, by the way.

776
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,400
We're all going to enjoy that you were here.

777
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,800
Oh, we've got one.

778
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,620
You need to hang on to that, Priestess Pisces.

779
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,920
Yes, Dave will sustain us from within.

780
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:20,180
But of course, that's leaping forward to the 4th of July.

781
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,340
We do have Wednesday, July 3rd,

782
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,280
which will also feature a live hour of slack,

783
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,740
just like this one.

784
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,280
So if you miss this one...

785
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,220
And you need to catch up on your sleep,

786
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,960
we'll be here to lull you...

787
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,740
The comforting drone of voices

788
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,380
will...

789
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,700
lull you into blissful slumber.

790
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,200
Clank.

791
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,520
Clank.

792
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,120
Clank.

793
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:47,360
Clank.

794
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,100
Clank.

795
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,100


796
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,100


797
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,100


798
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,100


799
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,100


800
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,100


801
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,100


802
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,100


803
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,100


804
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,100


805
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,100


806
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,100


807
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,120
Oh, sorry.

808
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,140
Oh, uh, uh, friend.

809
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:52,960
Sorry, friends.

810
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,300
Uh, well, this should sharpen us up.

811
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,060
Uh, it's the key representative of the evolution control committee,

812
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,820
the trademark Gunderson,

813
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,460
working inside of an amazing, highly futuristic,

814
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,960
live loop mixing capsule.

815
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,600
Uh, covered with screens all around.

816
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,740
And what we're about to hear is him,

817
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,600
uh, mash potatoing and remixing,

818
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,600
on the fly, mind you,

819
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,480
hundreds of bits and pieces of the works of the great composer,

820
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,880
Raymond Scott.

821
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,600
Evolution control committee.

822
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,720
This is called, uh, something like an 18th century disco town.

823
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,340
I think this is like the hits on 45, Raymond Scott.

824
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:35,760
Uh...

825
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:37,940
Uh...

826
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,120
Uh...

827
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,080
Lancer.

828
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,540
Do you want some, Dan?

829
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,400
Uh.

830
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,500
Thank you.

831
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:46,460
Thank you.

832
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:16,680
Thank you.

833
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,420
Thank you.

834
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,520
Thank you.

835
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,760
Thank you.

836
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,020
Thank you.

837
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,260
Thank you.

838
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,060
Thank you.

839
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,800
Thank you.

840
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,120
Thank you.

841
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,640
Thank you.

842
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,360
at a bluegrass festival.

843
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,140
How?

844
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,960
Because the banjo player drools out of both sides of the mouth.

845
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,400
What is the difference between a banjo and an onion?

846
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,140
I don't know, what is the difference between a banjo and an onion?

847
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,480
Nobody cries when you cut up a banjo.

848
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,900
How do you hide your stache from an auto harp player?

849
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,320
How do you hide your stache from an auto harp player?

850
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,800
Put it under the soap.

851
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,460
I don't get it.

852
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:18,980
We're a little bit...

853
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,260
Country?

854
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,640
A little bit country and a little bit diva.

855
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,020
As a matter of fact.

856
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,560
So this song's a little bit diva.

857
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,660
And there's some Bob.

858
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,440
And there's some Bob.

859
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,440
And a little bit of Bob, a little bit of Bob, a little bit of diva, a little bit of bluegrass.

860
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,700
There's a little injection of Bob in here too.

861
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:34,360
A little injection of Bob in here too.

862
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:34,880
And a little bit of Bob.

863
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:34,880


864
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,180
A little injection of Bob.

865
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:35,660
Injection.

866
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,180
She said it, I didn't.

867
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:38,740
A little Bob injection.

868
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:50,900
May your record be unbroken by and by, by, by and by.

869
00:52:53,900 --> 00:53:02,240
There's a vine of heaven waiting in the sky above.

870
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,880
In the sky above.

871
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:17,220
Well I played the piece de vie piece One bright and sunny day

872
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:28,240
When I fell in, missed into bed I put on some Q&A

873
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:34,880
My turntable started jumping up and down.

874
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:34,880


875
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:34,880


876
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:34,880


877
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:34,880


878
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:34,880


879
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,500
What is it I did not know now?

880
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:50,300
Don't let Bob know how I cried when it spread my dirty mouth.

881
00:53:50,300 --> 00:54:01,440
Now, be your record, be unbroken, by and by, by, by and by.

882
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:12,140
There's a light of heaven waiting in the sky, Bobby, in the sky.

883
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:22,860
Well, I bought a second copy, listening to your red-eyed express.

884
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:34,000
Well, my girlfriend came on too, and she's gone and taken off her dress.

885
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:40,140
Oh, yeah, we'll come together, I should call me.

886
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:41,620
Yeah.

887
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:55,920
Sweet and sumptuous voice, I just told her, gotta wait now, girl, I'm listening to freedom of choice.

888
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:06,980
Oh, you made your record, be unbroken, by and by, by, by and by.

889
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:12,120
There's a light of heaven waiting in the sky, Bobby, in the sky.

890
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:36,080
Well, I know I've been a sinner in my life, and even just gotta say I ain't no Christian child.

891
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,920
I'm a new traditional man.

892
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,340
Yeah, oh yeah.

893
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:50,920
When I hear that truth evolve, and oh no, I never stop.

894
