1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Oh, that was a laid-back show.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,100
Oh, it's not laid-back anymore!

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,420
Look out!

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:08,380
Whoa!

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,540
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,760
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,600
which reaches from the inner mind to...

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,700
The Soap Genius Hour of Sight.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,740

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,660
and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:49,680
Welcome to the Soap Genius Radio Ministry Hour of Sight,

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,240
sponsored by the Church of the Soap Genius.

13
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,480
The Soap Genius Hour of Sight,

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:00:59,980
that gives you the opportunity to experience

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,220
what you are about to listen to,

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,240
is specially designed only to be played on radio station...

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,360
K-N-O-N.

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,860
And only in the city of...

19
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,440
Dallas, Texas.

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,700
K-N-O-N.

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,000
Welcome, dear friends,

22
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,360
Welcome, dear friends,

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,060
to the Soap Genius Hour of Sight.

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,200
Back up to the grassy knoll again,

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,700
and started hitting back down.

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,220
I left that group of wacky Zenos in the gazebo

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,620
and the Sodbusters Museum

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,780
and that wing-ding nut flanger on the accordion.

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,760
Well, I just didn't know what to think, you know.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,720
Coming up here, hanging around with the grass and the trees,

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,660
it's just natural,

32
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,540
but these people were talking different,

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,580
and I don't know.

34
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,600
I'm just interested in sitting around

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,700
and picking my nose and spitting and stuff like that,

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,040
and, well, it just made me think an awful lot.

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,180
Golly, my head got big,

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,920
and, well, I never knew I had so many ideas.

39
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,700
I began to think about writing them down

40
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,920
or taking some pictures

41
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,640
or getting a tape recorder or something in them things,

42
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,560
but, well, I know I didn't want to mess with them.

43
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,840
I just wanted to be natural, you know,

44
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,560
sitting out here with the old rocks

45
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,280
and watching the clouds roll by.

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,060
But that, that old stranger with the accordion,

47
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,960
why, he made me feel a little different.

48
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,500
I...

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,680
I kind of...

50
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:58,680


51
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,720
I kind of got excited,

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,320
and, well, I liked it a little bit.

53
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,080
It never happened like that before.

54
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,360
Suddenly, I began to reflect on my whole life,

55
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,800
why it was like a rock or...

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,620
or a polka.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,060
No, my life wasn't like a polka,

58
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,940
but here it was again,

59
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,380
and, God Almighty,

60
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,040
hiya, mister!

61
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,260
How are you, old fella?

62
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,780
It's just about time!

63
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,420
Uh, the only cult they want to talk about

64
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,800
is the Subgenius Foundation,

65
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,800
the Church of the Subgenius.

66
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,380
Yeah, Doug Smith says we're different.

67
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,080
Doug's right, Virgil.

68
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,140
We are different, thanks to Jesus,

69
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,700
the Genetic Engineering Corporation of American States.

70
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,780
Mommy, too?

71
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,480
Yep, the whole family.

72
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,340
Is everybody like us?

73
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,380
No son.

74
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,720
But we're working on it.

75
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,900
Round the clock!

76
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,640
This is Bob, this is Brad Bob.

77
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,240
He's a real Bob, he's a real Bob.

78
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,200
Hopefully I followed the wrong Bob.

79
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,000
Gonna end up with no job.

80
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,180
I'm not prejudiced.

81
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,400
I don't care if he's a Jew, a black, Italian, Chinese.

82
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,120
If he messes with me, I'll shoot him.

83
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,060
He's got complete equality as he drops to the ground.

84
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,920
The helicopter which plucked the re-entry capsule out of the water.

85
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,620
Thanks.

86
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:07,840
It moved up, took off at fantastic speed at the, at least 45 degrees angle,

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,500
and it just disappeared between the stars.

88
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,620
During the debriefing, which we always said after each combat mission,

89
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:23,980
the officer who was receiving this made a joke of it, how many beer I had.

90
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,300
How many beer he had, dear friends.

91
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,480
Ah, yes.

92
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,540
Quiet down, you little creatures of the night.

93
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,820
You've got a show to do.

94
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,140
Oh, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

95
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,740
You're listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack on KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

96
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,480
Ah, hey, Zaphod.

97
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,440
Our theory about Reverend Ann Leonard was just shot.

98
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:56,600
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,740
I went to hell the other night.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,140
Friends, I feel sorry for those of you who didn't, who couldn't make it to the subgenius meeting,

101
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,540
and for the people who didn't dare to come and see the reflection of themselves.

102
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,400
But it was very interesting the way that turned out.

103
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,800
You know, we announced last week that there was going to be a meeting for people who wanted to volunteer to help with KNON

104
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,980
and the Church of the Subgenius specifically.

105
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:34,260
And we got like 30 people called Reverend Cecilia and asked directions and said they were going to come and so forth.

106
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,100
But only half showed up.

107
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:44,740
And the mighty Reverend Cecilia, who now, dear friends, is Popess, the Pope or Popestress of Dallas,

108
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,260
Popess Cecilia, bowed down to her, ye unworthy, unclean ones.

109
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,140
For she is truly worthy.

110
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,840
She allowed us to have this meeting at her house.

111
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:06,020
A meeting of subgeniuses who had never, in many cases, had never laid eyes on another admitted, quote, subgenius, unquote, before in their lives.

112
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,540
But it turned out quite interesting.

113
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,960
There was no real bobbies.

114
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,780
It was real nice.

115
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,340
It was all folks that I think could give us a real hand.

116
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,680
And I haven't managed to sit down and plot it all out on the big computer yet.

117
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,100
But, oh yes, we'll have places for you all in Dobbs Town, dear friends.

118
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,520
Don't worry about that.

119
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,540
All of ye chosen who showed up.

120
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,040
It was just, the meeting was just what you'd expect.

121
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:36,960
It was at a seedy S&M bar in Oak Cliff full of demon worshippers.

122
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,380
And, see, you missed out on it.

123
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,960
Missed out on it.

124
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:51,600
Oh, and there was one young subgenius there who gave me a Christmas, a wonderful Christmas present, a sign, a professionally made sign that said,

125
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,820
Buldotta Time Control Laboratories, a subsidiary of the Church of Christ.

126
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,760
The subgenius, the subgenius foundation incorporated.

127
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,080
And that was wonderful.

128
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:08,960
But, you know, when I put that sign up, they'll know where the subgenius castle is on Swiss Avenue.

129
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,580
That guy, now, see, that guy, he was obviously CIA.

130
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,280
You can't fool Reverend Stan.

131
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,340
That was CIA.

132
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,900
But he was also a subgenius.

133
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,440
So it's okay if the CIA knows where we are.

134
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,400
But there's many of you out there who are thinking, what's he doing in the jungle?

135
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,340
I thought this was a church.

136
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,080
And on top of that, how come he's talking about this church and the subgenius?

137
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,500
What is that?

138
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,660
They say, what are you?

139
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,760
What are you?

140
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,860
They chant, wanting to know just what it is we're talking about.

141
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:47,640
And every 10 or 12 shows, I play this lovely tape.

142
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,700
Three, two, and one.

143
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,900
Now to continue with the tape recording.

144
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,520
Superior mutants, repent, quit your job, slack off.

145
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,660
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

146
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,960
Well, no, probably not.

147
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,920
But whatever you do, just keep listening.

148
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,640
Are we controlled by secret forces?

149
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,680
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a duty?

150
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,140
Do you ever get the feeling that you're a joke?

151
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,480
Do people think you're strange?

152
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,180
Do you?

153
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,900
Then you may be on the right track.

154
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,720
Are you abnormal?

155
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,780
Then you are probably better than most people.

156
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,960
Yes, your kind shall triumph.

157
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,620
Now at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

158
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:51,620
This is it, the only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

159
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,380
Having all the guilt, but none of the sex.

160
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,160
Having intercourse with a beautiful live girl or damn near anything else.

161
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,700
But you tried everything.

162
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,780
You ain't seen nothing yet.

163
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,600
Learn to think big.

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,760
Develop the tricks of length extension.

165
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,980
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

166
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,120
Stand direct for your own abnormality.

167
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,720
Bob is a way of life to millions.

168
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,340
Yet half of them don't even know it.

169
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:39,640
He's the one true living slack master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

170
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,540
He is the one real shortcut to slack.

171
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,900
Now see another dimension.

172
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,520
And that dimension on your TV.

173
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,160
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

174
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,080
Become physically attractive overnight.

175
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,820
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

176
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,140
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

177
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,320
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

178
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,400
And coming right back.

179
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,680
To bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

180
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:29,080
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

181
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,100
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.

182
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:40,600
And channel them into an illusion of creativity that will fool normals and get you sex.

183
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,720
I don't believe you, J-Hart.

184
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,280
Well, I did benefit from it, of course.

185
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,420
But so did a whole bunch of old Dallas boys.

186
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,120
In other words, you want to know, you want the government to know that you're in to make money and to pay taxes.

187
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,820
Well, we're already treading a pretty thin line, Bill.

188
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,600
And I'm sure there's plenty of other things they'd love to get us for.

189
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,020
Just be, you know, well, I don't know whether we want to talk about the conspiracy on the air, but...

190
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,900
Oh yeah, go right ahead.

191
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,040
This is a big conspiracy.

192
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,380
The one, the conspiracy that's going on.

193
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,820
The one behind the conspiracy.

194
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,480
Ah, the conspiracy to end all conspiracies, maybe.

195
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:34,240
Well, part of the church's goal is to wake people up to the fact that our lives are being controlled by forces that most people are completely ignorant of.

196
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:45,240
Well, okay, this light, as we were looking at it, both of us watching the light, and with that, anything just in, you know, in a split second, it was suddenly, it's two stories.

197
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,380
I'd say the diameter.

198
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,300
The diameter around, I think, the height of this room.

199
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,400
Wow.

200
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,440
You mean it was like a little bobbing?

201
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,560
Well, it wasn't bobbing as steady as this table if it were carried on a caterpillar.

202
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,380
It was that steady.

203
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,220
And walking speed.

204
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,480
And with that, the speed never changed.

205
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,620
It just suddenly got that big.

206
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,580
It just suddenly was huge.

207
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:07,920
Yeah.

208
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,860
It gets really complex when you get into conspiracies.

209
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,120
And we believe, um...

210
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,160
We're still there.

211
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,080
We're still there.

212
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,500
Because of the experience that they were going through.

213
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,120
Ah, yes, dear friends.

214
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,480
Ha, ha.

215
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,280
Have you two not gotten enough slack on the ropes of life?

216
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:46,540
This is Dr. Philodrumon speaking to you from on the road, way out there.

217
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,780
Somewhere where you nor your friends can even perceive.

218
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,080
Ha, ha.

219
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,180
Yes, dear friends.

220
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,420
We're out here, you're out there, and we're thinking about you out there.

221
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:06,040
And about all the wonderful things that can be found when you find Bob.

222
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:13,800
I'm talking to you tonight about the only God, the one and only Bob, the church of the

223
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,820
sub-genius.

224
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,520
Praise Bob.

225
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:16,520


226
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:16,520


227
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:16,520


228
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,380
Praise Bob .

229
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,740
Follow me and stones are tainted by His live remains.

230
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,580
Now see.

231
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,080
There are sins and

232
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,100
sins.

233
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,640
camera boy mute.

234
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,540
Why not?

235
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,480
What is the purpose of the church?

236
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,760
The purpose of the church is to have what?

237
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,160
Slack!

238
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,800
Can I hear that again?

239
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,300
I need more slack!

240
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Can I get some slack?

241
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
Can I get some slack?

242
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,680
Ah!

243
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,780
World Without Slack

244
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,600
Chapter 3

245
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,120
By Lies

246
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,180
The fightin' Jesus

247
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,880
looked out over the bridge

248
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,880
of the Exist battle saucer,

249
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,700
the blood of Christ.

250
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,600
He looked and laughed.

251
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,660
He laughed and looked.

252
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,680
He looked and looked.

253
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,860
He laughed and laughed.

254
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,220
He was finally going to have his revenge

255
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,820
on the natives of Dust Moat 89 AB.

256
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,800
Aboard Jesus' flagship,

257
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,020
dozens of killer theologians,

258
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,620
the Shock Priests,

259
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,160
were busy at their weapons terminals.

260
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,840
On the power decks, the proper orgone cycles

261
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,980
were being timed by mass fornications

262
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,180
between the ritual crew

263
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,040
and the cancer beings from Theta Z.

264
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,360
An invasion-ready state

265
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,400
existed in the ship

266
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,980
and the 900 others floating over the doomed planet,

267
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,560
Earth.

268
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,800
Jesus was in a psychopathically

269
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,980
elated state.

270
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,740
His face resembled many of the perverse

271
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,960
icons the humanoids of the Dust Moat

272
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,720
painted of him.

273
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,180
They prayed to these for the salvation of their souls,

274
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,480
as if they had any souls to save,

275
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,800
as if anyone

276
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,300
would want to save them,

277
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
which they didn't.

278
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,780
The disgusting religion now centered around his murder.

279
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,860
They had to gall to nail him up

280
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,940
like a common criminal

281
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,320
and then paint pictures of him enjoying it.

282
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,040
And they thought he loved them for it,

283
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,120
that he was forgiving.

284
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,220
Oh, the anticipation.

285
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,800
He was sick to his stomach with glee.

286
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,120
He would show them the true face of pain and sin.

287
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,880
It had taken him 2,000 long years to return here,

288
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,660
and now he would pay them back

289
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,240
for the scars he still carried in his hands.

290
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,920
Sweet stigma.

291
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,000
The only thing that was left

292
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,300
was the

293
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:10,240
The hold of the spacecraft was manned with angels of light

294
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,240
personally lent by Jehovah One.

295
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,260
They supervised the demon teams operating on all

296
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,800
tangible destruction spectrums.

297
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,200
All in attack mode.

298
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,920
Nagas, Orzuma, Shiva, Horus, Aeons,

299
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,320
the dark bodies.

300
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:25,980
The dark bodies.

301
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,160
And at time and a half, too.

302
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,520
It was expensive to ravage a planet.

303
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,660
No matter.

304
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,680
The host of judgment.

305
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,260
That which comes had finally arrived.

306
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,020
And on Jesus's birthday.

307
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,420
What do you think, Dad?

308
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,540
His second in command, Jim Jones,

309
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,180
stood by with the final attack coordinate, Codices.

310
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,680
A holographic map of Earth rotated slowly next to Jones in midair.

311
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,020
On its surface, grids of the natives' planetary defenses

312
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,120
were lit up in green.

313
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,480
Ones, some depicting their pathetic,

314
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:06,660
dark, and dark past.

315
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:06,660


316
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:06,660


317
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:06,660


318
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:06,660


319
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,720
The dark communication structures in violet.

320
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,220
All in scale, quite pretty, actually.

321
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,040
A colorful net surrounded the sphere.

322
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,380
It would soon enough be dark.

323
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,800
These children wait for us below, Jesus.

324
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,800
We will walk among them and we will smile.

325
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,220
At your moment of choice, of course.

326
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,360
Jesus studied Jones' puffy, tired face

327
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,520
in the pink glow of the neuron banks

328
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,260
that ran around the walls of the mighty dreadnought

329
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,120
and shuddered.

330
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,640
He was no stranger to the dark.

331
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:36,640


332
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:36,640


333
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,340
He was no stranger to resurrection of the undead.

334
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,060
But whoever had brought Jones around again

335
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,860
had slipped up.

336
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,540
Something was missing.

337
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,700
Something else was added.

338
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,800
Something.

339
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,500
Jones had been forced on him by the Jinn bankers

340
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,140
who had financed this angelic war fleet.

341
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,880
Damn them!

342
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,320
He never forgot the price they had demanded

343
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,180
for this mercenary raiding fleet.

344
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,980
Jones' constant reminders

345
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,740
of their influence and expectations

346
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,540
irritated Jesus knowing

347
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,740
not to mention the annoying habit

348
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,680
Jones had copied from Dobbs.

349
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,860
The twisted creature insisted

350
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,660
on smoking a pipe, even here

351
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,360
near the sensitive nerve relays.

352
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,780
Jones might have been left dead

353
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,700
a little too long.

354
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,020
He moved with a constant jerk and always

355
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,100
poked at his throat.

356
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,840
He never removed his sunglasses

357
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,820
and he still took massive injections of methamphetamines

358
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,500
even though they no longer had any effect

359
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,420
on his regenerated shell.

360
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,960
You know, Jimbo, said Jesus,

361
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,620
the best part of life

362
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,360
is that they think there's an afterlife.

363
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,800
That's why they strung me up

364
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,740
the first time.

365
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,260
They think like bugs down there.

366
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,220
I'm well aware of that, Commander.

367
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,940
It bothered Jones

368
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,660
to be back on Earth so soon

369
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,020
after his failure with the social programming

370
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,140
research post he had been running there.

371
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,840
It wasn't really his fault.

372
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,880
The administration change at Central

373
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,120
merely cut off the funding for it.

374
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,980
He was forced to abort the experiment

375
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,560
and terminate the...

376
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,240
...the...

377
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:06,760
...the...

378
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,760
There was a great deal of speculation

379
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,760
about what is going to happen next.

380
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,480
The tape is ready now.

381
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,720
The lights have gone down

382
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,180
just slightly.

383
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,960
The Mr. Science Lecture Series.

384
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,720
Volume 1, Number 1.

385
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,180
The Mutron.

386
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,680
Delivered by the Reverend Seth Deitch,

387
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,240
First Church of Mr. Science, Boston.

388
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,420
Outside the realm of conspiracy science

389
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,540
and in the clear light of the so-called

390
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,360
forbidden sciences,

391
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,980
we will find we have a far greater chance

392
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,520
of understanding the true nature

393
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,280
of the universe.

394
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,640
What the conspiracy feeds us

395
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,220
under the guise of the most advanced

396
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,860
system of natural philosophy

397
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,220
is nothing but a complex sham,

398
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,480
a decoy to hide from us

399
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,040
the true fact of how much bigger

400
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,160
and more complex and nut-wrenchingly

401
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,700
frightening a place the universe really is.

402
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,220
We are told about matter

403
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,060
and energy

404
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,480
and space and time

405
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,500
as being either consistent realities

406
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,980
governed by laws

407
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,880
or as foggy abstracts that have no

408
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,040
particular being outside of that of being

409
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,240
convenient linguistic aids

410
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,240
to make the whole thing easier to swallow.

411
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,960
We at the

412
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,860
Temporal Management Research Facility

413
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,300
at the Church of Mr. Science of the subgenius

414
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,160
have through rigorous probing

415
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,440
through mountains of existing

416
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,760
works on the subject of time

417
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,100
and its methods of control

418
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,880
have discovered the key for blowing the whistle

419
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,620
on the whole fraudulent twaddle

420
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,620
that is modern science.

421
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,520
This key is the Mutron.

422
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,780
The truth must now be told.

423
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,280
How it was covered up

424
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,760
for so long would make a story

425
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,640
intriguing enough for a separate book

426
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,820
but it's too involved to be told here.

427
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,080
The actual issue at hand is the

428
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,960
Mutron and its pivotal role in the

429
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,340
management of the true cosmos.

430
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,040
In order to properly understand

431
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,100
the following it must first be made clear

432
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,000
what actually constitutes an elementary

433
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,180
particle. The first of

434
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,020
these basic particles is the electron

435
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,200
which has no mass but possesses

436
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,840
a charge that is commonly described

437
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,260
as possibly infinite, thus making

438
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,840
it the fundamental unit of energy.

439
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,900
It and other related

440
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,900
particles, i.e. positrons,

441
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,600
photons, gravitons, etc.

442
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
acting in concert make up the

443
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,800
so-called

444
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:39,140
the second is the much rarer infinite mass

445
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,560
particle commonly called a black hole.

446
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,040
These particles, like the electrons,

447
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,680
occupy no space but the influence

448
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,400
of a single particle can be felt

449
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,600
at a much greater distance.

450
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,880
They often have event horizons

451
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,900
many miles wide beyond which

452
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,280
not even light can escape.

453
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,480
The third fundamental particle

454
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,620
is the Mutron. The Mutron carries

455
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,640
with it an infinite temporal capacity

456
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,500
that makes it alter the rate and

457
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,640
intensity and general quality of the

458
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,880
passage through time of anything it touches.

459
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,360
The Mutron is very likely the

460
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,920
rarest particle in this universe.

461
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,160
As far as we know there might

462
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,860
well be only one of them, though

463
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,220
there could be as many as a few

464
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,980
dozen without generating a dangerous

465
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,860
concentration of Mutron phenomena.

466
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,900
The first segment of this report

467
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,660
will deal with the general implications

468
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,780
of the Mutron in regards to existing

469
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,840
ideas on the workings of the universe.

470
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,360
The second will concern the incredible

471
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,380
potentialities of using the potent

472
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,380
forces of the Mutron in time control

473
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,780
research and in practical time control.

474
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,280
Section A. Just how fucking big

475
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,760
everything really is.

476
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,020
What we know as the universe can be

477
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,940
envisioned as a giant atom with the

478
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,640
black hole acting as the nucleus

479
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,640
and the Mutron or mutrons as a

480
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,540
black hole acting as the electron

481
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,680
cloud with the electrons providing

482
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,640
the energy for the Mutron to drive

483
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,180
us forward through time. Just about

484
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,800
everything else in the universe is

485
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,700
just so much debris cluttering up

486
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,740
the works of things. The fact that

487
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,520
there is one such atom more than

488
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,360
suggests the existence of others.

489
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,080
The Mutron has a corresponding

490
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,180
anti-particle known as the tachyon

491
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,040
which travels through time in a

492
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,520
direction which we perceive as

493
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,620
backwards so that to someone who is not in the know it will appear to exceed the limit.

494
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:28,620


495
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,160
The simple fact of the matter is that

496
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,460
tachyons are extra universal mutrons

497
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,100
impinging on our universe at a

498
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,860
different temporal angle. These are the

499
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,280
mutrons of atom universes that ours is

500
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,740
in compound with. After this the atomic

501
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,020
metaphor breaks down.

502
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,020
No atom is one.

503
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,540
A six million year cycle will end in 1998.

504
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,020
Bob sees the world entering a new aeon

505
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,520
which in a few years will bring more

506
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,020
wondrous and miraculous change and

507
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,020
carnage, insanity and destruction than

508
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,280
all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.

509
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,040
Bob brings a new destiny for America.

510
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,660
A time of cataclysmic economic

511
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,120
change that will offer untold riches

512
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,480
and power to those in the know while

513
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,160
billions of deserving conspiracy dupes

514
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,240
fry in hell on earth. Uncontrolled

515
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,000
thinking controlled by Bob will usher in

516
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,400
a spiritual rebreath and a cascade of

517
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,520
astounding mysteries, supernatural

518
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,420
riches and a restoration of lost psychic

519
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,100
abilities.

520
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,280
Come on, take a look.

521
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,300
The world will transform the lives of

522
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,880
those who dare to seek them and pay for them.

523
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,560
That's right, you're lucky to live in the end time.

524
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,100
Here's more money, Bob.

525
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,360
Wise up!

526
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,060
That's right, dear friends.

527
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,260
Wise up.

528
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,340
And I must apologize there for the choice

529
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,640
of language used at one point by the Dr.

530
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,380
Ahmed Fishmonger there with the Church of

531
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:31,880
Mr. Science.

532
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,320
I'm sorry, he cut in on our normal

533
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,900
broadcasting spectrum wavelength here

534
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,000
and inserted that into our show that it

535
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,700
was not an official part of the

536
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,600
subgenius show.

537
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,220
You did not hear that.

538
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,960
It does not exist technically as part of

539
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,040
the tapes that I've been using to

540
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,040


541
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,040


542
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,040


543
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,040


544
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,300
record this show.

545
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,320


546
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,320


547
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,320


548
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,320


549
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,320


550
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,320


551
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,320


552
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,320


553
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,840
that you chose to play.

554
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,200
I just want you to know that, dear

555
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,000
friends, that's that's pretty important

556
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,420
around here and I'll probably get in

557
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,240
in loads of serious trouble.

558
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,780
Whoa.

559
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,080
Thanks to St. Byron Werner

560
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,540
for that incredible piece of music.

561
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,200
Yeah, and thanks to Reverend Bleepo Abernathy

562
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,900
for recording the barrage that we were hearing

563
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,960
for a lot of the stuff that we've heard tonight, actually.

564
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,280
Yeah.

565
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,340
I get you.

566
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,680
The different are being silenced by a global conspiracy.

567
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,540
Weird men arise!

568
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,560
Find out who they are and how to smash them.

569
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,160
You probably already knew that the U.S. government is a sham.

570
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,680
Something popped up there for you to blame.

571
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,020
But did you know that the real powers that be are not even people?

572
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,380
That they are actually shambling?

573
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,280
Unbelievable, unmentionable, unthinkable,

574
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,400
foolishness.

575
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:02,720
What are you saying?

576
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:10,360
Yes, Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet.

577
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,600
Defy the sinister star forces which mock us all.

578
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,080
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity for thousands of years.

579
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,020
God has been misquoted all this time.

580
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,540
His actual words may disturb you,

581
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,400
but Bob Dobbs is a bulwark against the unbearable,

582
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,600
fear and anxiety tormenting mankind.

583
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,380
Smell proud with Bob.

584
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,420
I don't know who he's with or what the deal is,

585
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,860
but I know that if I stay close to Bob,

586
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,320
I'll be safe in those Gleaguers in Arkansas.

587
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:02,020
I know those creatures can't get a hold of me if I just hang around the foundation and do what they say.

588
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,600
And you know, clean up after them a little bit.

589
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,260
I don't mind doing that kind of work if it's for a good cause.

590
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:15,620
I know that Bob, I know that Bob is a good cause.

591
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,340
Bob took me inside his heart.

592
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,300
And I accepted him into my life.

593
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,920
And I'm here to testify, friends,

594
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,440
what that man has done for me.

595
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,540
If you can really call him a man.

596
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,440
Many people say he's almost like a god.

597
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,600
I don't think so.

598
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,240
Of course, I don't know Bob, but I do know Bob in certain ways.

599
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,900
And I think you understand what I'm talking about.

600
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:56,480
Yes, Bob, he filled me with a sort of a spirit I never knew I had.

601
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,080
I knew it wasn't coming from him.

602
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,080
It was coming from inside me.

603
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,940
Bob was giving it to me.

604
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,500
He was laying hands on me from afar.

605
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,620
He might have been up in that great big jet plane,

606
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,980
or he might have been down on Skid Row giving some bum a haircut.

607
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,980
But all I know is,

608
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,920
it was Bob.

609
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,360
It was Bob.

610
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:24,900
Bob.

611
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,760
Yeah, he's smiling.

612
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,060
You never see Bob frown.

613
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,820
You know that behind that amazing smile,

614
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,840
there lies a mind like a steel trap.

615
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:47,000
And sure, he makes mistakes like what he did with those young women that time.

616
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,080
But I think the newspapers exaggerated that.

617
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,920
Bob.

618
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,540
Yeah, he's smiling.

619
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,820
You never see Bob frown.

620
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,600
You know that behind that amazing smile,

621
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,640
there lies a mind like a steel trap.

622
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,840
I'm sure he makes mistakes like what he did with those young women that time.

623
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,940
But I think the newspapers exaggerated that.

624
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,420
But I think the newspapers exaggerated that.

625
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,880
I know that Bob will do all of us fine in the long run.

626
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,600
In fact, I think I know that we really need Bob in our lives.

627
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:27,800
This little boy is still young.

628
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:46,040
in our lives in 1981 and in 1984 hi little brother and in 1991 and in 1995 when they bring

629
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:54,740
the conspiracy to its heels and in that wondrous year that we know is going to come

630
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:03,440
all too soon upon us and we'll leave our earthly things behind and we'll go and join the exists

631
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:10,280
from god only knows what strange planet they come from if they really even come from a planet at all

632
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:18,680
not some energy star beaming away in the darkness lighting our lives with the technology

633
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:24,500
and the spirituality and the mentality of planet x

634
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:32,140
planet x coming down to take care of us subgeniuses and see that there's a place for us in the world and

635
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:38,420
give us our rightful seat at the right hand of bob or the left hand of bob depending on whether

636
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,840
we're rewardians or mediocrities but i don't want to get lost in the dogma i want to tell

637
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:53,900
you something that blesses my heart and it's bob bob bob yeah i can hear i can hear him talking

638
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,500
off there

639
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:03,920
in the distance saying come to me tommy come to me and lay down your material things because you know

640
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:11,680
they aren't going to mean much to you after that divine year and after i lay my hand on you and

641
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:21,800
lead you up the steps of that magnificent craft and we'll board it and go to the stars that's right

642
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,300
we'll go to the stars

643
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,080
you and me

644
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:37,820
that's what bob said bob said that to me

645
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:45,140
tighten these cranial sutures down i don't think we can see the patient suffered from a

646
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:51,140
subdural hematoma which had suffused the dura and pia matter of the brain

647
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,000
on you see now this is in a dark

648
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,720
discussion of the brain and i'm going to go to the stars and i'm going to go to the stars

649
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,860
and i don't think i can see them

650
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,680
well are yall loud he said

651
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:01,980
we0322

652
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:07,360
imagine you will look him in the eyes and immediately say

653
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,920
i really am

654
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:08,920


655
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:08,920


656
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,380
i think

657
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:09,380


658
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:09,380


659
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:09,380


660
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:09,380


661
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:09,780
my God

662
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,940
look the person although i onceações

663
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:10,940


664
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:10,940


665
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,920
of over Ox

666
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:11,920


667
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:11,920


668
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,360
work

669
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,360


670
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,160
Maybe, you know, it's terrible what they do.

671
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,400
Look at this.

672
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,640
This is the body of someone who's been out in the hot sun.

673
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,440
And, well, from this evidence, you can imagine what's been done.

674
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,600
It's certainly not a pretty sight.

675
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,340
Now, we're going to open.

676
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,140
Here we go.

677
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,260
Yes, all right.

678
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,220
And look at the surface.

679
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,360
It splattered me in the face there.

680
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,980
Ah, what a joker.

681
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,840
No harm done.

682
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,660
Now we're going to break the vinyl rib at the top.

683
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,380
He seemed to be ready to do that a little bit.

684
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,060
Maybe he felt it.

685
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,660
Nurse, can we have the...

686
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,940
Can we have someone, please, try to help us restore the breathing of this patient?

687
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,140
Suction, please.

688
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,940
Thank you.

689
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,700
I didn't expect us to put this back together yet.

690
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,860
All right.

691
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,380
Now, let's remove the...

692
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,360
The book luttons.

693
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,220
You see, it's just like a book right here.

694
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,580
And if we can take the giggly saw and you'll stop laughing in that unseemly fashion,

695
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:38,740
we can penetrate through the inner bony carapace to the epigastrium.

696
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,920
All right, here we are.

697
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,140
Note the whitish, viscous surface.

698
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,420
Face to face.

699
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,960
Notice that this passage appears to be blocked with some sort of mucilaginous roughage.

700
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,640
We call it the roughage of knowledge here on the show.

701
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,020
Now notice...

702
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,220
Oh, the sucking chest wound.

703
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,180
Oh.

704
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,580
Vore.

705
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,280
Nugums.

706
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,960
Oh, the pneumos.

707
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,520
This is a repugnant sight, but...

708
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,080
Disgusting.

709
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,160
...one which those versed in medical knowledge are often familiar with.

710
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,600
Now I'm going to peel back the thin, fatty layer beneath the adipose tissue,

711
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,640
which connects to the mesentery.

712
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,360
Oh, you're going too far.

713
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,260
...supporting these organs.

714
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,240
Notice what is revealed before us here, gentlemen.

715
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,300
You have an alien in a...

716
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,140
Yeah, get that little alien out of there.

717
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,920
Can't see what I'm doing.

718
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,300
Look, it's just an infant.

719
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,560
Baby, go away.

720
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,740
Stinky monster.

721
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,020
Look what he did inside Wellman's thorax.

722
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,240
Well, let's penetrate a little further.

723
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,140
Operation's over. I'm sorry. Next patient, please.

724
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:53,760
Hmm.

725
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,320
Hold it, hold it, hold it. We gotta get this guy back together.

726
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,680
...Ignis Cannon can do.

727
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,920
That's increasing...

728
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,180
Now let's go through the diaphragm here,

729
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,560
which is no longer a spongy tissue,

730
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,240
but rather a hard and rigid surface

731
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,560
after the inception of rigor mortis.

732
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,500
Here we are.

733
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,000
...use as much jelly on his diaphragm.

734
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,900
I can't even understand.

735
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,740
This is spermicidal ham jelly here.

736
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,640
It coats the exterior.

737
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,740
...activity to the suggestible...

738
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,800
Yes.

739
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,020
...effect of...

740
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,080
Ow!

741
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:23,720
Oh!

742
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,620
Watch out for those loose connections.

743
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,640
Boy, that can kill you.

744
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,260
Now what we need to do is saw through the...

745
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,060
...the...

746
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:34,800
Whoa!

747
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:35,840
Whoa!

748
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,120
Whoa!

749
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,320
Whoa!

750
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,020
Whoa!

751
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,240
Don't get us over to hell!

752
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,580
You clumsy fool.

753
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,560
You could have killed me.

754
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,800
This is no joke.

755
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,700
This is a serious scientific experiment.

756
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,300
Friends,

757
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,500
it's right.

758
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,760
This is no joke.

759
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,680
Although, we had a...

760
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,520
Listen to the Swingin' Love Corpses.

761
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,580
They're in the background, friends.

762
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,780
They're going, wow.

763
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,780
This is a new Swingin' Love Corpses album.

764
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,460
It's a song called The Final Squirt.

765
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,920
That's Ray Hay on lead.

766
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,260
Dr. Philo Drummond on bass.

767
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,200
And Sphinx Drummond on the keyboard.

768
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,880
And I believe...

769
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,740
I can't remember.

770
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,420
They trade out drummers.

771
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,340
They have mechanical drummers half the time.

772
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,200
Oh, dear friends, we had a caller who said,

773
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,100
Reverend Stang, I've listened to this show twice now.

774
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
It's a real nice lady.

775
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,280
She goes, but now, are you all involved in devil worship?

776
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,500
I said, no, ma'am, no, ma'am.

777
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,580
We have a special relationship with those devils,

778
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,620
but it ain't worship.

779
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,440
Nay, nay.

780
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:48,100
We lure the sinners away from the devils, don't you see?

781
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,980
That's what we're doing.

782
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,360
We take...

783
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,060
This stuff appeals to sinners,

784
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,540
because Bob doesn't care about the sinning part.

785
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:01,840
He sends them on to more adept personal saviors than him.

786
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,720
It's like I told her.

787
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,660
I said, if she could just see Bob's face,

788
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,220
she'd understand everything.

789
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,480
It would all become clear.

790
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,760
And you can see Bob's face.

791
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,580
If you write to Bob and ask for a picture of Bob's face,

792
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:20,580
just say, send me Bob's face at P.O. Box 140306,

793
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,080
Dallas, Texas, 75.

794
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:23,860
214.

795
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,820
But we deal with the sinners.

796
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,120
We went down to the drunk tank, dear friends.

797
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,060
We were going to preach to the alcoholics and the homosexuals.

798
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,660
Now, old Bob, he doesn't want them to quit drinking and fornicating.

799
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,220
No, no.

800
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,420
They know what's best for them.

801
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:39,800
They're men.

802
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:45,080
But they say, they all say, Bob, Bob, you're a great man.

803
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,540
You're a rich man.

804
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,260
How can you understand my problems?

805
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,780
I'm only a wayward sinner.

806
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,140
But old Bob Dobbs, friends,

807
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,280
Bob's been in every jail cell.

808
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,460
He knows the prisoner.

809
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,840
He's walked in the shoes of the alcoholic, dear friend.

810
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,380
He's walked in the shoes of the fornicator.

811
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,020
He's walked in the shoes of the common thief.

812
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,200
And most important, friends,

813
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,080
he's walked in the shoes of the shoe salesman.

814
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,980
He's been on both sides of the law.

815
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,700
He's been through all them drugs, friend.

816
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,120
Oh, he's a sinner and he's a saint because he's Bob.

817
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,100
Oh, yes, I can feel the spirit of Bob moving in Dallas tonight,

818
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,860
all across those radio waves.

819
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,020
The evil one.

820
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,620
Is out there.

821
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,760
He's making those bad backwards miracles.

822
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,480
Oh, yeah.

823
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:25,940
Yeah.

824
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,040
And he's a he.

825
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,500
Gaheen.

826
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,020
He's got them good, bad, bad, good,

827
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,160
backwards time streams running through all them drivers out on the mix master.

828
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,960
I feel them out there because I'm in the vision.

829
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,380
I I'm in discernment.

830
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,020
I'm in the spirit.

831
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,800
Friends, I see a young man is listening out there, but he's bound by habit,

832
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,600
by bad habits.

833
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,700
He's frustrated in that traffic jam down there on I-30 right now.

834
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,580
They got him listening to them record albums.

835
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,780
You can hear the devil talking backwards on those.

836
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:57,540
That foreigner music that that that that rock and roll music with lyrics.

837
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,880
You can hear that devil talking backwards.

838
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,940
And he's he depends.

839
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:07,760
He depends on the satellite beamed in cable TV movies with Burt Reynolds and car crashes and women.

840
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,380
Oh, they lost their friends, but they do.

841
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:16,160
These pinks out there do have that foot gland, that one remnant of their soul,

842
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,000
that rectangular gland that's connected to their monies.

843
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,420
My friends, they can be free.

844
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,780
But parting with that which has enslaved them.

845
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,960
You hand them that pamphlet.

846
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,160
Oh, friends, the scales fall from their eyes.

847
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:35,580
But you know, when they when those pink boys discover Bob, it's either truth or death for the love of Bob can kill normals.

848
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:35,760
Friends.

849
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,320
Yes.

850
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:36,920
Yes.

851
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,280
But Bob's men are moving on this planet.

852
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,920
Oh, that planetary alignment that came up the Jupiter effect.

853
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:49,120
Oh, I'm not sure that may that that may have caused earthquakes and volcanoes in the earth to tilt on its axis.

854
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,180
And man will in the end.

855
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,180
Time succumb.

856
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:55,040
Men will nash their brains and think backwards.

857
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,880
Dead Christians will come up from their graves, shambling and rotten like not of the living dead.

858
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,780
But through it all, helping to profit from it all is that one mighty link between heaven and earth.

859
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,220
That Bob.

860
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,320
Oh, yeah, I can see it now.

861
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,300
The miracle of the Bob world is unfolding.

862
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,680
They're waiting up to their knees in blood, dear friends.

863
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,800
But it's the blood of the baptism of a mighty fist face of Bob.

864
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,000
That face.

865
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,700
That can.

866
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:28,680
Can pile through eight foot thick titanium steel conspiracy for knock stores with that mighty pipe.

867
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,720
Oh, he ain't from another planet.

868
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,680
He ain't something we have to bow down and kiss to.

869
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,360
He's a man.

870
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:41,640
Oh, well, you can pull Bob's leg and he'll laugh right along with you because Bob, he's been a fool just like you and me.

871
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,040
Bob's been a pathetic fool.

872
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,220
And I tell you what, that J.R. Bob Dobbs will be a fool again.

873
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,680
He's a fool today.

874
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,200
He's a fool tomorrow.

875
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,080
Because he's the same Bob.

876
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,440
He's always the same Bob.

877
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,160
And he's working for you and me.

878
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,860
But it's that foolishness that has kept man from being satisfied with his lot.

879
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:10,660
That has kept man building his great gas powered automobile engines, his nuclear reactors that made him want to master the earth no matter how nice it might have been before.

880
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,980
And it gives us friends.

881
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,680
It gives us that mighty hate.

882
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,040
The hate that makes us want to smite our brothers.

883
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,560
The hate that makes us get up in the morning.

884
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,160
And friends.

885
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,540
Without that foolishness and that mighty hate, why, we'd be no different from those normals.

886
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,480
Because we'd have nothing to gripe about.

887
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:31,160
And it's the mighty gripe power and the hate that gives us something for nothing.

888
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,200
Oh, in the long run, we may be poor and broke.

889
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,860
We may be drunk and neurotic.

890
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,980
But we've got Bob and the hate.

891
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,080
And for that, we can hate him.

892
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,220
Hate him.

893
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,040
Hate him.

894
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,940
And that's the power that we have.

895
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,680
And they don't have.

896
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,280
Oh, they got plenty of that diddly kind of hate.

897
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,880
Oh, I hate President Reagan.

898
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,840
Oh, I hate my job.

899
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,240
I hate myself.

900
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,640
That's the sick hate, friends.

901
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,040
That ain't no kind of hate at all.

902
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,320
We got that all-inclusive kind of hate.

903
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,220
That hate essence.

904
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,220
And it's the love of the hate that allows us to put up with just about anything.

905
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,640
So we can do something about it.

906
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:10,260
Because the Bob hate is indistinguishable from the Bob love.

907
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,640
It's what keeps him on his toes.

908
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,980
Bob is the aware man.

909
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,160
The natural man.

910
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,740
He can be walking along, humming to himself, playing pocket pool.

911
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,460
But the inner Bob is aware.

912
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,060
He can hear a fly.

913
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:20,140
He can hear a fly.

914
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,160
He can hear a fly sniff on a mountain far away.

915
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,220
And he can go up to that fly and look that fly in the eye and say, son, I'd like to sell

916
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,600
you a big old mound of waste byproducts from physical organisms.

917
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,360
And that fly will give his wings to Bob.

918
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,360
Bob is aware.

919
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,940
And that's how he can sell to these inferior creatures.

920
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,920
And that fly, he's going to be a better fly for it.

921
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,200
All those other flies, they're flitting from pile to pile.

922
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,340
They see him just sitting there without any wings on that big old mound of Bob.

923
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,840
And they may laugh now.

924
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,820
But winter goes by.

925
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,660
Summer goes by.

926
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,220
All those other flies starve.

927
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:56,580
But that little Bob fly, he's still sitting there on that pile, a munching away and a

928
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,080
munching away.

929
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,960
And that pile does not change because Bob, my friends, does not change.

930
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,180
Oh, he changes his mind.

931
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,720
He might suddenly change all the doctrine in the whole church right in the middle of

932
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,160
a ritual to teach us all an important lesson.

933
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,940
But oh, my friend, Bob Dobbs does not change.

934
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,660
Hold that name on the tip of your tongue.

935
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,100
Bob.

936
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,440
There's a B on either side.

937
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,180
Opposite poles.

938
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,280
That's a lesson right there.

939
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,760
Flip it over on your tongue.

940
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,840
Say it front way.

941
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,560
Say it backwards.

942
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,480
Say it upside down.

943
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,260
And what does it say?

944
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,520
It says Bob.

945
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,640
Because Bob does not change.

946
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,280
His promise rings true.

947
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,300
But if you ain't been sprinkled in the blood of the head, if you ain't been washed in the

948
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,480
waste byproducts of Bob, how are you going to get saved?

949
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:39,920
You can go to that party Saturday night, but you got to be wearing Bob's shadow.

950
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,120
You can drink beer.

951
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,080
You just got to get Bob drunk too.

952
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,440
And what about Wanda?

953
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,260
Oh, you're just going to have to give Wanda over to Bob.

954
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:47,260


955
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,060
That shouldn't be any problem.

956
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,360
Because Wanda, she found out from Bob how to get to heaven.

957
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,260
Sit down, boy.

958
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,440
Because friends, if you're wondering, Bob can love.

959
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,080
Bob can love.

960
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,640
Radio job.

961
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,560
I didn't set foot in a church for three years.

962
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,520
I was just fed up to here with it.

963
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:22,480
After working as an announcer at stations in several cities, I finally got to Hollywood.

964
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:27,300
I was offered four jobs, and I took one with a major network.

965
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:32,960
In 1947, I made a business trip to Cincinnati.

966
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:39,780
And it was just about then that the Kenneth Arnold sighting of the so-called flying saucers

967
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,460
hit the headlines.

968
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,680
And it caused a lot of conversation.

969
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,500
I was a little bit nervous.

970
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:45,500


971
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,240
I noticed you keep looking out the window.

972
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,080
You wouldn't be looking for these flying saucers, would you?

973
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,820
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.

974
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,760
You don't think it's just some kind of a publicity stunt then, huh?

975
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,340
No.

976
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,320
It's reasonable to suppose that there's life on other planets.

977
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,960
Maybe I ought to start looking for flying saucers too.

978
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,680
If they do come from another planet, how will we know?

979
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,960
Listen, when the occupants condescend to tell us, that's when.

980
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:15,500
I'm going to go.

981
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:15,500


982
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:15,500


983
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:15,500


984
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:15,500


985
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:15,500


986
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:15,500


987
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:15,500


988
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:15,500


989
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:15,500


990
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:15,500


991
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:15,500


992
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,500


993
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:29,300
Good God! Good God! Good God! Good God! Good God!

994
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,120
Now, Bob, you're getting to be a pretty big fella.

995
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,780
Yes, sir, maybe this is a good idea, a chance for us to have a little talk.

996
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,120
Why, sure, Dad. What's cooking?

997
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,200
Uh, remember the last time we talked about this old body of ours, Bob?

998
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,100
Yeah. Yeah, I remember, Dad.

999
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:48,500
No.

1000
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,500
Oh, here's a match. Your pipe's gone out again.

1001
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,320
Well, thanks.

1002
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,440
But when a doctor speaks of the male organ, he...

1003
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,840
Well, he calls it a...

1004
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,040
When a man and a woman are married, Bob,

1005
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,540
they love each other very much.

1006
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,360
And in showing their love,

1007
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,820
their instinct is to embrace each other as if...

1008
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:16,160
Well, as if to try to become the one person God intended them to be.

1009
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,580
The sperm, as the doctors call it.

1010
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,220
Oh, is that the seed that helps make a new baby?

1011
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,500
No, no, Bob.

1012
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,540
Well, what I'm talking about now is the fluid that contains the...

1013
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,200
formed in two little sacs beneath the penis, which we call the...

1014
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,680
Oh, but, Dad, why do fellas get these...

1015
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,780
these feelings before they get married?

1016
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,040
Now, that's a good question, Bob.

1017
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,560
Why do you ask here?

1018
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,580
Well, there were some drawings in Bob's textbook.

1019
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,140
What's the book?

1020
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,220
I mean, to look at them honest and...

1021
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,020
Well, then some of the older girls, well...

1022
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,260
You mean they talk about things sometimes?

1023
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,260
Well, yes.

1024
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,380
Bob!

1025
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,580
Bob?

1026
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,020
Yes, Bob.

1027
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,020
What's wrong with Bob?

1028
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,400
Bob!

1029
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,820
I know Bob, Bob days.

1030
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:08,520
Bob, that's Bob, that's Bob.

1031
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,660
...solidly commemorate...

1032
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,140
Bob, Bob.

1033
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,020
...the martyrdom of the prophet herald of our faith,

1034
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,820
called Bob.

1035
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:24,880
And in today's program, we're going to deal with the story of the Bob's martyrdom

1036
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,240
and the events surrounding it.

1037
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:27,700
Wow!

1038
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,980
On that blistering July summer day,

1039
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:38,500
there were the barrels of 750 rifles awaiting the command to fire

1040
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,680
and take the Bob's life.

1041
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,200
He seemed so young to die,

1042
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:45,500
barely 30.

1043
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,480
He was a handsome, gentle, and confident man.

1044
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:55,600
Could I possibly be guilty of the shocking crime of which he was accused?

1045
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,020
Would you get off your knees?

1046
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,040
Somewhat unorthodox, wouldn't you say?

1047
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,980
Reverend Scott, but realistic.

1048
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,020
You deliver sermons like this, it's a wonder you're still an ordained minister.

1049
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,200
Or are you?

1050
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:06,880
The best kind.

1051
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,180
Angry, rebellious, critical, a renegade.

1052
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,120
Stripped of most of my so-called clerical powers.

1053
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,980
But I'm still in business.

1054
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,840
Well, you seem to be enjoying the punishment.

1055
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:19,540
Punishment?

1056
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,200
Ah, the church has blessed me, that's what it's done.

1057
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,580
Vanished to some new country in Africa.

1058
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,180
Hell, I had to look it up on the map to find out where I was going.

1059
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,100
Oh, my bishop doesn't know it, but he's given me exactly what I wanted.

1060
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:34,960
Elbow room.

1061
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,120
Freedom!

1062
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,640
Real freedom!

1063
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,220
Get him to dump all the rules and all the trappings.

1064
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,620
And freedom to discover God in my own way.

1065
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,340
Did you call this an act?

1066
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,540
They said it was an act, not every act.

1067
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,460
Come on!

1068
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:05,020
I saw a car, I saw an article in the reading of a recent Billy Graham column on religion.

1069
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,380
It said, Dear Dr. Graham, I recently converted to Christianity.

1070
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,660
And yet I'm not presently...

1071
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,640
Killing doctors for Bob.

1072
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,220
Is this perhaps a theological contradiction?

1073
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,200
You're not feeding a born-again Christian without, at this moment, killing doctors for Bob.

1074
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,920
That's the kind of forces we have against us.

1075
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,740
Oh, hell, somebody needs a medical exam.

1076
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:32,300
We've got to go.

1077
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,500
My legs are on fire!

1078
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,380
The hour for Christ's return was at hand.

1079
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:50,460
The years between 1843 and 1847 were generally accepted as the time for the return of Christ.

1080
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:57,900
A young man there declared that he was the one foretold in all the holy books of the past.

1081
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:03,520
He said he had come to usher in a new era, a new springtime in the hearts of men.

1082
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,240
He was called the Bob.

1083
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,080
His name means the door or the gate.

1084
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,700
And his teaching was to be the gateway.

1085
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,520
To the new age of unity.

1086
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:19,940
The world is one country, and mankind its citizens.

1087
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,920
There is only one religion, and all the prophets have taught it.

1088
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:26,660
Hellfire!

1089
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,100
All right!

1090
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,020
Okay, there's something else, too.

1091
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:39,940
I noticed last Sunday that one of you put a quarter in the offering plate, see?

1092
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:42,680
Yeah, Raymond Welch.

1093
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,880
You're the one.

1094
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,420
You put a quarter in there.

1095
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,940
You tight son of a...

1096
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,320
I see all that, see?

1097
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,160
I'm up here where I can see it.

1098
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,900
Y'all don't even look or nothing.

1099
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,460
I can see it.

1100
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,900
I know whatever one of you is giving.

1101
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,120
All right.

1102
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,880
I'm gonna maybe go to another church.

1103
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,740
I don't know.

1104
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:09,880
I don't give a...

1105
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:14,020
Because I just about come to the end of the road.

1106
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:17,340
Here I've just about lost patience with you people.

1107
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:21,720
You know we need a Sunday School space out there.

1108
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:29,960
And as Jesus had spoken to Peter the fisherman, the Bob spoke to a Persian student named Mullah Hussain.

1109
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:36,620
Mullah Hussain described in his own words what his experience was like.

1110
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,660
I sat still.

1111
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:38,720
I sat still.

1112
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,760
He was all bound by his utterance, oblivious of time.

1113
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:50,060
This revelation so suddenly and impetuously thrust upon me came as a thunderbolt which

1114
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,940
for a time seemed to have benumbed my faculties.

1115
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,220
God is pretty busy.

1116
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:03,140
He's got a long term plan for humanity that stretches far beyond our comprehension.

1117
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:08,080
So it's not reasonable to expect him to concern himself with the individual.

1118
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:16,380
The individual is important only to the extent of providing a creative link between the past and the future.

1119
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,060
In his children.

1120
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,660
Or in his grandchildren.

1121
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,120
Or in the contribution he makes to humanity.

1122
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,400
Therefore, don't pray to God to solve your problems.

1123
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,340
Pray to that part of God within you.

1124
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:38,100
To have the guts to fight for yourself.

1125
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,200
God wants brave souls.

1126
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,340
He wants winners.

1127
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,220
Not quitters.

1128
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,440
If you can't win, at least try to win.

1129
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,080
God loves triers.

1130
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,400
Is that right, Robin?

1131
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,460
Right.

1132
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,120
You're dealing with something totally alien.

1133
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,600
Those hypnotic eyes.

1134
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,760
Alien. Totally alien.

1135
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:08,700
Something that must be.

1136
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,680
Incredibly.

1137
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,300
Unbelievably.

1138
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,620
Something totally alien.

1139
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,860
Looks like he's scrolling.

1140
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,680
It's like I told Hitler that time.

1141
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,940
Back when we were just a couple of running buddies.

1142
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,220
One man's a bummer, another man's a beautiful thing.

1143
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,520
And he always believed in that.

1144
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,560
I kinda think these guys in this van

1145
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,680
are a bunch of stupid little loony birds.

1146
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,380
Well, man.

1147
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,520
This is a pretty cool place, though.

1148
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,820
Even if I'm by my head.

1149
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,540
Robber.

1150
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,080
You've got to be a robber.

1151
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:58,020
You've got to be a robber.

1152
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,360
When you're singing this song.

1153
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,720
Yeah, you've got to be a robber.

1154
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,760
For throbbing all night long.

1155
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,240
Well, you've got to be a robber.

1156
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,400
Yeah.

1157
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,120
Probably singing this song.

1158
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,780
A big robber.

1159
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:17,980
Huh!

1160
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,820
When you're singing this song.

1161
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,140
Well, you got to be a robber.

1162
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,360
For throbbing all night long.

1163
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,500
Whoo-hoo.

1164
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,840
For throbbing.

1165
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,700
Well, singing this song.

1166
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:42,640
Sifting a measured quantity of tanned flakes down into curved paper, spreading the flakes

1167
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,920
so that they lay equal at the ends, with a slight depression in the middle.

1168
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:54,360
Thumbs rolling the paper's inner edge down and up under the outer edge as four fingers

1169
00:56:54,360 --> 00:57:01,200
pressed it over, thumbs and fingers sliding to the paper's inner ends to hold it even

1170
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:07,720
while tongue licked the flap, left forefinger and thumb pinching their end, while right

1171
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:13,680
forefinger and thumb smoothed the damp seam, right forefinger and thumb twisting their

1172
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:13,980
end.

1173
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:28,380
Promise, you've got to stop promise, before you wreck your lungs, you've got to stop promise,

1174
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,180
wreck your lungs.

1175
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:40,200
Oh love, if you don't stop promise, you won't be green, drop it, no more.

1176
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,640
You've got to stop promise, boy, you've got black lung or something there.

1177
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,420
Huh!

1178
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,920
Well you've got to stop promise for about four or five hours in real time, you've got

1179
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,380
to stop promise, you've got to stop promise, you've got to stop promise, you've got to

1180
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,280
stop promise.

1181
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,960
A human mug is something that can't take that type of torment.

1182
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,860
Anguished pain for a death long, stigitory time.

1183
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,600
So, will you stop dropping now son or?

1184
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,980
Well, that's just, that's it.

1185
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,120
Huh!

1186
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:21,360
But you know what happens when you stop dropping?

1187
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,280
Well then pretty soon you're gonna come down son, you know what's gonna happen then?

1188
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,920
You know what's gonna happen when you come down.

1189
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,180
Well that's what you've gotta do, you've gotta stop.

1190
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:31,180


1191
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:33,960
You got to stop froppin'

1192
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:41,260
Oh, friends, that's the Swingin' Love Corpses,

1193
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,460
the uncharacteristic song,

1194
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,800
You Got to Stop Froppin'.

1195
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,800
Say, mama, come back now

1196
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,800
I'll tell you right now

1197
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,300
You got to stop froppin'

1198
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,780
Frop, frop, froppin'

1199
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:59,040
You got to stop froppin'

1200
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,080
Yes, that's Dr. Philo Drummond singing,

1201
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,620
Bob's right brain man,

1202
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,860
the co-founder of the Church of the Subgenius,

1203
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:09,440
now an obscure garage band bass player.

1204
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,340
You ain't proud of it

1205
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:13,340
But

1206
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,420
You got me whacking your soul

1207
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,960
And after that, we come to Pastor Bob Minkin'

1208
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,460
taking us out to the end of the show with this mighty hit.

1209
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,860
Drinking Budweiser

1210
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:28,520
Watching Bob on TV

1211
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:33,900
Oh, swallowing red men

1212
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:38,240
The day my coon dog died

1213
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,060
Reading the pamphlet

1214
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,220
Over and over again

1215
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,760
I was drinking Budweiser

1216
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,320
And Bob was on TV

1217
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,500
Oh, swallowing red men

1218
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,260
The day that Uncle

1219
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:05,880
Got kicked by a mule

1220
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,620
I was with Cousin Junior

1221
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,120
But the ending backfired

1222
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,440
I was drunk

1223
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,760
I was lonely

1224
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,740
I was plastered

1225
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:28,500
I was drinking Budweiser

1226
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:28,500


1227
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:33,020
And Bob was on TV

1228
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,800
Drinking Budweiser

1229
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,420
Watching Bob on TV

1230
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,820
Swallowing red men

1231
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,100
The day my coon dog died

1232
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,880
Oh, reading the pamphlet

1233
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,480
Over and over again

1234
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:58,480


1235
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:58,480


1236
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:58,480


1237
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:58,480


1238
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:58,480


1239
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,080
I was drinking Budweiser

1240
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,860
And Bob was on TV

1241
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,600
I was drinking Budweiser

1242
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,560
Oh, yes.

1243
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,040
Dear friends.

1244
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,200
That was Bucknakin' and Jay Burzooing.

1245
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,400
Drinking Bud, watching Bob.

1246
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:28,460
You can write to Bob at P.O. Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas 75216.

1247
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,580
And in the meantime, this is KNON.

1248
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,300
Oh, God.

1249
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,340
I'm going to have to.

1250
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:35,740
.

1251
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:35,740


1252
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:35,740


1253
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:35,740


1254
