From PR News in Washington, I'm drinking alcohol, including whiskey.
PR's report reports that I'm not dangerous.
They can drink up without fear.
A rescue ship carrying inappropriate government officials and alcohol industry executives say they were PR News, Washington.
What's it going to be, eh?
Is it going to be in and out of institutions like this?
Or are you going to attend to the divine word?
The So Genius.
The Power of...
What?
This is some new form of torture.
Say it, brother, sir.
I hope to God it'll torture you to madness.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Dragging your butt through the day.
Selling your body and your soul to a bunch of bland normals.
Acting stupid so they'll think you're one of them.
I'm tired of getting up.
I'm tired of all the guilt.
But none of the sex.
There is a simple answer, dear friend.
A glowing beacon of slack amidst the turmoil and darkness.
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living slack master at his church of the So Genius.
Praise Bob.
Bob brings a new destiny to the abnormal.
Bob comes to Just a Bob.
He's the one who's gonna destroy our sins.
To unmask the conspiracy.
And to get us back the slack they stole away.
It's us, sir, says them.
Are you going to fry in hell alongside the pink boys?
Or are you going to pull the wheel over your own eyes?
And accept Bob into your mind?
And repent?
And go in your nab?
Slack off and...
Praise Bob.
The church of the So Genius.
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.
Oh yes, dear friends.
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1796.
Thank you, Leemur, for the opening credits.
And the piece we started off with was by Santiago Trejo.
Probably Reverend Santiago Trejo.
I'm not sure I got that off of one of the Facebook...
One of the subgenius Facebook pages.
The number of which is too damn high.
Our music in the background right now is the Swingin' Love Corpses from the Bay Mixes tape.
And on and off during this show we're gonna be reading from the Dobbs Town Mirror.
That's a kind of a newspaper that you get if you...
If you get anything in the mail from Subgenius.
All the membership packs have them.
And basically if you...
Anybody who gets a face mask or book or anything at all from us gets the Dobbs Town Mirror.
And some cool stickers.
All of which are courtesy of Mayor Uncle...
Uncle Onan Canobite and Dr. Philodrumon.
But Mayor Canobite is the mayor of Dobbs.Town.
Which is a forum on the internet for Subgenius members only.
But the Dobbs Town Mirror is in a printed thing.
This one's from August of 2020.
And what you find in the Dobbs.Town Mirror...
Are things to see, say, do and buy.
Oh no. Things to see, say, do, think, know and buy.
I'm sorry. I looked away for a minute to check my volumes.
Things to see, say, do, think, know and buy.
From the Dobbs Town Mirror. Greatest offer yet.
Friends, the church of the Subgenius is happening now.
You probably missed Dada, Surrealism and Fluxus.
You probably missed Hippie, Punk and Rave.
You probably missed Jonestown, Waco and Heaven's Gate.
But the church of the Subgenius is happening now and you haven't missed it!
The best mail order mind control cult at this price range is yours to join and mutate to your own ends today.
If you will.
We'll but decide you're not going to put your slack off any further.
X Day approaches.
The church of the Subgenius, friends.
Taking the bore out of being born.
What other mind control cults put you in the driver's seat with two steering wheels?
Don't forget the


Ol
Fear keeps us safe from the light
Why would anyone open their eyes?
Till the night
All hours are lost
All hours are lost
All hours are lost
Money and war
Humanity fucked from the start
Till the night
All hours are lost
Till the night
All hours are lost
Till the night

This is not a joke
My dear, we're gonna drown
Can't we dance as the bridges burn down
Can't we dance as the bridges burn down
Yeah, we're gonna drown
Drown, drown, drown, drown
Slash and burn and scorch the earth
Every time, can't we get it right?
We breed it fine and eschatize
Make up your mind, can't we get it right?
Stranger in that frowning ancient mind
Be kind, rewind, don't go to the light
Any hope, it's a violent call
The blurt is and the fool
Grifters and shoggies crash the game
The best ultra-glon-noo-oo
All good and fun, but this is not
A pretty white world
And this is not
A coke and a smile
And this is not
A dope flaky light
Dude, we're gonna drown
Can't we dance as the bridges burn down?
Can't we dance as the bridges burn down?
Can't we dance as the bridges burn down?
Yeah, we're gonna drown
Drown, drown, drown
Drown, drown, drown

Thank you.
Thank you.
Bob and the Exists have access to the Book of Life, listing all paid members.
The likes of you and I, however, may never know if a kindness or cruelty was unknowingly wasted on a fellow subgenius.
The unusual Swingin' Love Corps version of Purple Haze.
And I ain't trying to be braggin', but I'm flying on a sub-dragon.
And all I wanna do is set the world on fire.
To watch the light bounce off your eyes is my desire.
Lost love through a space rift.
And now I'm just negative.
And now I'm just negative.
Another flaming and burning song.
I want to set the world on fire by Reverend Negative.
So very strange that in September of 2020 in the USA,
there would be this outbreak of songs about the world burning up with fire and sickness.
Jeepers. I wonder what that's about.
From the Dobbs Dock Town Mirror.
Psychic Research.
The so-called problem of evil asks why a benevolent God would allow suffering.
This is only a problem for mainstream religions.
The Church of the Subgenius knows that suffering feeds the Elder Gods.
And it's as simple as that.
What is frustrating to the subgenius is not that suffering happens, but that it happens to the wrong people.
Namely, anyone who is suffering.
And anyone who ever bothered us to any degree at any time.
Including other members of the Church of the Subgenius.
We welcome suffering when it happens to them.
Time for a story now from the mysterious Sheridan of Cleveland.
He has a double CD of these stories.
All of which had to adhere to three strict rules.
One, the two main characters must be opposing near and far.

Two, there must be at least one crass commercial and unpaid for reference to some product.
And three, there must be a gnat in every story.
This one is Adam and Eve.
It was a gleefully, unabashedly, unashamed morning.
And the sun shone like an overexposed tanned yellow butt in the sky with a crack in it.
Nets.
Circled Adam's yucky umbrella drink.
And took turns diving down the suction straw.
Like poor travelers on a Price's Wraith vacation in their first and last tube ride.
Reaching for his alcoholic pleasure, he promptly plunged the straw into his eye yet again and again.
And he was in the water.
Eve curled her straight hair around her fuck you finger and didn't bother to look.
She's been here more times than she's used the finger.
Her, always the thinking, responsible one.
Him, always the drunken drinker.
She, always the drunk.

Always looks to the potential ahead of them.
And he, no further than the drink before him.
What's the blend today, dear?
She casually asks.
Yerk pus and pomegranate pulpy, he burps.
And scratches his neck mole.
Want some?
She nods and holds out her hand to accept the foul smelling mixture.
She grimaces and stomps the ground once.
From her generic dollar store lounger which kits up dust covering her tan bare foot.
Including the custom salon toenail paintings of butterflies and birds.
With a specially mixed magenta background.
Ground blend.
Not bad!
She shrieked at the top of her now destroyed vocal cords.
Not bad!
But needs more bumblebee anus.
Not nearly as good as your used chew tobacco jar, swamp puddle juice mixture.
Well, it's not like I'm a good drinker.



It's not like I'm trying.
It's not like I'm not trying.
But I'll kill you yet.
And no I did not just say that out loud.
What's that dear?
Adam, who is near sighted, lethargically reaches for his drink three times before tumbling it off.
The 100% solid water.
The only left drink of the day.
The most
And the only.
The only.
The only.
The only.
The only.
The only.
The only.
The only.
fact that corrective lenses had not yet been invented.
EVE disappeared with a rustling of tree branches and an inviting sideways glance into the thick
forest not yet protected by goddamn clueless tree-hogging bleeding-hard environmentalist
fucks that are way over their goddamn save-the-earth bloated heads.
Too lazy, bored, and drunk, Adam sat there and pissed himself, staining the Canadian-made
wicker all-weather lounger with a lifetime warranty even against, yes, even against drunken
pissing after a dissing.
Barefoot Eve leaves the trail of
all-weather loungers with a lifetime warranty even against, yes, even against drunken pissing after a dissing.
Barefoot Eve leaves the trail of all-weather loungers with a lifetime warranty even against,
yes, even against drunken pissing after a dissing.
As she makes her way through the woods . . . leaving a path that would later become the Cleveland Metropolitan
Park's memorial trey…
As she walks, tree roots stinging the soft pulp
of her feet, she mulls over her relationship with Adam.
. . .
. . . In her first intimate account of the series,你看 is pretty much an example of Adam's

she remembers laughing at the tiny blurry thing between his legs.
What's this thing do? she snickered.
In the first display of modesty ever,
Adam covered his privates with a mighty oak leaf.
Unfortunately, it was a mighty poisonous leaf,
and he applied whatever and fuck he found until it healed.
He then approached Eve and flicked her left nipple
with his mighty male dominant middle fuck you finger.
Eve refused.

Eve refused to give in to modesty until she scored her victorious secret links.
And besides, if she had it, she was going to show it before age would surely blow it.
Adam turned, disheartened, and made his way back through the woods,
leaving Eve behind because, well, because he's stupid.
Eve was hungry and thirsty from her travels.
Eve tries to train her vision on the objects hanging from the trees closest to her.
She reaches out for food, but grasped a slimy, coiled snake instead.
I shall be a tattoo on your lower back.
I shall be a tattoo on your lower back.
Coiling around your round buttocks,
reaching down your left leg and ending at the soft tendon in your ankle,
the snake said.
The hell you say, yells Eve.
I have allergies.
It squeezed the snake's head until its eyes popped open.
It popped out like BBs and put the eyes out of the nearest budding potato.
Gonna need to readjust your vision plan now, bitch, she said,
as she fashioned the snake skin into a new pair of walking boots.
And that was Sheridan.
Sheridan from old Cleveland.
Oh, Sheridan tells some funny, funny stories.
And now this.
From the Dobbs Dot Town Mirror.
Rational living.
If nature doesn't make a great deal of something,
then that something is usually neither cost-effective,
nor quite bothersome enough to breed out entirely.
Like some rare diseases.
Like being left-handed.
Like high intelligence.
The Church of the Subgenius offers the first ray of hope
that there is a cure for the IQ problem.
Beyond alcohol.
Beyond traumatic brain injury.
Humans are the missing link between earlier primates and A.I.
The Church of the Subgenius is the missing link between earlier primates and humans.
And between humans and A.I.
Meet enough subgenii, and you'll see what I mean.
Many are both.
And so can you.
Stop stalking. Stop stalking. Stop stalking. Stop stalking.
Are there any weirdos here tonight?
What, I'll be damned.
Aren't there, fuck, any chance any fucking weirdos here tonight?
I'm so surprised.
Would there by any chance be any fucked-up weirdos on drugs and alcohol here tonight, my friend?
Well, in that case, I wanna hear a PRAISE BOB!
Now, there are some few of you here who may not know a damn thing about the Church of the Subgenius.
And I will make it short and sweet.
Friends, there's only three things you need to know about the Church of the Subgenius.
That's Bob, Slack.
I think some, I can tell that some of you here know about Slack.
But the other thing you need to know about is...
THE CONSPIENCY!
You know, every church has got some kind of rules and laws.
We only have one.
And I think some of you know what it is.
It is, fuck them if they can't take a joke!
And believe it or not, as cynical as that may sound, that is indeed a philosophy that you can live by.
The Church of the Subgenius is down here.
And it's a philosophy that was founded in 1953 by this salesman, this incredibly magically talented salesman, J.R. Bob Dobbs.
When he was seized up in the spirit by an alien space monster called Jehovah One.
Which has disguised itself as God for numerous religions over the centuries.
And he told Bob that throughout history there has been a conspiracy of normal people stealing away the Slack.
Of the weirdos, the abnormals, the misfits, the disbelievers, and most important of all, those who will believe anything.
Can I get a praise Bob?
Yes!
So, he founded his church not on a rock, but on a sandy shifting beach of hypocrisy.
Because where is any religion without its hypocrisy, I ask you?
It's not that we love Bob that much, it's that we love the idea of everybody else burning in hell!
Yes!
We're crickets like any other religion.
Yes!
You know, that's what it's all about.
But, it is a doing yourself religion.
It is a disorganized religion, a non-organization for non-joiners.
Which makes it hard to make a buck off this thing.
All subgeniuses by definition are different.
If any two are alike, one must die!
So check your neighbor out, make that decision quick.
The only thing that we as subgeniuses have in common,
is that we have nothing in common with the normal!
Look at the word subgenius.
We didn't call it church of the genes, okay?
Almost anybody can qualify.
What we're saying is that conspiracy has been misdefining intelligence all this time.
It's not intelligence that we're talking about.
That's not what counts.
What counts is sense, common sense, sense of humor, and dollars and cents.
And, uh, after the show, sense of media, I guess.
But the thing is, Bob is not smart.
Wouldn't being smart ever get you a date?
Well, actually, in this crowd, maybe it did.
But what he has is luck!
He has luckyism.
The reason that Bob can do magic and you can't, is he doesn't know any better.
He walks the path of least resistance, friends.
That is his path to slack.
And it can be yours, too.
But here's the thing about slack.
We're not gonna tell you what it is because we can't.
Only you know what slack is for you!
Now, for some reason,
for some people, slack is sitting in front of the TV set and smoking a beer or whatever.
Uh, for other people, like me, slack is working your ass off at what you wanted to be working your ass off at.
Uh, we're not here to forgive your sins.
Bob Gobs is not the kind of, uh, messiah that...
He's not that well connected.
And on top of that, he does not actually give one flip of a shit about your sins!
He doesn't care about your sins!
He comes not to forgive your sins.
He brings not forgiveness, but an excuse!
That's all you really needed was an excuse.
And that is what he is for.
Now, he is here to bring, to bring a reminder of slack.
Now, slack is, as I said, it's indefinable.
You might call it something for nothing.
Now, a lot of people think, oh, this church is ugly and this is just all about money.
Well, that, too.
Slack is connected to money.
Slack is connected to sex.
But Bob is slack!
Bob is money!
Bob is sex!
And Bob is coming!
For boys, girls, and everybody in between.
Ask not what Bob is smoking in his pipe, for he is smoking you!
You throw yourself into that damn pipe!
Bob is a short-duration personal savior.
After a while, you get tired of Bob and move on to the next personal savior.
It might be some porno star or Star Trek, God forbid.
The only thing, friends, that we have standing in between us and slack is that conspiracy I mentioned.
Now, a lot of you folks know about the Cougar.
There's a lot of conspiracies.
There's going to be one for everybody.
There's the JFK conspiracy, the UFOs crashing at Roswell, the 9-11 truther conspiracy, worst of all, the fashion conspiracy.
Friends, don't worry about a one-world government or a one-world religion.
You should be worried about a one-world advertising.
That shit's going to bend you over and not even have the common decency to give you a reach around.
We're not asking for love, because this is a war.
It's really us versus them, and this time we're us!
For once, friends, we're trying to lead a return to decadence.
Not trendiness, but decadence.
Luckily, I won't be following that.
I'm going to be followed by two hot chicks and one other of the old name.
Who?
And then by an architect who will return.
In the meantime, friends, yeah, this is a free country, all right?
You're free to work your ass off, right?
They even have a machine now that can tell when you're thinking.
It's called a television.
And if it's off, you're guilty.
Friends, all we're trying to do is tempt you.
We're sinners away from the devil.
We don't give a head fuck where you go after that.
We believe in the God that doesn't want us to believe in it.
That's how ornery we are.
We are unbuckling the Bible Belt so that its pants will drop to its ankles,
and it will be forced to gaze unflinching upon its own private desires.
Ah, yes.
Bob said, don't just eat that hamburger.
Eat the hell out of it.
And that goes for everything you do.
I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to, as Bob said.
And I could go on and tell you about the sex cult and the deviation and the special X-Day drills and so forth,
mind control that we tend to do on you.
But I have to confess something to y'all.
There have been times when I used to look out on what's normally a free country,
and I'd see a pretty small audience of subgeniuses, and I'd think,
God damn, some of these people are real nerds.
I would get frustrated at the sheer nerdliness of half of the subgeniuses.
But then one day, I suddenly went,
D'oh! That's what this is all about!
It finally sunk in.
Yes, they are fucked up because there really is a conspiracy of normals stealing away their slack.
They are fucked up, and that's why J.R. Bob Dobbs is their god.
And that is why you, you my friend, you must repent, quit your job, and slack off while you still know how.
Question authority.
I see a few people out there have been reading their prescriptions.
Bob is not, now believe it or not,
Some of you Bobbies are going to be surprised by this,
Bob is not the answer,
But neither Christ Bob is anything else.
But there's one thing I want to leave you with,
And that is that one rule of Bob,
The one rule of the Church of the Subgenius,
Fuck them if they can't take a chump.
Christ Bob! Christ Bob! Christ Bob!
Christ Bob! Christ Bob! Christ Bob!
Christ Bob! Christ Bob! Christ Bob!
Man, we did some serious ranting back in those days.
That was a mix by Slander Bob from a DeVival recording of me preaching.
He calls it Rantomania from 2010.
Boy, I guess I was working harder back then.
Of course, I was probably 20 years younger.
Hmm, crazy.
And now this.
From the Dobbs.town Mirror.
New way to health.
Slap.
Slack is the force that causes people to ask, what is slack?
Blessed necessity.
Immoral?
Read this twice.
There are many moral systems and they often contradict each other.
Even if you pick one and only one and adhere to it faithfully, it is you who decided that
one was the correct one.
That makes you the arbitrator of morals.
You can't be the arbitrator of morals.
You can't be the arbitrator of ethics, morals, morals, and immorality.
Diversify your ethical portfolio with the Church of the Subgenius.
Keep your existing beliefs.
Add and subtract beliefs as you already do.
Except now, openly, with Slack and with JR Bob Dobbs at your side.
This music is the Swingin' Love Corpses.
This is the Swingin' Love Corpses.

And from Dobbs.Town Mirror, A Cure for Magic.
Years ago, I was entering a building with someone I worked with.
She pulled some change out of her pocket and threw it on the steps.
I asked why. She said to her it was some change, but if a child found it, they'd feel lucky.
Think about how good it feels to feel lucky.
You know, it's like a little child.
You don't even have to have a lucky experience to have that feeling.
Seek it out. Pretend if that gets you started.
Think, I'm lucky and today is a lucky day.
Try it for three days running and see what happens.
