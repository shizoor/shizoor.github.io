1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,040
The mind of man has always longed to know what lies beyond the world we live in.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,220
Explorers have ventured into the deeps and the heights.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,780
Of these explorers, some are scientists, some are mystics.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,100
Each is driven by a different purpose.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,000
The one thing they share in common is a wish to cross the borderlands that lie beyond...

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,880
The subgenius power of slack.

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,100
Stand by.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,040
Stand by, please.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,420
1-3-0-1-3

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,600
1-3-0-1-3

12
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,980
1-3-0-1-3

13
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,080
1-3-0-1-3-6

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,920
1-3-0-1-3-6

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,560
1-3-0-1-3-6

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,160
1-3-0-1-3-6

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,920
1-3-0-1-3-6

18
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,040
1-3-0-1-3-6

19
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,500
1-3-0-1-3-6

20
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,280
1-3-0-1-3-6

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,240
1-3-0-1-3-6

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,720
Helis shedsではed.

23
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,220
If you're right...

24
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,620
1-3-0-1-3-6

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,940
Sit re-enter the underground trio and you will find your place 5 star- súper reflections down end sweet過 to the back into the give sender admission

26
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:06,960
out of condoms, it's just the right size for five or six of them.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,240
Some of them get the hard first aid kit in the box.

28
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:17,120
Do we really? We have a box of real condoms in the first aid kit? Oh, yeah, I wanted to mention...

29
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,880
The ones with Bob and Connie on them?

30
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:28,200
This may come as a dreadful surprise, but the official medical team here,

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,900
at least until Nikki Death Chick arrives, is Princess Wee and myself.

32
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:41,160
I actually had ambulance technician training. Oh, he's performed medical experiments before.

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,420
Don't worry, you'll be in good hands on the island of Dr. Stan.

34
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:52,320
My human millipede was a tragic problem. A run of the millipede.

35
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,180
We have a first aid kit.

36
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,180


37
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,840
And some pills for diarrhea and stuff like that.

38
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:11,760
And there's plenty of subgenius mama type people who probably have plenty of remedies in their bags.

39
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,160
Oh, is that splinter hurting you here? Let me pull that splinter out.

40
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:23,580
While Dr. Drummond slams your ankles with a sledgehammer, you won't feel that splinter a bit.

41
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,140
No, no, no.

42
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,200
So there's plenty of medical-ish...

43
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,470
attention.

44
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:34,450
But the easiest way to deal with it is not to become injured in the first place.

45
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:42,350
Right. Don't, you know, where it says, don't swim down to old C. Quas Den.

46
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,930
Look, I know you're subgenius. That's your cue to do just that very thing.

47
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,350
But in this particular case, you might not want to.

48
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:56,270
Or, you know, I've noticed the, if you go hiking on the trails out here,

49
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:01,250
which I very strongly recommend as a trail hiker,

50
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:10,150
there are occasional yellow ribbons, you know, like a yellow ribbon that keeps,

51
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,730
to keep you from going further into that part of the woods.

52
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,130
That's because there is no that part of the woods.

53
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,870
You'll go off of a cliff.

54
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,130
Either that or it's all that part of the woods.

55
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,830
Right. Yeah.

56
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,330
There are some really steep cliffs.

57
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:30,290
And dumbasses, as well as subgeniuses,

58
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,250
have lately been known to go plummeting into the depths.

59
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,370
Not at this campground, but at nearby ones, near Athens.

60
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,410
The gravity's really fierce around here.

61
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,770
Yes, and it will get tougher, too.

62
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,070
There were supposed to be thunderstorms and earthquakes today.

63
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,170
Well, we had some thunderstorm last night,

64
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,410
distant thunder, the Borg Erygmus of Heaven,

65
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,230
and the earthquake may be felt in individual tents,

66
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,830
if the truth be known.

67
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,130
I've got an earthquake in my pants.

68
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,270
Well, just let it out.

69
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,690
I've got a tornado in my tummy.

70
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,810
I've got a tsunami in my bladder.

71
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,770
Well, that's a most interesting staying.

72
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,530
And don't forget, every time they buy...

73
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,510
I've got a beehive in my nutsack.

74
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,390
...Revelation X, the Baba Parvati,

75
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,770
and a hypochryphon.

76
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,570
There is a sort of generalized slack that is generated.

77
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,250
You'll have to sign to me,

78
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,330
and I'll have to guess just as much.

79
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,730
It's difficult to communicate with His Excellency.

80
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,210
Oh, no, no, I was just...

81
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,770
He was just spouting about the urogenital system.

82
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,610
Yeah, I have a little jar back here, Paisies.

83
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,490
I was using it, in fact, when you were talking to me.

84
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,450
Oh, no worries.

85
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,450
Well, were you going to go pee for me or something?

86
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,450
I wish you would.

87
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,290
When is a door not a door?

88
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,490
When it is a jar.

89
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,490
Yeah, why do you think we put this picnic table cover here?

90
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,310
So that you can't see our groupies.

91
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,650
I thought it was so they can't see your feet.

92
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,490
You know, you never want them to see your feet.

93
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,830
Oh, it's the old problem of looking at the videos later

94
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,290
and clearly seeing yourself reach under there

95
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,250
and kind of scratch your groin.

96
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,370
It's amazing what they can get with availability.

97
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,590
Well, I see there's quite a lot of activity going on

98
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,650
around the sales table over there.

99
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,630
It could be people are laying up treasures here on Earth

100
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,630
as they will soon in Heaven.

101
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,010
Ah, yes.

102
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,870
Do you have those cufflinks that look like Bob Dobbs?

103
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,850
The problem is, who wears French cuffs?

104
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,710
Come on, I mean, even I don't.

105
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,830
I would if I had them.

106
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,790
I sell a pair of those.

107
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,050
We sell a pair of those.

108
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,010
Those are handsome things every gentleman should have,

109
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,110
but come on, I mean...

110
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,150
Bob Dobbs cufflinks, who thought of that one?

111
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,630
We sell three or four of the pins a week.

112
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,350
Oh, the pins.

113
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,190
Now everyone needs one of those.

114
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,330
An instant recognition badge.

115
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,670
Only available through us.

116
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,450
If you have one of those for Schluggen or pins,

117
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,370
you are clearly, obviously, and subtly a subgenius

118
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,110
to whoever sees you.

119
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,810
So small a space they take up

120
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,750
that they can be rightly said

121
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,150
to go with any ensemble of clothing.

122
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,790
You just have to remember to take them off

123
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,350
if you put it on something washable.

124
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,890
Some subgeniuses are wary of approaching

125
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,590
another obvious subgenius, though.

126
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,710
Somebody was talking about,

127
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,350
oh, I saw this other person at the ball.

128
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,990
They had a Bob shirt on,

129
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,310
and I was about to go talk to him,

130
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:41,970
but then I thought,

131
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,690
oh, what if he's just some guy

132
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,150
who just got a shirt somewhere at a thrift store,

133
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,330
doesn't know anything about it.

134
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,610
Then you can tell him about the shirt he's wearing.

135
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,770
But...

136
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,130
You know, I go out of my way never...

137
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,010
I hope this doesn't upset anyone,

138
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,290
but at Cleveland Heights,

139
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,470
I never wear a subgenius wear.

140
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,270
Confessions.

141
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,070
Around, out to the supermarket,

142
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,250
in the post office,

143
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,090
because I'm going to have to deal with these people

144
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:09,750
for years.

145
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,510
And I really don't want to,

146
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,430
as it happened in Dallas,

147
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,550
oh, there's the Bob man.

148
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,030
Hey, how's old Bob doing?

149
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,770
So we...

150
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,350
But the one day,

151
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,490
that I kind of forgot,

152
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,090
and I didn't think I was going to be going out that day,

153
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,450
but Princess Wee and I went out.

154
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,290
We weren't wearing our killed legume shirts.

155
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,170
I was wearing a Bob shirt.

156
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,430
And this kid walked up,

157
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,250
as we were in the parking lot,

158
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,270
and goes, pardon me,

159
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,550
but would you happen to be Reverend Stang and Princess Wee?

160
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,870
That's the first time that's happened in a long time.

161
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,750
And I said, yeah, how...

162
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,570
Did you see her picture on the internet or something?

163
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,350
And he goes, no, you're wearing that Bob shirt.

164
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:59,110
I wasn't out for five minutes before somebody had me pegged.

165
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,310
And the next thing you know,

166
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,250
that's what it'll lead to.

167
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,970
I'll be in somebody's bedroom getting pegged.

168
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,850
And I don't want to know about that.

169
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,070
Don't you think this might be the fabled exception

170
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,390
that proves the rule?

171
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,270
The one time that it did happen,

172
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,970
against which, in relief,

173
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,670
you can throw all the other times,

174
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,270
an infinitude of times,

175
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,390
when it didn't happen?

176
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,490
Oh, right, yeah.

177
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,150
Well, at least this isn't like that.

178
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,250
Oh, sure, my car broke down,

179
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,070
and I broke my leg.

180
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,850
Yes, I got snagged for speeding in Speedonk.

181
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,110
At least it isn't as bad as that day

182
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,890
they had to remove my eye with Popsicle sticks.

183
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,450
That was terrible.

184
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,530
Emergency surgery after I'd fallen off Mount Everest.

185
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:44,950
Yes.

186
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,770
It was not nearly as bad as that day.

187
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,810
I was reborn,

188
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,290
reincarnated as a preemie naked mole rat

189
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,510
born onto an iceberg in the North Sea

190
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,090
in 50 mile an hour winds.

191
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,470
Right, that was a bad one.

192
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,650
And my mom mole rat smoked,

193
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,030
so I had a nicotine fit on top of that.

194
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,310
Actually, that's the way I feel every morning,

195
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,050
and Princess, we will vouch for it.

196
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,110
The mole rat thing comes back in...

197
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,030
Yeah, for about a minute.

198
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,070
When I first wake up,

199
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,810
I feel like the naked mole rat fetus preemie.

200
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,990
On the iceberg.

201
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,710
You know naked mole rats,

202
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,250
you got to be kind of chilly every now and then to begin with.

203
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:25,570
Absolutely.

204
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,310
And a preemie naked mole rat.

205
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,050
They're naked for one thing.

206
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,430
Yeah.

207
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,730
And they're all horrible and pink and everything.

208
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,030
With those teeth.

209
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,930
Scientific American, I think, did,

210
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,470
or Nature magazine,

211
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,450
somebody did a,

212
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:46,130
it turned out to be an April Fool's joke.

213
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,690
April Fool's.

214
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,890
But in their magazine,

215
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,130
right there in print,

216
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:57,090
they were talking about the naked ice borer of the Antarctic,

217
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,810
which would kill pink,

218
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:08,190
hundreds of these naked rodents would bore through the ice

219
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,750
using a heated part of their skull.

220
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,790
They could heat up their skulls so fast

221
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,990
that they would,

222
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:17,550
they could,

223
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,530
they would bore tunnels through the ice

224
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,570
underneath herds of penguins.

225
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,250
And the penguins would fall in

226
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,950
and these things would tear them apart

227
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,410
like little ice piranhas.

228
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,870
But they were,

229
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,190
they were hairless mammals

230
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,790
who lived in the ice.

231
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,510
And they had a photograph of one.

232
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,690
And it was in Scientific American.

233
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,370
I,

234
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:35,790
I,

235
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,930
it was the early days of alt.slack for me.

236
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,070
So it had been about 1995.

237
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,190
And I posted that and I said,

238
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:43,990
how can this be?

239
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,690
And I was shocked how many subgeniuses

240
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,810
completely swallowed it.

241
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,310
I reprinted the whole article.

242
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,410
I,

243
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:51,790
I,

244
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,870
right after I posted it,

245
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,170
I caught on.

246
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,870
The discoverer was

247
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,170
Abril Faso,

248
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,150
which is Italian for April Fool's.

249
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,370
And I,

250
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,070
and it was the April issue.

251
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:05,570
It was like,

252
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:05,990
duh,

253
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,930
Scientific American has a sense of humor

254
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,950
like everybody else,

255
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,050
or nature,

256
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,450
or National Geographic.

257
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,410
But I,

258
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,070
ever since then I've dreamed of the,

259
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,670
the naked hothead,

260
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,750
the naked ice borers.

261
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,590
And,

262
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,050
if,

263
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,470
and you don't think how many penguins

264
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,290
they have to eat

265
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,030
to keep up that metabolism.

266
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:24,610
Well,

267
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,230
that's all preposterous.

268
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,450
And yet there is nothing about it.

269
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,190
How do we know?

270
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,310
As you say,

271
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,730
each part of it is not entirely improbable.

272
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,830
The bombardier beetle can produce a blast of heat.

273
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,490
And the,

274
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,210
the mantis shrimp can produce a point of heat

275
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,650
that is momentarily brighter than,

276
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,370
than the sun itself.

277
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,210
I mean,

278
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:49,850
as,

279
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,450
as hot.

280
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,490
Really?

281
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,010
I don't know how they do that,

282
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,510
but they,

283
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,350
they do it.

284
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:56,410
And,

285
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,890
Did Bob tell you that,

286
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,070
Dr.

287
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,230
What about the,

288
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,330
the kangaroo rat of the southwestern desert,

289
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,930
which never needs to drink water at all

290
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,610
because it synthesizes it out of the seeds

291
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,350
and other things which it eats.

292
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,110
That's cheating.

293
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:11,930
Well,

294
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,350
if,

295
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,390
you know,

296
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,730
they can do it.

297
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,170
But it's the,

298
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,250
an adaptation like that is possible.

299
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,650
It's unlikely to have them so combined in one individual.

300
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,750
The hot skull would be the,

301
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,750
the problem.

302
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,190
But,

303
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,050
Speaking of which,

304
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:27,310
kids,

305
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,210
if you happen upon the rare southwestern desert tortoise,

306
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,570
there or here,

307
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,230
don't run up to it going,

308
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:34,690
oh,

309
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,010
oh,

310
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,290
boo,

311
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,030
oh look,

312
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,830
he's on sea claw.

313
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,550
He's not scared.

314
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,810
He's scared of me.

315
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:39,310
If,

316
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,430
you'll make him pee.

317
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,730
And when you do that,

318
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,410
he loses all the water he's saved up for two years

319
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,390
because those tortoises also don't drink.

320
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:47,590
They,

321
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,090
you know,

322
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,950
they gradually,

323
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,350
from the dry plants they eat,

324
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,010
they get enough water to store in their,

325
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,570
some kind of bladder.

326
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,150
And,

327
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,710
and in order to escape a predator,

328
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,630
they will void that water.

329
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,450
But it's,

330
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,190
it's almost certain a later,

331
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,690
slower death for him.

332
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,410
So be merciful on the desert tortoise.

333
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,750
And on poor Dr. Legume over there,

334
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,390
who's in the same condition.

335
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:14,750
Well,

336
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,550
you probably know,

337
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,790
ever since his surgeries.

338
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,550
If you've ever scooped up a toad with your bare hand,

339
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,010
one of the first things the animal will do is pee all over it.

340
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,790
So you drop the repulsive toad.

341
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:26,530
Toads?

342
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,410
Isn't that what girls,

343
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,750
that's what girls always did.

344
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:29,810
Yes.

345
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,170
And then also the horned lizard,

346
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:36,550
the,

347
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,250
you know,

348
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,890
the so-called horned toad.

349
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,290
Do horny toads really spit blood?

350
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,290
At their eyeballs?

351
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,710
Yes,

352
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,190
they do.

353
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,910
They project blood out their eyeballs onto your hand.

354
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,590
But they also pee on your hand.

355
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,370
I grew up with those.

356
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:47,890
I never,

357
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,310
well,

358
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:48,510
I've,

359
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:48,910
I've,

360
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,710
Many reptiles will pee on you to make you put them down.

361
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,750
And if you put them on a dob's head,

362
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,250
strangely enough,

363
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,970
that's the one time they won't pee.

364
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,190
Everybody else,

365
00:14:59,390 --> 00:14:59,990
of course,

366
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,250
you know,

367
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,530
you sit down on a dob's head,

368
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,510
you automatically just lose control,

369
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,250
start peeing.

370
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:05,570
Duh.

371
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:05,830
I mean,

372
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,030
we've,

373
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,550
I'm sure it's all happened to all of us.

374
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,270
It's kind of a surprise to find out.

375
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:10,270


376
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:10,570
It's the first time,

377
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,090
isn't it?

378
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,290
But,

379
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,310
that's why we talk about,

380
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,090
use the dob's head in toilet training your kid.

381
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:17,450
You know,

382
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,390
if you use it wisely.

383
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,350
We discovered that accidentally.

384
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,590
But anyway,

385
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,010
yes,

386
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:23,850
you know,

387
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,310
pee is an important defense.

388
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,410
Well,

389
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,870
reptile pee is,

390
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,450
For many of us.

391
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,410
sero-immunologically interesting.

392
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,150
In many ways,

393
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,070
reptile pee may prove to create medical advances.

394
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,270
Well,

395
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:47,830
I've noticed Mr. Sister referred to his betas medicine as lizard pee.

396
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,130
Uh-huh.

397
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,230
I think.

398
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:50,750
Didn't he?

399
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,790
Didn't he call it lizard pee?

400
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:52,930
Yeah.

401
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,170
Lizard pee?

402
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,670
Yeah.

403
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,210
It's horrible.

404
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,470
Oh,

405
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,970
it's orally ingested?

406
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:58,550
Yeah,

407
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,910
he says it tastes horrible.

408
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:00,870
Hmm.

409
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:01,290
Well,

410
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:01,570
it would.

411
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,810
I thought that was what,

412
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,850
he was referring to the stuff you have to inject when you have diabetes.

413
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,390
See,

414
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:06,730
you get,

415
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,730
events overtake you.

416
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,570
Even as you're making a radio broadcast,

417
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,110
it's,

418
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,490
Right.

419
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,470
That's lizard spit.

420
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,130
Lizard.

421
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:14,670
Lizard spit.

422
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,310
That's right.

423
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,290
He called it lizard spit.

424
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,030
Lizard spit,

425
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,730
not lizard pee.

426
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,150
See,

427
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,590
you see I'm kind of pee-centric.

428
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:18,610


429
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:18,690
of course,

430
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,790
that's in a sense worse.

431
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,690
It's what the lizard spits out rather than processes in the usual way.

432
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,050
So,

433
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:32,010
it's apparently inimical and foreign with only a slight adumbration of lizardiness for its

434
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:32,730
medicinal possibilities.

435
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:34,690
See,

436
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,010
friends,

437
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,730
when you come to an X day hour of slack,

438
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,550
when you leave,

439
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,890
you practically could get a degree in herpetology.

440
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:48,890
You must know about the giant toads and the hallucinogenic venom that they produce in the

441
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,770
American southwest.

442
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,210
And no pop quiz.

443
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,850
Bufo alvarius,

444
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,850
the Colorado river toad,

445
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:02,230
has the giant poison glands on the back and you just squeeze them and,

446
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,330
Just like popping his head.

447
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:05,970
You do not ingest them.

448
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,710
That is faith-based.

449
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:07,910
You have to get rid of the needle.

450
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,450
You have to dry the stuff,

451
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,710
the mucus,

452
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,590
whatever the venom is,

453
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,310
dry it on a sheet of glass that you've cleaned.

454
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,410
And then when it's dry,

455
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,250
scrape it into a pipe and smoke it.

456
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:22,510
Yeah,

457
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:22,990
smoke.

458
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,750
Go ahead and smoke that toad's zit juice,

459
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,070
boys and girls.

460
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:36,190
Do not ingest it because this is the way the animal protects itself and it will stop your heart as it will a dog who bites one of these huge obese toads.

461
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,630
And,

462
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,630
yeah,

463
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:39,630
they're large.

464
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:40,730
Yes.

465
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,770
And when they land,

466
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,250
they go like this too.

467
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,270
Their body is strangely elastic.

468
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:52,950
So they are the only toad that generates a psychedelic substance,

469
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,590
which gives an extraordinarily strong trip.

470
00:17:59,570 --> 00:17:59,630
Yeah.

471
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:01,630
Yes.

472
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:06,090
It is a form of DMT,

473
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,830
I believe.

474
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:15,050
You have to sit yourself down in a chair where you're going to be secure and nobody will mess with your body while this is happening.

475
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,070
And the whole thing,

476
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,510
immobilizing as it is,

477
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,030
only lasts about half an hour and then you're done.

478
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,610
Unlike acid that goes on and on,

479
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,750
this simply takes over.

480
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,570
And the only other after effect,

481
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,030
it is reported,

482
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,930
is a feeling of general well-being and happiness,

483
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,170
which persists for a couple of days.

484
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,730
You know,

485
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:44,290
they say that the semen of a rape bearer will work the same way.

486
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,750
But the problem is that trip lasts seven years.

487
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,010
And if you ask for it,

488
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,670
it's not rape.

489
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,310
Well,

490
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,510
it doesn't,

491
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,270
either way,

492
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,510
it's going to be seven years.

493
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,330
And from what I understand,

494
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:06,150
the hibernation periods are the absolute worst because you don't hibernate.

495
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,150


496
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,150


497
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,150


498
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,150


499
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,150


500
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,970
But you can't get away.

501
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,150
How do you stay alive?

502
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:11,670
Ooh,

503
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,590
it's too gross to even talk about, friends.

504
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,850
The human tampion,

505
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,570
as Princess Wee put it.

506
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,150
Well,

507
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:20,870
there you go.

508
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,670
Horrible.

509
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:21,830
Horrible.

510
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:28,630
But then there's very little chance of actually being apprehended by one of these creatures

511
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,210
if one simply follows the dictates of common sense,

512
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,770
an ordinary prudence.

513
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,230
We make a lot of jokes about the rape bears,

514
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,350
but to tell the truth,

515
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,710
they're an endangered species.

516
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,870
And that's pretty serious.

517
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,010
You know,

518
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:41,250
to them,

519
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,070
we're the monster.

520
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:42,770
How about that?

521
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:43,450
Exactly.

522
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,970
And rape isn't funny.

523
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:47,430
Well,

524
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,610
except the way we do it.

525
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,870
Except the way those bears.

526
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,290
I've seen cartoons drawn by subgeniuses which depict this.

527
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,910
That pornography side of Bob's business didn't do too well.

528
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:01,810
Well,

529
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,130
the small eight-page comic.

530
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,670
Maybe we should have used a two-piece.

531
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:04,750
Well,

532
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,230
in this case,

533
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,530
we used people instead of people and animals.

534
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,430
But,

535
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,510
we wanted to put some science into it.

536
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,890
It was like an educational thing.

537
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,570
Our mission is educational.

538
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,930
And we try to tell as many as possible.

539
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:22,330
But within the set of knowing that we're not going to reach all that many people.

540
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,810
Because if we did there wouldn't be room.

541
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:28,750
We can talk in just as much detail about the Yucatevism,

542
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,050
say,

543
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:33,130
as we do about desert reptiles.

544
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,510
But...

545
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,390
Or Muom, which you should probably talk about sometime.

546
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,610
Nobody's going to be interested in those reptiles after X-Day,

547
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,190
unless they want to be.

548
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,810
And I want to force it down their heads.

549
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,670
Because they're cool.

550
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:54,370
Actually, if Susie was here, she'd be going on and on about the joys of lizards.

551
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,510
She's pretty seriously lizard-centric.

552
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,190
Got it.

553
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,650
A thing for the lizards.

554
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,090
Yes.

555
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:09,450
Let it be known that we wish Reverend Susie were here.

556
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,350
But we don't want to put any pressure on anyone.

557
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,030
Because Pastor Pressure's not here.

558
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,910
He did show up at Potter Nostril and Petal's wedding.

559
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,650
Oh, my God.

560
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,370
Talk about photos of Bob.

561
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,010
Okay, this is something I really hate to go into.

562
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,170
Why are you?

563
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,690
This is a horrible subgenius secret.

564
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,250
No, this is different. This is a new one.

565
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,190
Oh, a new one?

566
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:34,550
Yes.

567
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,490
Yes.

568
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,490
And when we have the projector, I...

569
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:40,970
Oh, God.

570
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,510
Did I bring a copy of it?

571
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:43,890
Yeah.

572
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,970
Anyway, it's bad enough that we found that the true Dobbs head

573
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:56,770
was, in fact, an artist's rendition of a photograph of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

574
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,970
Of a living human being.

575
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,510
From the 40s.

576
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,650
Or perhaps it could have been from any time,

577
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,450
but it did first appear in the...

578
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,270
Late 40s.

579
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,510
In newspaper ad clip-off.

580
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:12,930
Just as he wrote, this person did pose for a series of...

581
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,450
Well, of course.

582
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:18,610
...ads of men's stuff in the 1940s and early 50s.

583
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,330
But his head is in different angles than all those popular mechanics ads.

584
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,450
And this was the one that the true Dobbs head came from.

585
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,670
It agrees in every particular...

586
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,110
Frighteningly.

587
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,090
We still are trying to come to grips with that.

588
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,430
In every particular except the chin.

589
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:40,130
It seems that whoever accepted that to make the Dobbs head rounded off the chin

590
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:47,490
more than is actually present in the actual living, breathing, physical Dobbs.

591
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,210
That's a pretty scary shot.

592
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,750
It's a halftone, but it's a halftone of a photo, not a halftone of a washed bra.

593
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:00,590
Those little dots are made artistically from this photo.

594
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:01,790
Unbelievable.

595
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:02,950
Well, anyway...

596
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,370
Yes, it's difficult.

597
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:09,690
It turns out Pastor Pressure's wife's great-great-uncle.

598
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,890
I think I have that right.

599
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:11,990
I forget his name.

600
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:16,310
He was kind of a historian around West Virginia.

601
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:20,670
And he wrote a book about his life and times.

602
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:29,250
And he had a friend named Bob who was a very strange man.

603
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,870
And there is a photograph of this Bob.

604
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,130
And he came in that book.

605
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,690
And he had a friend named Bob.

606
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:36,690


607
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:36,690


608
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:36,690


609
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:36,690


610
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:42,570
And it's about as close as I've ever seen

611
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,330
besides that one that we're talking about

612
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,910
that the true Dobbs head was made from.

613
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,630
It's a fairly clear photo.

614
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,670
He's got the pipe.

615
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,230
His head is about at a three-quarter angle.

616
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,070
And he's got suspenders on or something.

617
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,410
He's dressed like an Oakey or a West Virginia good old boy.

618
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,350
And apparently...

619
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:09,930
on top of this coincidence, coincidence or whatever, that this West Virginian fellow

620
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:17,750
happened to be named Bob and look exactly like Bob. He was famous around those parts for tangling

621
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:28,850
with a pig. The pig's name was Belial, a devil name. Yes. Famous devil name. One of the famous

622
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:34,010
devils, one of the more famous devils. Pastor Pressure told me about it at the wedding and he

623
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:41,390
emailed me a really good scan of, or a PDF of several of the pages, but did I copy it onto

624
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:47,610
the hard drive I brought with me? Well, that's neither here nor there, but what was revealed

625
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:54,550
there, the photograph. It was another photograph of that damn Bob. And you know, one was scary

626
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,630
enough. We've seen a million photos of Bob, you know, in hammocks and,

627
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:06,530
fishing and ads. But not wrestling a demonic pig. No, and not, well, certainly not in that

628
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:12,010
position of the one true Dobbs has. A lot of those guys, let's face it, are probably just,

629
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:16,690
you know, a lot of squares in those days and cool guys. Yeah, sure, of course. Had that look,

630
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:22,630
you know, that real cream hair. Reverend Dapper now to this day is still exemplifying that. And

631
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:28,750
of course, the pipe was universally considered cool all through the 50s and early 60s. So,

632
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:35,290
that's not surprising. But every, now and then, I mean, when you run into a real photo from when

633
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:43,190
cameras still worked around Bob. Well, the lighting produces the result that you see in the

634
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:50,550
Dobbs glyph that we're all familiar with. So, we have top people looking

635
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:58,210
at this, don't we? The funny thing is that everyone I know who used to have a copy of this

636
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:58,830
mystery,

637
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:06,270
photo no longer can lay his hands on it. It seems to have disappeared and they

638
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,950
just can't find it. What about you? Can you find it?

639
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:18,470
I have the one true Dobbs head that is the father of all the Dobbs heads here.

640
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,730
Yes but...

641
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,450
In a vault.

642
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:25,450
But I'm talking about beyond that. This new...

643
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,910
The new one, no. All we've seen are scans of newspaper...

644
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,850
Do you have copies even of the scans?

645
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:31,670
Oh yeah, sure.

646
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,430
Oh you do? Okay, well that's good. Because I was starting to wonder...

647
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:42,050
Yeah, no, we've kind of been sitting on this information because it's shocking.

648
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,790
It can tear the church...

649
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:46,190
Demons can control some elements of demonology and censor things, cause things

650
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,170
to disappear from pages of manuscripts and books.

651
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,610
Oh I see Reverend Anitrocity has arrived.

652
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,430
And a newcomer...

653
00:26:55,430 --> 00:27:01,570
A newcomer is with a fake name like Smith or something. Was that right?

654
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:02,230
Do I remember correctly?

655
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,870
An honorific.

656
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:13,090
I was at a Smith family reunion recently. I thought that it would be hundreds of thousands

657
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:18,430
of people. But it turned out to be only the Smiths that were descended from my paternal

658
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,030
grandparents.

659
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,450
Are they related to the ones who produced the wild cherry cough drops?

660
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,630
Well...

661
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:30,570
Well all Smiths are related somehow except for the false smi. But you know my great great

662
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:35,930
great uncle Joseph, he was in the business and it's interesting I found out that I...

663
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:41,070
My four great grandfathers were all preachers. Scary isn't it?

664
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:51,770
And my father, Pappy, still teaches Bible studies at the local Methodist church in Stainesville,

665
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,190
Texas.

666
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:59,650
Even though he himself staunchly believes that Jesus never existed as a historical figure.

667
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:07,210
And that the whole thing was a compiled mess of control propaganda that was very handy

668
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:07,910
to the Romans.

669
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:15,710
A great religion for losers some have said. I don't feel that way at all. I think that

670
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:20,570
religion has helped humanity in many ways.

671
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,170
Only kidding.

672
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:26,630
Killing the sinners for instance or the witches. You know who's going to argue with that?

673
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,030
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.

674
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:38,490
Yes, Savranola Stang. It's true. His zeal sometimes burns very brightly.

675
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:44,930
I gave to the Salvation Army one time. I'll never do it again. God they must have

676
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:50,870
spent five grand sending me full color mailers for that fifty cents I dropped in a bucket

677
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,450
one time.

678
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,750
Hmm. Well, were these graphically interesting or provocative?

679
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:02,510
No, just Salvation Army. I was just helping out the lone drunks out there. Except I think

680
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:09,790
what I was really helping out was the Salvation Army corporate headquarters office plant budget.

681
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:14,310
If I know the way these do-gooders work, a lot of them.

682
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:18,370
Well, one thing they do is they go through all the stuff that is donated and they take

683
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,210
the best of it for themselves.

684
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:20,950
As do we.

685
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,070
Well, of course.

686
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:22,910
Please, some of the-

687
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:27,450
We do, but we don't claim to be so high and mighty hoity-toity as they do.

688
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,310
No, we claim to be higher.

689
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:33,570
They are doing Christ's work. We are doing Bob's work. You know, there is a difference,

690
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:41,310
for heaven's sakes. And they take all the good stuff long before the Po folk get anything

691
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:41,990
that's left.

692
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:49,390
Well, it gave us lots of opportunities to defend our own snake oil.

693
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,550
Which there is plenty of.

694
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:58,070
Plenty of need to do. The prejudice against the serpent is part of the problem.

695
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:05,770
Well, but that's also what makes the oil magical. Magical snake oil, you know. And

696
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,670
plus the whiskey and Tabasco helps. We used to mix that stuff up. And the Three Stooges

697
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:16,210
were expert. They had the formula for the true snake oil. They mixed up in what, was

698
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,490
it a big fisherman's boot?

699
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,410
It looked like.

700
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,530
And a can of Frankenstein.

701
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,790
And a can of Frankenstein.

702
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,950
And a can of Frankenstein.

703
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:29,190
Oh, boy. That's, you know, people wonder, who trained Bob? Friends, just look to the

704
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:36,870
Three Stooges. You can, and others, not, certainly not just them. I didn't grow up with Laurel

705
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,070
and Hardy. They didn't show those on TV much when I was a kid.

706
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,510
They did when I was a kid.

707
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,590
But I started watching them recently and, oh man, those are, some of those are just

708
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:47,970
spectacularly funny.

709
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,670
But Stan Laurel directed them.

710
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:57,490
You know, he was the genius behind Laurel and Hardy. He came over on the same steamship

711
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:03,290
with Charlie Chaplin when they first came to America as co-members of a traveling vaudeville

712
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:09,870
show called Fred Carnot's Ten Nights in an English Music Hall. And he made great silent

713
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:14,230
movies, which are, you know, quite fun, even though you can't hear their voices.

714
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,970
Yeah, you couldn't tell they were Limeys in the silent movie.

715
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:17,950
Yeah, well.

716
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,770
And then I recently saw a movie called The Limey.

717
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:20,770


718
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:20,930
It's called The Limey.

719
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:25,550
It's about a Mexican version that they made where they redid one of their whole things

720
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,910
but spoke Spanish, which they didn't even know, but they spoke it phonetically. It was

721
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:36,030
really entertaining to watch. They throw other things in in the Mexican version which aren't

722
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:41,330
in the American version. Like an entertainer comes to the party who can spit water out

723
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,170
of his mouth and do amazing things with that.

724
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:44,630
Yeah, but it's just, it's just.

725
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:50,610
Why would, why would the American conspiracy hide it and the Mexican conspiracy would,

726
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,810
would promote it?

727
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:59,710
You know, Hollywood was controlled by some strange anhedonic people for years who were

728
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:06,850
suspicious of anything that intimated joy and would go through with ruthless scissors

729
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,730
to cut it out.

730
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:14,530
Well, I guess there was a, a kind of a reaction against that, wasn't there?

731
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:20,590
Joseph Breen, the Hays office. Yeah, it took the 60s to create the, the, the, the

732
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,870
ratings system of the motion picture.

733
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,990
Well, they brought back more titties and gushing blood.

734
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:38,010
Yes, well they really pushed the envelope in the 70s. But on the other hand, it's now

735
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:41,530
just another flavor that can be chosen.

736
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:49,450
We showed that movie Pig, which is a recent horror film, last year and almost nobody would

737
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:49,990
watch it.

738
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,690
Nobody wanted to watch that, eh?

739
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,590
No, I, I consider it a pretty impressive work of filming.

740
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:54,830
It is disturbing.

741
00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:01,730
Dr. Legume turned me on to it. It's a, you could sort of call it a slasher movie

742
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,610
with redneck cannibals torturing, uh, pinks.

743
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,430
The standard stuff.

744
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:15,130
But, but it, it's all appears as if it, it's, it's one long shot. I know that actually

745
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:19,690
there's flash pans where they could cheat and do retakes if they needed to, but it's,

746
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,290
it's as if the whole movie is one shot.

747
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:29,330
And oh, it makes me sweat just thinking of the cameraman on that, out there in the woods

748
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,410
shooting that stuff.

749
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:36,830
It's obviously really hot and I know how much those things weigh and the concentration it

750
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,970
takes to do that.

751
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:42,110
And probably they were really killing those people.

752
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:47,170
That's the nice thing about doing it all as one shot. You can tell nothing could be faked,

753
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,570
you know.

754
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,070
You can't fake a photograph.

755
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,470
So, you know, it's pretty impressive, uh, horror movie.

756
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:56,970
And the funny thing is, it's one of those things where you go, oh, I don't like slasher

757
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:57,230
movies.

758
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,350
I don't really care.

759
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,450
I'm not interested to see that.

760
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:02,070
But, uh, Legume turned it on.

761
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:05,450
Princess We could not look away until the kids came home.

762
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,370
We had to turn it off.

763
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:11,990
But I finally saw the end of it and it has a twist ending which turns it into a good

764
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:12,710
movie.

765
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:19,050
If only conceptually for some people, because they don't like to see that kind of thing.

766
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,190
It's only a movie.

767
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:27,750
And uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know.

768
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:28,890
Pig.

769
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:38,190
It's an opportunity to be spontaneous and to consume the flesh of the sacrificial victim.

770
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:43,270
Yeah, it's a hell of an improv acting job or that guy is just a real ruthless

771
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:43,770
killer.

772
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,770
Well, we'll find out.

773
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,150
All things will be made certain.

774
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:57,250
I'm recording this with such high resolution on this little tiny miraculous deck here that

775
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:01,970
it'll be, it'll fill up the little card and I have to go and dump it all into Princess

776
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,010
We's laptop before I can come back and use it again.

777
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,450
Or I'd have to buy another card.

778
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,050
Sounds expensive.

779
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:08,910
That's eight dollars.

780
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,850
I can't believe this stuff.

781
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,470
All these miniaturized little things.

782
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,270
Waste not, not.

783
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:15,710
I could.

784
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,330
You know, by next year, all I'll have is one of those phones.

785
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:20,990
It's all I'll need.

786
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:26,950
There'll be a few little tiny buds stuck here and there, microphones and play, and I'll

787
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,510
be able to just do everything.

788
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,250
However, I will not ever look up from it.

789
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:36,430
It'll be as if I was married to it and not really part of the world around me.

790
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,630
Tiny headphones that you wouldn't even be able to see.

791
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:45,130
Well, what about those Google glasses that you just have projected on your glasses?

792
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:45,690
I invite you to come and see.

793
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,370
I invented those when I was about 12.

794
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:50,910
They just, Google hadn't been invented or anything else.

795
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,910
But the tiny camera that would be on the side of your glasses.

796
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:55,630
Yes.

797
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,850
But this.

798
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:00,810
And I learned, however, through documenting subgenius, the important part about all that

799
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:04,870
is are you really going to look back at the tapes?

800
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,110
Answer, no.

801
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,350
You know.

802
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,150
Nome sign.

803
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:11,930
Nome sign.

804
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:12,570
Nome sign.

805
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:13,290
Nome.

806
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:13,590
Nome.

807
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,390
Nome.

808
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:14,590
And you go Nome.

809
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,250
I mean, say, note your sign.

810
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,310
Nome sign.

811
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,430
Note your sign.

812
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,010
Nome sign.

813
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:18,610
Note your sign.

814
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,050
And you go, Nome.

815
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:20,410
Note.

816
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,110
Nome.

817
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:21,550
Note.

818
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,070
Nome.

819
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:22,350
Note.

820
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:27,090
That's a comedy routine that Princess Wee and I developed.

821
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:27,890
Yes.

822
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:33,090
I thought I would, you know, explain it and pad it out, ruin the illusion completely.

823
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,790
And he, did you know your dad couldn't really pull a quarter from behind your ear?

824
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,010
He actually had it in that hand the whole time.

825
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:44,030
He just made you think he'd moved it to this hand but it was really in this hand.

826
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,350
Through the miracle of mystery.

827
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,850
I mean, I know there's some subgeniuses that don't know that.

828
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,110
The new guy, he's shocked.

829
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:57,650
He's going to be traumatized forever, probably murder his parents.

830
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:00,750
You lied. Magic wasn't real.

831
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:09,030
My son was so horrified to have the truth about Santa Claus spelled out to him.

832
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:15,050
Because as long as there was that one impossible thing that was real,

833
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:19,050
that meant there could be more impossible things.

834
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:24,010
And he had worked out that if he could just get in touch with Santa Claus,

835
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:29,610
he would be successful in convincing the great man that he, Zandy,

836
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,970
was suitable to share the magic power.

837
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:37,970
Because if you have any magic, you might as well have all magic.

838
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:38,810
Or.

839
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,770
As Nenslow put it, once you believe one impossible thing,

840
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,370
you can believe any impossible thing.

841
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,170
And the poor kid had to.

842
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:48,390
I mean, he really refused to believe it.

843
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:54,790
And I finally had to go, look, son, here he is.

844
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,610
And we brought Santa Claus out.

845
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:01,090
Because Santa Claus is, of course, friends with Bob,

846
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,990
if not much closer to Bob in certain ways.

847
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,510
Familiar ways.

848
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,270
And familial.

849
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,230
And familial ways.

850
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,110
Some say that Santa Claus was Bob's dad.

851
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,910
The traveling milkman.

852
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:19,610
Well, obviously, Zee, Joshua, M. Chan, M. Dodds was not the biological father.

853
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,250
The stump of a pipe he held clenched in his teeth.

854
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:25,250
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.

855
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,410
Yeah.

856
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:32,630
So we were able to show Zandy the truth about Santa Claus.

857
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,370
Yes, of course, he really exists.

858
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:38,290
But he doesn't service most people.

859
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:38,710
So they.

860
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,390
Fake it.

861
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:45,070
And that's why our neighbors across the street had to tell their kids,

862
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:49,450
well, yeah, Santa Claus will bring you presents, but he bills us.

863
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,910
They actually told their kid that.

864
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,250
That was never spelled out to me.

865
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,470
No, your mom and dad probably didn't think of it.

866
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,130
But, of course, my parents had to pretend they were Santa Claus

867
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:08,330
until I started working for Bob and had an inside thing.

868
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,930
You know, to tell the truth, I'm surprised he hasn't been more generous.

869
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:17,370
That's how I got this recorder came from Santa Claus and Princess Wee's laptop.

870
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:18,750
Sinterklaas.

871
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,530
Yes.

872
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,850
Or Krampus.

873
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,230
Maybe it was Krampus who was working for us.

874
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:23,430
Yeah.

875
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:26,990
I didn't even know who Krampus was for the longest time.

876
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,730
The devil that helped Santa Claus in Germany.

877
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:30,570
Right?

878
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,390
Isn't that what he is?

879
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:37,510
And takes bad children away and they do not return in his bulging sack.

880
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,010
And he's a horrible.

881
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:39,010


882
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:39,010


883
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:39,010


884
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:39,010


885
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:39,010


886
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:45,690
He's a horrible, shaggy, satyr-like, tongue-extending demon with a bifurcated tongue.

887
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,630
Yeah, he's no helpful elf.

888
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:48,690
D. Krampus.

889
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,810
And then in Holland.

890
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:52,670
Father Christmas.

891
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:58,990
Yeah, Father Christmas has Little Black Peter, who is this.

892
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:05,250
As depicted in artwork, he looks like a Picaninny from a Betty Boop cartoon.

893
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,170
With a turban.

894
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,290
Yeah, yeah.

895
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,090
And he's the one who builds.

896
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:08,590
And he's the one who builds.

897
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:08,990
It's the most important.

898
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:08,990


899
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:08,990


900
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:08,990


901
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:08,990


902
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:08,990


903
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:08,990


904
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:08,990


905
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,190
It's the most racially offensive thing to an American.

906
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,930
We're walking through.

907
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:14,290
He builds them.

908
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,530
In the Near East, he assembles these toys.

909
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:22,450
And Father Christmas is not little and fat, but huge, tall, and powerful.

910
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:26,730
With a long, flowing white beard, yes, but.

911
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:32,230
Yeah, Little Black Peter was a freed Portuguese slave, I believe.

912
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:36,910
Who is now the master of all of Santa Claus' slaves.

913
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,270
That was funny.

914
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:38,450
That was funny.

915
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,550
Foreigners have their quaint beliefs.

916
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:45,370
But, I mean, seriously, we walked through our first trip to Amsterdam.

917
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:51,170
It was near Christmas, and we saw this cartoon face in the store windows.

918
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,150
Oh, not only that.

919
00:40:53,250 --> 00:41:00,090
We had kids getting on the streetcar, going to Christmas parties, dressed like Father Christmas and.

920
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,390
Little Black Peter.

921
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,790
Little Black Peter, yes.

922
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,730
And it was no big deal in Holland.

923
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:06,010
Like Black Peter.

924
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:06,450
But it's.

925
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,830
They don't have the.

926
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,250
The tortured history that we do.

927
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,730
And you can get a white.

928
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,390
Well, in Japan, they crucify Santa Claus sometimes.

929
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,450
Department stores.

930
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,350
You know, it's some bearded white guy.

931
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,270
Yeah.

932
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,750
You know, what's the difference?

933
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:21,570
I can.

934
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,370
That's understandable.

935
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,530
I used to wonder about that as a kid.

936
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,130
My family was not especially religious.

937
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:30,950
Surprise, surprise.

938
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:37,530
Although a lot of subgeniuses become subgeniuses because their families were too religious.

939
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,110
Or something.

940
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,350
Yeah, a lot of them.

941
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,710
And we get a lot more, especially Catholics, Jews and Baptists.

942
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,050
More of those three than anything.

943
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:52,610
But I just kind of got exposed to the Bible and stuff in piecemeal fashion.

944
00:41:52,790 --> 00:42:00,230
So Santa Claus and Jesus seemed, you know, all those God guys had robes and beards.

945
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:06,610
The beards were only common to cowboy villains, prospectors and holy.

946
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,110
Holy superheroes.

947
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,710
Holy Joes in those Bible movies.

948
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,710
Yeah, Bible superheroes.

949
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:11,610
Yes.

950
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:16,310
So that's, I guess everybody thinks of God in that way as having that.

951
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,690
Finlay Curry in various movies.

952
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,250
As Saint Peter.

953
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:24,430
Oh, is that, was he a God?

954
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:30,350
He was a Scotch actor and he had a long flowing white beard and he was always a saint.

955
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,230
Or he was Saint Peter.

956
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:35,550
He crucified upside down in one Roman.

957
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:36,970
Period.

958
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:37,770
Picture.

959
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:43,370
And he's in the background sadly shaking his head.

960
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,830
Well, Morgan Freeman is usually God now, right?

961
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:48,990
Or the president.

962
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,570
Since that old, what's his name, died?

963
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,310
The old, the ancient George Burns.

964
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,070
George Burns?

965
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,430
Yeah, he used to be God.

966
00:42:58,650 --> 00:42:59,490
He was God for a while.

967
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:00,110
For a long time.

968
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:03,810
And now, and Morgan Freeman is, of course, God now.

969
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:04,490
Mm-hmm.

970
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:05,690
And.

971
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:10,850
I was more familiar, my favorite God was the one in that movie, Green Pastures.

972
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:11,610
The Lord.

973
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,630
Yeah, he would rear back and pass a miracle.

974
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,030
He used to whip up a mess of firmament.

975
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:20,470
Not just a little firmament, I mean a whole mess of firmament.

976
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,510
That was actually a very touching movie.

977
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,950
I liked his roll top desk.

978
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,770
It gave me religious feelings when I saw it the first time.

979
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:28,230
I thought God was more so.

980
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:30,270
Huh?

981
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:32,390
Oh, that's right, we said we were going to quit.

982
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,470
A quitter, eh, son?

983
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,130
I like the God.

984
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:37,550
In the world of the future.

985
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:40,090
He likes the God in World of the Future.

986
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,010
That's Pappy.

987
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:43,750
That's my dad.

988
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,870
He was, I never saw my father so nervous.

989
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,930
He's a courtroom lawyer.

990
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:53,770
And yet when he had a, you know, he could perform like a son of a bitch.

991
00:43:53,830 --> 00:44:05,330
But when he had his son point that big 16 millimeter camera and have to do the slate and all that, he was, and he had the script in front of him on a big piece of white board that he could read.

992
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:05,730
Right.

993
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,210
He, he never saw him so stiff.

994
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:09,970
For two years after he left.

995
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:14,570
Yeah, that's my father, way younger than I am now.

996
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,270
Jesus.

997
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,870
Oh my god.

998
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:18,950
Yes.

999
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:22,830
oh well, and so in this realm lent for this is still around.

1000
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,250
He's still pontificate primogeniture,

1001
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:26,570
and,

1002
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:30,110
he makes us call him that primogenitor.

1003
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:36,550
How can man die better than by facing fearful odds with the ashes of his father?

1004
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:36,590


1005
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:36,590


1006
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:36,590


1007
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:36,590


1008
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,190
in the temple of his gods.

1009
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,910
You should have seen Pappy at the Smith family reunion.

1010
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:47,190
We arrived there, and he strode in and announced,

1011
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:49,830
everybody come over here and sit and listen to me,

1012
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:52,270
because I'm the king here, which was true.

1013
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,830
He was the eldest of all.

1014
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:55,950
There were only two real patriarchs left,

1015
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:57,170
him and his younger brother.

1016
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:00,050
Uncle Charlie's kids turned out rich.

1017
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,670
You could tell. They talked about skiing,

1018
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:06,310
and they had that tan that only rich people have.

1019
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:07,070
Skiing, eh?

1020
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,610
Yeah. Yeah.

1021
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:12,550
Uncle Charlie worked for the Rockefellers and died young.

1022
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:13,910
Hmm, coincidence.

1023
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,850
Like Nelson Rockefeller?

1024
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:18,850
Yeah, like Nelson Rockefeller.

1025
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:19,930
Yes, he did.

1026
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:27,890
Actually, there was a Smith who was a senator in South Carolina

1027
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:30,630
longer than anybody who's been a senator anywhere.

1028
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:32,030
You know, Stan...

1029
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,930
Senator Cotton Ed Smith.

1030
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:35,810
Throughout this entire broadcast,

1031
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:36,290
you've been a Senator.

1032
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,310
You've been unusually revelatory,

1033
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:41,510
telling all sorts of secrets from your family,

1034
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:42,870
secrets of the church.

1035
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,150
No. Well, that's the next day.

1036
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,470
The world ends tomorrow, and you may die.

1037
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:48,390
Who gives a shit?

1038
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:49,990
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1039
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:52,710
Anyway, that certainly makes it a historic...

1040
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:55,910
Besides, who's gonna track down somebody named Smith?

1041
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:59,250
That's the... you're hiding in plain sight

1042
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:04,550
the most common name in the universe, except for China.

1043
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,830
There's a lot more Lees than there are Smiths.

1044
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:10,210
That Lee guy, he was a cutter.

1045
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:10,910
Prolific.

1046
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:13,710
He scored a bunch.

1047
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:17,190
The Smith guy was pretty active.

1048
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:22,450
Actually, the Williams guys may have surpassed Smiths recently.

1049
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:27,770
And Gonzales and Rodriguez are...

1050
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:31,270
I think have outpaced the Smiths by a long shot.

1051
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,870
You are keeping track of the...

1052
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,070
You better believe it.

1053
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:34,530
That's the...

1054
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:34,530


1055
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,970
I got a long list.

1056
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,210
I got a damn long list.

1057
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,190
Those who've been naughty and those who've been nice.

1058
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,790
Those who've been nice, I don't have to worry about.

1059
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:43,610
They'll all be on the sausage.

1060
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:47,110
But the competition never ends until the actual end of the world.

1061
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,410
It rises and falls.

1062
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:52,530
You know, you can see who's ahead at any given time,

1063
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:56,030
but it's like a horse race that never gallops to a conclusion.

1064
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,610
Well, unless you wipe out everyone else.

1065
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:01,070
But that's another Twilight Zone.

1066
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,150
That's another Marvel horror comic.

1067
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:04,510
How about the one where... How about the one where...

1068
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,550
How about the Twilight Zone where everybody else has your face?

1069
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,550
What about that one?

1070
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:11,970
Now, whaaaat?

1071
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:16,410
Don't you remember that there was a Twilight Zone where someone like Shecky Green,

1072
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:20,750
I don't know who, maybe it was Shecky Green, hates everybody else,

1073
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:27,990
and so his particular Twilight Zone torture is to be projected into a world where everybody has his face.

1074
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,090
How did they do that? I don't remember.

1075
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,850
Are you talking about the original series?

1076
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,510
Yes, I'm talking about the original Twilight Zone. I saw every single one.

1077
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:35,990
I saw one of them three years ago.

1078
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:41,770
Am I quite mistaken about this? But surely there is such an episode because...

1079
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:45,450
Maybe it just blew my mind so bad that I...

1080
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:47,530
Like everybody sees on the subway...

1081
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,870
How'd they do that? I mean, being John Malkovich has...

1082
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,930
His landlady, everybody, you know...

1083
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:53,290
Well, did they use masks?

1084
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:54,470
I think...

1085
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,470
Or did they dress him up in a million costumes?

1086
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:58,330
I think they dressed him up as much as possible.

1087
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:01,430
They used masks, they used split screens. I don't really remember.

1088
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:03,990
Does anybody else remember this or is he putting me on?

1089
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:07,610
This was in the 60s, back when I saw it as a kid.

1090
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:16,530
I've got... I've recently... Princess Wee and I watched every original Twilight Zone, all five years worth, 154 episodes.

1091
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,490
Well, someone will be able to tell us before too long.

1092
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:18,830
Not long ago.

1093
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:22,890
Perhaps some listener to this broadcast and self-professed expert on the Twilight Zone.

1094
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:26,350
I can look it up on Twilight... There's a website where you can...

1095
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:29,790
You can look it up but not by the title since we don't know the title.

1096
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:33,910
This website has them broken down by categories and subdivisions.

1097
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:46,930
And I'm not sure that it was Shecky Green but it's some sort of borscht belt comedian with a sad bulldog-like face, sagging and by no means not the face that you want everybody else in the world to have.

1098
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,010
Well, anyway...

1099
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,030
I'm sort of remembering this.

1100
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,350
By Rod Serling.

1101
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:57,250
It must have been late at night when I saw that one.

1102
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:03,790
Late at night and dyspeptic sleepless time when you toss turns.

1103
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,510
And turn on the Twilight Zone.

1104
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:10,310
View without warning this peculiar solipsistic episode.

1105
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:25,530
When we were watching those, it struck me night after night how influential that show was on me and everybody who made movies since then, practically.

1106
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:26,210
Yes.

1107
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:33,290
So many of the big filmmakers now, you can see that Twilight Zone in shots they do.

1108
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:33,770
Yes.

1109
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:36,310
It leaks over into everything.

1110
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,950
Rod Serling was a great subgenius.

1111
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:41,290
Truly great subgenius.

1112
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:46,110
And the late Richard Matheson who just joined the saucers ahead of us.

1113
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:46,310
He just died. Yes.

1114
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:48,210
He wrote a lot of those.

1115
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:51,410
Jack Vance also died a couple months back.

1116
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,970
And the most subgenius one of all...

1117
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:57,110
I have his condition so I can't remember his name.

1118
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:00,630
Charles Beaumont.

1119
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:01,070
Charles Beaumont.

1120
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:02,710
Yeah, Charles Beaumont who...

1121
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:04,810
He died young. That was a change.

1122
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,130
Yeah.

1123
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:13,270
Yeah. He had a brain disease that affected his sense of reality and he wrote all those scripts that are so effective.

1124
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,270
For the Twilight Zone.

1125
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:21,310
Where a guy like goes into space and he comes back and the world is almost exactly like it was but that picket fence wasn't there.

1126
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,090
Oh yeah, we've always had that picket fence there.

1127
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:24,930
You know, little details.

1128
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,070
Charles Beaumont lived in that world.

1129
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,110
Charles Beaumont.

1130
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,950
Charles Beaumont, Ray Bradbury, William F. Nolan...

1131
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,310
He died so quick...

1132
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,110
Richard Matheson...

1133
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,710
The other guys had to finish some of his scripts for him.

1134
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:43,450
So there'd be money for hospital bills and a funeral.

1135
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,030
Sad, sad tale. Oh well.

1136
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:47,810
Well...

1137
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,750
And Rod Serling paid his dues too.

1138
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:59,190
He was a serviceman who saw a grisly death and hence did several of the most effective and daring anti-war...

1139
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,510
and anti-racist stuff.

1140
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:02,350
Yes, he got...

1141
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,110
In the Twilight Zone. He was way ahead of his time with that stuff.

1142
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:08,190
Because the networks didn't like anything controversial.

1143
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:13,890
But if it was sci-fi, you could sneak stuff in.

1144
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:18,170
Also it was new and new fangled and new frontier and...

1145
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,030
Right, high tech.

1146
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:19,830
Like that, you know.

1147
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:25,770
It was thought to be the cool thing even if the executives didn't understand it.

1148
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:27,110
You can't argue with the ratings.

1149
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:32,350
I started seeing him in the third season.

1150
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:36,490
So that was when we watched him in chronological order.

1151
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:42,290
And when it got to the third season, that's when it started sparking memories in my head.

1152
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:43,610
It's like...

1153
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:44,310
The long ones...

1154
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:49,190
I'd see that guy peeling the skin back from his arm, revealing that he is one of the robots.

1155
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,510
That's a Twilight Zone that's an hour long.

1156
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,710
One of the hour long ones they experimented with doing.

1157
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:56,550
When I saw that shot...

1158
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:57,890
Oh, and there was another shot.

1159
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:58,850
The episode where...

1160
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:01,410
These astronauts are on a planet.

1161
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:04,050
The guy holds out a hand to show what he found.

1162
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,470
And there's a tiny...

1163
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:06,910
Semi.

1164
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:07,910
Semi, yeah.

1165
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:09,270
Semi truck in his hand.

1166
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,290
Smaller than an insect's hand.

1167
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:12,310
Those two scenes...

1168
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:18,450
When those hit me three years ago, for the first time since I was about six or seven,

1169
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:23,110
I suddenly remembered every little girl I had a crush on.

1170
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:26,470
Every tasty hamburger I'd ever had in elementary school.

1171
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:28,670
Just all these memories came.

1172
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,270
Came rushing back.

1173
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:33,230
And also how much I myself had ripped off Twilight Zone.

1174
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:36,510
I hadn't even thought about it until then.

1175
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,830
Well, art is synthesis.

1176
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:42,690
And we process what it is that we have to work with.

1177
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:46,770
Weave it into our own sub-creation.

1178
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:48,670
Was Bob in any Twilight Zones?

1179
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:54,190
Didn't you just say you watched them all recently?

1180
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:55,530
No, I watched them all.

1181
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:56,270
Yeah.

1182
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,190
Yeah.

1183
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:03,330
But I mean, if he did, he'd be in the background, most likely.

1184
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,090
And I don't even...

1185
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:06,790
When I watch a show, I'm just kind of...

1186
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:09,270
Well, there were some where they played with the concept.

1187
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:11,370
And some where they cheated with the concept.

1188
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:19,910
There is a subgenius Twilight Zone episode where it opens up with this bumbling, happy-go-lucky

1189
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:20,670
slacker.

1190
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:21,810
Uh-oh.

1191
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,230
Played by Red Buttons, I think.

1192
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:25,870
Even worse.

1193
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:31,010
And a genie decides, oh, this guy can't get a girlfriend and he's getting...

1194
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:33,510
The most important question of all time.

1195
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:34,310
So important.

1196
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,170
You have to stop what you're doing.

1197
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:38,650
The world can't continue until we know the answer.

1198
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:40,390
Well, I'm not on duty now.

1199
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:40,490
What's that?

1200
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,190
I'm not doing Ask Dr. Hal.

1201
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:44,050
But you could save the Earth.

1202
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:45,750
Or kill it, whatever you want.

1203
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:47,870
Well, now I'm...

1204
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:48,430
Leave it up to me.

1205
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:48,950
What's the problem?

1206
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:53,390
We need to know, you know, that Saul, genie in disguise.

1207
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:55,850
What the hell is that all about?

1208
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:57,430
Who in disguise?

1209
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:58,650
Judy in disguise.

1210
00:53:59,010 --> 00:53:59,750
Who says this?

1211
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:01,010
Judy?

1212
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:02,290
In disguise.

1213
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:03,950
You know, Judy in disguise.

1214
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:04,410
Judy in disguise.

1215
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:05,330
It's what you are.

1216
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:06,550
Judy in disguise.

1217
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:08,190
Judy in disguise.

1218
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:11,070
Well, that's what you are.

1219
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:16,930
A lemonade pass with your brand new crown.

1220
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:21,530
It's the kind of love I ask of the 12 of them I met.

1221
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:22,990
Judy in disguise.

1222
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:24,490
Who does this?

1223
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:24,850
And the answer is...

1224
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:25,110
Oh, so that's what you're talking about.

1225
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:25,350
What were you doing?

1226
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:25,490


1227
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:25,490


1228
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:25,490


1229
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:25,490


1230
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:25,490


1231
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:25,490


1232
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:25,490


1233
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:25,490


1234
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:25,490


1235
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:33,570
And this has a terrible effect on the disintegration of the earth and all the apocalyptic things?

1236
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:37,550
And the time-space continuum and indoor plumbing, it affects everything.

1237
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:46,590
Well, the song was based on a Twilight Zone about a subgenius who a genie comes along and turns him normal again,

1238
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:50,970
makes him normal so that he can make money and have a girlfriend, and he's miserable.

1239
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:55,550
So he forces a genie to turn him back into a subgenius.

1240
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:59,690
And that episode is what inspired that song.

1241
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:05,390
The song doesn't have any relation to the episode seemingly,

1242
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:13,570
and that is what makes it a perfect subgenius surrealist, bold surrealism piece of art.

1243
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:17,570
So what you're saying is Bob was a woman and he played Judy, and it ruined everything?

1244
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,670
You could interpret it that way.

1245
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:24,790
Or Judy channeled her Bob nature as much as she had,

1246
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:25,710
which...

1247
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:27,330
Which fluctuates in every individual.

1248
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:27,670
You know, that is a good question.

1249
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:29,350
And can sometimes be overwhelming.

1250
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,550
I told you it was real. I would never interrupt if it wasn't deathly important.

1251
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:34,750
Well, I...

1252
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:35,050
I'm not waiting.

1253
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:38,410
You know, we ought to Google the lyrics.

1254
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:39,370
We did.

1255
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:40,030
Oh.

1256
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,170
It gets weirder.

1257
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:47,530
Judy in disguise, well, that's a what you are.
