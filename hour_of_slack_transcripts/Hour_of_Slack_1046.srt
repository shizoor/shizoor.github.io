00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,620
Ladies and gentlemen, here is the latest bulletin from the Intercontinental Radio News.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,520
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,940
I'm standing in a large, semicircular, pitch-black oblong split in the ceiling.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,220
Through this opening, I can see...

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,140
The self-genius, power of spark!

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,900
In the meantime, we take you to the Hotel Martinet,

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,280
where Bob and his orchestra are offering a program of dance music.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:41,380
There was a farmer, B-O-B was his name, oh, B-O-B, B-O-B, B-O-B was his name, oh!

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:48,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm visiting Washington this week as part of a 13-day visit to Mexico,

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,920
PR's bad,

11
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,300
on Wall Street 6103341263.

12
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,660
Two teams of scientists have developed a new approach to obtaining taxpayer dollars to facilitate

13
00:00:59,660 --> 00:00:59,980
the production of the film.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,100
The U.S. military says U.S. warplanes and helicopters have killed PR News in Washington.

15
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,680
The U.S. military says U.S. warplanes and helicopters have killed PR News in Washington.

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:32,320
The U.S. military says U.S. warplanes and helicopters have killed PR News in Washington.

17
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,500
The U.S. military says U.S. warplanes and helicopters have killed PR News in Washington.

18
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,120
And who am I?

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,300
I am just a nobody.

20
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:48,160
Yes, a nobody, because you can't see my body, but you can hear my voice.

21
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,260
So I am a somebody.

22
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:58,080
Yes, I am speaking to your inner self, to your consciousness, to your inner sanctum soul

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:04,120
of your universal mind, to where the magical kingdom of God is within you.

24
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,780
Not someplace.

25
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,020
else. For what is

26
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,840
here is every place else.

27
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,740
And what is not here

28
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,980
is no other place to be found.

29
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,340
Is no other place to be found.

30
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,980
Is no other place to be found.

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,000
Is no other place to be found.

32
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,980
Is no other place to be found.

33
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,540
Ladies and gentlemen, you're listening to

34
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,100
The Self Genius

35
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,720
Hour of

36
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:27,960
Swag.

37
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,560
Yet it was

38
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,060
Artemia

39
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,500
Salina.

40
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,680
If our nation should ever be

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,000
attacked,

42
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,840
the pleasure humain

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,740
follow the instructions you hear

44
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,700
qui nous en donne.

45
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,860
In the event of attack,

46
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,680
on y est? Parfait.

47
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,000
A jet bomber

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,880
could fly five miles an hour.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,760
Une facette psychospirituelle.

50
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,520
Une facette psychospirituelle.

51
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,440
Une facette psychospirituelle.

52
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,440


53
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,200
There's a lady

54
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,400
who's sure

55
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,480
all that glitters is gold.

56
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,820
And she's

57
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,240
a

58
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,000
stay away

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,900
to heaven.

60
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,220
Yet there's

61
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,000
an emotional

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
if the stars

63
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:27,840
are

64
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,020
A word she can get, get what?

65
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,920
What she came for

66
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,080
And she's buying a stairway to heaven

67
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,680
There's a sign on the wall

68
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,780
But she wants to be sure

69
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,780
Cause you know sometimes words have to mean

70
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,800
In a tree by the brook

71
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,500
There's a songbird who sings

72
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,360
Sometimes all about thoughts on this given

73
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,140
Ooh, when she's buying a stairway to heaven

74
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,180
Do I, do I, it makes me wonder

75
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,660
Do I, do I, it makes me wonder

76
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,920
Do I, do I, it makes me wonder

77
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,140
There's a feeling I get

78
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,400
When I look to the west

79
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,540
And my spirit is crying for you

80
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,240
In my thought I have seen

81
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,060
Rims of smoke through the tree

82
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,380
And the oysters over those hopes I'm looking

83
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,140
Do I, do I, it makes me wonder

84
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,760
Do I, do I, it makes me wonder

85
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:03,860
Do I, do I, it makes me wonder

86
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,380
Do I, do I, it makes me wonder

87
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,520
Do I, do I, it makes me wonder

88
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,040
Do I, do I, it makes me wonder

89
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,400
And it's whispered that soon

90
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,080
If we all call the tune

91
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,060
Then the pipe will lead us to reason

92
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,980
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long

93
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,760
And the fire will burn for those who stand long

94
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,140
And the forests will echo with laughter

95
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,420
Does anybody remember laughter?

96
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,720
And she's buying a stairway to heaven

97
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,160
And it makes me wonder

98
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,840
Yeah

99
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,740
If there's a bustling forest

100
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:56,740


101
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,540
In your hedgerow

102
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,040
Call the gardener

103
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,180
It's just a spring cleat for the May Queen

104
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,560
Yes, there are two paths

105
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,140
So you can go back one at a laura

106
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,580
There's still time to change the road you're on

107
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,220
The road you're on

108
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,000
Do I really mean that my entire life is in vain?

109
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,480
Do I, do I, it makes me wonder

110
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,180
Or am I lost?

111
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,500
Do I, do I, it makes me wonder

112
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,240
Do I, do I, it makes me wonder

113
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,740
Your head is humming and it won't go

114
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,400
In case you don't know

115
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,360
The piper's calling you to join him

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,680
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?

117
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,120
And did you know

118
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,580
Your stairway lies on the whispered wind?

119
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,360
Ah!

120
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,080
Take a guess

121
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,160
Maybe I'm asleep

122
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,480
Ever been the wanderer

123
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,580
Don't you know

124
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,540
Magic's smile doesn't want to apologize

125
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:10,540


126
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:17,920
To the real or an inin deactivatedè¬›

127
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:26,740
To the real unless you want to Shut up your ears

128
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,320
Thank you.

129
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,660
Thank you.

130
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,060
Thank you.

131
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,920
Thank you.

132
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,440
Thank you.

133
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,040
Thank you.

134
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:26,900
Thank you.

135
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,760
Thank you.

136
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,380
Thank you.

137
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,480
Thank you.

138
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,520
Thank you.

139
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,800
That sounds delicious.

140
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,920
I bet the clean-up is easy.

141
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,600
I bet it's inexpensive and really just satisfies your man at home.

142
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,920
Definitely.

143
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,720
Yeah.

144
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,480
Reverend Stang is one of the happiest stomached men ever.

145
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,980
So he tells me, anyway.

146
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,760
If we could switch gears for a moment,

147
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,920
I have a question about the political scene.

148
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,760
And I know it must seem so provincial

149
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,960
from the cosmic point of view of being queen of all the UFOs,

150
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,400
but where do the...

151
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,380
Amos, again, you need to be as loud as you can.

152
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,340
You know, I'm actually rather old,

153
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,100
and I can't hear very well,

154
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,340
so you have to speak right up next to the microphone.

155
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,180
A thousand pardons, Your Majesty.

156
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,280
Quite all right.

157
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,780
Where do the UFOs, the alien people,

158
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,760
stand on the current immigration legislation?

159
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,820
And have you considered using any of your influence,

160
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,640
power, death rays, etc.,

161
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,580
to tilt the scales one way or the other?

162
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,660
I know it must seem a kind of provincial issue

163
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,700
on this little suburban island we call America.

164
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,820
You know, again,

165
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,780
this actually may feel like a cop-out to you,

166
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,200
but I have to say that with the people that...

167
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,840
the creatures, the beings that I am in touch with

168
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,360
being the unidentified ones,

169
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,740
I really can't speak for them.

170
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,120
The identified ones that you're curious about,

171
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,280
I don't have much knowledge of.

172
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,980
So I really...

173
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,020
I'm not able to give an opinion one way or the other

174
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,700
for those folks.

175
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,480
Hmm.

176
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,260
Sorry.

177
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,920
Okay, well...

178
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,080
It's just not in my realm.

179
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,700
What type of...

180
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,880
Like, so you're the queen of all UFOs.

181
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,160
Yeah.

182
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,580
What kind of managerial roles do you play?

183
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,700
Managerial roles?

184
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,680
Well, actually,

185
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,320
I would give you a day in the life.

186
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,920
As Reverend Stang would say,

187
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,060
my job is to stand around looking beautiful.

188
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,080
And I don't really have a hard time doing that.

189
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,240
It's a lot of fun.

190
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,380
I allow Reverend Stang to worship me,

191
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,940
adore me, preen me.

192
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,120
He massages my head, my shoulders, my neck, and my feet,

193
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,020
and all over my body every day.

194
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,460
And pretty much that's about it.

195
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,500
It's rough work, but someone's got to do it.

196
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,400
Well...

197
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,820
So as far as administrative duties,

198
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,420
like, you know, the action items,

199
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,460
you know, things that have to happen during the day for me,

200
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,820
it's actually...

201
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,440
It's so slackful that it's hard to describe.

202
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,380
Mm-hmm.

203
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,220
How about if, let's just say,

204
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,340
I mean, I'm talking about a friend of mine here.

205
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,200
Let's just say that you wanted to meet an exist.

206
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,280
Or, you know,

207
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,780
because there's all these tales about alien abductions and things like that.

208
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,100
Let's just say a friend of yours that you know about

209
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,040
really has been trying for years to meet an alien.

210
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,340
Cruising forward.

211
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,520
Could you hook a brother up?

212
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm afraid that's outside my realm, too.

213
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,600
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:23,760
I'm sorry.

215
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,120
Just totally outside my realm.

216
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,820
It's nothing that I have any control or power over.

217
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,600
You know, I think I know myself and all the listeners at home.

218
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,260
We really want to know what you are responsible for.

219
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,820
I mean, what do you do?

220
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,800
And are you willing to take this opportunity now

221
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,500
in this international exclusive broadcast

222
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,100
on Amos Hap's Electric Chalet

223
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,700
in the Feminist Kitchen starring Rikki Shangles?

224
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,480
Do you, Princess We Are Doe, queen of all the UFOs,

225
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,560
want to apologize for Shirley MacLaine once and for all?

226
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,940
Well, you know, Shirley MacLaine,

227
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,860
I'm actually, I'm not really all that familiar

228
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,300
with your Earth Farm One culture,

229
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,120
pop culture and other cultures.

230
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,400
I just, I don't study it.

231
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,420
I'm not familiar with it.

232
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,420
And I've heard that she's kind of gone off the deep end

233
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,500
as far as being sort of like a new age or newage

234
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,980
hippy-dippy-dip shit.

235
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,260
But, you know, it's not my fault.

236
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,280
And, um...

237
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,960
Not your fault.

238
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,540
I'm really not all that familiar with her and her work.

239
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,220
But you are asking what I do.

240
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,220
And let me tell you what I do.

241
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,280
I do actually have some influence in the Church of the Subgenius.

242
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,380
For instance, I have veto power.

243
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,320
I nay-said the branding, the required branding

244
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,980
that was going to be for every subgenius.

245
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,360
That was totally nay-said by me.

246
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:49,980
No way.

247
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,980
I said no way.

248
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,520
Also, there was going to be required trepanning,

249
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,480
no way.

250
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,560
I said no way.

251
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,580
That's not going to happen.

252
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,320
Um, I also...

253
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,000
What about the bobbies?

254
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,700
Pardon me?

255
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,780
What about the bobbies?

256
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,100
The bobbies, if they want to do the branding

257
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,000
and the trepanning themselves,

258
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,060
they're perfectly welcome to.

259
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,500
But it's not going to be done under the auspices

260
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,040
of the Church of the Subgenius while I'm seated here.

261
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,380
What about the soul harvesting?

262
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,780
Do you have any qualms about that?

263
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,180
Or the prairie squid, for that matter?

264
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,460
Does that raise any jealousy issues?

265
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,740
Oh, absolutely.

266
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,300
You know, not at all.

267
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,720
If there weren't prairie squids,

268
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,940
there would be just so many unhappy people out there,

269
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,940
men and women.

270
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,580
We need prairie squids.

271
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,200
No, there's no jealousy issues.

272
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,020
Absolutely not.

273
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,920
I would like to, you know, take it into the bedroom.

274
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,680
If you feel uncomfortable with some of my questions,

275
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,060
if you don't like them, you just throw them right back.

276
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,020
All right.

277
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,260
Is it true that it ain't cheating if it's Bob, ladies?

278
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:47,720
That is true.

279
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,380
That's 100% true.

280
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,380
It ain't cheating if it's Bob, and it ain't for the guys.

281
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,800
It ain't gay if it's Bob.

282
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,760
And same thing with women.

283
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,080
It ain't gay if it's Connie.

284
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,340
You know, it's all free love when it comes to Bob and Connie.

285
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,080
I mean, they're kind of like Jungian archetypes in that sense.

286
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,160
They're not even on our realm.

287
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,280
That's true.

288
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,760
It's like having sex with an idea.

289
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,620
Have you ever had sex with J.R. Bob Dobbs?

290
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,580
Well, I can't let something like that out.

291
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,080
Come on.

292
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,700
What do you think?

293
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,900
I can't say this enough.

294
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,440
You guys are just trying.

295
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,300
You get me to reveal things, and I'm not going to do it.

296
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,100
Okay.

297
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,360
Well, how about if we hit it from this angle?

298
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,400
Does Ivan Stang ever get mad when you have sex with J.R. Bob Dobbs?

299
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:45,080
Well, let's just say that, you know, he's learned to deal with his boss in special ways,

300
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,780
and they work things out between them.

301
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,060
Well, that sounds good to me.

302
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:55,880
Yeah.

303
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,220
Oh.

304
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,100
Yeah.

305
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,960
Gotta have slack.

306
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,600
Gotta.

307
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,200
You gotta have.

308
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,180
Gotta have slack.

309
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,240
Yeah.

310
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,340
Yeah.

311
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,960
I got a big old bob

312
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:38,520
I got a big old bob

313
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,580
He's right inside my pocket

314
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,320
Got my big old bob

315
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,360
Just reach inside my pocket

316
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,180
I just washed him off

317
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,360
He ain't too stinky this time

318
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,780
You got to try my bob

319
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,200
He really wants to meet you

320
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,800
If you'll open up to bob

321
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,260
You'll know that he's a love god

322
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,540
And once he gets inside

323
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,080
He's never gonna leave you

324
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,100
The burning seed of bob

325
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,200
Is leaking out of my pocket

326
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,800
Just open under him

327
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,060
He'll crawl inside your socket

328
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,780
Well, you know, the Catholics are

329
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,780
Have all kinds of

330
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,340
They've had to face a lot of

331
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,580
Blanket hatred

332
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,600
Especially nowadays

333
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,120
I mean, it's almost like

334
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,960
The name of their sect is synonymous

335
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,400
With child molestation

336
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,740
Which is certainly not fair

337
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,360
To the average Catholic

338
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,700
And it doesn't help that

339
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,280
The new pope used to be a Nazi

340
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,720
It doesn't help

341
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,060
He wasn't really a Nazi

342
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,640
You know, so I mean

343
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,760
It's like any religion

344
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,320
You can find a good reason

345
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,200
To make fun of

346
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,620
That's what I like about it

347
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,000
They're all kind of

348
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,940
When you get down to it

349
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,500
They're all the same

350
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,560
Except, of course, for

351
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,960
J.R. Bogg's religion

352
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,100
Which is better

353
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,800
Simply because that's the one

354
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,520
We believe in

355
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,160
But it could also be called

356
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,240
Anti-religion

357
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,240
Well, only anti-false religions

358
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,000
Right

359
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,360
Well, we've swiped it

360
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,400
I mean, borrowed from

361
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,520
All the good religions

362
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,060
Well, the good parts

363
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,400
From lots of bad religions

364
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,120
I should say

365
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,160
The naughty bits, you know

366
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,540
Like when you

367
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,800
The special books that your dad

368
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,140
Kept in his underwear drawer

369
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,340
Next to the gun

370
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,080
And balloons

371
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,920
All the Larry Flitter books

372
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,980
And, you know

373
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,800
He had these special paperbacks

374
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,640
And you'd look for the good parts

375
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,120
In those

376
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,480
That's the way we put together

377
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,020
Bob's

378
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,520
The details in Bob's religion

379
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,760
Using his memos

380
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,880
And other people's old

381
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,180
Cast-aside religions

382
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,760
Secret communiques

383
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,660
It was cool back then

384
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,460
It ain't the same now

385
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,540
Now that you put

386
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,860
Type of button in a computer

387
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,160
Anybody can make a religion

388
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,760
In a computer

389
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,580
And anybody can make porn

390
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,820
In a computer

391
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,720
Yeah, but back then

392
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,860
They had to make porn the hard way

393
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,980
I've got a copy of a

394
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,460
Comedy porno movie

395
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,860
It's like an old underground comic

396
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,700
In some ways

397
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,640
It's in Spanish

398
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,280
And it's all computer animated

399
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,040
People doing bizarre

400
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,420
Sexy stuff

401
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,120
And not normal looking people

402
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,880
Either

403
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,840
It's all kinds of strange characters

404
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,400
Almost an inspiration

405
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,780
From a reproduction cycle

406
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,620
It's like a desktop

407
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,800
A desktop animated porno movie

408
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,200
I guess they used a poser

409
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,860
That program poser

410
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,920
Something like that

411
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,720
And it's called

412
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,380
Too Funky For You

413
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,780
With the numeral 2

414
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,860
And the numeral 4

415
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,620
In the title

416
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,980
The radio synesthesia

417
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,140
On WCSN

418
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,600
In Cleveland

419
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,580
Cleveland State University

420
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,760
Provided us with all of that

421
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,600
Thanks to Dr. Sinister

422
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,980
Before that we heard a little bit of a song

423
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,340
By D.K. Jones

424
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,400
And where's truly Reverend Stank

425
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,080
And some saucer bed sound effects

426
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,800
By Frater Saadi

427
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,780
And now

428
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:53,960
Mm-hmm

429
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,920
Ladies when you buy milk

430
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,720
Remember that no other kind of milk

431
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,080
Has as many uses as

432
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,460
The self genius

433
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,180
Power of

434
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,140
Swag

435
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,820
That's miraculous

436
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,380
Good good good

437
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,120
Oh nonsense

438
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,620
Well it doesn't seem quite ethical somehow

439
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,860
From the studios of PR

440
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,640
This is PR Bluster

441
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,120
PR

442
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,400
Where you can listen to people yell at each other

443
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,500
PR is just talking

444
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:21,780

446

But he was nervous

We believe that

453
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,440
Did he appear nervous?

454
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,400
Definitely

455
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,900
How nervous?

456
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,660
A little more

The lemur did it

463
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,660
And now a submission

464
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,340
From a new depositor

465
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,740
Called

466
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,780
The Caveator

467
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
Good morning again

468
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,380
Good morning again

469
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,180
I am not a number

470
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,840
I am a person

471
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,840
What's it all about?

472
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,480
I am number six

473
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,260
I am number six

474
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,740
Where am I?

475
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,220
Orange

476
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,100
Where am I?

477
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,980
We're all pawns you do

478
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,580
I resigned

479
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,420
I will not be pushed

480
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,240
Filed

481
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,820
Stapped

482
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,680
Indexed

483
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,200
Briefed

484
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,840
Debriefed

485
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,320
Or numbered

486
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,940
My life is my own

487
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,880
Is it?

488
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,820
Mr. Wobba

489
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,640
I am a half-dozen-and-a-nother

490
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,160
It doesn't matter which side runs the village

491
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,680
It's one by one side or the other

492
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,460
No certainty

493
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,600
But both sides are becoming identical

494
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,160
What in fact has been created

495
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,820
An international community

496
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,220
A perfect blueprint for world order

497
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,040
When the sides facing each other suddenly realize that they're looking into a mirror

498
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,900
They will see that this is the pattern for the future

499
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,760
The whole earth

500
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,660
As the village

501
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,180
All the way up to the moon

502
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,820
The sun

503
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,220
Paint over our entire planet

504
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,280
Aoris

505
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,280


506
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,280


507
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,280


508
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,280


509
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,280


510
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,280


511
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,280


512
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,340
You won't hide

513
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:03,340


514
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:03,340


515
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:03,740
Thinks

516
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,300
That's better than me

517
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,900
So you wanted to vent

518
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,820
So we will stay

519
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,540
Come back, wipe this place off the face of the earth obliterated, and you with it.

520
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,700
Your services will not be required tomorrow.

521
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,620
How about the conspiracy?

522
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:21,500
Oh.

523
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,280
Yeah.

524
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,280
Everybody has some conspiracy theory.

525
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:32,320
We're not talking about the little conspiracy theories like the crashed UFOs at Area 51

526
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,340
or the mafia killing Kennedy or any of that, or the fashion conspiracy

527
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,760
that makes you think you have to wear makeup and look a certain way.

528
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,360
No, no.

529
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,120
Those are minuscule compared to the true conspiracy of the normals.

530
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,660
And it doesn't even know it's a conspiracy.

531
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,720
It's not clever.

532
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,520
They don't even know they're doing it.

533
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,760
Well, once I'm automatic.

534
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:01,460
The times they were a-changing, but now it looks like they may stop changing.

535
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,260
That actually seems to be the fear.

536
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,880
Them, they, the others.

537
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,840
The others seem to want all change to stop.

538
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,700
It's like, okay, we've got our internet and crap.

539
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,780
We can stop changing now.

540
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,240
We must not let the stopping even begin, my friends.

541
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,920
People don't even notice the world ending.

542
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,200
I look around you, you know, it's that we're in the middle of the shakedown.

543
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:33,060
Obviously, we've got to get slack because time is running out.

544
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,480
Time itself is running out when things stop changing.

545
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,260
That's the end of time.

546
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,680
And on that subject, President Bush.

547
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:48,040
You know, now, I don't, we're in Church of the Subgenius.

548
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,700
We're not, we try not to get too, we don't like to think of either side

549
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,880
of the conspiracy as being our friend.

550
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,240
They have this good cop, bad cop thing where, you know, whoa,

551
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,400
if Bush is so bad, then John Kerry must be my friend.

552
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,440
Well, you know, I don't know.

553
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,380
It's, and it's true.

554
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,260
Bush is so bad.

555
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,000
Do you sometimes wish that Bob Dole had won?

556
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,420
If that had meant that we wouldn't have to have Bush later,

557
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,720
it makes you yearn for his father.

558
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,060
It makes you miss Reagan.

559
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,840
Now, that is bad, friends.

560
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,160
That is really bad.

561
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,560
And they're bad shots, too.

562
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,180
I actually almost did the same thing Cheney did.

563
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,400
I did not shoot my dad in the face.

564
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,600
I missed.

565
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,840
But, but I, but Lonesome Cowboy Dave was going, oh, you know,

566
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,460
you know how I shot his friend in the face?

567
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,680
He just wanted to help him keep a low profile.

568
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,480
Okay, I got that one out.

569
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,240
I can erase it.

570
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,160
So, friends, how did the world get so dirty?

571
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,380
Evolution isn't fair.

572
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,780
The decks are stacked for the winners.

573
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,460
And the, the, our privacies are all being taken away.

574
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,320
Have you heard about urine tracings?

575
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,820
Where now they can actually trace where you've been and what you've bought by your pee.

576
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,720
They can judge your character by your pee.

577
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,460
And I don't mean by when you take a pee test when you go for a job.

578
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,060
I mean every time you flush the toilet.

579
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,980
You are flushing your children down the drain.

580
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,760
Their future, their privacy.

581
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,240
They will sue us retroactively, friends, for lying to the doctor.

582
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,520
Because they can track you through your toilet.

583
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,460
And that's very people.

584
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:36,460


585
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,100
That's paranoia, isn't it?

586
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,300
It's a new word.

587
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,900
As the cold, gray dawn broke over the fog-shrouded coastal village of Benton Cove, death came

588
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,300
to the big house on the hill.

589
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,680
School lunch should be balanced nutritionally.

590
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,840
That's why a dessert for lunch is just as essential as for a bigger, heavier meal.

591
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,360
What could be simpler for you to serve?

592
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,460
Or more enjoyable?

593
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,180
More enjoyable and tasty for your children than cupcakes.

594
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:15,860
Of course, cupcakes make an ideal after-school snack along with a tall, cold glass of beer.

595
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:27,740
The word Bob from the old ganglionic responses signifies a species or separate race.

596
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,020
Only for lack of proper understanding has Bob been considered as an individual.

597
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,860
That man is a homicidal maniac!

598
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,560
More really.

599
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:41,140
As the Orgosmososm, he is the chief product of the semi-tergid, the Jehovah One, who back-up

600
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,680
this music.

601
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,400
The man with the judge's hopelessly insane.

602
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,440
And within the nature of this microgasm, the space god, Yahweh One, established all the

603
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,780
qualities of powers that he himself possessed.

604
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:52,980
He must be returned to us.

605
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,380
Jehovah Prime, however, does not have slack.

606
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,280
And therefore, could not only not bestow it upon Bob...

607
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,240
Crazy like a fox.

608
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,540
From PR News in Washington, I'm Bob Duff.

609
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:05,540


610
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:05,540


611
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,660
And I'm brought in separately.

612
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,920
He looked at the man next to him and smiled and smiled.

613
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,580
Gun control advocates don't keep track of their merchandise.

614
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,940
He says the memos show a disaster non-existent.

615
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:26,420
White House News Secretary Scott McClellan says the Bush administration struggled to locate food, water, and even PR news in Washington.

616
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,240
The dealers of America present the...

617
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,240
So genius.

618
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,560
Power of...

619
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,140
...the world.

620
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,980
And this is Kenny saying hello for your friendly dealer.

621
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,020
They're the men you can always count on.

622
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,200
Save trouble and save money.

623
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,960
Um, do you...

624
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:53,080
I've, you know, as a female subgenius, I've noticed that the female perspective is often left out.

625
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,880
Why do you think this is?

626
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,580
Well, the real problem is that there just isn't enough female participation in the church.

627
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,680
If more women would get involved...

628
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,720
...write, preach, send in their, their writings, there would be more representation from women.

629
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,860
It's all up to the women to get more involved so that they'll be more seen there.

630
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,280
Reverend Stang will put forth whatever is given to him.

631
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:30,080
If you do some spouting, some Connie-style spouting, he will love that.

632
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,900
By the way, you identified yourself just now as a female subgenius.

633
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:40,220
And I wanted to ask both you and Amos what your subgenius history is.

634
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,500
We'll ask the questions.

635
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,760
But we might deign to answer one if you could be a little more specific.

636
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,520
Okay.

637
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,640
Well, I just was very curious to know how you all came to know subgenius.

638
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,740
I mean, it's been ten years ago for you, Amos.

639
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,840
And Reiki, I'm not sure about you.

640
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:03,880
And I was just totally, honestly curious to know how you became associated with it.

641
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:03,880


642
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,460
I'm not sure about me, Princess.

643
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,420
I don't know.

644
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,240
I think...

645
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,360
Pleiadians, I should say.

646
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:19,860
I was recruited at 16 by a Pleiadian emissary of light, given an incredible book called Bringers of the Dawn.

647
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:20,860
Bringers of the Dawn.

648
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:27,460
Which I read word for word at 16 years old and totally, absolutely, 100% believed it.

649
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,220
And my DNA did start to accelerate.

650
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,320
And now, in fact, I do not have the full 12 helix of DNA.

651
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,640
But I do have eight helixes.

652
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,520
And I'll tell you, eight is great.

653
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,060
Wow.

654
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,200
And so, I really came to it through that.

655
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:51,900
And only basically, I'd say, a year ago, I met my cult leader slash lover about two years ago.

656
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,200
And he said, you would love the Church of the Subgenius.

657
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,080
And as a true subgenius, I said, you're full of shit.

658
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,520
Stuff it up your ass.

659
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,640
I don't want to hear your lies.

660
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,320
I don't want to hear it.

661
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,080
I don't want to hear it.

662
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,880
So, I picked up a book about a year ago.

663
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,740
And it just, you know, it didn't even, I didn't even need to read it.

664
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,840
I picked it up through osmosis.

665
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,860
I've learned the dogma.

666
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,600
You'd wipe with it if I remember.

667
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,620
And you know what?

668
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,600
I, and I also am part Sasquatch.

669
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,340
I think that's, I have a stronger vein of Yeti in me.

670
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,080
I have a lot of Yeti in me.

671
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,980
I would like more Yeti in me.

672
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:25,780
But.

673
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,880
Not in the studio, Rikki.

674
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,420
But you, so that's my dogma.

675
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:30,820
I have.

676
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,200
I have eaten at restaurants called the Sasquatch.

677
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,600
I've seen Sasquatch.

678
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,740
I have been with Sasquatch.

679
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,900
I am a Sasquatch.

680
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,740
Cool.

681
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,900
And that's, that's my story.

682
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,820
Wow, thank you for sharing that with me, Rikki.

683
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,880
I really appreciate that.

684
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,440
Very cool.

685
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,980
I just, I just wanted to be knee deep in trim.

686
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,640
And being a lazy man, I knew that.

687
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,100
Let Bob do the work.

688
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,500
And also not very attractive.

689
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,160
No, not at all.

690
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,360
It just gets worse every year.

691
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,620
But you can imagine, even, even ten years ago.

692
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:10,200
Yeah, I mean he's about 250 pounds, 5'4", balding.

693
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,220
And he, let's be honest, it's about two inches.

694
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,160
Two and a half inches.

695
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,820
Oh, no, no.

696
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:25,020
I mean that depends on, you know, like when El Nino made the earth, they actually swell a little bit.

697
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,660
Causing it to go around slower, slow down the calendars.

698
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,640
Maybe then I had two inches, maybe.

699
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,100
And I mean, I'm not gonna lie to you folks.

700
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,020
I'm not gonna lie to you.

701
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,820
I am a, I'm a babalicious babe.

702
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,400
I'm gorgeous.

703
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,000
That's a fact.

704
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,920
Oh, that's, oh.

705
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:39,900
Yeah.

706
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,440
Good times.

707
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,140
And sometimes people look at us and they say, what?

708
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,300
They just don't get it.

709
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:50,720
But really, he, you know, he used, he used the subgenius dogma.

710
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,920
He used your guys' tricks to, to get sex.

711
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,080
And, you know, I didn't know it at the time.

712
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,220
But I, I thank him for it now.

713
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,280
And he's, you know, four and a half feet of pure man.

714
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,460
What a sweet story.

715
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,440
Yeah.

716
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,760
So.

717
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,840
I'm charmed.

718
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,900
I'm totally charmed.

719
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,640
I'm gonna take a break.

720
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,480
Do you mind if I ask you about you and Ivan Stang's relationship?

721
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,840
How did you two fall in love?

722
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,500
Well, no, I don't mind you asking at all.

723
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,960
I was, was and am associated with a group called Ace.

724
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,680
The Association for Consciousness Exploration.

725
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,020
And if you want to read all about it endlessly, you can go to one of our websites.

726
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:47,440
Ace, let's see, one is Rosencomet.com, R-O-S-E-N-C-O-M-E-T.com, or Starwoodfestival.com.

727
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,480
But that's how I met Reverend Stang.

728
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,420
Someone in our group brought him in for one of our Starwood festivals.

729
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,900
And I volunteered.

730
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,060
I volunteered to pick him up at the airport.

731
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,000
And that's how I met him.

732
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,820
And we were good friends for a long, long time.

733
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,860
And eventually we got to be more than friends when his marriage ended.

734
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:17,140
And he was free to pursue a relationship.

735
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,740
Did he break your watch to try to impress you?

736
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,920
No, he didn't.

737
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,840
He tried to.

738
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,580
But I had a fake, broken watch in my pocket.

739
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,280
And slipped that in, and he never knew.

740
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:34,680
He thought he was breaking my watch to get me, but it was actually a broken watch.

741
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,520
Don't cheat a cheater.

742
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,700
Salt River Stream

743
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:41,700


744
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,740
Shine

745
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,760
I dedicate this program to the fight against crime.

746
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,080
Not merely crimes of violence and crimes of dishonesty,

747
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,840
but crimes of intolerance, discrimination, and bad citizenship.

748
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,980
Crimes against America.

749
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:12,400
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

750
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,040
For most effective relief, use only as directed.

751
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,720
The relief it brings is incredibly fast.

752
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,660
Here's why.

753
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,400
No thanks.

754
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,460
And there, ladies and gentlemen, you have the beginning of our mystery.

755
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,540
Okay, let's talk shop.

756
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:39,160
If you could recommend one product that every subgenius must have, what would it be?

757
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,660
So I say out loud, and look at your beautiful big brain.

758
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:43,880
Please.

759
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,480
Well, of course, it would be a membership to the Church of the Subgenius.

760
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,100
I mean, that's, you know, the basic thing that everyone should have to protect you

761
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,700
so that when X day comes, you'll be delivered.

762
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,680
I mean, that's the most important thing.

763
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:05,320
Other than that, of course, everyone should start off with putting their baby toe in

764
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,200
of getting a rise, the subgenius video.

765
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,160
That would be my advice.

766
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:12,840
Just for basics.

767
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,360
Basic starters.

768
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:20,420
And just to put on the back burner here, I probably had some of the best sexual intercourse

769
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,300
of my life watching a rise.

770
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:22,860
Oh!

771
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,620
With, with, and I became J.R. Bob Dobbs.

772
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,400
And I came as J.R. Bob Dobbs, and let me tell you, wow.

773
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,140
It's like, Bob, you came again and again and again.

774
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,680
Yeah.

775
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,400
It was, it was the second and third and fourth coming.

776
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:42,880
It was.

777
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:43,720
It was.

778
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:43,720


779
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:43,720


780
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:43,720


781
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:43,720


782
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:43,720


783
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,060
Fourth coming.

784
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,500
It was ridiculous.

785
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:53,200
I can't abide them even now and then.

786
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:09,420
I can't abide them even now and then.

787
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,280
That's the worst that I have seen since.

788
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,280


789
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,280


790
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,280


791
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,280


792
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,520
Icia, I can stay for a long time, this little babe.

793
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:33,720
We're out and together in trouble all day.

794
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,360
Fine now.

795
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:35,360


796
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:35,360


797
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:35,360


798
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:35,520


799
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:35,820
Got to go clean up the ceremony.

800
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:35,820


801
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:35,840


802
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:35,840


803
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:35,840


804
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,640
I can still be positive about the future.

805
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:36,640


806
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:36,960
Bye-bye.

807
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,120
I'm in a good place.

808
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,120


809
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,640
OK.

810
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,040
You wanna have a but?

811
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,440
I'll go on quick.

812
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,120
Â¶Â¶

813
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,640
Â¶Â¶

814
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,340
Â¶Â¶

815
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,960
Wonderful piece.

816
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,900
Kevin Meredith did that wonderful piece there.

817
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,300
Â¶Â¶

818
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,540
Called Beneath a Shiny Crust of Solid Platinum.

819
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,680
That was the name of that instrumental beautiful piece.

820
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,180
And now, PR News.

821
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,280
From PR News in Washington, I'm disrupted.

822
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,940
A defense lawyer has been found today.

823
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,500
Police said apparently PR's bad.

824
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,520
On Wall Street, the 10262.

825
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,440
Republican Congressman Tom DeLay showed up on Florida's Interstate 75

826
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,140
for the first time since a hearing on DeLay's request

827
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,380
for a new execution-style conspiracy.

828
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,660
Tom reports.

829
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,440
370,000 residents are bending palm trees and knocking out PR News.

830
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,180
For PR News, I'm Tom.

831
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,280
Syrian officials are absurd.

832
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,320
Officials died yesterday from what officials are calling indirect PR News.

833
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,260
Also, here's some interesting news from this past week.

834
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:33,860
Chimpanzees. Also, you sometimes see people with their pet chimpanzee.

835
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,720
That was not my chimpanzee. That was my son, all right?

836
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,580
So he's got a slight body hair problem? Jeez, come on.

837
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,680
Give him a break.

838
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,920
Interesting. Here's an interesting news item from this week.

839
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,360
A state bill proposes Christianity be Missouri's official religion.

840
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,060
This is something from...

841
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,900
Well, it's nice that they have an official religion.

842
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,460
I didn't know that states had such things.

843
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,480
Yeah, I believe this was originally taken from a KMOV.

844
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,400
I don't know if that's a radio or television station, but anyway...

845
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,160
It sounds more like it was taken from The Onion.

846
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,160
No, for real. Okay, here's the story. I'll read it for you.

847
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,640
Missouri legislators in Jefferson City considered a bill

848
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,860
that would name Christianity...

849
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,580
the state's official, quote-unquote, majority religion.

850
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,600
Many Missouri residents had not heard about the bill until Thursday.

851
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,920
Karen Eroesti of the Anti-Defamation League,

852
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,240
along with other watch groups, began a letter-writing and email campaign

853
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,120
to stop the resolution.

854
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,720
The resolution would recognize, quote,

855
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,240
a Christian god, end quote,

856
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,140
and it would not protect minority religions, but, quote,

857
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,560
protect the majority's right to express their religious beliefs, end quote.

858
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,040
The resolution also recognizes that, quote,

859
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,860
a greater power exists, end quote,

860
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,920
and only Christianity receives what the resolution calls, quote,

861
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,060
justified recognition, end quote.

862
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:53,400
State Representative David Sater of Cassville in southwestern Missouri

863
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,280
sponsored the resolution,

864
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,640
but he has refused to talk about it on camera over the phone.

865
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,060
Antoine Assange, also the...

866
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,300
I wonder if I could get Church of the Subgenius

867
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,640
declared the official street religion of the street that I live on.

868
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,220
You know what...

869
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,840
Because my neighbors are all...

870
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,540
Every religion you can think of.

871
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,920
If I could get...

872
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,460
There might only be one or two Christians or one or two Jews

873
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,140
and one or two Buddhists on this block.

874
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,280
But that was back in...

875
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,300
And I know there's at least four subgeniuses.

876
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,960
In the People's Republic of China,

877
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,980
the People's Republic of Cleveland Heights,

878
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,140
almost anything can happen.

879
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,720
Yeah, we would outlaw, in fact,

880
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,840
all the other religions on this block.

881
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,020
At least...

882
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,420
Well, I guess we wouldn't outlaw them.

883
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,400
We would just make it so they couldn't complain

884
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,820
no matter what...

885
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:43,680
We did.

886
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,440
Which is what those Missouri...

887
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,760
That Missouri politician wants, is that...

888
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,540
Well, we're not going to tell you

889
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,480
you can't worship your burning man or whatever.

890
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,880
You just can't stop us from putting you in jail

891
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,680
as part of our religious freedom.

892
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,320
Since we're the majority,

893
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,260
you know, we can put your Satanists in jail.

894
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,420
And that way you can't interfere with our freedom of religion

895
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,920
by being seen.

896
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,360
See, could they put us in jail if we had X Day in Missouri?

897
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:11,640
Missouri?

898
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,520
Not yet.

899
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,780
Not yet, thank God.

900
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,100
No.

901
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:15,660
But...

902
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,300
So, uh...

903
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:16,800
But you're...

904
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,740
Actually, maybe they wouldn't be able to do that to you in Missouri,

905
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,220
but here's another place where it might happen.

906
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:21,820
Here's a...

907
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,040
New Florida town would restrict abortion.

908
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:24,780
Here's a...

909
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:25,540
Oh, yeah, that...

910
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,280
Domino's founder...

911
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,540
Domino's pizza guy.

912
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,460
...is building a community around a Catholic university.

913
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:35,460
If Domino's pizza founder Thomas S. Monaghan has his way,

914
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,080
a new town being built in Florida

915
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,660
will be governed according to strict Roman Catholic principles

916
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,220
with no place to get an abortion,

917
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,580
pornography, or birth control.

918
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:43,740
Pepperoniville.

919
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,280
Actually, it would be called Ave Maria, Florida.

920
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,060
Oh.

921
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,560
The pizza magnate is bankrolling the project

922
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,980
with at least $250 million

923
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,260
and calls it God's will.

924
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,200
Civil libertarians say the plan is unconstitutional

925
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,420
and are threatening to sue.

926
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,860
The town of Ave Maria is being constructed

927
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,140
around Ave Maria University,

928
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,560
the first Catholic university to be built

929
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,620
in the United States in about 40 years.

930
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,560
Both are set to open next year

931
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,120
about 25 miles east of Naples

932
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,340
in southwestern New York.

933
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,140
The town and the university developed in partnership

934
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,380
with the Barron Collier Company,

935
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,040
an agricultural and real estate business,

936
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,000
will be set on 5,000 acres

937
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,660
with a European-inspired town center,

938
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,880
a massive church,

939
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,160
and what planners call

940
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,960
the largest crucifix in the nation

941
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,080
at nearly 65 feet tall.

942
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:28,820
All right.

943
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,920
Now, you see, we have to outdo them.

944
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,720
We need a 65-foot-1-inch Dobbs head.

945
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,280
Yeah.

946
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,160
Or it might be just a gigantic pipe.

947
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,100
Yeah.

948
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:40,860
So this is...

949
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,400
This is inspiring me, though.

950
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:46,280
If some rich guy wants to buy his own city,

951
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,540
I think that that's...

952
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,420
There's nothing wrong with that.

953
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,440
Yeah, I say let him.

954
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,440
Because you know what, Bill?

955
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,680
We want to buy our...

956
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,360
Yeah, but that guy's got lots of money,

957
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,800
so he can really make...

958
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,820
Anyway, let's try and restrict our...

959
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,360
Well, it's not just him.

960
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,340
It's other people who are interested in this.

961
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,220
But anyway...

962
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,300
This is interesting.

963
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,100
If he gets away with this,

964
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,580
I'm going to make it my life's mission

965
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:19,180
to establish a community of my own somewhere.

966
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,080
Right, that's the idea.

967
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,520
Governed according to my own personal totalitarian ideas.

968
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,700
All you have to do is start your own pizza chain

969
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,300
that's fabulously successful,

970
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,000
or something like that.

971
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,600
Pizza sucks, too.

972
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,240
But anyway...

973
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,180
Why not build a town...

974
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,100
I would have one where we'd be against a lot of have churches.

975
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,040
How about that, you know?

976
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,580
Here's the only way...

977
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,500
Here's the only way...

978
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:40,620
Here's the only way...

979
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:40,660
Here's the only way...

980
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:40,700
Here's the only way...

981
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:40,840
Here's the only way...

982
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:40,840


983
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:40,840


984
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:40,840


985
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:40,840


986
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:40,840


987
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,140
Here's the only way...

988
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,840
If you own all the land in an area,

989
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,680
like maybe if you owned 5,000 acres

990
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,500
and wanted to build a city there,

991
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:48,400
you know,

992
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,140
and since it's all technically your property

993
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,460
and everybody else is just renting it,

994
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,040
you know, I suppose you could exercise your right

995
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,680
to say who does what on your property.

996
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,680
Yeah, it's private property.

997
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:58,900
But, you know,

998
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,440
I don't know if you can really incorporate that

999
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,720
as a municipality.

1000
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,600
In private property,

1001
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,860
you're not allowed to grow marijuana, for instance.

1002
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,620
So there's limits to what you can do.

1003
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,760
Ah, but you can stop anybody from...

1004
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,120
There was an Indian gentleman that tried that years ago

1005
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,680
and his neighbors put a stop to it.

1006
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,440
Oh, uh...

1007
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,480
You know, we live in a socialist police state.

1008
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,240
If you don't give money to the government

1009
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,560
on a regular basis,

1010
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:27,660
they'll put you in jail.

1011
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,000
It's as simple as that.

1012
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,480
You know, this whole town of Ave Maria,

1013
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,700
it's just going to be like a little Peyton place.

1014
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,920
They're still going to have their little affairs.

1015
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,740
There's still going to be little secret goings-on.

1016
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,580
There's still going to be people living in Ave Maria

1017
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,300
who otherwise think,

1018
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,120
hey, this is a great place to live

1019
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,920
and are otherwise doing their own little sinful thing.

1020
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:48,780
Well, damn straight,

1021
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,580
it'll be the same way in Dobbsville.

1022
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,160
I'm sure, you know,

1023
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,940
there'll be subgeniuses that sneak around

1024
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,820
and do all kinds of pink stuff, you know,

1025
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:59,360
secretly listening to Paul McCartney records

1026
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,240
and Neil Diamond.

1027
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:03,480
Secretly.

1028
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,760
Well, not secretly.

1029
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,680
Out in the open.

1030
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,560
That's the whole point of Dodgestown, isn't it?

1031
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,360
Well, no.

1032
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,780
I mean, see, they'd be doing these...

1033
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,340
They'd be...

1034
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,340
They'd have to sneak around

1035
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,200
because they'd be doing normal things.

1036
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,500
We have our own type of nonconformist,

1037
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,800
conformist fascism.

1038
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,800
It's kind of difficult to administrate

1039
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,760
something like that.

1040
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,740
Uh-oh, we lost...

1041
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,580
That's okay.

1042
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,920
We've got room for more.

1043
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,540
You know, that's the...

1044
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,800
We have freedom of tyranny in this country

1045
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,840
and we must preserve this freedom

1046
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,740
to have tyranny over others

1047
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,900
or else, you know,

1048
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,160
what else is it all for?

1049
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,060
I don't know.

1050
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:20,440
I don't know.

1051
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,240
Actually, my parting words to you

1052
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,160
would be to just carry on.

1053
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,440
Keep on keeping on.

1054
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,940
You guys are doing a great job

1055
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,400
and I have a big question, actually,

1056
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,820
to ask you that's really important.

1057
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,880
Reverend Stang would like to know

1058
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,440
if he can use any of this

1059
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,720
on his hour of slack.

1060
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,360
Oh, my God!

1061
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,000
Oh, my God!

1062
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:01,640
Oh, my God!

1063
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,360
Oh, my God!

1064
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,040
Oh, my God!

1065
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:03,760
Oh, my God!

1066
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:04,420
Okay.

1067
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,380
All right.

1068
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,660
Yeah, that'd be cool.

1069
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,200
God damn it, Frankie!

1070
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,840
How many times in this feminist kitchen

1071
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,400
have I told you when it comes to business

1072
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,400
you don't make the unilateral call?

1073
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,500
You don't have the cojones!

1074
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,660
You don't have the business!

1075
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,820
Okay, okay.

1076
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,420
Don't hit me again.

1077
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,300
Oh, my God.

1078
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,440
I'm sorry.

1079
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,600
You'd rather on to bolster yourself up like this.

1080
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,060
I'll make you some taloupe.

1081
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,440
I'll make anything you want, baby.

1082
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:37,580
All right, all right.

1083
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,340
All right, I'll bend over.

1084
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,220
All right, I'll bend over.

1085
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:39,900
We'll honor you,

1086
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,500
you devil's bargain with Stang.

1087
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:43,840
Stang!

1088
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,340
Why don't you just keep talking about Stang all night long?

1089
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,880
In those intimate times.

1090
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,860
But I'm going to need some of that church air.

1091
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,680
That'd be great.

1092
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,040
Has he actually been listening?

1093
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,240
Is he in the room with you?

1094
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,940
He's been listening.

1095
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:04,780
He's probably my biggest fan, so yes, he's been listening.

1096
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,600
I've been preparing our stir-fried fennel

1097
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,380
with roasted pistachios.

1098
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:10,260
Okay.

1099
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:10,480
I've been preparing it for him tonight.

1100
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,180
Oh, my God.

1101
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:16,160
And he's been just listening along and loving every minute of it.

1102
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,980
He's just so glowingly proud of me and of you guys

1103
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:25,280
for being so bright to pick up on me.

1104
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,880
He's actually extremely impressed with you.

1105
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,640
Well, duh.

1106
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:37,300
I mean, you're like a hot babe.

1107
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,560
Well, thank you.

1108
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:39,020
Yeah.

1109
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,340
I like your singing voice.

1110
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:41,900
I like...

1111
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:42,580
You know what?

1112
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:42,840
You know what?

1113
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:43,860
Be quiet.

1114
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:44,340
Be quiet.

1115
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,020
Princess, princess.

1116
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,080
Tell him.

1117
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:47,580
Tell him.

1118
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,900
I think we should get an apartment together.

1119
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,160
I really do.

1120
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:50,760
God damn it!

1121
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,800
I think you and I, I think we're soulmates.

1122
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,880
I think this could work out.

1123
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,140
Keep it in your pants, Frankie!

1124
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:03,460
I'm sorry.

1125
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,940
Would Stang care to give his apologies to you over here?

1126
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:06,680
I really...

1127
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:07,880
I'm very, very flattered,

1128
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,240
but I'm totally sold on Reverend Stang.

1129
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,960
Our hearts are entwined forever.

1130
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,140
How many dicks does he have?

1131
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:16,800
How many dicks?

1132
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,180
I'm not privy to tell you.

1133
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:18,300
37?

1134
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:18,300


1135
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,940
That's private, just between us.

1136
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:20,980
It's 37, isn't it?

1137
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,300
37.

1138
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,260
I can't tell.

1139
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,100
It's 37.

1140
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,280
You can't tell because they're too small to count?

1141
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,700
No, they're not small.

1142
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,740
Where does he keep them?

1143
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,180
In a box?

1144
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,000
No, they're connected.

1145
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:36,740
God.

1146
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,260
He's just got a huge package down there.

1147
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,640
He's got a huge package down there.

1148
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:41,400
He's got a huge package down there.

1149
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:41,400


1150
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:41,400


1151
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:41,400


1152
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,480
Okay, well, I think if we're going to start talking about what's-his-face,

1153
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,900
then this interview has come to an end.

1154
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:49,100
Very, very sweet one.

1155
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,420
Leave some soul for me, Amos.

1156
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,120
Okay, here we go.

1157
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,880
All right, and thank you very much.

1158
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,120
Oh, it's really, really been my pleasure.

1159
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,080
You guys are a blast.

1160
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,800
I want you to sing more songs,

1161
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,980
and I want you to be my lover and wife,

1162
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,260
but if you can't do that,

1163
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,240
I would really, really love to see you again.

1164
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:10,240


1165
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,280
I would really like you to be more present

1166
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,420
in the Church of the Subdivis,

1167
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,540
and I'll buy more books.

1168
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,320
Okay.

1169
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:18,380
Okay.

1170
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:18,960
Cool.

1171
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:19,540
Okay.

1172
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:20,660
Okay.

1173
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:23,600
That's it.

1174
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,140
I'm ending this.

1175
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,580
She's gone.

1176
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:31,660
He hung up on her.

1177
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,720
Amos, you never let me have any fun.

1178
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:35,660
Come on.

1179
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,560
Let's get back in the kitchen.

1180
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:38,460
All right.

1181
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:51,340
I have such a rush from that.

1182
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,000
That was incredible.

1183
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:54,000
Talking with Princess We Are Doe,

1184
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,480
queen of all the UFOs,

1185
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,140
the real power behind,

1186
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,840
the power behind the pipe,

1187
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,000
and we hate men here at the Sonus Kitchen.

1188
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,000
Um.

1189
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,580
I would never marry one of them.

1190
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,000
I'd rest a virgin.

1191
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:10,660
Rather.

1192
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,740
For husbands are a boring lot

1193
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,660
and only give you bother.

1194
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,180
Of course, I'm awfully glad

1195
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,840
that mother had to marry father.

1196
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:25,820
But I hate men.

1197
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,160
Oh, by the way,

1198
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,760
are either of your kids subgeniuses?

1199
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,480
My kids?

1200
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,100
Oh, they were born subgenius.

1201
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:34,900
They had no choice.

1202
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:36,880
I beat the slack into them.

1203
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,340
They still win,

1204
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,560
I guess, a little bit when I see a picture of Bob or anything.

1205
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,900
Well, I think Judge Punch didn't get involved.

1206
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:45,720
Good thing Judge Punch didn't get involved.

1207
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:50,480
Yeah, Judge Judy and Judge Punch got together and had this,

1208
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,360
they worked their frustrations out.

1209
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,140
That story was specially written by Bob Dutz,

1210
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,780
with music composed and conducted

1211
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,000
by Bob Dutz

1212
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,260
featured in the cast were Bob Dutz is Kitty.

1213
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:10,580
Bum.

1214
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:12,500
Bum.

1215
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:14,740
Bum.

1216
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:15,880
Bullshit!

1217
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,680
Where are these creatures?

1218
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,120
Why has no one ever seen one?

1219
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,620
Yeti, him hide.

1220
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,600
When smell human.

1221
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,580
But yeti come low country when want to steal woman.

1222
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,380
Or with want to steal woman.

1223
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,540
Someday there is hope.

1224
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,460
In fact, um...

1225
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:44,020
As we await the calling of the day.

1226
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,360
Call of the day.

1227
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,120
We can go back over.

1228
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:52,060
I think we have to go through a phone call here.

1229
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:58,760
But then we will see a song.

1230
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,680
A song of hope.

1231
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,040
We'll see it in here.

1232
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,400
Sirius Crossroads.

1233
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,200
Eddie speaking.

1234
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,540
Eddie, Samuel Curtis.

1235
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,760
I just landed.

1236
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,540
I know.

1237
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:08,800
We saw.

1238
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,260
It was great.

1239
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,860
Can you dig me out and set me up for a flight?

1240
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:13,760
Sure.

1241
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,300
Could you bring the cat?

1242
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,120
Yeah, I got him.

1243
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,660
His name is Monkey Puss.

1244
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,600
I want to name him Oscar.

1245
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,800
That wasn't so bad, was it, Monkey?

1246
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,000
Eddie, you got something for me, right?

1247
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,400
Oh, yeah.

1248
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,000
Okay.

1249
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,620
I'll be in in a bit.

1250
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:31,840
Okay, goodbye.

1251
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:32,760
Bye.

1252
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,740

1253
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,040
