1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Bob, Bob, love you.

2
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,240
Bob, Bob, love you.

3
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,720
Bob, Bob, love you.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,720
Light your prop eyes up and test it back.

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,240
Well, welcome to the hour of slack.

6
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,320
Praise Bob, Bob, and Connie's rack.

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,980
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,960
All bow before the great metal lord.

9
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,000
Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless tragic voyage.

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,760
We're all here tonight to praise Bob.

11
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:20,960
He's kind of shown us that Devo works in parallel ways with other pockets of humans on this planet.

12
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:29,980
Where we thought we were alone, we know there are now other human forms that believe in God.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,540
And we know that Bob is a conscious mutation.

14
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,240
As he knows, Bob is merely an enema for a constipated society.

15
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,400
These people here are here to help a constipated society blow it out their ass.

16
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,160
Have you ever met Bob?

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,980
Well, like I said, Bob would appear in my bedroom and chase me around, making me do jumping jacks.

18
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,540
He's got food.

19
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,160
I know what you do.

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,600
Cause I do it too.

21
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,620
Intelligence.

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,880
No, no, no, no, no, no.

23
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,780
Intelligence.

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,680
No, no, no, no, no, no.

25
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,840
Am I as smart as I think?

26
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,220
Probably not.

27
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,080
That's good.

28
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,120
Daily disease cannot feel pain.

29
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,980
Daily disease cannot feel pain.

30
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:56,220
He said that just because I make a speech, that's because I have money.

31
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,220


32
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,220


33
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,320
I'm glass..

34
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,320


35
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,820
Well, you were right.

36
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,020
It's the best I have ever heard.

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,300
I can see that through words.

38
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,300


39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,420
held on August 10th in Cleveland.

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:10,620
The third annual one organized by several old subgeniuses and fellow Devo fans.

41
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:17,120
Reverend Toth Wilder, Reverend Scott Orsi, the good Blinker Boy at AOL.com,

42
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,640
and help from Steve Sinek.

43
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,320
Friends, it's just been great.

44
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,900
Because I love the Devos.

45
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,780
We have a lot in common, the church and the Devos.

46
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,240
We're both owned by Bob.

47
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,300
We were both controlled by Bob completely for quite a long time.

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,400
And we both share a philosophy.

49
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,900
We don't always have the same kind of music, but sometimes we do.

50
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,240
We always have the philosophy.

51
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,280
A special philosophy, a little different, depending on which cult you're talking about.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,200
But it is a philosophy for the different.

53
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,960
You know, in pamphlet number one...

54
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,780
What the hell?

55
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,180
There's Herb Alpert here in the background.

56
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:15,680
Friends, did you know that Herb Alpert was the guy who signed Devo to their very first big-time record deal?

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,760
Anyway, friends, the Church of the Subgenius has called itself the Spaz Church of Macho Irony.

58
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,880
And it's a church of macho irony.

59
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,200
And as I enjoyed the various cover bands covering Devo,

60
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:37,000
and the new and old and rare Devo materials that were dredged up for each of these conventions,

61
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:44,100
I got to thinking and pondering about the spazfulness of the great spaz bands.

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,340
And the ones I was thinking of primarily are ones from the 80s.

63
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,480
Elvis Costello, who I actually used to sort of resemble back in the day.

64
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,640
And Talking Heads.

65
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,440
I never was that into Talking Heads.

66
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,720
But they were a great spaz band, I suppose.

67
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,300
And David Byrne is a deuce-paying subgenius twice over, just as are several members of Devo.

68
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,860
Ah, friends.

69
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,600
But, you know, some people...

70
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,960
And of course, there's spaz bands today.

71
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,100
And we'll be playing a lot of that.

72
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:25,720
But, you know, some might say that the spaz, the spaziness and spazitude,

73
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,640
of the weirdos shows no dignity.

74
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,580
That it is somehow silly and unmanly.

75
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,380
But, nay, my friends, nay!

76
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,140
I say the ability to spaz is our treasure.

77
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,080
And the inability to spaz is the curse of the blockhead and the pink.

78
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,080
Because think, is not the sexual orgasm coming?

79
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,580
The ultimate?

80
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,380
Spaz attack?

81
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,440
The spaz of sex, friends.

82
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,440
The spaz of letting your own mutant abnormality out.

83
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,240
Do you really care what the others think?

84
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,360
Well, sure you do.

85
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,720
But, why let on?

86
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:23,680
Friends, as Bob Dobbs said very recently to his young ward, Dr. Onan Canabite,

87
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,480
Bob said,

88
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:34,120
I'd rather have the right people laughing at me than have the wrong people laughing with me.

89
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,460
I'd rather have the right people laughing at me than have the wrong people laughing with me.

90
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,620
Friends, you think about that as you spaz out in this, uh...

91
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,620
Friends, you just wait. You just wait.

92
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,000
You just wait.

93
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,520
Is there anything religion can do to help me?

94
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,180
Find my friend?

95
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,020
Well, we could join together in prayer.

96
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,780
Uh-huh. But is there anything useful we can do?

97
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,800
No.

98
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,440
Oh, man.

99
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,920
Whoa.

100
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,480
We can't just efic spiritedly fight before the Εfos out of the way.

101
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,480


102
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,480


103
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,480


104
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,480


105
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,480


106
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,480


107
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,160
Whose turn is it?

108
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,380
Well, of course, mine.

109
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,500
I'm ready to see what I've got.

110
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,460
Now, while the runner goes to work

111
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,500
You've got both hands

112
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,500
You've got both hands

113
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,320
You've got beret in hands

114
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,740
You've got beret in hands

115
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,360
Take me for no man

116
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,400
Take me for no man

117
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,540
Okay, relax

118
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,140
And assume the position

119
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,320
Going to dog is a mission

120
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,020
One, two, and three, time to date

121
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,560
Always do what your mama don't say

122
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,000
Run some teeth with the follow way

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,560
One, two, and three, time to date

124
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,220
You've got both hands

125
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,860
You've got beret in hands

126
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,120
You've got beret in hands

127
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,640
You've got both right hand

128
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,880
You've got both left hand

129
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,860
You've got both right hand

130
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,680
While the left hand is left

131
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,520
While the runner goes to work

132
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,060
I said the left hand is in the hole

133
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,520
While the runner goes to work

134
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,500
You've got both hands

135
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,540
You've got both hands

136
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,280
You've got beret in hands

137
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,120
You've got beret in hands

138
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,500
We got beret and hat and

139
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,420
Play great ball, no man

140
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,580
Play great ball, no man

141
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,220
Play great ball, no man

142
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,520
Okay, relax

143
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
And assume the position

144
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,180
Going to dog is a mission

145
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,880
Watch your head, do you touch the thing

146
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,380
Always do what your mama let's say

147
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,760
Bust the teeth with the ball away

148
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,340
Watch your head, do you touch the thing

149
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,920
Watch your head, do you touch the thing

150
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,400
Always do what your mama let's say

151
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,800
Bust the teeth with the ball away

152
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,400
Watch your head, do you touch the thing

153
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,500
A lovely, lovely rendition of Devo's Praying Hands

154
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,760
Performed by Occupant

155
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,580
Who has covered a number of Devo songs

156
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,120
Which we'll hear this hour

157
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,280
Just

158
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,320
Just

159
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,500
Just absolutely

160
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,440
Just absolutely amazingly

161
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,480
Occupant

162
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,060

And now

171
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,320
Through subversive measures

172
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,380
Devo passes on the word of Bob

173
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,220
By uh

174
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,960
By uh we

175
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,540
By uh we

176
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,000
If you take a look at our last album cover

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,180
If you take a look at our last album cover

178
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,740
His name's been airbrushed

179
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,380
Into the rubber hairlines

180
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,320
Of each of the band members

181
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,060
Right next to the word sex

182
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,900
Do Bob and sex go hand in hand?

183
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,320
Well Bob is a kind of total all-consuming sex

184
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,060
We're like explosions

185
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,140
That leave you feeling good

186
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,540
We're like IBM

187
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,140
We're like IBM

188
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,440
We play it slow

189
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,260
Up above

190
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,860
Nothing has to stop and go

191
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,120
There's nothing but the up and go

192
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,400
There's nothing like some men and dough

193
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,680
There's nothing more than what you know

194
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,920
Yes

195
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,400
I guess the only slack that I get any more

196
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,700
Is worshiping at the holy temple of the yoni

197
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,260
Tell us about that

198
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,640
What's that?

199
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,420
Uh huh

200
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,560
Don't come to church

201
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,800
I'm sure your audience knows what the holy temple of the yoni is.

202
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,840
Can you tell us?

203
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,880
It's the female delta.

204
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,620
Female delta?

205
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,500
And that's where you are sitting?

206
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,160
It's penis fuck pussy.

207
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh.

208
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,060
Pussy surround penis.

209
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,520
Oh, I see.

210
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,760
Mark Mothersbaugh on Bob.

211
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,960
Oh, I see.

212
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,500
The planet has been suppressed, but now it can be told.

213
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,300
Every man, woman, and mutant on this planet shall know the truth about de-evolution.

214
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,380
P THE Miranda

215
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:27,520
Pika boo!

216
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,600
Pika boo!

217
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,640
Promo

218
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,080
Thank you.

219
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,560
Thank you.

220
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,060
Thank you.

221
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,680
Thank you.

222
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,620
Thank you.

223
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,740
Thank you.

224
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,880
A Bruiser Mix

225
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,560
by

226
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,540
Bruiser

227
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:18,840
Bruiser

228
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,480
Whoever that is.

229
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,660
It came with the

230
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,920
devotional

231
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,780
special memorial CD.

232
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,060
It came with the

233
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,140
devotional special memorial CD.

234
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,140


235
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,520
devotional special memorial CD.

236
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:30,840
but you know

237
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,240
I don't look forward

238
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,540
to going back

239
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:38,720
to the

240
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,620
thy platypus

241
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:42,620


242
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,960
Just talk about

243
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,000
the de-evolutionization

244
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,200
of man and stuff man.

245
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,640
The other week I was over at my Aunt May Biel's house.

246
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,620
Me and my cousin Bubba were talking about third world politics and the effect on the micro farm workers of the southern United States.

247
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,220
And all of a sudden it hit me.

248
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,860
Mark Mother's ball was right.

249
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,080
Man was devolving.

250
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,740
And turning back into the most simple of primates.

251
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,180
This would explain daytime TV.

252
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,080
Jerry Springer being so popular.

253
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,100
Why the hell were you not on a fucking record label?

254
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,680
But right when I was about to tell Bubba about this.

255
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,180
He turned on Jerry Springer.

256
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,060
And as I watched that 13 year old.

257
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,680
prostitute straddle the Pope.

258
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,260
I couldn't think anything but.

259
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,540
What a damn fine country we are.

260
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,860
God bless fucking America.

261
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,720
Devolutionization.

262
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,440
By a group called the Cryogenic Strawberries.

263
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,260
An unusual group.

264
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,280
I think they're on mp3.com too.

265
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,160
Or somewhere out there.

266
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,860
Do a little search.

267
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,240
Cryogenic Strawberries.

268
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,120
And now...

269
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,460
Occupant.

270
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,920
Today, what does it take to do the super thing?

271
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,400
I'll tell you what it takes, a very simple thing

272
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,800
Iron nerves, like the pilot of a jumbo jet

273
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:12,360
Or a girl, on the go who hasn't got there yet

274
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,900
Magnetic trumpets blowing, synthetic saxophones

275
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,300
The evidence kept growing from below

276
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,380
Hidden motivations, buried in the past

277
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,540
Still give us strength for the super thing

278
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,240
The Red Alarm

279
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,960
A rude surprise every time it rings

280
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,460
It means it's time to go beyond the normal thing

281
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:58,080
Pay attention and be prepared to do it right

282
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,720
The super thing, the thing that makes you bigger than life

283
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,360
Magnetic trumpets blowing, synthetic saxophones

284
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,320
The evidence kept growing from below

285
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:24,480
Hidden motivations, buried in the past

286
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,700
Still give us strength

287
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,540
Iron nerves, like the pilot of a jumbo jet

288
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,060
Iron nerves, like the pilot of a jumbo jet

289
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,380
Magnetic trumpets blowing, synthetic saxophones

290
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:52,380


291
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:52,380


292
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,080
Still give us strength for the super thing

293
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,300
Iron nerves, like the pilot of a jumbo jet

294
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,360
Magnetic trumpets blowing, synthetic saxophones

295
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,340
The evidence kept growing from below

296
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,160
Hidden motivations, buried in the past

297
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,380
Still give us strength for the super thing

298
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:26,860
The realument of the super thing

299
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:26,860


300
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:33,340
Ready starts tomorrow

301
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,400
Here's us, the delinquent

302
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,360
Good luck その地くそ俺たちが

303
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,020
Pleasure pain

304
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,180
Sensations unfamiliar

305
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,660
Can make you sick

306
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,400
It's a superhuman thing

307
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,080
And it does the trick

308
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,220
Magnetic drops are flowing

309
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,240
Synthetic saxophone

310
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,320
The evidence kept growing

311
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,080
From below

312
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,620
In motivation

313
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:15,000
Buried in the past

314
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,300
Still give us strength

315
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,860
Super, super thing

316
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,960
The super, super thing

317
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,200
The super, super thing

318
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,920
The super, super thing

319
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,420
The super, super thing

320
00:24:46,300 --> 00:25:07,060
The super, super thing

321
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,040
The super, super thing

322
00:25:37,060 --> 00:26:07,040
The super, super thing

323
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,260
The super, super thing

324
00:26:37,840 --> 00:27:01,700
The super, super thing

325
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:37,040
The super, super thing

326
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:05,800
The super, super thing

327
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,100
That get my bottom

328
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,240
That get my bottom

329
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:17,760
That get my bottom

330
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,100
That get my bottom

331
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,100


332
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,100


333
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,520
People gonna think you're a spy

334
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,260
People gonna think you're a spy

335
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:44,340
Whales by the Elastic Band, a classic song of great spazitude.

336
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:53,840
And before that, some ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland, Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

337
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,260
talking about the feast of spazism.

338
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,140
Speaking of which, upcoming are some amazing, well, here's an example.

339
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:09,500
It's not a Devo song, although Little Theodore later on in the show will cover through being cool.

340
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,040
Here's Little Theodore with I Don't Care.

341
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:29,460
I don't care about the economy. It has no effect on me.

342
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,760
Well, I need to be happy.

343
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,320
There's a woman, a screw, and a place to pee.

344
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,360
I don't care about the government.

345
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,160
I think it's about time it went.

346
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,380
Nasty politicians I resent.

347
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,100
Just like me, they're all hell-bent.

348
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,580
I don't want to hear about big stars.

349
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,780
They should all be behind bars.

350
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,240
Maybe we can ship them off to Mars.

351
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,120
Or take off their clothes and expose them.

352
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,120


353
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:07,040
I don't want no more of the press.

354
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,180
They're responsible for our mess.

355
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,960
If we knew what was best, we'd live our own lives and skip the rest.

356
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,500
Ha ha ha.

357
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,240
Ha ha ha.

358
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,520
Ha ha ha.

359
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,680
Ha ha ha.

Ha ha ha.

361

Ha ha ha.

362
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,160
Ha ha ha.

363
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,920
Ha ha ha.

364
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,740
Ha ha ha.

365
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,420
Ha ha ha.

366
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,640
Ha ha ha.

Mongoloid, Mongoloid.

389
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:16,060
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid, happier than you and me.

390
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,080
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid, one from a song too many.

391
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,080
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid and his friends were unaware.

392
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,080
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid and nobody even cared.

393
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:47,580
And he wore a hat and he had a job and he brought home the bacon so that nobody knew.

394

Left home with a friend of mine, gone two years and I don't know why.

00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:46,620
Now I'm happy all the time, I can't think, I'm feeling fine.

403
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,820

and they

488
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,920
on their CD, I found this

489
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,720
piece

00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,640
we watched our tails

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,080
We've only got

00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,260
a little sense

496
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,420
I said

497
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:06,920
it's all

498
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,640
just wind and sails

499
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,200
Are we not men?

500
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,000
We are demons

We are demons

506
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,320
We're pizza

507
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,420

Teachers and critics

00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,600
Are fans of the law

523
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,120
Are we not men?

524
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,040
We are even

525
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,200

We are even

533
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,300
I say it's all just wind and sand

534
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,960
Wooden hands all just go on

535
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:06,400
Pictures and dreams are fits of love

536
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,200
Are we not men?

537
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,980

Are we not men?

541
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,040


542
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,100
We are even

543
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,580
Are we not men?

544
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:26,580


545
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,140
We are even

546
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,900
Are we not men?

547
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:29,900


548
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:29,900


549
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,300
But let's leave things of this world behind

550
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:40,420
And walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius

551
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,260
And we find then the family falling apart

552
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,720
And we find then the family falling apart

553
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,360
Oh, they wail and gnash their teeth, our rival churches do,

554
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,120
about how the children are getting exposed to too much this and too much that.

555
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,700
What they ain't being exposed to is a little bit of mom and dad.

556
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,040
Forget the pornography, I don't care.

557
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,920
It makes me mad, my friend, the hypocrisy.

558
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,840
Now, I have nothing against hypocrisy.

559
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,840
Every religion must have its fair share of hypocrisy.

560
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,520
As Bob Dobbs once said, I don't practice what I preach

561
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,440
because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

562
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,980
But that preacher can get up there on TV and oh, he's so glad to keep you normal,

563
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,080
keep you working so hard you don't even know your own wifey anymore.

564
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:25,060
And your kids, you don't know your kids any better than your employees.

565
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,800
So, friend, let there be slack.

566
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:32,900
Salutations.

567
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:38,260
Today I feel a sense of urgency as I speak to you for Devo Incorporated.

568
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,780
There is a direct connection between Devo's work in the music field

569
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,420
and a message from my wife.

570
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,420
There is a big wiggly world around us.

571
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,020
You may not be aware of this, but we are in the middle of World War III.

572
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,380
It is not nuclear bombs that we must fear.

573
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,500
The weapon is the human mind or lack of it on this planet.

574
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,660
That will determine our fate.

575
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:04,460
Capital punishment for airline passengers who attempt to save money.

576
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,960
Spud men and gas lines who forgot that guns don't argue.

577
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,300
And tourists attempting to catch some rays at Three Mile Island.

578
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,660
Add up to a major attack of corkscrews in the brain.

579
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,640
We must fight back.

580
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,840
We must know what we want.

581
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,880
We must want what we need.

582
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,900
And what we need is duty now for the future.

583
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,260
You may not have eternal peace.

584
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,020
And między Medo-

585
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,020
D27

586
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,100
The 1500th networks,

587
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:52,100


588
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:56,120
Wild num-

589
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:56,600
b

590
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,220
Just stop.

591
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,060
Bye.

592
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,820
Bye.

593
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,460
We helped with the RU experience video.

594
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,380
And now, more Occupant.

595
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,200
See you next time.

596
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,400
Bye.

597
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,520
Bye.

598
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,240
Bye.

599
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,560
Bye.

600
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,380
Bye.

601
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:45,420
Bye.

602
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,500
Bye.

603
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,680
Bye.

604
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,080
Bye.

605
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,200
Bye.

606
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,740
Bye.

607
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,100
Bye.

608
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,220
Bye.

609
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,520
Bye.

610
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,620
Bye.

611
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,880
Bye.

612
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:45,420
Bye.

613
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,100
Bye.

614
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,100
Bye.

615
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,080
Bye.

616
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,420
Bye.

617
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,400
Bye.

618
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,700
Bye.

619
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,820
Bye.

620
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,520
Bye.

621
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,900
Bye.

622
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,420
Bye.

623
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,420
Bye, bye.

624
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,400
Bye.

625
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,120
Bender!

626
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,440
It's a miracle!

627
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,380
Ah!

628
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:32,240
This is by a wide margin the least likely thing that has ever happened.
