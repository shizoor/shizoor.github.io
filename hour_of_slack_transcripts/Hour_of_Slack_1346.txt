Welcome to the subgenius
with no power
of slap
of slap
I better try and break it
These things can do nasty things to the brain if the pitch gets up into ultrasonics
You like that?
No, sir
Just keep thinking about that
It's almost beyond human understanding
Some fantastic invisible force
converted two men into jelly
Human!
Look, Dan
Look at this
Look what it's done
The whole...
The whole...
Just your structure's eaten away
The bone's powder
So it takes care of my supper tonight
Bob
But let's leave things of this world behind
and walk now down the path of Bob
for this brief minute of slack
from the church of the subgenius
This is Reverend Ivan Stang
I'm 31 years old, friends
Not an old man, a young man
Not too many wrinkles on my face
But I tell you, friend
The wrinkles on my old head
come not from worrying
but from partying
There's two kinds of people
The kind that gets wrinkles from worrying
and the kind that get them from partying
Now, my gray hairs come from kicks
And I can dig it
I'm a hip cat
I can enjoy myself
And I believe that's what the Lord God thing, Wotan
put us on this planet to do
is to enjoy ourselves
We were created
Therefore, there must be a reason
Therefore, that reason must be
to have fun and get slack
This is the logic of Bob Dobbs, friend
And it is inescapable
So, you can't enjoy yourself
if you're a hateful pink boy
who thinks that hurting other people is enjoyable
So, slack for thyself
and slack for others, friends
are not interchangeable
but interconnected
And so we find that there was a consistency
in the word of Bob
that was not visible before
And of course, it cannot ever be visible
to one who does not have the blood
of the Himalayan Yeti
pulsing through their veins
Let there be slack
and there be no
any
any
any
any
any
any
any
any
any any donít
Just Motorola
Four Blendra

to one
cha
to properly
by the Queejibo
Cartel.
Friends, it was
like this.
Welcome
ladies and
gentlemen, brothers
and sisters, friends and
neighbors, local
hits and out of town rubes.
Welcome one and all
to the 2002
Indie Vival.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I am your host,
Pope Fred, and on behalf
of the Queejibo Cartel
and the good citizens of
Indianapolis, Indiana,
I thank you.
I thank you. I really
do. I mean,
it takes a great
and wonderful thing for each
and every one of you to tear
yourselves away from your
mundane lives, to
come out here to buy
expensive drinks
and listen to music that you could
have heard on VH1
or better yet, download
from the internet for
free.
Indeed,
we have stiff
competition from this very
city to take away
your entertainment
dollar. And
in the interest of fairness,
I will give you a bottle sample.
You have a chance
to see the Ray Romano.
Yes.
TV's Ray Romano
from Everybody Loves Raymond
on the 26th
at the Clothes Memorial
Hall for a night of comedy,
comedy, comedy.
This weekend is the last
chance that you'll get to see
Scooby-Doo Live!
Scooby-Doo
Live!
On stage at the Murat
Theater this weekend!
You came here.
Rock, roll, raggy, and deep.
SoundTribe
Sector 9 is playing right
now at the patio.
Really? Really.
He's gone.
We got your ten bucks. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
And lastly,
Indianapolis offers for your
entertainment pleasure
John Mayer at the Murat
Egyptian Room, who has
and I quote,
a solid singing
voice that captivates crowds
and an obvious passion for
creating earnest songs.
End quote.
Now you can't beat that.
No siree.
What chance, what chance
does our little dog
and pony show have
against such a veritable
cornucopia of sights,
sounds, and amazement?
None.
Were it not for the fact
that our dog can spout
hellfire rants
that'll curl your nostril hairs
and our pony has been
trained to do things that you can
only see on the internet
or bachelor parties.
Plus,
our kids have hearts.
They care
enough to bring this show
to you.
Care enough to bring
acts as far away from
Pittsburgh if we could.
And we did.
Saint Anne and Sister Helena
Handbasket will give you
more bang for your buck
than any solid singing
voice could muster.
1 Jest
I thought of all the genious
a book why
I thought of Arnold Palmer
and his bleeding head
4你知道
my time
and live
well
and that they'd share
BEWARE
I thought of that















I thought of all these things and wondered if I cared
I pondered for a while, I pondered through the night
By the next morning I decided they were right
We got rhyme selections in a white array
Chaine, y'all bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, chaine
Ring in the news cause I punch your in mind
Use a microphone like Shazam, use tight
The party people scream, ring, ring, sing, ring
Cause I got a remote for my beat down
Ring in the news cause I punch your in mind
Word
I felt so relieved, it really was a rush
I am so happy that I'm a subgenius
Tired of playing normal and following the herd
I woke the next day to go and spread the word
The people that I talked to, they acted all afraid
They won't even listen unless they're getting paid
I really do hate them, these people hate me
The things of which I speak
They point it and they laugh
They said I was a freak
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak
Tick tock, so socialize
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes
Who in the world do you want to fight?
It's against the system, we should unite
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight
Now I sit here thinking of everything I've said
I really am a Bobby
My face is turning red
I thought I was finished
I wondered what to do
Ready to give it up
I didn't have a clue
Then it all came to me
I really should have known
There are so many like me
I'm really not alone
I found others like me
With whom I could converse
One day the subgenius will rule this universe
Break, break, break, break, break, break
One day the subgenius will rule this universe
Break, break, break, break, break, break, break
One day the subgenius will rule this universe
Ladies and gentlemen
Introducing
The man who sort of started this whole thing
A man who is a close personal friend
I love the man
He's the cream of my coffee
The sugar in my tea
The added to my Castella
The one, the only, Ivan Stagg!
You sit down there and shut up! Because there's something I have not heard out of you maggots and pukes yet!
Have I heard a god damn praise bop?
Praise who? I don't think I've heard it very loud.
No!
Ah, it's starting to sound like music. Like with a beat, it could be like praise bop!
Praise bop! Praise bop! Praise god damn bop! Praise bop!
Okay, that's enough. I'm done.
What's wrong with you bunch of bobbies or what?
Jesus Christ, you bunch of religious bananas.
Um, friends, well I guess that'll do for this sacred moment of noise. I got y'all yelling a little bit.
Friends, welcome to the very first in all history Indianapolis D-Vival. Praise fucking bop!
The conspiracy tried to keep us away from this being I can state, but by god we did it anyway!
Now friends, I suppose...
...
...this may be the very first subgenius D-Vival for some of you.
And some have come around and heard this sort of comedy thing.
Some are going, well, I'm gonna go there and make sure they're as stupid as I've heard.
By god, just so I know once and for all.
And when you come to a subgenius D-Vival, sometimes you see these amazing displays of behavior.
Abhorrent, abnormal behavior.
And you go, what the hell does that have to do with anything?
It has to do with Bob!
Well, it doesn't necessarily have to do with...
...have a damn thing to do with Bob!
Because really, all Bob wants for you is SLACK!
Now listen, they get all excited about slack.
Look, how many of you can tell me what slack is, hmm?
Indefinable!
There's someone with the correct definition of slack.
It is absolutely indefinable.
Those who know don't say, and those who say don't know.
As the Hells Angels used to say.
Which makes me think I probably shouldn't be saying that myself anyway.
But, um, I will come up and give a longer sermon later.
But I wanted to pump the newcomers up with just enough to get you to, well, either come or get frustrated and come back one more later.
So I'm gonna give you a very quick capsule description of this beautiful institution known as the Church of the Subgenius.
Goddamn Jesus!
There are only three things you really need to know, and then you'll have it down.
Bob, slack, and...
...the conspiracy!
Boo!
That sounds like I hardly need to explain anything.
But, oh, and the one rule.
There is, you know, most religions rely on an incredible number of rules.
Damn, man, I'm so distracted. I'm trying to read his, uh, uh, death sign down there.
There's, um, so many religions and things offer you all these complicated sets of rules.
And we do too, but they're all understood to be complete bullshit.
Except for the one really serious fucking goddamn rule in the Church of the Subgenius.
That one simple, obvious rule is, of course,
FUCKING IF THEY CAN'T TAKE A JOKE!
And, you know, the...
The damn weird thing about it is,
there's every now and then you stumble upon something that sounds like hilarious bullshit in the Church of the Subgenius,
and yet somehow happens to be true.
Well, most of them aren't always true.
But FUCKING IF THEY CAN'T TAKE A JOKE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN LIVE BY!
And in fact, it is the only philosophy you can actually live by.
Now, to give you a capsule summation about this man, Bob,
whose face you've seen in clouds,
tattooed on hookers' butts,
and sometimes, some of you have it so embedded on the retinas of your eyes
that even when you blink and close your eyes,
you see that negative version of his hideous, grinning visage.
But I find it hideous because he's my boss, okay?
I know most of you like Bob. I do too.
But imagine, you know, having to...
I have no words for the guy!
Anyway, Bob Dobbs, back in 1953,
founded this Church of the Subgenius
when he discovered...
Well, actually, he didn't discover, but he was...
He had this sort of a vision, my friends.
He was trying to make his own amateur TV set,
and he stepped in a puddle of water,
and GOD HIMSELF grabbed Bob up
and yanked him up by the scruff of the neck
and told him that there was a conspiracy of normal people
who had been robbing away the slack of the weirdos and abnormals
since the dawn of time.
Well, this wasn't actually God saying this.
It was this alien space monster
that has managed to convince most people it dealt with
that it was God over the centuries.
So what's the difference?
And so, and also this creature,
this monster from outer space
who is worshipped as God and Jesus by many people,
was...
It told Bob that the world,
the world was going to end July 5th, 1998,
by which fact we know that obviously that date has not come.
The conspiracy is a lot bigger than we thought,
and they started messing with the calendars
and God only knows how long ago.
Anyway, friends, he said,
Bob, I want you to get off your ass
and start yourself a do-it-yourself religion.
I give you a church to found,
not upon a rock,
but upon a sandy shifting beach of hypocrisy, friends.
If you don't believe me,
I'm going to give you a beautiful,
beloved hypocrisy,
for where would any religion worth its salt be
without its fair measure of hypocrisy?
It's the only thing that he knows.
Praise the Lord!
And Bob was a salesman before he was a prophet.
He would, in religion,
he decided it was the best product of all
because there was no manufacturing costs at all.
And so he created this disorganized
do-it-yourself religion,
a non-organization
for non-joiners,
which is why there's only about 100 people in here,
not 100,000.
Now, people who are the sinners,
the mutants,
the misfits,
the disbelievers,
or those who will believe anything.
Those are the people who like to draw flies, friends.
Now, here's the thing.
All subgeniuses are, in fact,
completely different from each other.
If you look around this room,
you'll go,
well, some of them are sort of what I expected,
but, ooh, that's my fellow subgenius, you know.
Well, friends, it's true.
The only thing that any of us have in common
is that we have nothing at all in common
with the conspiracy of the normal people.
Now, sometimes I used to feather that and go,
but now the normal people, they can't help it
because they, ah, who cares?
Kill them all anyway!
Let goddess sort them out!
I'm sorry, I have a pagan's t-shirt.
I thought that was real funny.
Let goddess sort them out.
Goddess is peaceful, not like God.
God's all mean and got a beard and lightning bolts, right?
And goddess is round and earth-like and sweet.
Well, then we'll let God kill them all
and let goddess sort them out.
And those who goddess sees
have paid their $30 dues in the church of the subgenius.
That's when that goddess rips her goddess mask off
and says, well, I was actually one of those hideous alien monsters.
And you're saved and you're going to be given the powers of God
and we'll take you up just like all that New Age crap,
except one of those religions has to be right, right?
Wrong!
What if it's this one?
Why not?
It's so damn crazy it just might work, you know?
How?
Because, you know, they say you can't beat City Hall.
Ah, well, I suppose.
Same person certainly can't.
Because it's only the crazy people, folks,
who are nutty enough to actually stand up and try to beat City Hall.
And you never know.
Sometimes it actually happens.
It seems too good to be true, though,
and that's why some people don't believe in Bob.
They think, oh, well, I understand.
I get the joke.
I'm not a sub-subgenius.
I get that.
I understand you guys are just making fun of those religious nuts, you know.
You're just pretending to be religious nuts.
No!
We are not pretending to be religious nuts, my friend.
You have not seen a religious fanatic lose his mind and lose all perspective
until you've seen a sub-genius in slack.
A sub-genius in slack does not think logically.
He does not think about, well, does it make sense?
Bob said in 1998 the aliens were going to kill the normals
and say that it didn't happen in 1989.
That doesn't make any sense.
Well, fine!
How far would Jesus have gotten if the Christians worried about making sense?
How well would yesterday's newspaper sell
if those newspaper editors worried about the news making sense?
My God, that's what it is when people look at the church as sub-genius.
They go, well, that's sub-genius.
That just means people just below a genius.
I don't know if that means they're stuck up or something.
Self-effacing or what?
Friends, it doesn't have anything to do with intelligence.
It has to do with sense, common sense, sense of humor and the all-important dollars
and the harvest.
And friends, Bob did not become the high epop of the church of sub-genius
because he's some smart guy.
I mean, look at him.
He's not smart.
He's got what counts.
Luck, not brains.
How far did brains ever get you on a hot date?
Nowhere!
Even looks don't matter that much nowadays.
It's luck.
Luck being in the right place at the right time.
As Bob said, I'd rather be lucky than good any day.
And as a result, Bob has a power.
The power that other, that popes don't have.
The power to fail.
And yet, every time he fucks up, he makes a million bucks.
That's because he walks the path, the true path, the path of least resistance, my friends.
He surfs that path of least resistance.
And now, Bob has the superpower of luck,
but he does not have the great god-like power that some better connected deities have.
He cannot forgive your sins.
Because he doesn't give a shit about your piddly little pathetic sins.
He doesn't think you get anything worse than him going to the trouble of having to forgive them.
He won't forgive your sins.
Because he came here to excuse your sins.
He brought not forgiveness, but an excuse.
You don't use Bob as a crutch.
You let Bob use you as a crutch.
You do not ask Bob, hey Bob, what do you smoke in your pipe?
You throw yourself in that pipe.
You let Bob smoke you.
You let Bob light you up, suck you through that pipe into his lungs.
You let Bob smoke you.


You're part of Bob's brain.
You're one of those thoughts that might be the thought that made him get a little wood that minute.
Or it might be the thought that made him want to leave town.
Anyway, friends, that's the good news.
Then there's the conspiracy.
Tomorrow is Hitler's birthday, isn't it?
Speaking of World War II.
Oh my God.
That's 420, dude.
Oh man, 420.
You know what that means?
420, 420.
We're in 420 right now.
Jesus, I'm getting out of this.
I'm a skyscraper, man.
Tomorrow's Hitler's birthday?
Yeah, at 420.
Damn, I didn't get him a car.
Wake Branch Day, Vivian's death day.
I don't think my Nazi uniform fits me anymore.
I was a lot more trim back in my Bundeswehr days.
Well, you know, I'll be seeing our friend Father Joe Mama on Hitler's birthday.
Really?
About Saturday night at the Indianapolis Devox.
Papa Joe's coming up to Indianapolis, huh?
Yeah.
Wow.
Yes.
What could be more fun than strapping Papa Joe Mama in one of his Nazi suits down and
taking out one of those testicle crushers and just crushing them in front of everybody
and saying-
That's not a Nazi suit and those aren't testicles, Dave.
Oh, okay, okay.
I get them confused.
It's a satirical commentary on fascism.
Okay, but do you-
And a damn fine looking subgenius torture commandant outfit.
Yeah, but you should not grow pubic hairs on a commandant's outfit.
Those aren't swastikas.
They're three-legged pies.
They're nightstickers.
Oh, I thought they were.
Okay.
I confused them for pubic hairs once again.
Yeah, people are so ignorant.
They see Nazis everywhere.
It's a Russian uniform that the other folks have.
They wear it often.
Why would people see Nazis anywhere?
Are they having some kind of mass psychosis or something?
What would make them hallucinate Nazis everywhere?
I mean, Nazis, what?
Well, that's what I grew up.
When I was growing up in the 30s and 40s, that was what I was taught to fear and hate,
were Germans and Japanese.
Now, of course, I'm shiny white.







I'm not wearing my shoes.
It's weird how that's happened.
Thanks, Dink.
You see, now that you are tired of being part with these cigarette butts and these electrodes
are not doing too much for you, but you will tell us where the marquee is and you will
tell us very soon.
Oh, oh, oh, what's a marquee?
Oh, oh.
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
You're not in the slightest.
Sorry, Dave.
I'm in the schley bell time.
You say that all the time.
That's a codependency thing.
I'm just trying to make it clear.






I'm still in Christmas, man.
I'm never leaving.
That's it.
I'm interested.
You vomit on Christmas.
Yeah, but sure.
It's one of the few times of the year I get to vomit freely and be complimented on the
colors and also my shades.
Oh, art.
I hate modern art.
So do I, but you know, the lizard people demand it.
Yeah, yeah.
Nazis and lizard people everywhere.
Ah, yes.
From south of the border, the Nazis and the lizard people.
Armageddon.




Brave boys are in Texas ready to attack Mexico City.
The evil empire of the Canadia creatures.
Look at them.
They have no knowledge of the past, no ambition for the future.
So lucky.
Why would you say something like that?
Can you even imagine what it's like to remember everything?
But it was a good day.
It was worth it to have thousands of people all over America believe because they heard
Papa Joe Mama say it on NPR that the church of the subgenius had indeed been behind the
Columbine.
One lie, friends, can be worth a million bucks.
As Bob said, there's no such thing as no PR.
And friends, I love just how evil and sick and incorrect politically is that man, Father
Joe Mama!
Wait, wait, wait.
Discerning from the nämial commence.
Yes, dear friends, it is true.
The truth puns.
And now good friends, I think it's fair to say if there's a single ally in the world

world that we love more than any other?
It's probably got to be
Al-Qaeda.
And they have
a saying over there, friends, and it goes
like this.
He who tells the truth
should keep one foot
in the stirrup.
Now, whether he's talking
about gynecology, I don't know.
On to the sermon.
The sermon tonight
is entitled
Reparations.
Because there has
been a recent movement afoot
to sue various companies,
if not the government itself,
for slavery in the
1800s and before.
Lawyers figure
if they could work around the statute
of limitations and collect
$4 billion for the internment of World War II
Japanese, and then
sidestep the century-old Swiss
banking laws to squeeze out another
$4 billion for Jews who
lost their account numbers,
then some schmuck
should be able to extract
a few billion more from the powers
that be for the
kidnapping, rape, and enslavement
of various African ancestors.
So tonight
we're going to examine this controversial
topic and
consider the true ramifications
in regard to
this man, Bob.
Of course, any
subjection,
any genius worth their salt, can tell you
that slavery, the ramifications
for slavery, are
to put it charitably,
a joke.
It's nothing more than a
smokescreen to camouflage
the conspiracies,
ongoing enslavement,
of the masses today. Do I hear
praise Bob?
Praise Bob!
Attention
arguments!
Attention arguments!
Stand by for an important
revelation.
People do not
go to work on a
volunteer basis!
They are
compelled to go
and show up hat in hand
begging to serve
their conspiracy masters or else
they starve in the streets!
Oh sure,
you can call it
employment and come up with
all sorts of fancy, soundy names,
like free enterprise and capitalism
if you want!
Oh, but make no mistake about it,
it's still slavery, plain and simple!
Only now, my friends, they've repackaged it
and put it in a new container.
Now it's wage slavery.
Yes, because the conspiracy eventually realized
a very important little point.
They realized that it's always cheaper,
to rent,
than it is to own.
And we all know how they love to cut costs.
Do I hear praise Bob?
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob indeed!
The old time slaves, my friends,
they were never paid for their work.
Oh, that difference is true.
But they were also given
the bare necessities of life
so that they could survive.
Food, clothing, shelter.
Wage slaves, however,
they're given little pieces of paper,
which they're told are quite valuable,
but which the conspiracy, in fact,
mass produces like toilet paper!
Then, those same workers are expected to turn around
and fork over much of that same little pieces of paper
so that they can buy the same necessities
that they used to be given for free!
Oh!
Plus, they're also expected to give another 20 or 30%
for taxes!
For what?
To the conspiracy in order to control their lives!
Yeah!
Oh!
And if anyone refuses to pay the conspiracy its tax,
what happens?
It's off to the big house!
The house of pain!
Free enterprise indeed!
But now,
now there's always a certain percentage,
and we all know them too well, don't they?
They're made to be celebrities!
We're supposed to respect these certain workers
that work for the slave masses.
And that's just so much
that they earn extra pieces of paper.
They're allowed to retire
and stop working
to serve as motivational examples
for the rest of society!
If we work really,
really hard,
then we also,
we also might be able to retire.
And, we're told, if we follow the rules,
be just like them.
Better yet,
if we really make it,
oh, and this part's great, friends,
if we really make it,
we'll be able to rent our own slaves!
That's right!
Then we'll be just like Pinky!
We'll be able to afford our own servants!
Incredible,
but so, so true.
Yet, you see, friends,
the sad fact is
that money doesn't really matter.
Possessions
doesn't really matter.
The only thing in life
that really matters
is life itself.
We're all given only so much of it,
and the moment it's gone,
we die.
And no more free minutes.
The conspiracy,
the conspiracy knows this
and can't stand the realization
that they were given the same amount of time
as the rest of us.
So what did they do?
They immediately set out
and devised new ways,
in order to capture,
take away,
and control all the free time of others!
Yes, my dear friends,
that is how slavery began.
And they started to use it
so that they could get more goods and services
at the expense of others,
the so-called servant class.
Oh, a little problem occurred, though.
Over time, they started to realize
that slavery was more expensive
than it might otherwise be,
so they devised this new
rent-a-slave concept.
And it also had an added benefit.
There were no more escapees.
Remember that?
A few people might run away.
This way, with rent-a-slaves,
if they disappear,
another one quickly shows up
to take their place.
In fact, they'll even compete
for their privilege!
Incredible!
And yet, that's the beauty of their system.
It's a much more easier
and efficient way to do it, isn't it?
And best of all,
the slaves don't even realize
they are being controlled.
Oh, how that must have seemed
like the days of Camelot to the cotton.
The golden age of domination and power!
But then something terrible happened,
my friends.
A leader appeared,
who demanded in a thundering voice,
to let my people go!
His name wasn't Moses,
although he spoke with the authority
of Jehovah once.
His name wasn't Harriet Tubman,
although he ran an underground railroad
to freedom.
No, sir, his name was,
is, and shall never be,
J.R. Bob Dobbs!
And he won't rest
until the very last subgenius is free.
Will you give me a praise, Bob?
Praise Bob!
Now, if the African Americans
wish to legitimize
slavery by accepting a monetary payment
for the past,
that's their business.
Then the Khan will print up
more pieces of paper,
hand it over, and brag,
well, then, now that closes
the books on slavery,
we said we were sorry
and promise never to do it again.
Weak, weak.
So, uh, stop complaining
and get on back to work.
Now, if that's not bad enough,
my friends,
there are some pink conspiracy whores
who have even gone so far as to say,
that the blacks should be thankful for slavery.
They joke amongst themselves
that the lucky ones were captured,
domesticated, and transported
to a civilized nation
that offers plenty of social programs,
programs like five years,
five and higher long years of welfare.
Oh, aren't they so fortunate.
And if they were back in Africa,
they sneer,
the Negro might be starving
or swatting flies
or waiting to contract AIDS.
Oh, but they're not.
But now,
if he just follows the rules,
kiss plenty of pink little butt,
and doesn't cause any trouble,
he'll get a warm place to sleep
and a loose pair of shoes.
The arrogance.
The outrage.
Oh, how the conspiracy
could even dare to think such things.
That should be all the proof that we need
that you cannot compromise with the con.
No, sir.
These aren't rational beans.
They're monsters.
And they only understand one thing.
One thing.
And that's brute force.
Bob Dobbs knows this better than anyone else.
Yes, my friends.
And he's going to make sure
that he doesn't settle
for such a cheap cop-out.
No, sir.
The subgenius race
will not accept a settlement
for the past
or the present.
We refuse
a presidential apology.
And we will not accept
the pink
oh, we're so sorry
pink guilt platitudes.
We can't toss out words
and they won't be permitted
to just say
oh, we're sorry
and throw money our way
and then claim to be paid in full.
No, sir.
We demand payment
in a more precious commodity.
One that they could relate to, perhaps.
For every dollar
in a great lifetime taken,
we expect one to be forfeited
plus interest.
Now, I'm not saying
whether that means
the conspiracy slave masters
and their overseers
must be euthanized
or made slaves themselves
our next day.
That is, after all,
a question that
evangelicals and holocausters
are still trying to sort out.
But I will say this.
All subgeniuses agree
on this one premise.
And that is this.
We will never
forgive and forget.
Do I hear a praise, Bob?
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob, indeed!
The conspiracy is not the only one
who can hire certain bill collectors.
Bob Dobbs is bringing the entire fleet
of them here to Earth on X-Day.
And on that fateful day, my friends,
at 7 a.m.,
he's going to unleash the entire force
on the conspiracy.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
Yes, the Pink's will then know
the true meaning of Bob's pipe
as they struggle and scramble
to pay the piper.
We, on the other hand,
will finally have our chance
to truthfully look towards the heavens
and sing in unison,
Free at last! Free at last!
Praise Bob Almighty!
We're free at last!
Here's the word of Bob!
Praise Bob, Amen!
Thank you!
nothing to me.
Bobbies are here to stay
and someday you will see.
I spent my 30 bucks.
I've got my minister's card.
I'm a Deuce Pay member
and it wasn't all that hard.
I'll start my own ministry
and it will be the first.
Bobbies are not so bad.
We really are not cursed.
Subgenius.
Subgenius.
Subgenius.
Subgenius.
So now you know my story.
There's nothing I've left out.
I try to tell the truth
of what it's all about.
Yes, I am a Bobby
and proud to say it's so.
Yes, I am a Bobby
and a flat-fell dynamo.
I am a true Yeti
and yes, it makes me proud.
I am a subgenius
and I'll say it out loud.
I don't care much for paint
and the things that they say.
The Church of the Subgenius
will soon have its day.
Subgenius.

Subgenius.
Subgenius.
Subgenius.
Did you really think we would give you two acts
and walk away with your ten dollars?
and walk away with your ten dollars?

No! No, my friends!
The answer is no!
We have much, much more!
While any church would go for the easy buck,
we are entrepreneurs.
And we are nothing if not a value church.
While other churches preach family values
and Christian values,
we give you one dollar's worth of entertainment
for one dollar.
One dollar's worth of religion for one dollar.
And triple your money back if you're not a Christian!

You're not eternally saved!
Praise Bob!
YAY! YAY! YAY! YAY! YAY!

DJ Selly Out
aka Stahlio
will be spinning
the wax fantastic
in a barrage of collage
and thumping his nose
at such convention as copyright laws
and good news.
Now, I've only listened
to about 40 seconds
of his material
and my ears bled,
my bowels voided,
and I could taste colors!
Now, if that isn't product endorsement,
I don't know what is.
Boom!

Yes, indeed, we have live mummification tonight.
Live mummification tonight.
They're being mummified.
You don't see that every day.
Crimson Mane will delight your senses
with a performance that is both titillating
and educating.
Serving the Indianapolis area since 1997,
Crimson Mane has been pierced, lashed,
bloodied, suspended, gagged, bound,
and burned more times than I can count.
Winston Churchill once said,
I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears,
and suffering.
I have nothing to offer but sweat.
You'll have your blood soon enough.
You have your sweat right now, as you can plainly see.
And we will toil for you.
Oh, how we will toil for you.
Not just we humble preachers here on stage,
but our bartenders over there,
our cleaning staff wherever.
Oh, we will toil.
Such toil I cannot imagine.
As for tears, we shall see.


Here at the 2002 Indie Vival.
And now, DJ Sullyout and Crimson Mane.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Please help us.
We're stuck.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Just relax.
I'll get you out of this gunk.
Thanks.
Okay.
Let's make a break for it.
We're almost there.
Oh, no!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

Thank you.
Oh, no.

Congratulations, warrior.
You have succeeded in your mission.
Your efforts have honored us all.
Thank you, commander.

They are full of...
Slack!
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, oh, slack.
Yeah, that's why we're all here, ladies and gentlemen.
We're here for slack.
We're here for Bob.
Let's hear it for Bob!
Praise Bob!
I love you trained monkeys.
You're great.
You're wonderful.
I love you guys.
I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
All right!
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, Jacob!
The days are breaking.
All the coffees are cooking and there's bread and bacon.
Roll out, cowboy.
I thought somebody was actually in the room screaming that.
Get it while she's hot or I'll throw her out and spit in the skillet.
If I can't whoop it, I'll go down.
Oh, me and Gaggy Gag and the rest of the boys are sitting around the campfire window.
Hey, lo virtually slugging off dry plant.
But that's about it us two.
Oh you properly capture and empty that there now, ey?
Oh, we're still bad because the construction here is what trying to take over is.

booing.
And when they opens the chute, I come out a-ridin' a panther
And a-ropin' longhorn whales
I've rode everything with hair on it
And I've rode a few things, it was too tough to grow any hair
I've rode bull moose on the prod, she-grizzlies, and long bolts of lightning
Mountain lions are my playmates
And when I feel cold and lonesome
I sleep some of the dinner rattlesnakes
Cause they always makes me nice and warm
To keep alive, I eat stick dynamite and cactus
The Grand Canyon ain't nothin' but my bean hole
When I get thirsty, I drink cyanide cut with alkali
When I go to sleep, I pillow my head on the Bighorn Mountains
I lay in boots in Colorado and my hat in Montana
I can stretch out my arms, clean out from the crazy woman fork
Plumb over to the upper Gray Bull River
My bed tarp covers half of the world
Half of Texas and all of old Mexico
But there's one thing for sure and certain
And if you boys wants to know
I'll tell ya, that I'm still a long way short
Of bein' the Daddy of them all
Cause he's full growed
And as any man that really knows can see
Well, boys, I ain't nothing but a bad boy
I was suckled by a triceratops
I coulda stopped with I can train tumors with my one good eye
and I peed the Colorado River,
but instead he had to go on for six hours.
Hey, that's the way you do it.
That's a bragging song, huh?
I mean, a bragging poem?
Man.
This is the story of Good King Stank.
I'm not going to go on with that one.
Why not?
You're a piece of big bragging.
We ain't past midnight.
Oh, yeah.
We're not past midnight in some parts of the world yet.
But first, friends,
I shall tell you the story of Good King Stank,
whose queen was renowned as the finest poontang.
All across the land,
10,000 miles around,
none matched the beauty of the babe with the crown.
Now, among those who admired the bounteous Princess Wee
was one lowlife bachelor,
they called Chris Lee.
Chris Lee thought to diddle the thang
that he knew good and well belonged to King Stank.
Now, we've seen fuckheads, assholes, shitheads, and turds,
geeks, glorts, ninnies, and nerds,
but the sorriest morphidite you ever did see
was that chive-ass beatnik they called Reverend Chris Lee.
Chris Lee saw his chance,
set the X-Day drills,
while the king's brain was muddled on potions and pills.
Now, most faithful bobbies,
Stank was loath to disparage.
But that skunk married Wee in the short-nuration marriage.
This brash move so raised King Stank's ire
that he resolved to have Lee punished by torture and fire.
First, he'd have Lee tied to a cigarro cactus stake.
Then,
in a giant microwave oven,
Chris Lee's ass he would bake.
In Lee's rump,
Stank would roast a corn on the cob.
He'd serve some to Nege,
but he'd butter some for Bob.
But even at the trial,
Chris Lee showed such sass
that he vulgarly winked at Wee
as if to make a coarse pass.
Seeing this made Stank so furiously mad,
it almost blew out the one royal nab.
And the kingdom heard Stank yell
that Chris Lee will pay
or shut up like hell.
His lily-white ass I will churn like butter
until, at polite apology, I do hear him utter.
So untie his feet and untie his hand,
cause I'm gonna whip that motherfucker man to man.
Friends, they fought like devils and not like men.
They gouged and they bit and they kicked.
But then, something dreadful happened
before the battle was done
that left all the kingdom and even King Stank stunned.
For, while they fought each other,
into the setting sun,
that fine princess Wee,
off with Dr. Philo Drummond, had run!
Friends, I should give a little tip of the hat
to the great Rudy Ray Moore,
Dolomite, who inspired that.
I hate non-digital cameras.
I want a lot of money
so I can have a digital camera and a scanner
and everything.
Grrrr!
doesn't fucking work.
I got so many ideas and not enough cash.
Grrr!
Doesn't fuckin' work.
I think every Cebulis has said that.

Grr!
Doesn't fuckin' work.
Grrrr!
I'd do something like that.
Grr!
Ah, yes friends,

At the very beginning of this show,
we heard some KPFA puzzling evidence strange mix
and, of course, some ESO swamp radio
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Professor Chaz Smith in it.
But mostly we heard Pope Fred, Papa Joe Mama,
St. Ann and Helena Handbasket,
and St. Dalio or Stalio or DJ Selly Out.
And here are some contact addresses
or URLs, actually, on the internet for Stalio.

Friends, we're glad you listened to this show
and we're even more glad that some listeners
have donated enough to help us keep on going
for another couple of months.
Not just this show, but subgenius.com
and all the other archive sites.
But if you truly love Bob
and you want to help us keep on going,
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,
you should go to subgenius.com front page
or especially the radio page
or the catalog store pages
and help out financially as best you can.
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink
of total poverty and we don't want any subgeniuses
to make their own situations worse.
But some of you still have jobs.
Even five bucks makes a big difference,
even if it's only once a month.
From enough of you.
50 bucks makes an even bigger difference.
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way
of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.
We also take checks and money orders to subgenius foundation.
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44.
That's subgenius.com.

Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
