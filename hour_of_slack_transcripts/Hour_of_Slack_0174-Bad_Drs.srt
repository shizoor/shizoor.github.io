1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Okay kids, the car is packed. Now go and get your father and we'll look at some more in your house.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,680
Huh. Funny light tonight.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,400
Look at my shadow.

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,180
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:29,180
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,860
The subgenius power of SWAT.

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,280
There is absolutely no other possibility.

8
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,560
Now, let me introduce your tutors.

9
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,140
Reverend Arvin Stang.

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,540
Yes.

11
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,960
She's also been to Nicaragua.

12
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,440
By the way, she may also speak Spanish.

13
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, that's right, dear friends. We're back again with everything all changed around and...

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,320
Still my shadow, but...

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,500
I know.

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,020
That's the whole problem, you see.

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,060
But we're going to have a special subject for the show tonight.

18
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,200
For some of you people who haven't been up on your subgenius terminology lately,

19
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,620
we're going to investigate the subject of doctors.

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,320
Doctors. That's a rank in the Church of the Subgenius.

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,500
Yes, there's doctors out there, all right.

22
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,540
Doctors.

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,540
Yeah, I could...

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,600
I don't...

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,120
Well, it can...

26
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,300
No one can defeat me.

27
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,220
I can't define the doctor syndrome.

28
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,980
It can only be illustrated by example.

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,540
Yes.

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,640
And be glad you can't see this show right now, except on Channel X.

31
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:05,900
Uh...

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,440
We're having enough trouble as it is.

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,300
It has been a fun Easter, friends.

34
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:11,640
The, uh...

35
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,940
You know, last year the Easter pterodactyl brought the little eggs for my kids out in Glen Rose.

36
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,000
And this year, unfortunately, it wasn't quite so easy.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,500
It was the Easter vomit ultrasaurus.

38
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,600
Huge eggs, huge eggs.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,980
But, ugh, I mean, you can hear them in the background, just how bad it was.

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:40,720
So, Dallas viewers, may call the number on your screen, 823-7490, for information.

41
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,680
Uh, for disinformation, just keep listening.

42
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,040
And, uh, thank you.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,260
So far, so far here...

44
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,640
We're trying to march all the slack squads back to their barracks now.

45
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,440
And they're a little bit hard to deactivate.

46
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,660
They get belligerent late at night.

47
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,380
But, uh, they seem to be able to make it back to the barracks here.

48
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,560
Look, they've started now.

49
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,400
This is what we call the, uh, monster beach party.

50
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,460
Hey, well, so welcome to the subgenius beach party.

51
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,280
Yes, last week it was in Houston on KPFA.

52
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,600
You'll never know where the subgenius beach party is.

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,040
And don't you wish you did.

54
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,060
Oh, dear, that ding.

55
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,280
Well, Dr. Hal, is there any way you can fight through the sound effects and tell us about the...

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,920
the relationship between the demopods and the...

57
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,840
Well, the demopods and the myriapods, uh, got together at the early...

58
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,380
No, demopods and us-a-pods.

59
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,820
Oh, the demopods.

60
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,760
It says right here on the script we're supposed to...

61
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,500
I didn't understand that.

62
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,260
I thought you meant this script right here, the one with the red lines on the cover.

63
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,060
Listen, never read anything with red dots.

64
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,700
I never believe anything with red dots.

65
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,560
It says read addresses that people don't like on the show.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,360
God, I'm coming in from all sides.

67
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Too many buttons to push, too many tape recorders to watch.

68
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,860
Mobius, right, it's a dangerous survey.

69
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,880
I don't give a damn.

70
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,140
Dead center.

71
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,500
Yes, liberty right.

72
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:49,980
I get it.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,640
I understand things that frighten me, that don't make any sense.

74
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,880
Now let's get out of my brain.

75
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,760
I am a subgenius, and by that virtue I am in touch with forces greater than man.

76
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,260
I dare you to kill me.

77
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,440
I am not a dupe of the conspiracy.

78
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,800
I know more than they do.

79
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,320
I am a subgenius.

80
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,260
That's all I need to be.

81
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,460
I'm one of the good guys.

82
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,280
I shall prevail.

83
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,960
Let out the crazy man inside you.

84
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,960
He knows what's what.

85
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,500
Smile when you call me a fanatic.

86
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,340
Me, primate.

87
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,280
Me, open man.

88
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,660
I say to the pigs, give me your money.

89
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,500
You won't need it.

90
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:19,980
The future is mine.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,140
I will not offer you not but destruction.

92
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,400
What do they believe in?

93
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,460
Everything.

94
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,940
Who do they believe in?

95
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,340
A mysterious character named Bob.

96
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,580
His name is Bob.

97
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,720
Bob.

98
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,900
His character name is Bob.

99
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,660
Bob is what will bring slack to planet Earth.

100
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,520
And to you, young man.

101
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,560
And to you, if you will send a dollar.

102
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,080
If you send a dollar.

103
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,900
Who do they believe in?

104
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,960
A mysterious character named Bob.

105
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,160
Bob is the gun and you are the bullet.

106
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,580
The showdown is fast approaching.

107
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,160
The church is still unknown but its infectious doctrines spread across continents.

108
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,500
Church headquarters, the first megaphis temple lodge, is housed in this dungeon.

109
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:18,500


110
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:18,500


111
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:18,500


112
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,920
The church is a palace skyscraper from which Dob's secret mandates are issued to his agents in the dreaded brotherhood of Bob.

113
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,280
But this mighty edifice represents but the tip of a wandering rogue iceberg.

114
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:38,840
The words, hymns and sound effects of Dob's are disseminated on a weekly basis to thousands of devout radio listeners in most major cities.

115
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,680
Even as far away as China and darkest Africa.

116
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,280
This show is so popular that we're studying it from all angles.

117
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,320
You can even watch this show on Channel X.

118
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,780
As Hal plays the microphone and flies backwards around the other side of the planet.

119
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,300
The subgeniuses in China have to listen on shortwave radios.

120
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,640
You'll notice we've switched to spewage music for the background for this segment of the show.

121
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:11,000
As the psychic surgery is performed, Bob's sweaty brow is wiped by a small nuclear explosion.

122
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,200
Oof. All better now.

123
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,040
And here comes the reveal.

124
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,200
Oh! Hello!

125
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,480
You're improving Jacky. Just can't seem to get rid of that streak of honesty in you.

126
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:36,660
He gave you a vision of moral order in the universe, and there isn't any.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,160
Those stars twinkle in a void, dear boy.

128
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,580
And the two-legged creature schemes and dreams beneath them, all in vain.

129
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,260
All in vain.

130
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,420
All in vain, Jack.

131
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,880
You hear anything?

132
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,980
Listen to me!

133
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,080
Two-legged creature won't believe anything.

134
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,640
And the more preposterous, the better.

135
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,540
Whales speak French at the bottom of the sea.

136
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,320
The horses of Arabia have silver wings.

137
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,600
Pygmies mate with elephants in darkest Africa.

138
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,420
I have sold all those propositions.

139
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,520
And they were all fools and none of it matters.

140
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:18,980
Ah!

141
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,280
For whatever reason you refuse to feel this space we're in,

142
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,100
to know its insanity, really know it.

143
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,400
Whatever your particular anesthetic is

144
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,140
that you hold onto so desperately,

145
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,880
the thing, I mean, that makes you think you know who you are,

146
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,120
whatever that thing is you allow to keep you sane,

147
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,120
your ace in the hole,

148
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,780
the psyche that keeps you from trying to guess

149
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,200
at what your pimp has in store,

150
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,260
whatever keeps you from screaming out at this very moment

151
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,060
in absolute and sheer horror,

152
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,680
whatever that is, whatever that is,

153
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,900
it's a lie.

154
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,700
It's a lie.

155
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,120
Give reality your brain, you fantasized son of Walt Disney.

156
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,700
It's a lie.

157
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,600
An old off-the-street pimp's con game.

158
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,820
The magic for turning human blood into U.S. steel.

159
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,880
The thing that seduces you into being satisfied.

160
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,060
At pointing to the last tiny patch of flesh

161
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,920
you have on your bones as proof of your humanity.

162
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,260
And keeps you satisfied thinking yourself human

163
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,600
because you live a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a life.

164
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,120
I know you.

165
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,300
Because you live here in his space as I do,

166
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,200
are his image and play his game on each other,

167
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,320
thinking it's your own.

168
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,800
I know you.

169
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,140
You can't live in an insane asylum

170
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,000
playing insane game with a madman

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,700
and be objective, brother.

172
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,220
Hope?

173
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,600
At least prostitutes get paid.

174
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Yes, while you pin your hopes, your sanity,

175
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,200
and most of all your individuality

176
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,120
on that rickety old con game, a web of words.

177
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,060
While the master pimp helps you paint

178
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,180
your individual death wish in your head,

179
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,320
feel who you are.

180
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,520
Feel for a split second

181
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,440
the obscenity of who you've got to be.

182
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,300
Really.

183
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,320
In actions, I mean.

184
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,800
Defined by, ordered up for,

185
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,040
and delivered to your jobs on Monday morning.

186
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,020
The greatest eight hours you'll spend in your entire life, ho.

187
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,900
Is a colored television really worth that?

188
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,480
In this filth, this insidious insanity,

189
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,340
this nightmare of deception and hypocrisy,

190
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,460
in this United States of America,

191
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,840
careful not to awaken from sleeping,

192
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,460
we, you and I,

193
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,700
wander around through a sea of our own rotten bodies

194
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,980
in this pimp whores game.

195
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,080
You pretending it's everything else.

196
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,920
In this sewer in which no one can escape playing,

197
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,040
it's normal for brothers to pimp sisters and wives

198
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,220
because their fathers pimped them.

199
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,980
Or for television stations to pimp their audiences

200
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,080
for perverted sponsors who whore for their own commercials.

201
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,980
And until the authorities catch on,

202
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,640
even common normals can purchase

203
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,260
the word of Bob itself in condensed form,

204
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,420
the legendary Book of the Subgenius,

205
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,200
available in bookstores everywhere.

206
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,380
But the only certain way to receive the Dobbs teachings

207
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,840
in uncut form is to tithe directly to the church.

208
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,820
Do you really think you freed yourself

209
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,440
of America's special, insidious,

210
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,900
insidiousness of being inside you?

211
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,920
No, brother, America's a condition.

212
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,080
One thing is for sure,

213
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,440
a sheep is not a creature of the air.

214
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,660
But at the same time, we will be intent on searching out

215
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,540
the truth of all evidentiary components

216
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,960
which ostensibly have posed a threat

217
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,340
to our constitutional processes,

218
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,620
in particular, our concept of freedom

219
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,000
and our electoral process.

220
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,000
Good, good, because I was making, uh,

221
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,820
just only one and a half.

222
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,300
Well, as a member of the stock exchange,

223
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,260
I would suck their brains out with a straw.

224
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,580
The easiest way is to write a postal card

225
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,100
and ask them to mail you all their leaflets.

226
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,560
They'll put you on and forever you'll have everything.

227
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,480
Even after it's over with, you'll still get it.

228
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,640
They're very happy to do so.

229
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,420
You will be ordained as a card character

230
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,020
and a burying minister,

231
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,160
and receive the huge official magazine

232
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,040
of churchly news and doctrine,

233
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,520
The Stark Fist of Removal.

234
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,080
I'd just like to say a few words

235
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,700
about The Stark Fist of Removal.

236
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,540
This is the official newsletter of the church.

237
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,380
It's got all kinds of great stuff in it.

238
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,060
It's got proof of Bob.

239
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,460
It's got a picture of Bob with Ronald Reagan in there.

240
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,580
It's got all important instructions to the subgenius.

241
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,320
Illiterates can purchase their choice

242
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,940
of dozens of inspirational cassette tapes.

243
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,100
And there's even a line of casual subgenius wear

244
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,240
to fit every size or budget.

245
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,580
I'd sprit their nostrils open with a bowtook.

246
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,340
That's not a very good answer.

247
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,780
You're heightening my concern rather than lessening it.

248
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,820
It's embarrassing.

249
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,160
It's moist.

250
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,960
It's moist. It drips.

251
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,400
It squirts.

252
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,540
It's liquid warmth

253
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,920
emitting from your body.

254
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,460
It dribbles.

255
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,740
It spits.

256
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,960
It's nasty.

257
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:03,260
But yet it's beautiful in its own wet, slimy,

258
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,780
squirting and embarrassing way.

259
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,460
He did it the subgenius way too.

260
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,740
He had already gotten a short duration marriage.

261
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,620
That's right.

262
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,520
From Pastor Naked and official ones.

263
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:16,760
He already had the paperwork.

264
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:16,920
He had already gotten the paperwork.

265
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:16,920


266
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:16,920


267
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:16,920


268
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,120
He did have the paperwork.

269
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,360
He would have sanctified couplings, friends,

270
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,340
for the last few years.

271
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,240
But their short duration marriage ran out.

272
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,800
And rather than send Buck any more money,

273
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,960
they went to Las Vegas and had one of those parlor chapel,

274
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,220
as Norm just told me they're called,

275
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,580
a parlor chapel wedding.

276
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,220
Marriage parlor.

277
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,920
And when he left the chapel,

278
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,340
this acolyte came running in.

279
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,560
You know, it was one of those ten minute ceremonies.

280
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,840
This guy actually had the gall to come running out going,

281
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:45,180
Sir, there's supposed to be a $25 tip, quote, tip, unquote,

282
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,300
to which Pope Sterno threw down a dollar and said,

283
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,540
Sir, kill me.

284
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,240
That's right.

285
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,100
But we should say congratulations to Pope Sterno

286
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,320
and his faithful Ubermatrix, that is to say, Miss Dottie.

287
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,760
That's right.

288
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,500
And they're creating more little yetis, friends.

289
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:00,840
Yes, sir.

290
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,540
They are further contaminating the gene pool.

291
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,780
Sterno's father, the way he became a subgenius was his father

292
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,440
was one of the guys who had to stand on the Nevada desert

293
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,560
and face nuclear tests from about half a mile away

294
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:14,840
That's right.

295
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,240
wearing only goggles and a lead-shielded jockstrap.

296
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:18,840
Mm-hmm.

297
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,360
Duck and cover, baby.

298
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,080
You betcha.

299
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,540
But they weren't allowed to in those days,

300
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,000
and the result is thousands of subgenius children

301
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,260
of those selfless servicemen who gave their genetic structure for...

302
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:30,260


303
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,500
...gave their genes for...

304
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,640
...for nuclear dominance.

305
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,380
There you go.

306
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,500
And every bit will be appreciated.

307
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,600
Let me put it this way.

308
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,460
If I were you, I'd give me all your money.

309
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,140
All right, here's the money now being shoveled into the giant money elevator

310
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,260
and we're pressing the money into a small pellet

311
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,400
which will keep us warm until 6 a.m.

312
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,120
If we want to eradicate...

313
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,960
...the world three times...

314
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,800
If we want to eradicate the very concept of money,

315
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,120
it's going to take money and tons of it.

316
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,880
But money is to burn.

317
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,240
Here come tons of money now.

318
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,700
So we're asking...

319
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,840
And we can start with yours.

320
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,540
Okay.

321
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,560
Mr. Listener.

322
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,660
All the listeners now are putting their money in a big pile.

323
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,480
If we can take all the money and burn it,

324
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,780
then we can start a free anarchist society.

325
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,980
But we've got to have all the money first.

326
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,340
We're the only people who can take the responsibility for this project.

327
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,400
Yes, air and liquid both emit from this new type of tool

328
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,660
called...

329
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,460
...the

330
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,000
...

331
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,240
...

332
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,400
...

333
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,100
...

334
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,020
...

335
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,180
...

336
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:56,220
...

337
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,860
...

338
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,220
...

339
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,860
...

340
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,720
...

341
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,800
...

342
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:11,120
So the confused initiate was led to Dockstock, Dobstown itself,

343
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,160
Dobstown, Malaysia, where he was shocked to discover

344
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
the most primitive possible living condition.

345
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,260
Earth was inhabited by a species from another dimension.

346
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,760
With certain chants from the book, sacrifices,

347
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,860
this race, the old ones, can be brought back.

348
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,600
And mankind?

349
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,780
Destroyed.

350
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,640
Destroyed.

351
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,500
In the vast continuity of school park,

352
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,380
there seemed to be evil within.

353
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,780
There were people there with sensible heels,

354
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,100
and there were children there with no wounds of distinction.

355
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,400
There were children there with no wounds of distinction.

356
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:05,780
There were children there with no wounds of distinction.

357
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,160
There were women there who were thought of as virtuous,

358
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:21,900
but they contained the blood of the ruling class of Suopat.

359
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,900
I said men cried, babies died.

360
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,900
Men

361
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:38,900


362
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,100
Children fell,

363
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,720
Men sighed,

364
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,220
Days of pain jedi

365
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,040
Babies cried,

366
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,580
men died,

367
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,980
Children fell,

368
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,020
Women suffered.

369
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,780
People want to go home.

370
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:05,780


371
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:05,780


372
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:05,780


373
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,240
Between tenants and victims, they wanted to escape.

374
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,660
Yeah, they just wanted to escape.

375
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,060
He should know about it.

376
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,440
He should know about it.

377
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,400
He should know about sewer parks.

378
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,140
And the winter solstice.

379
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,480
I said, men cry.

380
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,700
Babies die.

381
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,440
Children fail.

382
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,940
People were hurt.

383
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,160
They die.

384
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,340
They die.

385
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,340
Funkin' away, fans.

386
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,020
Oh, yes.

387
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,880
People's Temple.

388
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,940
I'd say there's about four months before fun.

389
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,120
Before there's a delightful smell in the universe of charcoaled mankind.

390
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,420
You really mean four months?

391
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,280
According to the temperature rises in the last few weeks, yes.

392
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,940
So that's the message, is it?

393
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,420
About another 300 deadlines.

394
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,040
Is that what we say in tomorrow's paper?

395
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,920
Tomorrow we report the news, the facts.

396
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,900
We leave prophecy to the street corner cranks.

397
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,040
Some purchase thousands of Bob's handy pamphlets

398
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,620
with which to recruit the worthy and to perplex the normals.

399
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,520
To fill their minds with questions.

400
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,820
Questions that only Bob can answer.

401
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,180
Through his chosen apostles, his fishers of wallets.

402
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,280
And what is money?

403
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,640
Merely another tool of the conspiracy.

404
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,520
Except when it gains power by passing from your pocket to Bob's.

405
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,160
I believe in Bob.

406
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,840
And if you have a problem with your cash flow,

407
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,820
it's because your cash is not flowing towards Bob.

408
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,220
This is the first industrial church.

409
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,900
We're not a tax write-off scam.

410
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,540
We're...

411
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,180
We are an incorporated profit-making foundation.

412
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,360
Uh, if there is such a thing.

413
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,560
We're profits and we want profits.

414
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,600
Children, you've got to come back to the old American way.

415
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,220
Yes?

416
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,080
You've got to come back to quality goods.

417
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,260
For your dollar, a righteous purchase.

418
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,080
And let me ask you something, children.

419
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,900
How many of you have been tithing unto Bob?

420
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,220
That which is truly Bob's?

421
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,080
Tell me that, children.

422
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,220
How many of you have been giving 10% of your worth of goods to Bob?

423
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,120
I don't care who you are or where you come from.

424
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,520
If you haven't sent your $20 in to Bob, you're gonna burn.

425
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,400
Mother Teresa, I don't care how many people she's helped,

426
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,660
if she hadn't sent her $20 in to jail, Bob Dodge is gonna burn in hell.

427
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,640
And Bob offers a guarantee that can't be beaten.

428
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,600
Eternal salvation.

429
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,620
Or triple your money back.

430
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,340
Bob will protect you.

431
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,380
Bob is protecting the genetic future.

432
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,260
Let him. Let him into your life.

433
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,860
Let Bob protect you. He wants to protect you.

434
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,600
He must protect you. He has to protect you.

435
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,280
Jehovah One says Bob will protect you.

436
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,920
If you send a dollar to Bob.

437
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,460
My baby! My baby!

438
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,940
My baby! My baby!

439
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:38,200
My baby! My baby !

440
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,080
My baby! My baby!

441
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,660
My baby! My baby!

442
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,320
My baby! My baby!

443
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,000
My baby! My baby!

444
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,880
My baby! My baby!

445
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,780
My baby! My baby!

446
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,460
My baby! My baby!

447
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,340
My baby, my baby!

448
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,100
My baby, my baby!

449
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,500
It's not the same thing anymore.

450
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,700
Famous Doug.

451
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,740
That's another place, friends.

452
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,120
Yes, it's not the same thing anymore.

453
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,540
Where you can get those prairie squid drinks.

454
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,320
You can actually get prairie squid drinks.

455
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,280
Yeah, they put them in a blender.

456
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,580
They put them in a blender with protein powder

457
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,620
and just turn them into a really thick,

458
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,320
it's kind of like a daiquiri in texture.

459
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,640
But it's not the real prairie squid, though.

460
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,880
It's the flash frozen stuff.

461
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,540
I mean, nobody does it with a live prairie squid.

462
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,660
Praise Bob.

463
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,460
Praise Bob.

464
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,200
Well, dear friends,

465
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,420
it's time for a moment of serenity and melody.

466
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,600
Yes, if you'll turn to page five in your program,

467
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,880
I'm going to lead you in the hymn,

468
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,800
which we call Bob is My Story.

469
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,660
This is a hymn which is usually performed

470
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,620
in moments of extreme stress,

471
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,160
and such I judge this to be.

472
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,200
It's very easy, and you can support me

473
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,760
on the second verse and the chorus if you choose.

474
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,260
So we'll sing Bob is My Story.

475
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,960
Page five.

476
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,060
I saw a man with a pipe and a grin

477
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,240
All in the new morning light

478
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,820
Smiling at me like a madman to he

479
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,620
Made me a person to love me.

480
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,100
I told him don't bother me anymore

481
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,520
But he kept on just the same

482
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,680
Till I was totally brainwashed

483
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,520
Bob is his name

484
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,700
This is the chorus.

485
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,640
He is my story

486
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,060
Bob is my song

487
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,760
Bob, my amphetamine

488
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,600
All the day long

489
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:05,880
I won't tear my poster of dogs down

490
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,760
I'll feel no sadness or shame

491
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,360
Till I rejoin him in Dogstown

492
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,240
Bob is his name

493
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,620
He has no lack of his patented slack

494
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,540
For those of his following foe

495
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,980
He is the friend of whoever will send

496
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,600
Greenbacks or blacks

497
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:30,600


498
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,980
He's growing stronger and stronger

499
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,360
But he keeps redder than flame

500
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,540
I'll be a pink boy no longer

501
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,960
Bob is his name

502
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,880
Bob is my story

503
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,240
Bob is your story, friend.

504
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,540
And Bob is your fame.

505
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,640
Bob is the glands that keep you feeling the way you do.

506
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,160
Keep your squid juices pumping.

507
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,480
As they say.

508
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,120
Bob! Stop!

509
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:13,280
How many more times do we have to listen?

510
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,820
How many more times do we have to hear the worst song ever?

511
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,500
This band is terrible tonight

512
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,260
They just want to fall asleep

513
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,620
Yeah, the audience is going to be like

514
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,560
Bob's is going in every different direction possible

515
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,760
They're sick of them

516
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,680
They're sick of the Cafe Depresso

517
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,980
Yeah, they're sick of everything here

518
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,100
They only know three chords

519
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,380
But you're only gonna see them play one

520
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,660
I'm so tired of these guys

521
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,780
This band's bad

522
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,340
It's no surprise!

523
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,640
I wish they'd just pack it up and go away

524
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:12,480
Well, how many times do we have to play this same song over and over and over again?

525
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:22,680
Well, how many times do we have to play these same four notes over and over again?

526
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,640
When I came down to this nightclub

527
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,600
I thought things would be a little bit different

528
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,440
But it's just the same old band

529
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,700
In the same stupid shirts

530
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,980
In the same stupid bleeding head

531
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,680
Who think they could do something new after all these years

532
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,940
But they just play that same song

533
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,600
They just play that song all night long

534
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,060
And it just goes there and goes

535
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:02,620
Well, how many more times do we have to play this same song over and over again?

536
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,740
Beats party, beats party

537
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,480
Subjectives sick of Bob

538
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,620
Beats party, beats party

539
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,360
Well, it's one chord up, one chord down

540
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,520
Won't that music get me down?

541
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,400
I played in this band for ten hours or so

542
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,020
I ain't seen my check

543
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,240
Where's my check?

544
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,640
Where's my check?

545
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,680
Oh, where's my check?

546
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,560
Beats party, beats party

547
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:36,420
Well, how many times do we have to ask for this same check over and over again?

548
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,860
Beats party, beats party

549
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:45,840
Well, how many times do we have to play the worst song in the whole world?

550
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,440
Over and over and over and over and over and

551
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,640
Over and over again

552
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,460
Knives in the blood

553
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,320
And made one ready for a little of the old out-in, out-in

554
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,540
Leave it in when you're finished

555
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,220
Yes, this is what we do

556
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,200
Monks we are, monks of Buldada

557
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,660
And though they will not let the grass thrive here

558
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,060
Nor the trees

559
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,380
Buldada shall live

560
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:15,420
Because Buldada, having never been alive, cannot be killed

561
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,300
So in this paradox we find a pure and simple answer

562
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,480
an answer to the question of what to do tonight.

563
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Friday night?

564
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,860
Ah, yes.

565
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,900
It's Friday.

566
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,420
Yes, you can start sinning now, brother.

567
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,820
You can sin from now till Sunday morning.

568
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,940
You've got a good 48 hours of solid sinning in front of you.

569
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,040
And by God's end, after it's all over with,

570
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,560
you can sit there with a hangover in church and have it all washed away.

571
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,020
Washed away in the blood.

572
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,660
The blood of the lambs.

573
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,200
And the blood of the wolves, for that matter.

574
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,760
For is not the lamb of Jesus now being eaten by a black wolf?

575
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,500
An evil wolf?

576
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,600
A wolf of conspiracy.

577
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,140
Conspiracy, my friend.

578
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,500
A wolf that would take the good jokes of Jesus,

579
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,840
the sublime teachings of Buddha,

580
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,860
the...

581
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,640
the...

582
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,460
the small business parables of Dobbs,

583
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,300
and twist them,

584
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,860
distort them,

585
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,920
for their own aims.

586
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,240
Yes, that's the way it is now.

587
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,460
It's true.

588
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,660
There's no corpse there.

589
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,180
And lo, many...

590
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,840
elephants and rhinoceros came to destroy their huts and villages,

591
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,600
and to step on their albums.

592
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,220
And lo, the Lord was angry that they did not give their money to...

593
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:08,340
and great wrath and panic and broken guitar strings don't follow in...

594
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,800
Look at it when you take a break from listening.

595
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,000
But for now...

596
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,440
What is a rant?

597
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,180
A rant's a revival.

598
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,560
And a rant is part of a revival.

599
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,140
A rhyme is part of a revival as an atom is part of a molecule.

600
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:18,700
Yes.

601
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,580
It's when...

602
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:19,900
when...

603
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,460
when the person gets on stage and lets Bob speak through it,

604
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,420
and just cuts loose,

605
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,020
it's the...

606
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,320
the...

607
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,160
the living tongue acting on...

608
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,600
Exactly.

609
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,100
It's the undirected energy of Bob spewing forth through the human carcass.

610
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,500
We need a few of the initiates, please, to squat in the dirt and let us have their chairs.

611
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,800
Will someone help move the bodies of those stunned by the music back to the back by the beer?

612
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,540
The pile is out.

613
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:46,540


614
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:46,540


615
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:46,880
Out front.

616
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,660
No, back.

617
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,280
Excuse me.

618
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,600
And for everyone...

619
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,200
For everyone that dies tonight...

620
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,800
We're throwing them in all directions.

621
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,780
...their body is worth approximately $12 and it's falling fast.

622
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,880
Everyone that dies tonight is thrown on a cremation pile.

623
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,320
Every subgenius that is carrying his car gets a cut of that $12.

624
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,600
We need the glands for those experiments.

625
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,180
And we're talking about the foot glands.

626
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,780
We need the glands.

627
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,460
The most important one in your body next to you-know-what.

628
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:21,520
And yet, nothing could still the ranting tongues of the high priests of the subgenius.

629
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:21,780
Yeah.

630
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:35,540
No lack of material, no complete embarrassment could stop their ever-flapping, petulantly vibrating, ranting tongues from continuing... continuously speaking the word of Dobbs.

631
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:40,180
Even though no one was listening, even though their drugs had not kicked in...

632
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,980
Voices in the darkness.

633
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,180
...even though their brains had finally completely left them...

634
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:52,620
Even though their tapes had run out and had to be flipped in order to continue the lessons in...

635
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,160
Just how doctors for Bob...

636
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,820
Orphic... not your physician for Robert, none of that fancy stuff.

637
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,240
Just your straight doctors for Bob.

638
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:08,060
How they use anti-music to surgically change what was previously in your brain.

639
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,220
Oh, there went some of it.

640
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,100
Thank you.

641
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,160
He's trying to donate his...

642
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,560
He donated the sperm bank, but they wouldn't let us. Praise Bob!

643
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,300
Praise Bob!

644
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:26,140
There's people here, there's people here who, you know, can't donate to the sperm bank because they're underweight. Okay?

645
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:32,360
That's alright, let us just have just a few cells from underneath your skin so we can begin the cloning experiments.

646
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,540
Let us just have a chocolate.

647
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:38,380
I would like to clone that young lady in the front row because I know in about 14 years she'd be so cute!

648
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,480
We'd bring them up behind the Dobbs' channel.

649
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,460
Yeah, and just, you know, think you'd have a companion.

650
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,160
If you're gonna be exposed to radiation, let us just have a...

651
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:53,120
Let's go all the way, you know. If you're gonna do it, then just sit in front of a colored TV with your legs widespread watching Mr. T cartoons, and you can have a boy just like Janer!

652
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:53,780
Yeah, that's right.

653
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,720
It's in my eyes! It's in my eyes!

654
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,560
Make the tires fall off your car, I'm sorry Bob!

655
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,820
Janer's parents live next to the largest industrial waste dump.

656
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,180
It's a Janer device in the entire county.

657
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:05,460
Janer device?

658
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,240
Adam hooked up to a Janer device.

659
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,160
Janer, the perfect prince of the church speaks.

660
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,100
Some genius cheap humor. Some genius cheap humor.

661
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,040
I wasn't gonna drink today, but...

662
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:21,840
Well, since I already had this damn case, I guess I might as well do something with it.

663
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:28,440
And, well, I could take it back, but, well, they usually don't like you to do that.

664
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,820
And, well, I wouldn't want the grocery store to get mad at me.

665
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:41,100
I've, you know, I've been trying to win their bingo game, and, you know, if I take a bunch of cans back, well, they don't like that kind of thing.

666
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,060
And, you know, I could, well, I could probably just pour all the beer out of it.

667
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:50,420
But, well, that'd probably kill my grass, and I don't want to do that.

668
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:59,780
And I could trade it in for the aluminum, but it wouldn't be really worth the price of the gas driving down to the aluminum recycling plant.

669
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,760
It'd probably be worth, you know, it...

670
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:12,020
Yeah, that's what it is. I could take them in for the aluminum, you know, because if I drank them, well, they'd probably be worth more if they were just the aluminum.

671
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,100
No one, no recycling plant's gonna buy aluminum with beer.

672
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,720
I mean, I've got beer in it, so I probably would have to drink it.

673
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,260
And, well, it, you know, helps wash down my food.

674
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:33,020
And it's probably, you know, if I, you know, didn't drink any today, well, five more days from now, it'd be Sunday, and I might want some and wouldn't be able to drink any.

675
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:37,040
So at least I could say, well, hell, I got blowed off my ass last Monday.

676
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:44,940
And, you know, well, these pop-tops, well, some little kid could step on them or, you know, even though they are still full of beers.

677
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,140
And, you know, well, these pop-tops, well, some little kid could step on them or, you know, even though they are still full of beers.

678
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,340
And, well, yeah, they are in my refrigerator.

679
00:35:47,420 --> 00:36:00,360
But, you know, by some twist of the imagination, this little boy's foot could conceivably, I'm not saying that it's impossible, but it could probably come into my refrigerator.

680
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,860
And he could, you know, cut his foot open.

681
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:12,480
And, well, if he sued me or something like that, the hospital bill would be far greater than this beer is probably even worth if he did step on it.

682
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,140
And, well, that's, you know, so if I would go to the hospital, I'd be able to pay for it.

683
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:22,000
And, well, I'd be able to drink it and properly take care of the beer cap, the beer can tops.

684
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:28,040
And that'd be one less thing, one less thing on my mind that I wouldn't have to worry about.

685
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:38,440
And if I did get drunk, well, I probably wouldn't have to worry about it anyway, even though the fact that the beer can tops might be in, say, a trash can along with a beer can.

686
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,180
Oh, yeah, but, yeah, I was going to send them, take them to the recycling plant so I could get the money for them.

687
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,360
That was another reason.

688
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:51,940
And, well, you know, he's, he's, they went to all the trouble to paint the red, white, and blue Budweiser label on here.

689
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,400
And, well, I'd hate to, you know, I like to support the arts.

690
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,740
I'm a patron of the arts.

691
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,140
I'd like to, you know, support them.

692
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,560
Did you hear what he was saying?

693
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,680
Did you hear what he was saying?

694
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,360
I don't like that last sound.

695
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,340
The Lord is my God.

696
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:14,340


697
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,740
I'm a shepherd.

698
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,020
No, that won't do.

699
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,720
All right, close your eyes, please.

700
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:28,240
And repeat this prayer after me, right out loud.

701
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,820
Like this.

702
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,080
Ink, ink, ink, ink.

703
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,960
Ang, ang, ang, ang, ang.

704
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,080
Eve, meat, concrete, eel.

705
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,660
What makes us do this?

706
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,780
I don't know.

707
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,240
He tells me.

708
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,680
He never stopped.

709
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,120
I hear it's red and blue.

710
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,840
Give me a box full of them just like you.

711
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,820
I don't know what's going on.

712
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:06,980
He never stopped.

713
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,640
Well, soon in this song.

714
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,340
He never stopped.

715
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,020
Two days later, it's still going strong.

716
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:13,960
He never stopped.

717
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,660
I don't know what's going on.

718
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,540
He never stopped.

719
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,020
He never stopped.

720
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
He never stopped.

721
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,840
He never stopped.

722
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,740
He never stopped.

723
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,440
He never stopped.

724
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,740
He never stopped.

725
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:28,480
He never stopped.

726
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:28,640
He never stopped.

727
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:28,660
He never stopped.

728
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:28,680
He never stopped.

729
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,540
And then because we are Christians or Americans or something, I don't know just why, we began

730
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,760
to get conscience pains.

731
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,640
And we began to hear people say, well, don't just do something.

732
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,420
Stand there.

733
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:39,860
No.

734
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,000
We're ready for a TV.

735
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,940
He's got a rod that's about to put out.

736
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:43,940


737
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,140
We collapse into a grove when it gets cold.

738
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,240
Good Lord

739
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,140
Went to the doctor.

740
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,920
Let ago.

741
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,180
Let it go, Bob.

742
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:56,980
And I predicted our local American doctors will go on strike and be replaced by African

743
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,200
witch doctors.

744
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,380
Doctors for Bob.

745
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,400
Endocrinologists for Bob.

746
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,220
Farmers for Bob.

747
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,180
Gynecologists for Bob.

748
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,380
Kari Krishna's for Bob.

749
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,780
Illustrators for Bob.

750
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,340
Jailers for Bob.

751
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,000
Kidnappers for Bob.

752
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,620
Lawyers for Bob.

753
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,020
Mothers for Bob.

754
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,500
Neurologists for Bob.

755
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,640
The cancer pussies alive, they were in good condition.

756
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,140
We fed them once a week.

757
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,360
I didn't see why they had anything to complain about.

758
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,820
We had the neighbors look in on them while we were gone.

759
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,540
We didn't whip them hard.

760
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,060
We didn't kill them very hard.

761
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,500
I didn't see why they had any reason to sue them.

762
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,560
How was I supposed to know one of them was going to run into the fan?

763
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,580
We didn't cut her legs off hard.

764
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,760
We didn't cut her legs off hard.

765
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,400
We only cut off two of her legs.

766
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,920
She didn't really have any reason to sue.

767
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,320
When we ran over her face, it was with old tires.

768
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,920
I really didn't think she had any reason to sue with it.

769
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,700
It was a Volkswagen.

770
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:16,740
If we had run over her with a heavy car, I can understand why she had sued for that.

771
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,280
Just for throwing her into the acid pit.

772
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,060
Duel only took two livers, is what I heard.

773
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,440
He only took two.

774
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,300
He only took two.

775
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,060
He only took three kidneys.

776
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,600
I mean, I don't see how the Subgenius Foundation is responsible.

777
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:38,320
I mean, if these people want to hypnotize us into cutting their brains out with chainsaws, I mean...

778
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,500
Beach party, beach party, it never stops.

779
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,140
I'm tired of this nightclub.

780
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,620
This band is so bad.

781
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:53,840
Why do I have to pay five dollars every night to stay raw?

782
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,040
Beach party will destroy.

783
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:03,120
Well, how many times do we have to play this worst song over and over and over?

784
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,420
The biggest beach party.

785
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,260
Over again.

786
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,400
The biggest beach party.

787
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,400
Yes, it's Subgenius Bootcamp.

788
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,660
Drinking coffee and staying awake.

789
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,620
Stand up there.

790
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,300
Here, stand out in the rain and keep your weight.

791
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,500
Here, have some old Bob Cologne.

792
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,900
If you call yourself a subgenius coming to drill with a beard, that's two demerits.

793
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,480
All right, Mr. Hughes.

794
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:21,540
Okay, boy.

795
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,420
Three more demerits and I'll get that new baseball glove.

796
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,220
Look at the knees of your uniform pants.

797
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:25,880
That's disgusting.

798
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,940
I'm docking you five more demerits, Mr. Hughes.

799
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,320
Oh, gosh, gosh, get a new car.

800
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,000
What are you smiling about?

801
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,680
Order me that six more demerits.

802
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,900
And this shall be until the twins come,

803
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,560
for Nietzsche's only half of the split gods,

804
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,880
the ex-god, which is Loki,

805
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,060
and Nietzsche, which is the eunuch of the gods,

806
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:48,700
and the trickster.

807
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,860
He is my true son and finger.

808
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,380
We will split until then,

809
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,760
and we shall come back home and show the odds.

810
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,940
I'm going to have to go to bed.

811
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,800
I'm going to have to go to bed.

812
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,920
Don't just eat it.

813
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,760
Eat the hell out of it.

814
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,820
I'm going to have to go to bed.

815
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,060
I'm going to kill you guys on the island.

816
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,680
Not tonight, Wally.

817
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,440
A good deal is in the wallet of the beholder.

818
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,680
I'll tell you this.

819
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:11,780
Knowledge of birds,

820
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,880
patient of the millions,

821
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,840
not at the sun.

822
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,540
Extremism is the best thing.

823
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,860
I'm going to show you more than I can.

824
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,840
Through my discipline and my music and triumph.

825
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,340
I'll holler at your bride, Eve,

826
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,700
with the rhymes of the hymns.

827
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,480
And the world will say that this is unclean

828
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,860
and shall be moved to perdition.

829
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,940
The divine king will be killed in the closet

830
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,080
by his own crowns.

831
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,400
Darkness will fall.

832
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,340
The Philistines will reign.

833
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,680
If you ask us to,

834
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,260
the world is a space of human being

835
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,380
with every soul,

836
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,980
and our minds and our souls

837
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,340
shall be all stirred up together.

838
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,420
The emmits will be made to flash

839
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,720
and the high plains will be down.

840
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,840
And that's what I want to talk to you about.

841
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,400
The voice of the prophet shall be unseen

842
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,860
from the mouths of the innocent.

843
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,920
Do you even know what you're really thinking?

844
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,720
You think I know what you're thinking?

845
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,160
My head signs show to be another.

846
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,120
And this shall come in the source of all knowledge

847
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,920
which is likened to a book of the score.

848
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,260
It's all I've known relatively long.

849
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,880
And it's growing everywhere like a vine.

850
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,300
It shall receive the sacrament from the angels,

851
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,000
our bodies which preserve the rights of heaven.

852
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,500
It shall tell all our relatives

853
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,840
that we might well be right.

854
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,740
While the number of the stars in the hour is wide,

855
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,600
the time of the hour is less.

856
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,900
I can't forgive myself for telling you this,

857
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,000
especially when you don't know me.

858
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:21,640
You can't tell me.

859
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,120
I'm a part of the universe.

860
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,540
I'm not a part of the universe.

861
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,060
I'm not a part of the universe.

862
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,300
I'm not a part of the universe.

863
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:29,440
I'm not a part of the universe.

864
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,220
If you want to be known as an original,

865
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,120
you let it be,

866
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,400
and make sure you understand the right people.

867
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,060
The Google Hymn.

868
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,660
This is a hymn dedicated to the grinning,

869
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:51,500
giggling,

870
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,860
monkey guru.

871
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,180
Now, this is bliss consciousness.

872
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,320
Now, we have the roots of the tree.

873
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,280
This is the trunk of the tree.

874
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,820
These are the branches of the tree with the pretty leaves.

875
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,080
Now, in order to get bliss consciousness,

876
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,500
we must water the roots of the tree.

877
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,940
When the roots are watered,

878
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,960
the bliss rises up the trunk of the tree

879
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,480
into the branches of the tree.

880
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:21,820
When the roots are watered,

881
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,160
the tree rises up the trunk of the tree into the leaves.

882
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,840
When this happens, we have bliss consciousness.

883
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,360
Now, bliss consciousness is something that your mother will approve of.

884
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,820
Unlike sex and other said things,

885
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,060
this fits right on in with her.

886
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,800
She loves bliss consciousness.

887
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,420
Uh, pig.

888
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:42,940
Pig.

889
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,480
There is a happy land far, far away

890
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,180
Where little piggies grow

891
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,880
Three times a day

892
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,500
Oh, you should see them run

893
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,560
When they see the butcher come

894
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,820
Two cut slices off their bum

895
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:02,300
Three times a day

896
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,000
This is dedicated to peace consciousness.

897
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,180
Israel Regardie there, friends.

898
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:29,380
Doctors for me, doctors for you, doctors for me, doctors for the mind, doctors for the end of time.

899
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:38,880
Doctors for Wotan, doctors for Wotan, doctors for Wotan.

900
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:40,900
You have the student control.

901
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,220
Yes.

902
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,380
Your mind is no longer your own.

903
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,360
I have no mind.

904
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,820
My mind is not my mind.

905
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:59,580
Cast off the imperial brains of normalcy.

906
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,480
Because you want to, I do what I do, because Bob told me to.

907
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,680
You do what you do, because you want to.

908
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:12,080
I do what I do, because Bob told me to.

909
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,480
You do what you do, because you want to.

910
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,880
I do what I do, because Bob told me to.

911
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,500
I do what I do, because I want to.

912
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,580
Now that you've seen what you've seen,

913
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,840
will you be with us in the saucers on X-Day?

914
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,980
Or instead will you be left crawling through the glowing rubble, a doubter to the end?

915
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:40,040
In the sweet name of Bob, you must be saved, even if it kills you.

916
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,680
And of course, you know, it was after that they picked me up and they said, you're crazy.

917
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,440
You're crazy, Jimmy.

918
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,480
You've got to go in and relax and just settle down.

919
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,720
And they say, there's something wrong with the chemicals in your brain.

920
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,260
That's what they said.

921
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,800
I say, it ain't the chemicals, you understand?

922
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,140
It ain't the chemicals, it's the minerals.

923
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:04,600
It's true.

924
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,360
It's true.

925
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:05,360


926
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:05,360


927
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:05,360


928
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:05,860
The pills work.

929
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,360
Your boy is a genius.

930
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:08,760
Tensile.

931
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,940
Even though we're leaving the air at this time, you may still phone in any prayer request

932
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,780
you may have by calling 331-

933
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,920
Digital counter on the wall, Reverend Stain.

934
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,280
Yes.

935
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:18,760
And we're going to be going down.

936
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,200
We've got three minutes left.

937
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,100
Three minutes of slack time, friends.

938
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:27,000
And I could play some Burblin background noise or I could play the official sign-off tunes

939
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,860
and so forth, but-

940
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,520
We could just talk for another three minutes.

941
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:30,600
Easily.

942
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,100
Easily.

943
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,180
Easily, yeah.

944
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,000
We could talk for another three hours, friends.

945
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:37,320
Or three days, if that's what it takes to get you to write to that sacred post office box.

946
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:42,480
You've been hearing the learned old scholars of the Church of the Subgenius Society tonight.

947
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,340
That's right.

948
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,860
And learned we are in the dark knowledge and forbidden sciences

949
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,040
of time control, slack extraction.

950
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,580
And the arcane secrets of the prairie squid.

951
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,380
Friends, are you going to put up with what the gland owners are laying down on you?

952
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:04,040
I want you to either stand up or shut up, baby.

953
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,440
Praise Bob.

954
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:09,180
You've got to hip out to it or die trying not to.

955
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,100
Or just kill me.

956
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,460
.

957
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:12,460


958
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,300
.

959
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:13,600
.

960
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:13,780
.

961
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:13,780


962
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,720
What-

963
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,960
And think to yourself, there's no place like home.

964
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,120
There's no place like home-

965
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:34,420
All right.

966
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,840
We're pretty sure that he's a psychopath now.

967
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,120
How do we spot him?

968
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,780
Well, I hope he's wearing a Napoleon hat.

969
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,200
It's easy.

970
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,560
Otherwise they come in all sizes and shapes.

971
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,440
11 year old girls to 80 year old men.

972
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,120
They all look perfectly normal.

973
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:56,020
I keep telling y'all this is a sick and perverted nation.

974
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,420
All tired.

975
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,500
Nobody wants to listen to me.

976
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,140
Nobody wants to hear about Bob.

977
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:04,920
Nobody...

978
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:09,640
I try to tell everybody what's going on, they won't listen to me.

979
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,520
Well, to tell you the truth, I can't stand it anymore.

980
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:24,160
Hi everybody, I'm Andy Oakley and you're right on target for another session of the Gun Show.

981
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:30,700
It's the election year game that lets legislators from all over America say good things about guns

982
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,980
as they try to get votes and score a bullseye with our sharp shooting panel.

983
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,120
And who's tonight's first target?

984
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,620
Our first target tonight, Andy, is a state senator from Vermont.

985
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,160
Rockhead, New Hampshire, let's have a salvo of applause for Harry Bolt.

986
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:49,140
My fellow voters, nobody in this country admires firearms more than I do.

987
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,140
Every American ought to have four or five.

988
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,700
I've got a 12 gauge in the living room, a 2.38 in the den, 30.30 in my car,

989
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,920
and as you can see, I'm carrying a 4.2 inch mortar.

990
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,060
Now, put your hands up and don't try any funny business.

991
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,220
Whoopee! Hey, we got a great reaction from our panel on that one.

992
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,620
And who's our next contestant?

993
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,620
Andy, our next target from Milmauce, New Mexico, a congressman who's always been a fan of the show.

994
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,680
Also a minister of the First Church of Self-Defense.

995
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,420
Let's welcome Morris Mackley.

996
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,160
Fire away, Reverend Mackley.

997
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:16,840
Thank you.

998
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:23,080
I'd like to show you all a beautiful full-color picture of our Lord wearing a .357 Magnum and a hand-tooled holster.

999
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,780
And remember, guns are a gift from God.

1000
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,400
Bullseye, Reverend Mackley.

1001
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,260
You're going to be tough to beat this election year.

1002
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,600
And let's get to our final contestant on the firing line.

1003
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,160
From San Francisco, California, let's hear it for Congressman Willard Wendt.

1004
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,460
Welcome, Willard. And what good things can you say about guns?

1005
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,640
Well, I don't own a gun.

1006
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,900
And I don't particularly like people who do own them.

1007
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:47,340
Whoa!

1008
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:54,240
Willard, that's our warning buzzer. You've got just ten seconds more to say something good about guns.

1009
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,080
And remember, our panelists are all crack shots.

1010
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,660
Well, I guess guns are all right in their place.

1011
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,480
I'm not sure that's enough, Willard. You've got just five seconds more.

1012
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,140
I think we ought to register firearms. That's... Whoa!

1013
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:07,980
Hey, everybody!

1014
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,900
Everybody's stocked!

1015
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,880
That's some great shooting, panel!

1016
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,140
And that's all we have time for on The Gun Show.

1017
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,520
The Gun Show's been brought to you by Bang! Bothered Americans Needing Guns.

1018
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,820
I'm your host, Andy Oakley.

1019
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,960
We'll be back right before the Illinois primary.

1020
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,320
And in the meantime, remember, a gun is like a good friend.

1021
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,380
Treat it right, and it won't kill you.

1022
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,880
Five dollars and...

1023
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,980
We're into the...

1024
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:36,000
...a good separate prayer partner and your personal friend.

1025
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,960
In the next 13 minutes...

1026
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,160
...or 14 minutes...

1027
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,480
...something good, good, good is coming your way.

1028
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,140
So don't leave this radio station. Let's have a good time together.

1029
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,960
He's all I need.

1030
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,200
He's all I need.

1031
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,460
Ah, yeah.

1032
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:03,320
Thank God I'm a man.

1033
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:18,200
Remember, that's Bob at Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1034
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:19,980
Yeah!

1035
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:32,580
Skip around in a circle, skip around in a circle, and you'll fall down.

1036
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,020
Yeah!

1037
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:33,320
There we go!

1038
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,540
I don't want this anger burning in me.

1039
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:46,780
It's something for which it's so hard to be free.

1040
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,940
Another two years of glory and sorrow away.

1041
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:01,200
Making a difference, I've turned back the page.

1042
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,740
I'm gonna be dead.

1043
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,780
I'm gonna be dead.

1044
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,740
I'm gonna be dead.

1045
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:16,460
I'm gonna be dead.

1046
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,940
That's when it's my day.

1047
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,060
So stay tuned.

1048
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,720
Don't forget to write Bobby for that free information.

1049
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,680
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

1050
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,320
Let it go, Bob.

1051
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:42,520
I told you, I want to see Dr. Bold, I read Gypsy Doctor.

1052
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:47,660
Wait a minute, is that Dr. Repeat, I read Gypsy Doctor.

1053
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:52,020
Doctors saying, are you, in fact, a doctor for Bob?

1054
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,580
I'm a healer, I'm a surgeon.

1055
00:53:54,660 --> 00:54:01,300
I've got knives, scalpels, gas, pills, anesthetics, and musical instruments.

1056
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,260
I don't know how to play.

1057
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,340
I am a doctor.

1058
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,420
A doctor for Bob?

1059
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,300
We bring him back to life and then we kill him again.

1060
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,240
I went and seen myself a doctor.

1061
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,580
And he gave me a great big bottle.

1062
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,980
Don't take them, they'll kill you.

1063
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,360
Throw the poison pills away, pile.

1064
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,440
It's probably time for a little stimulation there, cadet.

1065
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,540
So why not get up and move a little?

1066
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,980
Comedy is comedy, but some rhythm tossed in can do anything but help.

1067
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,040
Let it go, Bob.

1068
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,240
Whoa, Bob.

1069
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,240


1070
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,240


1071
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,240


1072
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,240


1073
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,240


1074
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,240


1075
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,240


1076
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,240


1077
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,240


1078
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,240


1079
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,240


1080
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,240


1081
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,240


1082
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:35,900
They say the bigger the headache, the bigger the pill, baby.

1083
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,100
Call me the big pill.

1084
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:45,440
We're here to make up the 4K Jam with the Club Network Chicago, and I'd like to know,

1085
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:49,720
Saint Sulak of the Hog Butchers of the West, are you a doctor for Bob?

1086
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,820
I am.

1087
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,000
This is beginning a new life for me.

1088
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:57,720
As the Saint of the Hog Butchers of the West, as a new man, I'm free.

1089
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,800
I'm free.

1090
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:01,120
Yes, and are you a doctor for Bob?

1091
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:01,380
Yes, I'm free.

1092
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,120
I'm free.

1093
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,220


1094
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,220


1095
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,220


1096
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,220


1097
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,220


1098
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,220


1099
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,220


1100
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,220


1101
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,220


1102
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,220


1103
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,220


1104
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,220


1105
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,220


1106
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,660
The doctor has proved that I am free.

1107
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,100
Only a doctor for Bob can be free.

1108
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,920
And only for Bob.

1109
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,320
I do what I do.

1110
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,740
Because Bob told me to.

1111
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:22,380
No, I don't believe the charges of brainwashing diabetics and ludicrous children like you.

1112
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,360
Bob told me to.

1113
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,220
You do what you do because you want to.

1114
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:32,140
You don't use such techniques as brainwashing by, what, what I mean, brain surgery.

1115
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:32,200
No, I don't use such things like brainwashing the most我們 пред会做.

1116
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,780
But you, can you walk?

1117
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:34,560
Two!

1118
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:41,600
From the soles of my feet to the tippy-tips of my ears, I am a doctor for Bob.

1119
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:51,160
And let me say that prior to this moment, I had the least ability to understand a doctor for Bob of any subgenius in the church.

1120
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:56,300
But tonight, with our heart and soul in a nation experiment, seeing such a success,

1121
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:01,820
I truly feel that I am for the first time a true doctor for Bob.

1122
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,900
But Bobby's bigger than I.

1123
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,420
Uh-oh, I think he's caught a doctor giving something for his cough.

1124
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,660
All right, all right. Here's a quarter.

1125
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,220
Oh, that's not much.

1126
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,180
Not much of a cough.

1127
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,540
Well, thanks, Douglas. I'll take over.

1128
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,240
It's all right. You'll be yourself again in a minute.

1129
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,260
I'm... I'm so sorry, everybody.

1130
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,440
Now you just drink this.

1131
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,280
Are you a doctor for Bob?

1132
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,880
I don't feel well.

1133
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,660
What's the matter with you?

1134
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:34,720
Oh, I don't know. I was the doctor, and he told me what to do, but I didn't do it.

1135
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:39,560
He said to take one pill three times a day, but you can't do that.

1136
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,820
I think I'd rather die than do that.

1137
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:52,080
Man, it's a gas.

1138
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,760
I figure, you know,

1139
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,280
some of those roaches, they put in the air,

1140
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:56,780
they put out in grass,

1141
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,500
and a glass of acid will put you on the moon in an hour.

1142
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,660
But reality, that's where it's happening.

1143
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:02,760
What?

1144
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,200
What's the use of pretending?

1145
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,480
I can't stand this anymore.

1146
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:09,840
Doctor, please.

1147
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,000
Please, doctor.

1148
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,020
Chandler said you went over to Georgia Street to see that doctor.

1149
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,440
Yeah, that's right, Ed. Short visit.

1150
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,460
Poor guy. Pretty bad, huh?

1151
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,760
Well, the guy's really a mess.

1152
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,300
The beatin' it walked up to the epileptics and said,

1153
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:23,500
Oh!

1154
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,500
I don't hear the music,

1155
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,040
but go, baby, go!

1156
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,020
Here's my million dollars.

1157
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,200
Bob's Beach Party.

1158
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,820
One dollar.

1159
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,660
Is that one dollar?

1160
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,240
For hours.

1161
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,520
Bob's Beach Party.

1162
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,400
Subgenius Beach Party.

1163
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,540
Is that all I gotta do?

1164
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,420
Subgenius Beach Party.

1165
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,760
Great combination, isn't it, Joe?

1166
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:53,620
What's that?

1167
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:56,080
An armful of narcotics and a loaded gun?

1168
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,780
Let her go, Bob.

1169
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,540
Boy, did we get high.

1170
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,500
Yes, sirree.

1171
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,740
We sure got relaxed.

1172
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:12,400
A physician must determine if tendon repair is our need.

1173
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:12,800
There it is.

1174
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,400
The blood pressure is the worst for me.

1175
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,440
The blood pressure is growing.

1176
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,900
It's growing even now as you speak.

1177
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,560
The blood pressure is the worst for me.

1178
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,600
But if the chief ever caught you,

1179
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,540
if he caught me taking these pills,

1180
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,840
he'd snap my head off.

1181
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,420
Here, try one of mine.

1182
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,000
Oh, yeah?

1183
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,440
Yeah, the chief himself's been on these for a week,

1184
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,580
and he's a changed man.

1185
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,860
A favorite area for clairvoyance

1186
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:37,300
has always been in the field of science and medicine.

1187
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,660
What's your trouble, young man?

1188
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,920
The Venusian gook rod, doctor.

1189
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:45,960
Now, see here, young man, my time is valuable.

1190
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:49,820
Doctor, this is a medical emergency.

1191
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,140
I hope you like that nonsense.

1192
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,500
I try to make the audience a part of the entertainment,

1193
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,700
and they go along with it all just great.

1194
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,620
That chatter with the doctor is no phony bit, really.

1195
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,980
It's just the way it happens.

1196
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,620
You'll have to make it in one night when you're down Florida way.

1197
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,840
All right, nurse, bring the next patient in.

1198
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,400
Get up on this table.

1199
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,620
Pull off that gown.

1200
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:19,800


1201
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,020
Raise up that right leg.

1202
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,380
Let that left one down.

1203
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:27,380
Pull off them stockings, that silk underwear.

1204
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:32,020
The doctor's got to cut you, mama, God knows where.

1205
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,160
Internal, inner, non-existent, void particles.

1206
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,680
You can send negro-influenced voice wave,

1207
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,260
tap-shoe disc patterns.

1208
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,760
You can send us cow vomit,

1209
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,200
tooth broken,

1210
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:48,800
11-year-old,

1211
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,160
11-gated, elongated,

1212
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,040
creation-oriented,

1213
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,820
speared gum,

1214
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,460
restaurant scars.

1215
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,500
You can send us niki,

1216
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,560
Don't look at me that way, Douglas.

1217
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:06,220
You're mad.

1218
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,960
Don't be frightened, Douglas.

1219
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,060
You're about to see what service you require.

1220
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,060
Give me Dr. Rowe!
