1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,160
Con radio, we are receiving flash traffic, emergency action message, recommend alert one, recommend alert one.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,760
Alert one, alert one.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,340
Con radio, receiving emergency action message, recommend alert one, recommend alert one.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,660
Alert one, okay.

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,720
Alert one, incoming emergency action message.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,580
Alert one, it's authorized.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,380
Alert one, incoming EAM.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,020
You can watch.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,100
Test, test.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,280
Radio, radio antenna.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:29,500
Radio antenna.

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,660
Where's the BLF antenna?

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,020
Aye, sir.

14
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,020
That's it.

15
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,680
It's working.

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,160
I'm here, too.

17
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,100
Just because I rocked doesn't mean I made a stone.

18
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,380
I feel your fear.

19
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,740
It's coming through like static on my heart radio.

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,400
I'm here, too.

21
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:59,260
I'm here, too.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
I can do anything.

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,220
Excuse me.

24
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:02,700
Just in case.

25
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:12,820
But like, I'm just going to do this.

26
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:12,840
Believe me.

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,940
There's a massive yearly много period on principle.

28
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:14,940


29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:14,940


30
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:16,840
Yes, Parral Works ERAO.

31
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:16,840


32
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:16,840


33
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,680
Are we getting somewhere here taking a shot at animal role?

34
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,060
I'd really appreciate produced by Adam Gilroy, the village head of the United States,

35
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,140
Under the Why Are You There.

36
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,480
But if that was chocolate and ice cream, you got a permission to spin a jar.

37
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,780
Come on, I've already given you a jar.

38
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,260
She'd still gottan some average baseball cap.

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,000
loud voice.

40
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,240
Call now for fat body that will be yours forever.

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,440
Call now for a lean, fat-free major credit card.

42
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,820
By far the most common bird in the swamp is the white blackbirds, but the forests are

43
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,100
full of hawks, warblers, and cutlers, blacklers, and cutlers.

44
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,760
Hello there.

45
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:01,360
All of you have heard of mail order obscenity for your entire family.

46
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:08,140
I'd like to begin with a flood tide of second-class filth in a depraved manner.

47
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:16,560
An illustrated, detailed course in pornographic perversion, threatening to pervert an entire

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,600
generation of our wild, flagrant Harvard sociologists.

49
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,380
The United States Supreme Court has described it as,

50
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,400
dirt for dirt's sake.

51
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,700
We describe it as dirt for money's sake.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,520
The Self-Genius Hour of Slavery.

53
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:43,200
In the past few years, this depraved filth has become increasingly worse, not only in

54
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,580
content, but in volume, for one reason.

55
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,880
It is big business, profitable business, for the mercenary perverts.

56
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,380
I swore I would never sing again.

57
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:03,800
Through this material, today's sadists, masochists, psychiatrists, sociologists, and psychologists,

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,800
the military chaplains association of the United States, and every other kind of deviant

59
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,040
can be stimulated to acht for which he has no legitimate outlet.

60
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:24,020
This moral decay weakens our resistance to the onslaught of the communist masters of

61
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,100
law.

62
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,100


63
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,100


64
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,100


65
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,760
A bizarre but evil misfit pervert cults.

66
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,920
Highly colorful contaminated hardcore human buttocks in a perverted manner.

67
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:42,400
And thus the grotesque rubber cigarette for the participant until his utter depravity is complete.

68
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:50,680
Remember, support the obscenity racketeers by writing to Cincinnati, Ohio.

69
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,900
Hey, I got a question for you.

70
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,600
This is insane.

71
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,240
Well, that's the power of cult.

72
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,020
Power of cult.

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,520
Wow.

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,320
See, we want to expose ourselves, create a limited life, and...

75
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,260
People are horrible and...

76
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,740
Crazy.

77
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,480
I would tend to agree with you.

78
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:12,860
Hmm.

79
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,720
It's nothing.

80
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,180
It's nothing.

81
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,100
Maybe fear is just F-E-A-R.

82
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,160
But first, here's a mighty swell gang.

83
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,060
You'll want to spread the news around that you're collecting those slick new friends.

84
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,680
Because that's the only way they'll trade duplicates with them.

85
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,940
And you won't want to miss out on that fun.

86
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,220
You want to be sure you'll round out your collection of all 18 different friends.

87
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,580
Like Smitty and K.O. and Herbie, of course.

88
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,440
And the best part is, you don't have to ask Mom.

89
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,720
Remember, that's P.P.

90
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,620
P.P.

91
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,160
P.P.

92
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,380
P.P.

93
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:51,380


94
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:51,380


95
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,880
P.P.

96
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,380
P.P.

97
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:52,380


98
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:52,380


99
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:52,380


100
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:52,380


101
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:52,620
P.P.

102
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:52,780
P.P.

103
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,000
P.P.

104
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,220
P.P.

105
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,780
P.P.

106
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,500
P.P.

107
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,080
P.P.

108
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,380
P.P.

109
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:56,480
P.P.

110
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:56,480


111
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


112
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


113
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


114
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


115
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


117
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


118
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


120
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


121
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


122
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


123
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


124
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


125
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


126
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


127
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


128
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


129
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


130
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


131
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


132
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


133
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


134
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,560


135
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,660
Hi, this is Dr. J.

136
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,620
Are you tired?

137
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,440
Do you sometimes feel?

138
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,180
Now you've got it.

139
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,000
Why go through life when you can use anyone, anyone, and get anyone, and get anyone, to do anyone, and feel powerless again?

140
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,260
You'll be able to use calm.

141
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,320
Greatest weapon on some people.

142
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,700
Anyone.

143
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,360
Any place.

144
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:08,780
Anytime.

145
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,020
Imagine if you were able to predict and control calm.

146
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,300
Perhaps you wanted to make a good impression.

147
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:12,620
So.

148
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:12,940
So.

149
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,740
Feel powerless again.

150
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,100
Psych.

151
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,240
Psych.

152
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,420
Psych.

153
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:14,600
Psych.

154
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:14,760
Psych.

155
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:14,880
Psych.

156
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:14,980
Psych.

157
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,380
While that seems as if it would be so, sometimes it can be hard.

158
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,240
We feel good when we were unaware of the process.

159
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,160
Pleasurable stimuli.

160
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,020
Have a stomachache.

161
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:21,840
Unconscious victims.

162
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,820
Repeat exposure.

163
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,020
You will actually grow.

164
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,200
How annoying it is.

165
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,360
Someone has one hand in his pocket.

166
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,320
You put your hand in his pocket.

167
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,540
Why?

168
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,020
Why?

169
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,920
But wait a minute.

170
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,560
Why'd you do it?

171
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:29,920
So.

172
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,360
So.

173
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,280
Heightened arousal.

174
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,880
Unstoppable overall strategy.

175
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,900
Arousal is high.

176
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,100
Excitement aroused.

177
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,020
Arousal arousal.

178
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,060
Arousal was high.

179
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:37,780
Flexibility.

180
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,280
Flexibility.

181
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,300
Your own beauty is limited.

182
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,960
A pack of lies.

183
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,600
Conundrum.

184
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,580
What does all this mean?

185
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,240
You think.

186
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:42,620
You think.

187
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,460
What does all this mean?

188
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:43,860
Long.

189
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,760
Boring.

190
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,420
And finally.

191
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,060
Set yourself up as better than the rest.

192
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:47,760
Simplicity.

193
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,980
Your ideas are muddled.

194
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,380
Finally.

195
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,520
But how small you are.

196
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,340
Feel unimportant?

197
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,180
Once there was a boy down south.

198
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,820
Always had snot running across his mouth.

199
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,400
What's that mess boy the neighbors would say?

200
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,020
Why is that snot on your face that way?

201
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,300
Why is that snot on your face that way?

202
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,560
Snot on tweedle.

203
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,720
Snot on tweedle.

204
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,300
Snot on tweedle all day.

205
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,240
Mama sent him to the grocery store.

206
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,160
Let's go grocery.

207
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,860
Asked him to buy three eggs times four.

208
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,460
Run back home for the grocery man say.

209
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,140
Why is that snot on your face that way?

210
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,280
Snot on tweedle.

211
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,640
Snot on tweedle.

212
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,780
Snot on tweedle.

213
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,060
Snot on tweedle.

214
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,800
Snot on tweedle.

215
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,780
Snot on tweedle all day.

216
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,200
Mama sent him to the grocery store.

217
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,180
What's that mess boy?

218
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:12,740
Honestly looking very cheap.

219
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,560
Whenever I look over at a flex of his clothes.

220
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,040
A total NeedProVolume portion goodbye.

221
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,980
Soon this boy,

222
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,860
became a man.

223
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,240
And oh hello.

224
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,300
His mom and I Nein.

225
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,300


226
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,020
λη

227
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,260
Wanted to know the master plan

228
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,640
So to the Lord he did say

229
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,700
Hey God, why is this snout on my face this way?

230
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,020
Huh? Hey God, God why do I have this snout all over my face like this, God?

231
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,400
Huh? Hey God, why is this snout on my face like this, God?

232
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,800
Huh? Why is this snout on my face this way, God?

233
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,400
Snout Mouth Tweedle all this day

234
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,540
All this day

235
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:41,040
Hey friends, welcome to Hour of Slack number 1067

236
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,980
Is that it? Where's my background music? That's funny

237
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,780
Oh, oh wait, I see why, I see where it is

238
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,120
Look at that, it was on number three, not number one

239
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,620
Ah, there we go

240
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,760
Snout Mouth Tweedle

241
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,380
Snout Mouth Tweedle

242
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:04,520
A composition by the great Joe Newman of the Rudy Schwartz Project

243
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,480
And you can find information about the CDs of the Rudy Schwartz Project

244
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,700
At www.schwartztone.com

245
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,680
Yes, this is Stephen Kent in the background

246
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,000
Yes, this is Stephen Kent in the background

247
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000


248
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,720
On his didge

249
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,500
We met him at Starwood

250
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,200
We just got back from, last week was the devotional

251
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,620
We're not going to be bombarding you with Devo music tonight though

252
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,100
But that was a great devotional

253
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,220
It was a great devotional with Deva

254
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,260
Yeah, Deva, the devastating female Devos

255
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,820
The stupefyingly devastating Deva

256
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,020
And friends, oh yes, and the rest of what we've heard

257
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,760
The cut-ups were by the great subgenius collage artists

258
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,340
Nor Elpref and Mr. Fernandanande Lee Murr

259
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,600
They do not work together, by the way

260
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,200
It's just that I play their stuff all the time

261
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,460
And our new intro was by Popes Lilith

262
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,780
The scary new intro

263
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,580
So, but we...

264
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,120
I actually have subgenius news to catch you up upon this time

265
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,400
Now, this most important thing was something that was faxed

266
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,740
This came to my fax machine

267
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:39,140
And it spewed out as two handwritten pages

268
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,920
And I'm going to try to read this the way that it came out on my fax machine

269
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,100
It was addressed in handwritten to

270
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,560
The owner of the company, number one, subgenius foundation

271
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,420
Special report, urgent, top secret

272
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,500
And I'm going to withhold this fellow's name

273
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,540
But he said this

274
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,640
People are in danger by people that have robotic communication lasers

275
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,900
In laborator research

276
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,820
I was planted a zo chip by person that has experience

277
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,980
With different kind of lasers

278
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,440
Everybody part has a chip

279
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,000
They torture people in different areas

280
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,000
And seal your information

281
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,100
By reading everything you did by recording your life history

282
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,140
This is no joke

283
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,060
If I don't receive within 24 hours a call or letter

284
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,600
I will go on national television

285
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,620
And it will hurt the movie that is going to come out soon

286
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,940
I can prove it

287
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,140
And have evidence that you know

288
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,260
By understanding how I know what it is

289
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,220
By looking at my body with MRI

290
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,840
To show the things...

291
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,060
People do with computer

292
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,260
And using frequencies radios

293
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,720
To torture people

294
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,300
I've been to sacramental

295
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,820
And have pictures of my body badly bruised

296
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,780
That look purple in the midsection

297
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,280
Take this serious

298
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,360
And help remove the implant

299
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,820
I know how to find these people

300
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,440
Will explain when you call this number

301
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,540
Day or night

302
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,660
Need your help to stop these robotic communication people

303
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,080
It will hurt your...

304
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,520
You...

305
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,000
You know the whole system

306
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,500
I compared all four pieces...

307
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:25,500


308
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:25,500


309
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:25,500


310
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,520
The â¶ă's who played the black copy

311
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:44,800
Didn't know how to do it

312
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:44,800


313
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:44,800


314
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,720
There's not a si dungeons

315
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,320
And in place of a fairytale

316
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,500
More advanced

317
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:51,500


318
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:51,500


319
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,820
a John Stewart type comedian

320
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,900
who gets elected president

321
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,860
and his name is Dobbs.

322
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,480
Dobbs.

323
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,860
So the people,

324
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,720
when they,

325
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,980
certain kinds of people

326
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,580
see the ads for this movie

327
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,180
with President Dobbs,

328
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,200
they assume that,

329
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,500
well, we're behind it.

330
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,720
As well they should

331
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,680
because you don't know

332
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,440
that we're not.

333
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,440
Anyway, I just thought

334
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,940
that was pretty important information

335
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,560
about the Zo chips

336
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,000
and people's bodies

337
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,540
and having been to Sacramento

338
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,840
and all of that.

339
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,820
Yes, kind of sobering, isn't it?

340
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,340
Yeah.

341
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,740
I guess that's a strange way to put it.

342
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,480
Let's see.

343
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,780
What other news?

344
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,820
Oh, the new Quijibo is out.

345
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,200
Quijibo is a subgenius magazine.

346
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,700
I will tell you the address

347
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,360
to write to for information

348
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,880
about this fine publication.

349
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,540
It's the,

350
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,300
the only really regular subgenius magazine,

351
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,160
but it's a big hefty,

352
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,140
this one here weighs in at 23 pages

353
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,880
and it has a good number.

354
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,300
This number 30,

355
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,740
it's the Quijibo adult library

356
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,140
and he,

357
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,340
he,

358
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,960
it's titled instead of regular Quijibo,

359
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,520
it's called

360
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,460
The Southpaw Self-Pleasure.

361
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,220
He was a right-handed man

362
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,080
surrounded by nubile willing women,

363
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,340
but only his left hand

364
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:20,540
could.

365
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,660
He could bring him satisfaction.

366
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,060
Oh, Princess,

367
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,920
we were joining in on this.

368
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,820
Anyway, this,

369
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,780
this magazine,

370
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,100
I wanted to share with you

371
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,500
some of the interesting articles in it.

372
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,480
There's,

373
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,020
here's something called

374
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,480
Diswhiskeylexia

375
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,880
by the editor,

376
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,320
Reverend Christopher Lee,

377
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,020
who is the famous movie star,

378
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,220
biggest moneymaker of last year.

379
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,740
Here he is holding a Pope Pero

380
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,860
mug of,

381
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,620
and oh,

382
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,320
the night,

383
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:53,940
boys,

384
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,060
you'll be interested to know

385
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,640
that Quijibo magazine

386
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,880
always has a page three girl.

387
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,040
Page three girl in this issue

388
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,060
is Pope,

389
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,740
Priestess Pisces.

390
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,420
Let me tell you,

391
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,080
I'm fully hetero,

392
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,760
but I'm,

393
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,180
I mean,

394
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,560
this is really hot.

395
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,320
Well,

396
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,120
she's showing off her cleavage

397
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,860
and her little tongue barbs

398
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,380
and all that,

399
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,380
that stuff.

400
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,720
These modern day kids,

401
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,160
I don't think.

402
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,900
Mere hume words

403
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,380
cannot describe her yumminess.

404
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,620
Praise,

405
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,980
Priestess of Pisces,

406
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,200
the Queen of Wank.

407
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,120
And that's literally true.

408
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,880
Pisces' ministry

409
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,920
is based on

410
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,080
slack through wanking.

411
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,620
Yes.

412
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,440
She's a very outspoken

413
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:33,820
wankist.

414
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,200
one might say,

415
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,040
pro-wanker.

416
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:38,620
Oh,

417
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,600
there's some information

418
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,840
about Bigfoot news

419
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,260
has been gripping Malaysia.

420
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,280
And this is true news

421
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,660
from

422
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,820
apparently

423
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,060
a 10 foot tall

424
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,380
ape.

425
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,360
Ape.

426
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,820
They like to call

427
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,960
yetis apes

428
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,540
was cited

429
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,020
in this national park,

430
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,080
which of course

431
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,260
has caused a lot more people

432
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,680
to come to that national park.

433
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,740
Yes,

434
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,860
this is no news

435
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,520
of the weird here.

436
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,140
This is Reuters 2006.

437
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:03,900
Right.

438
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,340
Well,

439
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,060
it's still,

440
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,420
you know,

441
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,160
the fact that they,

442
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,200
the fact that they call

443
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,000
our cousins

444
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,260
the yetis

445
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,640
ape men

446
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,500
and so forth.

447
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,060
Anyway,

448
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:13,540
there's,

449
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,460
this issue has some,

450
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,580
some excellent

451
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,840
rantings

452
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,200
and reports

453
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,740
on

454
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,060
American Nazis.

455
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,320
Oh no.

456
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,560
Yeah.

457
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,360
The American Nazis

458
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:23,860
that have,

459
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,400
have wrecked

460
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,220
the family of Magdalene

461
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:27,780
and Jesus,

462
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,940
the subgeniuses.

463
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,760
We have a little bit

464
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,540
of news on that.

465
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:30,840
In fact,

466
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,580
I should mention,

467
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,640
might as well go ahead

468
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,020
and say.

469
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,580
Yes.

470
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,780
Because people have been

471
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,580
wondering about

472
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,880
what has happened

473
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,760
with Reverend Magdalene

474
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,720
and her child

475
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,760
who was taken away

476
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,240
from her

477
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,300
because she was

478
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,180
involved in the church

479
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,260
of the subgenius.

480
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,120
Yes, it's true.

481
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:46,880
A New York

482
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,680
family court

483
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,480
took,

484
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,620
a woman's child

485
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,400
away from her

486
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,180
because of her involvement

487
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,920
with the church

488
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,940
of the subgenius

489
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,400
because they thought

490
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,480
this judge

491
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,180
was under the impression

492
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,680
that our church

493
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,900
was full of

494
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,740
devil worshipers

495
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,220
as opposed to

496
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,160
people who simply

497
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,900
do business

498
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,700
with certain

499
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,500
minor level

500
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,940
demons

501
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,080
in the conspiracy.

502
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,700
Anyway,

503
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,360
we got,

504
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:15,440
supposedly

505
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,140
their last trial

506
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:17,780
date

507
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,460
happened this week

508
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:19,720
and they're going to

509
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,720
end it Friday

510
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,760
but the judge

511
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,800
has yet to make

512
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,360
a decision.

513
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,300
So we wait

514
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,280
in terrible suspense

515
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
to find out

516
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,660
whether

517
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,640
this judge

518
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,840
is more sane

519
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,140
than the previous judge

520
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,160
who had to be

521
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,600
recused.

522
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,380
He recused himself

523
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,180
in fact

524
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,200
right in front of

525
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,640
everybody

526
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,640
because it,

527
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,580
I guess partly

528
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:43,980
because

529
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,780
so many thousands

530
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,380
of people

531
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,020
on the internet

532
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,480
were laughing at him

533
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,620
for having

534
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,860
mistaken the church

535
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,840
of the subgenius

536
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,220
for the Illuminati

537
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,820
or something.

538
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,900
Anyway,

539
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,960
also in Cuigibo here

540
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,580
there are some

541
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,320
detailed field reports

542
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,920
on the devotionals

543
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,540
and various

544
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,020
devo shows,

545
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,240
photos,

546
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,900
sexy photos

547
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,900
of subgenius males

548
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,760
and females

549
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,780
in Congress

550
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,360
doing acts of Congress

551
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,900
and intercourse

552
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,720
speaking.

553
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,620
Oh, yes.

554
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,760
See, there's Philo

555
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,440
and me and Hal

556
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,180
yakking.

557
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,520
Oh, yes.

558
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,020
There's you and Dr. Hal.

559
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,880
Oh, and the Dr. Hal

560
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,380
reveals that secret.

561
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:25,760
Oh, that's right.

562
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,700
The secret recipe

563
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,820
for peanut butter cookies.

564
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,520
It's very,

565
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,460
a secret

566
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,000
technological secrets

567
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,040
behind the engineering

568
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,100
of a peanut butter cookie.

569
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,060
Right, it's a secret recipe, folks.

570
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,500
That's another reason

571
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:41,920
that we're here.

572
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,400
Strange rites and rituals

573
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,960
among the subgenius tribes

574
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,600
of Brushwood

575
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,300
which is the kind of gossip

576
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,800
you want to hear about.

577
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,140
You've always suspected

578
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,520
that there's a lot of

579
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,960
naughty goings-on

580
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,940
and luau's

581
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,540
and so forth

582
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,300
in this cult

583
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,720
and well,

584
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,240
you can find all the

585
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,280
salacious details

586
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:00,840
right here.

587
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,960
The Dobbs house

588
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,440
tiki time.

589
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,920
Queegee boys

590
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,740
love girls

591
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,940
who love Queegee Bo

592
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,060
and you can get

593
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,740
more information

594
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,720
about Queegee Bo

595
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,620
from this address.

596
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,080
Queegee Bo

597
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,180
that's Q-U-I-J-I-B-O

598
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,060
18 West Main Street.

599
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,980
It's pretty simple.

600
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,260
18 West Main.

601
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,600
Greenfield, Indiana.

602
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,900
4-6-1-4-0.

603
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,260
Once again,

604
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,120
that's 4-6-1-4-0

605
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,620
in Greenfield, Indiana.

606
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,720
And what other news

607
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,060
did we have?

608
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,280
Oh, the Insight.

609
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,760
Ah, yes.

610
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,840
Insight was busted, friends.

611
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,080
You may be familiar

612
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,180
with the ad

613
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,640
with Smilin' Bob.

614
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,700
He looks just like

615
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,980
our J.R. Bob Dobbs.

616
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,360
In fact,

617
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,580
he's an obvious ripoff

618
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,920
hawking male enhancement pills

619
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,760
from a company

620
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,700
called Insight.

621
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,320
For three years now,

622
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,080
they've been

623
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,480
ripping off our trademark

624
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,000
successfully

625
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
because they didn't put a pipe

626
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,660
in their false Bob's mouth.

627
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,560
Our Bob, of course,

628
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,840
always has that pipe.

629
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,660
But it was obviously

630
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,480
supposed to be

631
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,900
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

632
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,600
Obviously.

633
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,440
Anyway,

634
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,280
Justice and Carmen,

635
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,980
have been served, friends.

636
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,540
The maker of dietary supplements

637
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,400
that claim to improve

638
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,560
everything from sexuality

639
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,280
to memory

640
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,500
defrauded thousands

641
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,960
of customers and banks

642
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,820
of at least

643
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,280
a hundred million

644
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
federal authorities say.

645
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,700
And this indictment

646
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,600
names Berkeley

647
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,360
Premium Nutraceuticals.

648
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,300
The company,

649
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,360
which recently said

650
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,520
it has five million

651
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,680
customers worldwide,

652
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,780
is known for its

653
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,300
Smilin' Bob ads

654
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,780
that depict a man

655
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,120
whose life gets better

656
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,280
and his life gets better.

657
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,800
After he uses the company's

658
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,360
enzyme for natural

659
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,660
male enhancement.

660
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,920
The company markets nationally

661
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,340
a variety of other products

662
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,940
claiming to help everything

663
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,120
from night vision

664
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,760
to memory

665
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,340
to female libido.

666
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,840
The company president

667
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,880
and others made up

668
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,780
information in their

669
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,020
advertisements such as

670
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,360
endorsement by doctors

671
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,460
that did not exist

672
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,960
and results of

673
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,740
customer satisfaction

674
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,980
surveys that have

675
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,180
never been conducted.

676
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,920
U.S. Attorney General

677
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,720
Lockhart said.

678
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,280
Customers with a

679
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,000
complaints were told

680
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,020
to write to a director

681
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,080
of customer care

682
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,120
who did not exist.

683
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,340
And luckily for us,

684
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:26,660
friends,

685
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,160
the charges carry

686
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,180
a 30-year sentence.

687
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,040
Five of the company's

688
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,760
former executives

689
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,680
have pled guilty

690
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,740
in U.S. District Court

691
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,160
to defrauding customers

692
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,900
through a product

693
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,820
giveaway program

694
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,440
that led to

695
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
unauthorized billing

696
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,000
of their credit cards.

697
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
They've frozen

698
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,840
25 million bucks

699
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,500
in assets

700
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,620
held by

701
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:49,900
Warshack

702
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,760
and members

703
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,000
of his family.

704
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,200
And they're going

705
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,920
to try to recover

706
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,620
money to give

707
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,180
to victims

708
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,220
of the false Bob.

709
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,760
Berkeley Nutraceuticals

710
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,660
generated about

711
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,380
$250 million

712
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,700
in sales

713
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,920
in 2004,

714
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,700
mostly from

715
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,780
telephone orders

716
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,880
spurred by TV ads

717
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,480
starring Bob Dobbs.

718
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,660
What a bummer.

719
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,160
Well, friends,

720
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,780
we're going...

721
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,560
Actually, I mean,

722
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:17,960
it's a...

723
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,600
It's a...

724
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:18,600


725
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:18,600


726
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:18,600


727
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:18,600


728
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,860
It's a joyous occasion

729
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,680
for us

730
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,720
that this thief

731
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,120
has been sent away.

732
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,020
And now we're going

733
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,820
to go back,

734
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:27,920
back, back

735
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,000
into the tapes

736
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,240
and I'll try to tune in

737
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,640
the lonesome cowboy somehow.

738
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,200
So, for right now,

739
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,240
here is the news.

740
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,660
From PR News in Washington,

741
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,880
I'm delayed by

742
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,940
Mysterious Ernesto.

743
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,660
NASA said today

744
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,680
the ideal price

745
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,760
for the space shuttle

746
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,220
would be $50 to $60

747
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,260
on Monday.

748
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,380
A faulty judge in Detroit

749
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,700
has ordered less than

750
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,720
$67 of space shuttle

751
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,440
under mysterious circumstances.

752
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,760
PR News is poverty stricken.

753
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,720
Saudi Arabia's royal family

754
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,300
is paying for false PR.

755
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,000
U.S. officials say

756
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,420
top OPEC officials said

757
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,040
the Sri Lankan army says

758
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,100
an army spokesman says

759
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,900
the rebels say

760
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,000
the army has to face

761
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,660
PR News.

762
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,800
From Washington.

763
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,520
On one side are those

764
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,320
who believe the right

765
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,320
of all people to speak

766
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,860
in moderation

767
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,100
and worship

768
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,720
tyranny and extremism.

769
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,600
The fascists,

770
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,880
the Nazis,

771
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,360
the communists,

772
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,240
and a victory for

773
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,520
the cause of fascists

774
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,420
of the 20th Century.

775
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,080
Cult새,

776
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,640
Cultítulo,

777
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,980
the Nazis

778
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,340
and history shows

779
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,020
Victory for the Fascists

780
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,100
A feeling is

781
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,540
natural,

782
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,500
and comforting.

783
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,240
Tolla, Tolla, Tolla...

784
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,520
We recently saw the enemy

785
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,840
way

786
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,820
Comunists

787
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,140
calling

788
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,660
This cult called terrorist.

789
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,220
Terror, terror, terror, terror, terror.

790
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,060
The horror grows, grows, grows, grows.

791
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,460
Wrong and comforting.

792
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,420
Wrong, wrong.

793
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,080
Totalitarian.

794
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,180
The right of all people to speak in moderation and worship tyranny and extremism.

795
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,120
Conspiracy.

796
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,200
Conspiracy.

797
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,180
Conspiracy.

798
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,300
Conspiracy.

799
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,300
Conspiracy.

800
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,240
Conspiracy.

801
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,220
Conspiracy.

802
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,280
Conspiracy.

803
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,280
Conspiracy.

804
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:29,340
The world is a collage of corporations inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business.

805
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,820
The world is a collage.

806
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,400
I love it here.

807
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,680
Dr. Dave, Dr. Dave, Dr. Dave, Dr. Dave.

808
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,280
Well, have you heard what's going on over there now out in the wilderness, where wonderful

809
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,120
X-Days has been held for some 3,000 years now?

810
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,660
No.

811
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:47,840
No.

812
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:54,200
A mad fellow who has been befriended by the Southern Tier Indians is going around shooting highway patrolmen, supposedly.

813
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,880
Now, didn't that happen, like, isn't that last week's news?

814
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,620
And that was that one guy and they caught him?

815
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,760
Apparently, they haven't caught him.

816
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,600
Well, maybe they did just catch him.

817
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,240
Are you thinking of Bucky, Reverend Bucky?

818
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,180
Oh, no.

819
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,420
They cornered him and he turned himself in.

820
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:17,000
I mean, he turned himself into a toad and tried to hop away, but they gigged him.

821
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:24,480
Yeah, that was Reverend Bucky who used to do the subgenius website revisions.

822
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,860
That's the self-same?

823
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
Or buckweed, it could have also been.

824
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:39,200
So, yeah, Dave, what kind of news have you been up on?

825
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:47,560
Well, I did hear about Reverend Commander Bucky slaying a Badooper, but I didn't know if it was real or not.

826
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,680
Okay, here's the news.

827
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,360
I've been catching people up on the news.

828
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,120
The news is that one guy died.

829
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:59,780
And that guy that made a fool of himself on TV, he did it again.

830
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,740
And that other guy that was a jerk, he did it again, too.

831
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,960
And that country that was at war with that other country, they're having war again.

832
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,460
And there was a bad earthquake.

833
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,640
And there was some terrible flooding.

834
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,440
So, that's the news, man.

835
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,760
Yeah, and there was a guy, too, thrown in with the flooding, wasn't there?

836
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,940
Yeah, and some crazy woman killed her baby for Jesus.

837
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,380
And then there was this guy that beat up his wife, too, right?

838
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah, that's right.

839
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,480
And there was some guy that beat up his wife.

840
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,280
And then there was some wife that beat up this guy.

841
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,640
There was, yeah, that was the news.

842
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,960
So, yeah, I guess I'm pretty well caught up now.

843
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,840
Yeah, you're caught up now.

844
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,900
Now, what about the other...

845
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,960
That's all you need to know.

846
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:45,660
The other high E-popped, making juvenile delinquents out of people of the Martian race,

847
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,640
or of the other...

848
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:47,960
Other religions.

849
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,300
Did you hear about that?

850
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:50,820
No.

851
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,320
Well, Pope Benedict said, he quoted an obscure phrase...

852
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,820
Oh, right.

853
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,960
An obscure discourse, an argument that a guy who was getting them,

854
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,540
they were attacking his fort,

855
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,500
and he told the other guy who he was kind of friends with,

856
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,280
and told him they were going to sack the place,

857
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,780
he was telling him, well, your religion sucks and stuff,

858
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,600
and the other guy was saying, well, so does yours.

859
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,100
And so...

860
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,760
And Pope Black quoted that?

861
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,360
The other high E-popped tried to...

862
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,280
Make a big deal out of it somehow.

863
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,100
Right.

864
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,920
But I'm really not caught up on that part.

865
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,460
So, in other words, because one guy in one country said a bunch of stuff

866
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,820
that a guy a thousand years ago said about another guy a thousand years ago,

867
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,540
a million people in another country got...

868
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,760
Started burning things.

869
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,340
Yeah.

870
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:34,840
Yeah.

871
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,980
Well, that's usually how...

872
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,340
That's what they call spontaneous combustion in the social...

873
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,400
Political sphere.

874
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,340
The Onion had a funny headline that said that...

875
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,400
The conflicting...

876
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,900
The conflicting sides in the Middle East were turning to religion for help.

877
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:54,760
Yeah.

878
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,760
I'm sorry to laugh at theirs, not ours, but that makes soup.

879
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,940
Well, it's funny that it took them that long to come up with that punchline.

880
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,560
It's such a...

881
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,840
Well, I guess it's been done.

882
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,560
Hasn't everything pretty much been done?

883
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,620
I guess every new story's been told and everything's been done,

884
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,380
except for the day those freaking exes finally get here.

885
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,000
Yeah.

886
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,220
It's been talked about.

887
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,980
It's been predicted by every single religious nut in the world.

888
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,540
Most of all, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

889
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,000
I want to know what they look like, because I was tailed on the way back home.

890
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,880
They look like anything you want to know they look like.

891
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,360
Oh, okay.

892
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,120
They're schmooish.

893
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
Yeah, if you want to...

894
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,940
Right, they're like the mighty schmoo that will...

895
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,780
That flops itself onto your breakfast griddle

896
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,420
and cuts itself up into slices so you can cook it easier.

897
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,980
Well, that is weird that we are...

898
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,260
They are on the wavelength, because I swear,

899
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,220
rather than a cylindrical or a spherical object,

900
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,380
they look like giant, you know, like deli turkeys,

901
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,420
you know, the big roast turkeys they put in the windows

902
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,640
that are made of plastic, but they look really good.

903
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,180
I mean, I couldn't smell them, let's just say that.

904
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,160
They could have been actual roast turkeys chasing me around,

905
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,020
but they had, like, red and yellow running lights underneath.

906
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,540
And on top, it looked like there was one beacon light

907
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,420
where the turkey's head would have been,

908
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,100
not been roasted, you know?

909
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,900
Mm-hmm.

910
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,880
Are there some kind of new Franken-turkeys

911
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,620
you've been seeing at the farmer's market or something?

912
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,120
Well, that could be.

913
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,740
I maybe have been having bad visions of mutated turkeys

914
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,240
and thought that they were, like, X's flying craft.

915
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,660
But I'm pretty sure that I was actually being pursued

916
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,860
by a small squadron of flying...

917
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,260
Oh, they were chasing you?

918
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,400
No, they weren't tasting me.

919
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,000
They were chasing.

920
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,420
Chasing, yeah, chasing.

921
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,380
They were chastising.

922
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,180
They were chastising me, too.

923
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,700
Chastising.

924
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,840
Psychologically, I was thinking things I didn't want to think.

925
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,680
They weren't harmful thoughts,

926
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,820
but they were just obtrusive thoughts,

927
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,900
you know, about baseball in 1978.

928
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,380
So flying, lit-up, telepathic...

929
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:00,740
Telepathic.

930
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:05,660
...shmoo-like turkey creatures were harassing you.

931
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,320
Harassing me.

932
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,840
So I just was looking for your epoptly advice

933
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,140
on what I should do.

934
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,420
Maybe I should just wear sunglasses

935
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,180
or cut out my optic nerves.

936
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,720
Well, we got a fax earlier this week

937
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,220
about something like that.

938
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,880
They said that the problem was

939
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,620
robotic communication labors in laboratory research

940
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,880
and that they torture people

941
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,860
by recording your life history.

942
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,600
What if you line your baseball cap with tinfoil?

943
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,260
Would that help?

944
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:34,720
Right.

945
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,660
What if, like, you know,

946
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,720
the people who wear tinfoil hats,

947
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,220
can't we just maybe turn out a couple thousand of them

948
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,080
with the old Dobbs logo on there?

949
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,060
Duh, we tried.

950
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:46,900
We did.

951
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,900
We're doing that.

952
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,580
We've been doing that for years, Dave.

953
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,560
Oh, well...

954
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,000
Yeah, look at the Cafe Press catalog, man.

955
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,440
No kidding.

956
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,460
It's full of nothing but tinfoil-lined Dobbs hats

957
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,060
with every possible cool little drawing

958
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,780
by Dr. Howell on them.

959
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,680
Well, they have to have more than just regular,

960
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,000
you know, just regular tinfoil on there.

961
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,160
They need reinforced and electrolytically perfect

962
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,380
so as to bounce the race.

963
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,040
Uh-huh.

964
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,700
I see.

965
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,500
Yeah.

966
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,500
Maybe we should run ads, late-night ads,

967
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,240
that feature a smiling, pipe-smoking guy

968
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,940
who, you know, his longer gets longer

969
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,840
whenever he wears his special Bob hat.

970
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,440
Yeah, yeah.

971
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,140
That would be...

972
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,060
And we could sell just sugar pills

973
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,440
or some kind of ginseng or something

974
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,640
and call it male enhancement snot-mouthed Tweedle pills.

975
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,120
Why not tell them that every time there's an encounter

976
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,740
that the elongus will become flungated?

977
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,400
That way...

978
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,680
You know, if they're expecting a lot of people over

979
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,340
or whatever you might want a lot of beings over,

980
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,120
then they can...

981
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,560
They'd be prepared to have a sex orgy that will...

982
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,700
I don't know.

983
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,420
That's right, friends.

984
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,160
If you buy smiling Bob snot-mouthed Tweedle pills,

985
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,420
you'll have a longer, stronger...

986
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,060
Stronger.

987
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:10,420
Stronger.

988
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,880
Weiner pills.

989
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,960
Your breath will be brighter.

990
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:15,780
Cleaner.

991
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,620
Tastier.

992
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,820
And resemble your schlong.

993
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,780
I don't think anybody would want their own breath

994
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,580
to resemble their schlong.

995
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,960
I don't know why, but...

996
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,680
Let's just not even...

997
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:27,940
Nah.

998
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,740
No.

999
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,720
It makes breathing difficult.

1000
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,240
It makes conceiving difficult, so...

1001
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,800
You're right.

1002
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,880
Remember, this is not our opinion.

1003
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,820
Every day, more and more men are turning to food.

1004
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,620
Wild oil cream or truly big loose handsome hair.

1005
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:51,000
And that's surprising, for what other leading hair tonic removes the hair neatly and naturally.

1006
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,040
What's more, root wild oil cream is alcoholic and contains soothing alcohol.

1007
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:01,700
No wonder root wild oil cream is the favorite with so many millions of smart alcoholic men.

1008
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,780
Get root wild oil cream.

1009
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:08,980
The choice of big loose handsome men who put handsome smart loose big hair first.

1010
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:09,860
It's true.

1011
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,200
Makes breath brighter.

1012
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,320
It's a fact.

1013
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,680
Makes breath brighter.

1014
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,760
It's true.

1015
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:15,760


1016
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:15,760


1017
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:15,760


1018
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,640
It's a fact.

1019
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:18,740


1020
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:18,740


1021
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:18,740


1022
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:18,740


1023
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:18,740


1024
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:18,740


1025
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:18,740


1026
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:18,740


1027
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:18,740


1028
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,240
If you just keep chewing the gum...

1029
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,940
Oh my...

1030
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,660
Oh my god, I...

1031
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,640
I left that gum at home.

1032
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,240
I can't chew no gum over here.

1033
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,100
Now I'll try chewing some gum over here.

1034
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,620
Smell.

1035
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,920
Smell that smell.

1036
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,940
It's kind of...

1037
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,520
It's...

1038
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,840
A wild smell of elderberry gum.

1039
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,040
There was some smell I could smell.

1040
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,760
I'm going to have to go ahead and...

1041
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,800
I'm going to be smelling it soon.

1042
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,760
A sort of a fishy smell.

1043
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,860
I heard the sound that precedes the smell.

1044
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,960
Smelt, actually.

1045
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,920
You dealt that smell.

1046
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,620
Yeah, whoever smelt it.

1047
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,340
Just yesterday.

1048
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,460
That was some puzzling evidence with Dr. Howland, Dr. Philodrum,

1049
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,740
and now some Noral Prefinitely Murd.

1050
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,640
I've got an eclectic reading list.

1051
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,720
I've got an eclectic reading list.

1052
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,500
I've got an eclectic reading list.

1053
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,240
21st century fascists.

1054
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,260
21st century fascists.

1055
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,020
Oh, my God.

1056
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,000
Oh, my God.

1057
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,660
I believe the American people have the wrong path.

1058
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,240
21st century fascists.

1059
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,020
Oh, my God.

1060
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,320
Costly defeats.

1061
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,360
I believe the American people have costly defeats.

1062
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,740
We want to be free.

1063
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:50,100
We will abandon them to the beheaders, the terrorists, the assassins.

1064
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,980
Amazing twists and turns.

1065
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,300
Wrong.

1066
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,000
Losing strength along the way.

1067
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:54,980
Infamous.

1068
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:55,780
Chaos.

1069
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,780
Want to help us out?

1070
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,380
Blown into pieces.

1071
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:00,880
Plunger.

1072
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,180
Seek to attack.

1073
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,020
After midnight.

1074
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:04,980
Steal.

1075
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:05,900
Just that.

1076
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,240
Throw in the towel.

1077
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,020
Just that.

1078
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,300
Throw in the towel.

1079
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,140
Just that.

1080
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,300
Throw in the towel.

1081
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,080
Just that.

1082
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,300
Throw in the towel.

1083
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,820
A media mob scene.

1084
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,440
Perverted.

1085
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,740
Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um.

1086
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,540
AJ's did it.

1087
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,360
AJ's did it.

1088
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:19,820
Let down.

1089
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,660
Let down.

1090
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,520
Mysteries.

1091
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,220
21st century fascists.

1092
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,040
Oh, my God.

1093
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,420
It's making me really excited to see her like that.

1094
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,220
21st century fascists.

1095
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,540
I loved her so much, and I'm so sor-

1096
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,980
Please, please, please, sweetheart.

1097
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,180
I love you so much.

1098
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,080
Oh baby, please come back to investigate the wreckage.

1099
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,240
21st century fascists.

1100
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,600
Child pornography charges.

1101
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,200
21st century fascists.

1102
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,600
Child pornography charges.

1103
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,760
President Bush still struggling for a rebirth.

1104
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,240
Giant piles of dirt.

1105
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,960
Giant piles.

1106
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,280
That's even worse.

1107
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,300
Giant piles.

1108
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,280
That's even worse.

1109
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:53,880
Bungled.

1110
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,640
There are still issues.

1111
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,840
Cross leader feats.

1112
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,720
Giant piles.

1113
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,140
There are still issues.

1114
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,240
Giant piles.

1115
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,340
Cross leader feats.

1116
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,020
Oh my god.

1117
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,800
Chaos.

1118
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,760
Wanna help us out?

1119
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,340
Let's go to a restaurant.

1120
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,440
In them, they're all cotton fields at home.

1121
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,780
We're the man of restaurants.

1122
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,740
Strangers in the restaurant.

1123
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,000
Make the day complete.

1124
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,160
Now give me my pills.

1125
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,540
Let's now look at some techniques for making your daily life easy.

1126
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,380
You've screwed up.

1127
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,020
You feel guilty.

1128
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,700
I'm sorry.

1129
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,920
Let's see how we can use psychology.

1130
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,300
Fast.

1131
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:33,600
Fast.

1132
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,180
Circumstances beyond your control.

1133
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,180
You didn't feel up to it.

1134
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:36,920
You completely forgot.

1135
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,560
Placing the blame on an outside source, vague generalities, is highly effective in reducing

1136
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,340
a person's anger.

1137
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,980
You don't care or you're not interested in caring.

1138
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,420
Shift blame or assign excuses.

1139
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,800
Exacerbate the situation.

1140
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,800
Sometimes it's very hard, but as hard as it is, it looks great, but doesn't do anything.

1141
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,420
Do nothing.

1142
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,740
But remember, give her back what you took.

1143
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,660
Nothing makes sense.

1144
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,460
Primal and pure.

1145
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,320
Go back in time.

1146
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,140
The sex was lousy.

1147
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,940
Use words that have a strong negative connotation.

1148
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,880
It's all-consuming.

1149
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,320
Annoying problems.

1150
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,920
Sit down and shut up.

1151
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,260
I don't like that and now I'm upset.

1152
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,620
Angry, hurt, frustrated, and small.

1153
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,480
Beat yourself up.

1154
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:05,920
Blash out.

1155
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,560
Bear in mind there are no absolutes.

1156
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,040
Bear in mind there are absolutes.

1157
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,000
Heightened state of arousal.

1158
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,560
Injure him.

1159
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,100
Smile.

1160
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,540
That's right.

1161
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:11,980
Smile.

1162
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,260
Incapacitate him.

1163
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:13,340
Hit him.

1164
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,620
Vomiting, urinating, or belching.

1165
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,120
Act insane or mentally deranged.

1166
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,700
Hit him where it hurts.

1167
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,260
Who cares?

1168
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,460
Hit him where it hurts.

1169
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,160
Act without thinking.

1170
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,180
Using deception is acceptable.

1171
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,680
You'll notice that you feel much better about yourself and life in general.

1172
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,660
Get anyone to do anyone feel powerless again.

1173
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,620
Lie to again.

1174
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:34,440
Yeah, I, uh, speaking of conceiving, I had, I conceived this little animation and, and,

1175
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:42,960
uh, uh, put it out on, on YouTube and my friend Nenslo basically said it.

1176
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,540
It sucked.

1177
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:44,840
So you.

1178
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:50,340
And I, and I said, I wish I, I wish you had some of what I'm smoking as a joke.

1179
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,000
And he said, I wish you had some of what I'm thinking with.

1180
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,340
Touche and ouch, Master Nenslo.

1181
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,660
That's real repartee for you.

1182
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,120
Yeah.

1183
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,100
That's razor sharp wit.

1184
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,320
Yeah.

1185
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,460
And it's consummate max or some sort of clear broth.

1186
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,060
Yeah.

1187
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:12,940
Yeah.

1188
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,180
I wish I could think thoughts like that.

1189
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:26,300
How does one, I mean, I think you have to be born with a brain and not wreck it at some

1190
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:26,700
point.

1191
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:31,960
I mean, several brain cells, not just the one, or is the case princess.

1192
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,380
We and I, the shared one, isn't it a practice makes perfect sort of thing too.

1193
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,860
What you mean?

1194
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,960
The more thinking you do, the better you get at it.

1195
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,840
I'm not sure.

1196
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,880
Well, you might be.

1197
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,680
I'm not sure about that.

1198
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,100
Cause look at some of, look at where some of the deep thinkers go with it.

1199
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Well, yes, I guess you do have a point there.

1200
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,480
They go to the guy who faxed me.

1201
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,000
Now that, that person obviously is way ahead of me.

1202
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:03,900
He knows about the robotic communication lasers, but, but where's he gone with it?

1203
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,180
Right.

1204
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:09,620
Can he create meaning as, as you told me the other night in the tender moment after we

1205
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,100
had sex.

1206
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,940
You said that changing the sex.

1207
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:12,940


1208
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,960
The sound changes the meaning of all visual information.

1209
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,660
And I said, well, geez, I've known that.

1210
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,100
And I've been trying to express that, but I couldn't.

1211
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,740
And then I shut up for awhile and I realized the visual information was very horrible.

1212
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,440
And then I made a little, like a little bird sound and sang the, um, whistled the Mayberry

1213
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,220
RFD theme song.

1214
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,180
And I felt hell of a lot of sex.

1215
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,700
We had him, we had him mow the lawn and he thought that we told him that was.

1216
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,880
Don't destroy his illusions, honey.

1217
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,460
He did a good job on the lawn.

1218
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:42,700
I know.

1219
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,080
He did a great job on the lawn.

1220
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,580
Mowing the lawn.

1221
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:46,600
Yeah.

1222
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,480
You're a great.

1223
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:47,980
Yeah.

1224
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,400
That was real.

1225
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:48,880
Yeah.

1226
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,420
Pardon?

1227
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,480
That's what the kids call it now.

1228
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,320
Mowing the lawn.

1229
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,340
When they open your skull.

1230
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,460
Ride them.

1231
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,440
Mow them.

1232
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,460
You mean kids call mowing the lawn sex?

1233
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,360
Yeah.

1234
00:39:59,480 --> 00:39:59,860
Oh.

1235
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:06,160
And no, the military calls, calls trepanation and lobotomies mowing the lawn.

1236
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,520
Right.

1237
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,720
Trimming the hedge.

1238
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,500
They call it.

1239
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:08,860
Yeah.

1240
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,240
You, you just give them a light haircut over the top.

1241
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:12,680
Yeah.

1242
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,080
Just, just take a little bit off the sides.

1243
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,180
Using that ice pick through the eye sockets.

1244
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,820
But always.

1245
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,920
For the nose, the nasal.

1246
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,160
You can go up in through the nose, can't you, if you have the right tools.

1247
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,540
I think with mine.

1248
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,760
Scramble somebody's math.

1249
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,100
Scramble someone's math.

1250
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:34,880
Yeah.

1251
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,120
Well, yeah, you can do that.

1252
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:41,560
I mean, if you know where to go in with the hooks and which part to scramble, you can

1253
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,440
get rid of certain.

1254
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,700
Like orneriness.

1255
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,660
You could remove someone's orneriness.

1256
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,200
You could remove someone's verbal ability.

1257
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,160
Just pluck it right out.

1258
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:54,300
You could remove someone's ability to tell the difference between say a glass of water

1259
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,500
and a parking lot.

1260
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,800
Is there a big difference?

1261
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,720
Well, see, you've already had that operation.

1262
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,760
How does it feel to you?

1263
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:10,460
Well, I, I do have a hard time differentiating between certain objects that I did quite easily

1264
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,920
differentiate between before.

1265
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,200
For instance, cars.

1266
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,740
You're the kind of voter they're looking for.

1267
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,620
Yeah, well, that's what I'm worried about with the flying turkeys.

1268
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,240
But I don't know if I'm ready to go yet, so to speak.

1269
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,200
I haven't.

1270
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,980
The de-bowled flying turkeys.

1271
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:34,300
Those are just, those are like a form of, of preliminary vote guesstimating.

1272
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,240
You know, it's like a survey.

1273
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:41,600
They follow you around and read all of your thoughts and everything you say and do as

1274
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,500
a kind of a survey.

1275
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,340
So that doesn't really affect the turnout of the election.

1276
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,160
Yeah.

1277
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,180
That's not the real lawn mowing per se yet.

1278
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,220
No, in a way they've kind of mowed the lawn of everybody, I think.

1279
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,280
And they used a lawnmower called the TV.

1280
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,200
Nice trim job.

1281
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:01,780
Yeah.

1282
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,740
I mean, look what it's done to some of our younger peers.

1283
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,760
So let's think of, let's think of what it's done to some younger subgenius.

1284
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,420
GC.

1285
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:17,500
Subgenie who have been foolish enough to go back and look at the evil lawn mower.

1286
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,620
I mean, many have taken the vow and many have agreed to.

1287
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,780
Oh, they do it for kicks.

1288
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:31,260
They think that they get, they think it's fun to go back and, and see before the, then

1289
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,140
see what, what it was that took out their math.

1290
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:34,940
Yeah.

1291
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,580
They don't know what they're messing with though.

1292
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,720
They joined the army.

1293
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,400
You don't need too much math except for if there's like a hundred thousand people.

1294
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:41,400


1295
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:41,400


1296
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:41,480
Yeah.

1297
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,440
And if there's a hundred other guys and maybe just two of you, you should know to hold your

1298
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,000
hands up.

1299
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,300
Both of them, two of them.

1300
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,200
I don't know.

1301
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,440
Well, they always, they need one guy who does math and they need one guy who can read and

1302
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:59,380
they need one guy that can sing and one that can speak English and push buttons on a, on

1303
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:07,100
a telephone radio comm set and a whole bunch of guys that can run into the face of oncoming

1304
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,800
fire and bombs and so forth.

1305
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,820
You know, it's funny.

1306
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,340
Wow.

1307
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,500
And they're always filming while filming how those guys are always the ones who are spared.

1308
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:21,100
And the guy who plays the guitar and sings it with the cigar cigarette sticking out of

1309
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,200
his mouth, make it kind of makes his eye wrinkle up at the same time.

1310
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,320
And he sings about what it's like back home.

1311
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:26,980
Always dies.

1312
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,080
I've always, that would be you that if you were in the war movie, you'd be that guy,

1313
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:32,420
right?

1314
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:32,860
Right.

1315
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,200
The, the rockets would misfire and go all the way to North Carolina and hit the barracks

1316
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,360
where I was masturbating.

1317
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:39,800
Man.

1318
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,380
I don't know.

1319
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,380
Well, the way off cars.

1320
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:44,620
Yep.

1321
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,540
That's the way I feel.

1322
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,020
That's why I'm a subgenius, I guess.

1323
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:54,040
Now see, I feel, I feel more like the guy that would, that would run into the recruitment

1324
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,020
offerings, office saying, I want to sign up.

1325
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:57,820
I want to kill.

1326
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,740
I want to kill.

1327
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:02,100
And they make you a computer operator in Hawaii.

1328
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,880
Why do they do that?

1329
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,780
It's so frustrating.

1330
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,180
Catch a 22.

1331
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,520
Gotcha 22.

1332
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,040
Well, it's 23 now.

1333
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,120
Yep.

1334
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,800
I think it's going to stay 23 for a long time.

1335
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,480
Actually, it was 23 when I was a kid.

1336
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,200
Now it's up to 27 or something, I think.

1337
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,360
I think it's catch 27.

1338
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,180
It's a chicken cacciatore, too.

1339
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:22,920
Yeah.

1340
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:30,520
23 was actually Nimwald Hornbanger's number in the restaurant at the end of the table, wasn't it?

1341
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,920
I don't remember that particular sit book.

1342
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,860
Sit book.

1343
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,600
The man with the Sly Slav unit that used to mow the lawns before but was nicer.

1344
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,960
Dr. Benway?

1345
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,220
Dr. Dobbs?

1346
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,540
Dr. Howard?

1347
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,000
Dr. Fine?

1348
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,100
Dr. Howard?

1349
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,120
Dr. Fine?

1350
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,400
The guy at the end of the universe.

1351
00:44:59,400 --> 00:44:59,880
Dr. Bob?

1352
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,100
Bob Bobalina?

1353
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,540
How do you do, ladies and gentlemen?

1354
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,220
This is Bob.

1355
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:05,820
Bob.

1356
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,000
Back in his hometown of Cleveland.

1357
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,020
I'll answer the door.

1358
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,520
I'll see who's at the door.

1359
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,120
Yes, sir.

1360
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:12,880
Come in.

1361
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,260
Look, this might be Bob.

1362
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,460
Who's Bob?

1363
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,140
Bob!

1364
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,080
Well, Bob, it's certainly a pleasure having you drop in to see me.

1365
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,220
Well, Bob, I want you to meet Bob.

1366
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,580
Oh, hiya, Bob.

1367
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,680
And say, Bob, I meant to tell you.

1368
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,740
Hey, wait a minute.

1369
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,500
Wait a minute.

1370
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,660
First, I want you to meet Bob.

1371
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,900
Well, I'm certainly glad to know you, Bob, and I'm particularly glad you're here because

1372
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,840
the quartet's going to be here in a minute.

1373
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,040
We should do a number dedicated to Cleveland.

1374
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,460
We haven't got much time, so let's hear the number.

1375
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,540
Okay, hit it, boys.

1376
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,880
I'm so embarrassed in front of Bob.

1377
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,360
Come in.

1378
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,800
Come in, girls.

1379
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,800
I want you to meet Bob.

1380
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,720
Bob, I want you to meet Bob.

1381
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,760
Bob, why are you staring at the girls like that?

1382
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,600
Well, hello, Bob.

1383
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,640
Very good, Bob.

1384
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,420
Very good.

1385
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,320
Bob, why don't you go out to dinner?

1386
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,260
Yes, Bob.

1387
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,480
Hey, Bob, here's one of your boys, Bob.

1388
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,580
Hello, Bob.

1389
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,140
Hello, Bob.

1390
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,240
Who, Bob?

1391
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,560
Bob, what are you really doing here in Cleveland?

1392
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,480
Well, where is he now?

1393
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,840
Well, if the Republicans can't decide on anybody, he may be our next president.

1394
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,600
What the fuck?

1395
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,760
We got a one-track mind, friends.

1396
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,240
Really?

1397
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:26,600
And it's got a B on either end of the track and just a big zero all the way for a thousand miles.

1398
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,040
It's like a big, long train that just goes,

1399
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,240
until it gets to the end.

1400
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:34,500
It goes,

1401
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,340
and that's it, baby.

1402
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,980
That's what it's all about.

1403
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:40,260
Yep.

1404
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,580
Close quotes.

1405
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,500
Being in the Bob zone.

1406
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:49,160
Dave, you notice I've just let you, I've let us just jabber on the air for this, almost

1407
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,480
this whole hour.

1408
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:54,620
Once I finally got figured out the, I never did figure out the phone thing.

1409
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,960
It just worked by accident.

1410
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,760
Now, when I quit trying.

1411
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,000
It was a miracle.

1412
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,660
It suddenly worked.

1413
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,740
Are your hands still frozen?

1414
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:04,620
Yeah.

1415
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,760
I mean, have you been able to work?

1416
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,100
Yeah, that's why I can't.

1417
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,060
Well, that's the thing.

1418
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,680
I can't push the CD play button anyway.

1419
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,460
Can you still satisfy the princess when necessary?

1420
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,680
That's up to her.

1421
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,520
Oh, I didn't know you had that kind of relationship.

1422
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,320
Yeah.

1423
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,060
No, I don't know.

1424
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,100
She's, yeah, it's, well, she's a princess, man.

1425
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:24,800
Think about it.

1426
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,020
Nobody could satisfy her but her, I guess.

1427
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:27,380
Yeah.

1428
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:35,820
No, she can't be satisfied in the way that a normal mundane thinks, you know, a pro thinks of things.

1429
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,260
Yeah.

1430
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:36,260


1431
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:36,260


1432
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:36,460
She's not satisfied.

1433
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:36,860
She's gonna be satisfied.

1434
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,080
She's gonna be satisfied.

1435
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,080


1436
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,080


1437
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,080


1438
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,080


1439
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,080


1440
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,080


1441
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,080
There's always going to be some little thing that's not quite royal enough.

1442
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,680
That's how you know they're royalty.

1443
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,100
Hmm.

1444
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:51,540
Us proles wouldn't even notice the kind of stuff that royalty is hyper allergic to.

1445
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,900
So am I supposed to tell one of those aristocrats jokes right now?

1446
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:55,180
No.

1447
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:55,880
No.

1448
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,040
Please don't.

1449
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,640
Well, you heard one of those aristocrats jokes.

1450
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,920
I heard all of them.

1451
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,860
Did you see the movie of that?

1452
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:05,680
No, I didn't.

1453
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:05,800
No.

1454
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,180
I was misfortunate and was left in a drainage ditch.

1455
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,360
Yeah, that's right.

1456
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:11,680
No.

1457
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,760
People with orange skin.

1458
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:20,060
But when I grew to be a man, which I had actually two growths coming out.

1459
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,160
One was a man and one was a swollen foot.

1460
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,580
Well, but it looked kind of man-like.

1461
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,220
And also, they're supposed to be orange.

1462
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,220
It added to my power amongst the people.

1463
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,900
I grew to become their king later.

1464
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,460
Later, I became an elder statesman.

1465
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,320
And then I just left the place.

1466
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,640
I can't remember where I started.

1467
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:50,780
A lot of primitive cultures do treat their dwarves and deformed people as mystic beings.

1468
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,980
They gave me things to smoke.

1469
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,720
They gave me chicken sandwiches and lovely senoritas would comb my few hairs.

1470
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,700
Yeah, see, they figured since you were so different that you were chosen or singled out by the god.

1471
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,340
Absolutely.

1472
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,980
You were special to the gods.

1473
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:13,960
That's why you had such a large and such a small brain, you know.

1474
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:14,380
Yeah.

1475
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:19,480
I can say those words at the same time without chewing gum or something.

1476
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,360
I know what's going on there.

1477
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:22,840
I can feel it.

1478
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,600
I've noticed.

1479
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,220
Have you noticed what the walls look like right now?

1480
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,480
No, I haven't.

1481
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,880
Okay, I'm sending vibrations not only of peace and Saturnalia.

1482
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,680
But I'm...

1483
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:35,960
Slaternalia.

1484
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:36,740
Slaternalia.

1485
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,520
We call it out here.

1486
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,120
I'm also sending...

1487
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,360
Geez, what is this stuff?

1488
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,960
It's got a long chemical name.

1489
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:46,920
Hydro...

1490
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:48,640
I don't know.

1491
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,680
So you're sending peace and vibes of hydrocyanidic acid or something?

1492
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:58,300
It must be the hydrocyanidic acid that makes the drippiness of the walls.

1493
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,960
It's tetrahydrocyanide of some kind.

1494
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:01,260
I don't know.

1495
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,500
I guess there's ten of them or four or something.

1496
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,280
I see.

1497
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:04,880
Well, I'm sorry.

1498
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,700
I'm really honored that you're sending vibes like that our way.

1499
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,520
Well, you can use it as you will.

1500
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,260
You know, you can have a great radio show, have a wonderful life.

1501
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:23,940
Well, I'm going to have a college online course, a media-packed online course in practical

1502
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:27,240
subgeniusness and hardcore dobsism.

1503
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,060
Wow.

1504
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,560
In November and December.

1505
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,500
That's why I've been...

1506
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,200
I've actually done a whole lot of shows ahead of time.

1507
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,860
So that I won't have to...

1508
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:37,400
I don't have to work on them while I'm being a Professor Stang.

1509
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,620
Do you have to prepare a meat package or do you...

1510
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:41,800
Yeah.

1511
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,060
Yeah.

1512
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:42,880
I have to have...

1513
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,980
In fact, there's a syllabus and prospectus you can look at on maybelogic.org.

1514
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:57,680
It's the people that did the Robert Anton Wilson movie called Maybe Logic based on his

1515
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,960
thought processes, which are maybe logic.

1516
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,800
And they have this academy.

1517
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:08,680
They have this academy online with a bunch of hipster types like, you know, are you

1518
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,700
serious or not?

1519
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,540
And who else?

1520
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,000
I don't know.

1521
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,340
Various wise men and show-offy academic...

1522
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,060
And wise crackers.

1523
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,200
Wise crackers.

1524
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,600
And they called me up and said, hey, you want to do some kind of a course?

1525
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:29,220
And I said, yeah, I'll teach people how to run their own cult.

1526
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,120
I will share this secret profit-making formula.

1527
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:34,840
With you.

1528
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:34,920
With you.

1529
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,540
And the secret wisdom.

1530
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,240
The secret teachings of all ages.

1531
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,960
That is...

1532
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,760
That's beautiful.

1533
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,880
And do you have many students?

1534
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,960
Have they enrolled yet?

1535
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:48,260
I don't know if there are any new timers or old agers.

1536
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,080
I don't...

1537
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:49,920
I don't even...

1538
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,320
I haven't checked that out.

1539
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,400
That's why I mention it.

1540
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,560
So as to make sure that maybe someday there will be some.

1541
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,120
Because that starts in November at maybelogic.org.

1542
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,600
There's also maybelogic.com, which is strictly...

1543
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:09,020
It's strictly about the Robert Anton Wilson movie and brain cell.

1544
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,220
Yes.

1545
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,220
He has a full collection of brain cells, actually.

1546
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,000
Who, Wilson?

1547
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:15,400
Yeah.

1548
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,580
Well, like most of us, he probably started out with such a thing.

1549
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:24,920
I thought Timothy Leary had a lot of brain cells left for somebody in his situation.

1550
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,160
Yeah, but they were misshapen.

1551
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,920
Well, you should talk.

1552
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,300
Oh, I'm not...

1553
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,320
I'm not casting...

1554
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,440
Your brain cell...

1555
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:32,740
You've...

1556
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:32,920
I...

1557
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,580
Dave only has one brain cell.

1558
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,640
I don't have a brain cell, but it's shaped like a totem pole.

1559
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,160
Well, thank God.

1560
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,440
At least it has a rhythmic feeling to it.

1561
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,960
I was just saying that Mr. Leary, in his case, had hundreds of thousands of brain cells that

1562
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,220
were all shaped like little...

1563
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,640
little shards of glass.

1564
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,660
I thought they were paisleys.

1565
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,220
But you could smoke them.

1566
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,520
Anyway, Dave, you have to go now.

1567
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:02,180
And I'm going to shut off everything except the tapes, because you're listening to the

1568
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,560
Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slice.

1569
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:12,720
And for more information about Subgenius and all of that, all of it, really all of everything...

1570
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,100
Or to be relieved of information.

1571
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:20,920
To be relieved of anything, check out subgenius.com if you really want to know.

1572
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:26,920
The music in the background, by the way, this whole time has been from Stephen Kent and

1573
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:32,280
Transmission, Oil and Water CD.

1574
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:32,620


1575
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:33,900
He...

1576
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,700
He blows one of those didgeridoo things.

1577
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:38,960
Among others.

1578
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,440
But anyway, Dave, we have to go now.

1579
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:42,740
Bye.

1580
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,380
Okay, goodbye.

1581
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,100
We love you.

1582
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,320
No.

1583
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,340
Don't get his hopes up like that, Princess Sweet.

1584
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:48,940
Bye.

1585
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,000
Bye.

1586
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:55,740
Bye.

1587
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,100
Bye.

1588
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,020
Bye.

1589
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:57,400
Bye.

1590
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:58,820
Bye.

1591
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:58,820


1592
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,340
Bye.

1593
00:53:59,440 --> 00:53:59,740
Bye.

1594
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:00,680
Bye.

1595
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:01,920
Bye.

1596
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,460
Bye.

1597
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:02,460


1598
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:02,460


1599
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:02,980
Bye.

1600
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,120
Bye.

1601
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:04,560
Bye.

1602
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:04,560


1603
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:04,560


1604
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:04,560


1605
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,400
Bye.

1606
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:17,660
Bye.

1607
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,680
Bye.

1608
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:22,780
Bye.

1609
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:22,800
Bye.

1610
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:22,860
Bye.

1611
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:22,860


1612
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:22,920
Bye.

1613
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,060
Bye.

1614
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:23,560
Bye.

1615
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:23,560


1616
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:23,620
Bye.

1617
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:24,620
Bye.

1618
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,360
Bye.

1619
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:27,700
Bye.

1620
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,400
Bye.

1621
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,960
I don't know.

1622
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,200
Oh, look at your hedges.

1623
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:59,380
Oh, look at your hedges.

1624
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:29,380
Oh, look at your hedges.

1625
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:44,660
Oh, look at your hedges.

1626
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:21,480
Oh, look at your hedges.

1627
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:59,380
Oh, look at your hedges.

1628
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:29,380
Oh, look at your hedges.

1629
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:59,380
Oh, look at your hedges.

1630
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:29,360
Oh, look at your hedges.

1631
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:41,500
Oh, look at your hedges.

1632
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:47,460
Oh, look at your hedges.
