1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,820
Hello, I'm scared. Let's see a new echo.

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:24,000
Good evening and welcome to the subgenius radio hour of slime.

3
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,000
And today please let us know if you get on the stream that leads to an numeric grade

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000


5
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,500
We hope this video was exciting to you all and oh and send you all the best compliments

6
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,820
throughout the day until then above all, here's beöß...

7
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,300
BOB!

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:57,860
vibration

9
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,780
Hello.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:00:59,920
Hello.

11
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,960
So, Dr. Lazarus takes you through Relaxation Exercises 2.

13
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,860
The material may not be reproduced.

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,380
Relaxation 2.

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,320
Should you have comments, criticisms, or suggestions regarding the cassette book program,

16
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,820
please forward them directly to

17
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,920
the technical staff,

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,060
Division for the Blind and Physically Handicapped,

19
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,240
Library of Congress,

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,820
Washington, D.C.,

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,240
205-422.

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,220
Over 21 years, Mr. Lazarus...

23
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,700
This concludes the instructions.

24
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,740
Because people like you are helping us stay on the radio.

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,940
You can't buy a miracle,

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,660
but you can certainly stand behind a miracle ministry.

27
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,720
Like a bunch of...

28
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,220
...on the radio right now.

29
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:46,780
Right.

30
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
Okay, you got them there?

31
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,780
You can probably feel something of a vibration moving through that radio

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,260
from perhaps over the airwaves,

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,300
from us and the spirit of...

34
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:57,700
I did it.

35
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,420
...the radio's turned off.

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,320
Pardon me?

37
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,620
Our radio's turned off.

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,160
That's okay. It'll still work.

39
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,480
Well, after...

40
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,900
Stick your finger in the light plug.

41
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,540
After the phone call is through,

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,640
go ahead and do as they said.

43
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,500
And if you want to get the vibrations good,

44
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,180
turn the volume all the way up.

45
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:14,660
Right.

46
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,240
Isn't that right?

47
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,120
And you should be standing on one leg when you do that.

48
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,640
And then what?

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,180
Unbutton the middle button of your shirt

50
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,740
and send us a dollar.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,500
Put your hand up.

52
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,680
Put your hand up.

53
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,680
I know.

54
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,500
Uh, really now,

55
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,580
are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks,

56
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,060
or do you...

57
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,040
And I wouldn't infer that our secondary state is Antichrist,

58
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,620
but I'm telling you that preparations are being made

59
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,960
and that the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand

60
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,780
and that if you plan to get saved,

61
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,660
you had better do it.

62
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,840
Now, there will be a day not in the too far distant future

63
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,880
in which Antichrist will be revealed

64
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,020
and the mark of the beast will be introduced

65
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:13,600
and people will have a number in their hands and in their foreheads.

66
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,320
So our demand for energy will be met from our own production

67
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,680
and our own conservation.

68
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,140
But there's the fact that the earth,

69
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,820
the clarions,

70
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,560
and some of the other people that you've named

71
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,760
are actually being controlled by aliens from outer space.

72
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,460
By UFOs.

73
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,460
Come on.

74
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:28,460


75
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,320
This is really...

76
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,180
Come on.

77
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:32,780
Come on.

78
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,540
Come on.

79
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:33,840
Come on.

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,120
Come on.

81
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,180
Come on.

82
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,180


83
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,800
Come on.

84
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:34,940


85
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,380
Come on.

86
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:35,920
Come on.

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:35,920


88
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:35,920


89
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,020
Come on.

90
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,200
Hmm.

91
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,620
Also in your literature,

92
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,980
I noticed connections with aliens

93
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,160
and the God of Wrath who visits us every once in a while

94
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,360
and talks to, we've got to drop this name in here,

95
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,600
Bob Dobbs, the High Muckety Muck.

96
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, the main thing we'd have to say about,

97
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,120
that Bob would want us to say about aliens

98
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,640
is,

99
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,760
number one, don't trust them.

100
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,880
Number two, if you've been contacted by aliens,

101
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,580
come to us and we will sort the thing out.

102
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,820
We'll let you know whether the ones that are talking to you

103
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,960
are telling the truth

104
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,580
or whether they're just pulling the wool over your eyes.

105
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,160
The aliens are not benevolent then.

106
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,100
Chances are they're...

107
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,780
There's some that are friendly.

108
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,700
Yeah, chances are they want to cook you.

109
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,740
Cook you.

110
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,360
That's right.

111
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,760
That's interesting.

112
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,320
There was a group did a song on that, you know.

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,240
The Stranglers, in fact.

114
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,800
Oh, that's one of those rock and roll...

115
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:27,800


116
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,580
The rock and roll groups, right?

117
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,460
Dr. Drummond?

118
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,500
Tools of the Conspiracy.

119
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:31,780
Yeah.

120
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,200
The rock groups are Tools of the Conspiracy.

121
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,880
Most of them.

122
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,220
Yeah.

123
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:35,440
Right.

124
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,340
We found a few that aren't.

125
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,220
The Stranglers aren't.

126
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,380
Actually, the Stranglers aren't.

127
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,340
One of the Stranglers is a practicing subgenius.

128
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,220
A couple of Doctors for Bob is one

129
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,560
and The Abominations was another we've heard of.

130
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:46,980
Okay.

131
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,840
We're not here to destroy

132
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,500
We are here to admire

133
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,260
We are waiting for the UFO

134
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,120
Waiting for the UFO

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,880
Waiting for the UFO

136
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,860
If you have your Bibles with me, look at verse 6.

137
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,520
And hath made us kings and priests unto God his Father.

138
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,480
To him be glory and dominion forever and ever.

139
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,680
Behold, he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him.

140
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,740
A space vessel, identity unknown.

141
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,240
I could show you a flying saucer and you'd swear it was something that I got from Eric.

142
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,560
Sure.

143
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,140
You'd show me a real flying saucer?

144
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,460
And you'd say I got it from Eric.

145
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,400
I'd give you a thousand dollars to your religion if you can produce one flying saucer.

146
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,600
At least, Joe, that is my opinion of what I think you would think.

147
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,780
And I've seen a lot of saucer people.

148
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,400
But I can't talk about it, you know, because back in the zoo.

149
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,700
So we just gotta wait, you know, until 1985 and then, oh yeah, freeze those cats in the sink.

150
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,480
The crew of the UFO is an especially designed robot human.

151
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,240
It was built in...

152
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,720
And fire.

153
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,640
Disintegrated, Captain.

154
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,460
Oh, fuck.

155
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,480
Not too much.

156
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,280
And here come the strangers.

157
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,460
This is the most weirdest thing.

158
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,620
It has bugged me.

159
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,500
This has been 20 or 25 years ago.

160
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,640
Okay, tell us about it.

161
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,800
Yeah, it's fascinated me.

162
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,040
It has absolutely not bugged me.

163
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,300
I always believe in UFOs.

164
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,100
I believe in reincarnation.

165
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,420
I know reincarnation is right.

166
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:26,480
Right.

167
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,740
And I was standing there waiting on the bus.

168
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,800
And here comes a guy.

169
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,860
And he didn't even have a new car or anything.

170
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,640
I heard...

171
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,600
I had been reading about the UFOs.

172
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,300
And they said, well, okay, there's people out of space that's actually living here with us.

173
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,180
Some of them even married those people.

174
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,200
You know all that junk, you know?

175
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,560
I don't say it's junk.

176
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,760
I just say that's the way they're told.

177
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,320
Right.

178
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,120
All right.

179
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,220
And here comes a guy.

180
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,380
Come along there.

181
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,960
And I'm waiting on the bus.

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,960
And he picked me up.

183
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,980
And he was...

184
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,620
A blonde-haired guy.

185
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,060
Light complexion, kind of like I am.

186
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,660
But he had the bluest eyes.

187
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,660
And he was so nice.

188
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,540
He never said anything other than he was a very...

189
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,720
Just a wonderful person, you know, you'd like to ride downtown with, you know?

190
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,040
Mm-hmm.

191
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,340
And...

192
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,400
But he fascinated me.

193
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,380
I have never got him out of my mind.

194
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,020
He had eyes.

195
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,700
He looked absolutely to me.

196
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,580
And I got eyes like I can look to people myself.

197
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,060
But boy, he had me beat.

198
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,640
Yeah.

199
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,720
He took me downtown.

200
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,600
He didn't ask me no questions.

201
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,740
He didn't tell me anything.

202
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,240
But he...

203
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,440
I'll tell you, I never saw a human being like this man.

204
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,200
And I'll tell you, I don't turn on the men.

205
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,000
I turn on the women.

206
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,360
Well, another hot day.

207
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,300
The sixth...

208
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,820
And completely ignore old line one.

209
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,460
You're on the air.

210
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:45,780
Go ahead.

211
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,400
Make a little noise.

212
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:46,580
Pardon?

213
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,180
Yeah.

214
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,380
Let me talk to that subgenius.

215
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,620
I am worried to death.

216
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,260
Okay.

217
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,620
They're here.

218
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,020
Let me talk to him.

219
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,920
Maybe they can put you at ease.

220
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,280
Okay.

221
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,280


222
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,540
Did you call in last time?

223
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,080
Huh?

224
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm not sure.

225
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,400


226
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,400


227
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,240
Did you call in last time we were on?

228
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,540
Didn't.

229
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,600
But listen, I'll tell you what.

230
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,560
Anyway, it was still a little bit dusk when he talked about it.

231
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,360
He said this is up in the east and I've got some super vision.

232
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,440
Anyway, I walked out of the door and looked up in the east and saw this bright star.

233
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,320
He didn't know what...

234
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,380
Or Snow didn't know whether it was a star or a planet or whether it was a...

235
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:26,380


236
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:26,380


237
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,800
Whether it was a balloon or what it was.

238
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,920
And I walked out there in the backyard in my pajamas.

239
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,260
I looked at this thing and I saw some people coming out of that damn thing.

240
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,300
Boy.

241
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,020
Pardon me.

242
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,740
You saw this thing.

243
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,120
Was it close by?

244
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,500
No.

245
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,540
It was way out there in the east in the sky.

246
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,540
Well, you could see people in it?

247
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,820
Yeah.

248
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,080
He said he had super vision.

249
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,120
People came out of that thing.

250
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:51,980
Okay.

251
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,320
Now we have someone, an eyewitness here.

252
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,440
Let's take advantage of it.

253
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,880
Would you explain what they looked like and...

254
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,880
I couldn't.

255
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,000
It was too far out and I couldn't see what they looked like or anything.

256
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,900
But it was a weird thing and it scared me and I've come back in the house and locked

257
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,400
the door.

258
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,320
Holy cats.

259
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,860
What a weird looking thing.

260
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,660
We finally got one.

261
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,240
We found a flying saucer.

262
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,540
Can you tell us what...

263
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,540
There was a half a dozen people come out of that thing and they're just kind of scattered.

264
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,220
Yeah.

265
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,820
Did they land on the ground?

266
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,480
No, I didn't see them land.

267
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,460
Do you have a feeling that they're still amongst us?

268
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,880
They're among us.

269
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,400
Yeah, I've ridden in them but I've never seen one.

270
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,240
They are among us and it's got me worried and I thought maybe you'd know something about

271
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,340
it.

272
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,600
Well, maybe one of our listeners will.

273
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,780
Will you give us a date and an approximate time that that occurred?

274
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
That was two days ago.

275
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,820
Two days ago.

276
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,880
Did they have blonde hair and blue eyes?

277
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
I couldn't tell.

278
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,720
I couldn't tell for sure.

279
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,300
I wish we'd seen that.

280
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,640
We are not alone.

281
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,340
Yeah.

282
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,800
It's them or us.

283
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,880
Okay, thank you.

284
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,460
Or to put it that way, we're not alone.

285
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:54,460


286
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:54,460


287
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:54,460


288
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:54,460


289
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:54,460


290
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:54,460


291
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,360
I don't think it's in space dialect.

292
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,180
We are not alone.

293
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,560
Yeah, there...

294
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,440
That sounds like...

295
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,060
That sounds like...

296
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,520
Well, what I hear them say.

297
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:01,820
Yeah.

298
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,720
It's frightening, isn't it?

299
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,040
It sure is.

300
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:05,540
Okay.

301
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
Well, stay inside the rest of the night.

302
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:07,940
We'll talk to you later.

303
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,560
Okay.

304
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:08,860
Good night.

305
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,780
...gathering project of the aliens of the UFO.

306
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,320
Oh, Bob, today.

307
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,120
The aliens of the UFO are energy manipulators.

308
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,460
I thought, you know, there is a lot of talk about flying saucers and the whole thing

309
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:24,460


310
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:24,460


311
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:24,460


312
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:24,460


313
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:24,460


314
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:24,460


315
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:24,460


316
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,940
I want you to meet a man this evening that's actually seen some 300 flying saucers.

317
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,120
And your name, sir?

318
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,660
My name's Elwood P. Suggins.

319
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,980
On the club, Mike B.

320
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,440
On the field.

321
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,820
Man cannot participate in long space expeditions.

322
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,600
NASA has scientifically verified and kept very quiet

323
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,940
the fact that the unstoppable cosmic rays to which every astronaut has been exposed

324
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:01,180
destroys brain cells at the rate of 1% every four months.

325
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,880
Since the neurons of the adult human brain do not reproduce,

326
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,280
a space expedition represents irreparable brain damage.

327
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,720
I've ridden one, but I've never seen one.

328
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,220
By remote control, or how did they get a hold of you?

329
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,300
Well, actually, it was one of what's known as the close encounter

330
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:19,580
of the human brain.

331
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,220
It was the third time.

332
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,260
I was driving in my car late at night, one night, out in the country road,

333
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,820
just like you've heard in all the UFO stories.

334
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,280
And the beam came down from the sky, stopped my car, took control of me.

335
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,900
And the next thing I knew, I had powers and abilities far beyond those of...

336
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,540
The knowledge must have come from outer space.

337
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,960
I didn't know I was going to die.

338
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:03,980
I knew I was going to die.

339
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,780
I knew I was going to die.

340
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,220
Ah, yes.

341
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,620
This is one of four hours of slack that'll culminate in...

342
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,980
Number 901.

343
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:28,760
or 902, I don't know what, all about our friends from out of space and X-Day. I have to do all of

344
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:36,740
these shows at once, fast, and so they might all start out the exact same way, because they're all

345
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:43,700
composed of the same four basic parts, each of which, of course, has its own 500 insane, totally

346
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:54,420
new parts. The first of these would be the ancient, and I mean truly ancient, subgenius media barrage

347
00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:02,300
tape number two about UFOs and Bob, which was assembled in 1981 by the very earliest, most

348
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:09,940
primitive subgenius doctors working under even more primitive conditions under Bob. You'll hear,

349
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,620
or possibly have heard, the infant phylo drummer.

350
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:21,140
The baby puzzling evidence. Little glass madness. The teeny tiny versions of old, long gone dead

351
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:27,980
subgeniuses, such as David Boone and Dr. X. May they rest in peace. And even, you will hear,

352
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:35,920
the teeny tiny baby Reverend Stang, yours truly. Now, the second part of all of these shows will

353
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:43,620
come from Reverend Susie the Floozy's barrage edits about X-Day, when the aliens will come,

354
00:13:43,700 --> 00:14:00,220
from her show, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse, on WREK in Atlanta. Oh, yes. Nobody can cut and sling like Susie.

355
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:08,700
And we'll also be hearing live recordings from the most recent actual subgenius worship event,

356
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,240
X-Day. 6X-Day this time. Last July's yearly,

357
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,180
and the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one, the last one. And, of course,

358
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:23,060
number four, we'll hear the usual hour of slack bits from ESO Radio on WCSB Cleveland,

359
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:30,880
with Chad Smith and Lonesome Cowboy David, plus the unusual collages of Fernand and Andy Lee Murr.

360
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:40,780
Oh, yes, and number five, the music of So-So Dada, heard here in the background with his X-Day 6

361
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,440
noise opera, as heard.

362
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,720
Like so much of this on alt.binary slack that placed on the internet.

363
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,620
Oh, yes.

364
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh, yes.

365
00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:01,160
Watch the heavenlies. It's your spaceship out of control. Does that sound fearful, my friend?

366
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,680
What'd you say, Jesus? A final great space event as Christ returned to the earth.

367
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,300
This is just another one of those kooky concepts that people get and try to

368
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:19,100
pass it off for gospel truth. You continue to believe in the rapture and look for Jesus Christ,

369
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,900
because he's coming very soon. Let's get into our study of God's word today.

370
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,940
You ain't gonna let that go to waste of you, Lord. That would be a pit and a shame.

371
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,480
That's a good, eh? Maybe I ought to put someone down there to enjoy it.

372
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,180
Gabriel, I'm going down there. Yes, Lord. I want you to be my working boss here while I'm gone.

373
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,780
Yes, Lord. Keep everything neat and tidy.

374
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,280
Yes, Lord.

375
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,080
Yes, Lord. You know that spade that fell a little while ago? Tender that, too.

376
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,580
Yes, Lord. I guess that's about all.

377
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,020
He's coming as King of Kings and Lord of Lords, so you can just relax today that regardless of

378
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,720
what the news media around the world says, we know who's in charge, and praise God,

379
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,920
we know exactly how everything is going to come out.

380
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,160
In revelation, likewise manner. Well, listen.

381
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,660
I'm gonna crack that wing. I'm gonna get back. And I seen one of them flying right by,

382
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,780
over my car, and they stopped my car, and they took me in, and they said,

383
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,900
Jimmy, Jimmy, we're real. We're here. We're here to help you. You understand?

384
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:27,160
We're here to help you and your mother and all those dear to you, and your friends, and Brother Roloff,

385
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,080
and we're gonna stop the evil that's going on in the world.

386
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,240
We're gonna come down and we're gonna help those evil people find themselves.

387
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,420
So you're gonna help us, Jimmy. You're gonna help us.

388
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,620
You're gonna tell us which ones are the evil people that we need to correct.

389
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,480
Now, you're gonna help us, Jimmy, okay?

390
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,560
And then they got back in their spaceship and they flew off, and I just found myself in my car again,

391
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:54,280
and I drove on down to that 7-Eleven, and my father, of course, he's dead, but they're keeping the water on him.

392
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,780
He's okay. They're keeping him cool. People say I'm crazy. I don't mind black people and colored people, but you know...

393
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,940
I talked to a fella not long ago, and you know what he told me? It's a sad thing.

394
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,900
He told me, he said, I see little men, and he held his fingers like this.

395
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,640
It's illusions. He said, I see little men.

396
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,340
About three inches high.

397
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,900
He said, I'm over in Spain or somewhere like that. He said, I even go over into a place like that.

398
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,860
And he said, I see these little objects and these little men and all these little things.

399
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,680
And if your heart doesn't go out for something like that, I want you to know my heart goes out to people like that.

400
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,380
And I want you to know something else. Those people are actually, you know what they're doing?

401
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,300
Those people are really reaching out, trying to find something.

402
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,640
And if they can just realize that Jesus has the answer, that Christ has everything they need,

403
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,260
that they're looking for, and Christ can let them get on high,

404
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,400
and lift them up and put them on the highway, and give them joy and speak love, give them peace in their life,

405
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,260
you'll not want any more dope, you'll not want any more alcohol, you'll not want any more...

406
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,140
No, don't let me take those pills, no!

407
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,120
I don't want to take those pills from outer space, no!

408
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,280
I don't want to take them pills. No, no, no!

409
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,200
Have another one. Have another one. Have three more.

410
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,680
That was fine.

411
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,100
Hey, I feel, I feel, I feel great!

412
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,680
Hey! Hey, where's Bob? I want to go see Bob now!

413
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:40,020
I'm going to talk to Bob! Hey, Bob! Hey, what's up, Bob? Hey, it's a video! I want to see Bob!

414
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:55,780
And I need to talk directly to you, Bob.

415
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:06,700
And I don't write real, real so good, real good work.

416
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,080
It's...

417
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,260
But...

418
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,940
At least I can, uh...

419
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,500
Uh...

420
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,120
I...

421
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,240
Talk, talk, talk, Bob.

422
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,740
So...

423
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,680
Please, uh...

424
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:26,920
Um...

425
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,680
Send maybe some more...

426
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,740
Uh...

427
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,220
Those, you know, uh...

428
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,920
Those pills...

429
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,080
Bob, uh...

430
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,880
Uh...

431
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,660
Uh...

432
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,420
Those beeps that you hear, friends, uh...

433
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,400
Those beeps are...

434
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,840
Are special codes.

435
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,940
You slow this tape down to one...

436
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,340
One...

437
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,820
One one-hundredths of...

438
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,680
Of the normal speed.

439
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,400
Whatever your speed is, and...

440
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,600
And you'll hear the...

441
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,940
The secret messages and those little beeps that cover up what the conspiracy must never know.

442
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:07,820
And neither should you, because you'll be better off and closer to Bob when you don't know who Bob's friends really may be when they show up at your door.

443
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,360
Bab, bab...

444
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:09,540
Huh...?

445
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:09,800
You didn't hear me?

446
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,020
Not this time.

447
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,440
What do you mean?

448
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,680
часов

449
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,900
Soon just going to be here in the early hours with two fr一點 free

450
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:20,900


451
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,860
In just a go!

452
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,340
Scaredy cats!

453
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,120
I couldn't understand it.

454
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,960
A thing they said it was a crazy beat.

455
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,580
It just stopped me dead rock.

456
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,160
Listen to me.

457
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,600
We've got the Warren people.

458
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,340
There's aluminum things out there.

459
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:05,720
We see.

460
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,740
Damn it.

461
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,420
Oh, Virgil.

462
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,280
No.

463
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,600
We don't have time for sex hurt.

464
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,560
We've got to call the army, the navy, the air force.

465
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,680
We see.

466
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,160
Virgil.

467
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,300
Virgil.

468
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,040
Friends, remember the old days.

469
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,540
Well, that's where all of that came from.

470
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,220
The old, old, the day.

471
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,420
The actual day that they talk about.

472
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The day.

473
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,060
The day before the computers.

474
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,600
Before the digital mixing.

475
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,820
The day of the cassette deck and the reel-to-reel splicing tape.

476
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:58,440
The days of media barrage number two about UFOs from the year of our ord, 19th and 81.

477
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,460
Welcome, futurists, cyberphiles, and the rest of you dateless wonders.

478
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:23,040
And now to push this convention into hyperspace, the man who put the star in Star Wars, a real bird in the Darth Vader's saddle.

479
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,980
Bob.

480
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,620
Bob.

481
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,560
Bob.

482
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,620
You still got it, Bob.

483
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,120
Hello and welcome.

484
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,640
Our topic today is UFOs.

485
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,540
Of course, that's just the start.

486
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,320
Throughout recorded history, human society has been haunted by reports of unidentified...

487
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:46,800
flying objects in our skies, many of which have defied all attempts at scientific explanation or understanding.

488
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,100
What are these phenomenon and how can they be explained?

489
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:57,920
With me today is Terence McKenna, a philosopher and thinker of note in the area of altered states of consciousness and alternative realities.

490
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:09,320
Yes, well, the ordinary approach to the UFOs has been to view them as visitors or intruders from a nearby star system that have come in the form of...

491
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,320


492
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,320


493
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,320


494
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:17,860
metal ships for reasons of trade or scientific investigation or military conquest or missionary activities.

495
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,400
Let me tell you, you're not the missionary type. You never last.

496
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,860
And incidentally, you want to do mankind a real service? Tell funnier jokes.

497
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,680
And therefore, it is threatening.

498
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,840
This is one of the reasons that I think it relates to the psychedelic experience.

499
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,300
Because the psychedelic experience is like a UFO in the air.

500
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,300


501
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,300


502
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,860
It's like a man encounter on demand.

503
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,640
Whoa, another acid flashback.

504
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,920
Whoa, another acid flashback.

505
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,080
Whoa, another acid flashback.

506
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,600
Half your yellow will lift you into orbit.

507
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,220
Real rocket man.

508
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,280
I'll take two.

509
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,580
That would probably kill a horse.

510
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,340
I said I'll take two.

511
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,020
Whatever.

512
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:13,580
They decide to have this curious, symmetry-breaking kind of experience.

513
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,020
What I have tried to say to the UFO community is...

514
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,640
I don't want my mom to die.

515
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,960
Hey, mister, do you need some help?

516
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,440
Let him go, Ralph. He knows what he's doing.

517
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:36,020
We will not really have a deep understanding of what the contact experience is until we include data from the psychedelic experience as a legitimate...

518
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,920
We will not really have a deep understanding of what the contact experience is until we include data from the psychedelic experience as a legitimate...

519
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,700
Yeah, that to be included when looking at the problem.

520
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:51,220
The UFO phenomenon is a modern manifestation of pixies, elves, fairies, sprites, demons, whatever you wish to call them.

521
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,440
Angels.

522
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,600
Angels.

523
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,120
Angels.

524
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,260
Angel Baby

525
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,400
My Angel Baby

526
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,120
He tasks like hell

527
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:17,920
Being with you dear I would never stay away without you near

528
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:25,420
Because I love you, I love you, I do

529
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:33,300
Angel baby, my angel baby

530
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:41,320
Baby, I love you, I love you

531
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:48,620
No one would love you like I do

532
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,980
Angel baby, my angel baby

533
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:15,140
Angel baby, my angel baby

534
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:46,240
Angel baby, my angel baby

535
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,060
Angel baby, my angel baby

536
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:54,080
Angel baby, I love you so

537
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:03,280
Angel baby, my angel baby

538
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:08,160
either like invasions from another world or virtual impossibilities.

539
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,100
I think that the flying saucer is knocking on our door

540
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,660
to remind us of the depths and strangeness on this planet.

541
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,280
Who would have the best place?

542
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,980
I don't see it.

543
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,380
Yes? Who is it?

544
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,160
What happens is going to happen to you and all of you.

545
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,260
And it's going to be worse.

546
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,100
A lot worse.

547
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,580
Oh, honey, don't be so naive. That's how the world works.

548
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,780
But wouldn't there be a natural stage in the evolution of a society

549
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,440
where it enters into a kind of interplanetary discourse?

550
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,100
Yeah, right.

551
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:01,600
Take this kind of data and deal with it the same way we might deal with our lunch or our toothpaste.

552
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,280
And not think of it as being...

553
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,740
Some terrible possibility of an invasion of the lizard people from outer space.

554
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,820
One possible view of the flying saucer is

555
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,320
that it is a kind of projection from the consciousness of the planet.

556
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,940
That it is dire.

557
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,000
That it is, in fact, a kind of alchemical object

558
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,020
haunting human historical time

559
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,520
with a symbol of totality.

560
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,540
The kind of totality that our religions and our mystical yearnings

561
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,280
are so...

562
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,900
So at pains to concretize for us.

563
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,280
What?

564
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,300
This was Jung's view.

565
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,080
How?

566
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,180
The Swiss psychologist Carl Jung,

567
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,500
who in 1953 wrote a book called

568
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,460
Flying Saucers, a modern myth of things seen in the sky.

569
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,900
So in the fall of 53,

570
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,440
for three or four months altogether,

571
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,320
I drove all around the country

572
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,360
interviewing people who had been mentioned in the early flying saucer books.

573
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,100
I'm getting this book on UFOs.

574
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,100
Did you know they're real?

575
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,240
But there's a huge comic conspiracy to cover it up.

576
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,580
Oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy.

577
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,020
So naive.

578
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:11,920
Who's naive?

579
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,800
I didn't say anything.

580
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,440
In the fall of 1953,

581
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,320
which was the time that I got into the UFO field.

582
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,500
So he got into it a year or so before I did.

583
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,160
How?

584
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,800
Carl Jung saw in their circular form,

585
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:31,720
in their scintillating, shining, alchemical, brilliant,

586
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,480
a symbol of human wholeness,

587
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
to interpret them psychologically,

588
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,620
to interpret them as one would interpret a dream.

589
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:45,000
I hope that if you all haven't seen a flying saucer,

590
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,220
that eventually you will see one.

591
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,640
If you haven't seen one,

592
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,360
my advice would be not to look for them in outer space

593
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,540
or even in another dimension.

594
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,480
If you look deep inside yourself,

595
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,240
there you will see them.

596
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,420
In a way, this kind of explanation is very satisfying.

597
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,720
However, it is not satisfying to the person

598
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:14,820
who has immediately undergone a very strange experience.

599
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,940
Unless such a person were told

600
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,300
there are great messages of hope for the planet.

601
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,380
On some occasions, the messages are received by shortwave.

602
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,780
On other times, by means of modulated light beam reception equipment.

603
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,860
On a few occasions, they've even come by long-distance telephone.

604
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,880
Do you have all of that equipment in your home?

605
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,640
Yes, sir, we do.

606
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,500
Well, could we listen to this particular tape?

607
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,260
You certainly may.

608
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,240
Fine, let's listen.

609
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,780
Greetings in the light of our radiant one.

610
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,940
I am T'Vala.

611
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,340
My purpose in speaking with you, my brothers and sisters,

612
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,380
is in reference to what is termed your world situation.

613
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,200
As all of you know, your planet at this time

614
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,720
is experiencing a period of great unrest.

615
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,860
For instance, imagine, for example, that you are in a world of chaos.

616
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:00,860


617
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,980
Just as a possibility that some naïve, well-meaning alien should come down

618
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,960
and try to address a joint session of commerce.

619
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,700
Who's naïve?

620
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,420
I didn't say anything!

621
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,740
Well, what good would it do?

622
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,920
So naïve.

623
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,320
There would be sensation on all of the tabloids and newspapers for a few weeks

624
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,180
and hand you back the Monday night football.

625
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,620
And so, what good would additional information or inspiration be that came from outside?

626
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,240
Let's assume then, for the moment that we are being visited by these aliens,

627
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,780
as I presume you assume.

628
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,540
That's right.

629
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,420
What's the need for them?

630
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:30,860
Why are they there?

631
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:30,860


632
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:30,860


633
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:30,860


634
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:30,860


635
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:30,860


636
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:30,860


637
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,420
Why are they bothering with us?

638
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,160
Well, it's a very interesting planet at this particular time in its history.

639
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,500
I mean, maybe there's only once every 500 million years that a particular planet goes

640
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,080
through this phase of civilization.

641
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,720
Last time this happened was several million years ago.

642
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,780
It's happening again.

643
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,040
They all gather around.

644
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,040
I mean, like a volcano ready to go off.

645
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,440
There's a volcano waiting to erupt into the Pacific ground.

646
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,780
That's really hot, isn't it?

647
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:57,980
Yeah.

648
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,960
It looks like we're watching fireworks, doesn't it?

649
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,360
But we're not.

650
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:00,500
We're just watching it.

651
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:00,500


652
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:00,500


653
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:00,500


654
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:00,500


655
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:00,500


656
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:00,500


657
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,940
That's what's coming out of the center of the Earth.

658
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,060
Wow.

659
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,040
Here are all the dogs.

660
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,900
There are no dogs.

661
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,100
There's nothing living on Earth.

662
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,220
Not even dinosaurs and three-starred monsters.

663
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:13,920
Nothing.

664
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,460
There's nothing but land and volcanoes and the molten lava coming out and shooting up

665
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,840
at 2,300 degrees.

666
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,420
Burn it!

667
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,420
Send it to Hell!

668
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,340
We left the Earth, and we could see the earth.

669
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:30,340


670
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,840
I could see a hurricane down in the Gulf area from the craft.

671
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,020
I took photos, but none of that.

672
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,980
I took photos of the Earth, leaving the Earth.

673
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,220
I took photos of approaching the moon.

674
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,060
This is in 1956.

675
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,580
Can you imagine how I felt?

676
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,120
This is before any of the astronauts went anywhere to speak of anything.

677
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:54,000
I think the Russians got the other side of the moon photographed, and incidentally,

678
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,320
the slides that I have, the overlays, fit right on top of that long before we ever got

679
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
there, which in itself is evidence that the moon is not the only thing that's in the

680
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,320


681
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,320


682
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,320


683
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,320


684
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,320


685
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,320


686
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,320


687
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,700
picture.

688
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,160
I don't know if I'd be able to see the moon, but I'm not trying to prove that I've been

689
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,560
to the moon.

690
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,160
I don't care too much about that.

691
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,860
Beautiful, isn't it?

692
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,740
Where are we then?

693
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,420
Well, this is technically what we call deep space.

694
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,020
Well, it's technically what I'd call sodal.

695
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,920
Oh, look, come on.

696
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,660
Cheer up, everyone.

697
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,440
We are 15 million light years from the nearest space route.

698
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,660
There is no intelligent life around here anywhere.

699
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,300
How these aliens did this, I don't know.

700
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,300
But I would like to know what they did.

701
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


702
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


703
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


704
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


705
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


706
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


707
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


708
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


709
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


710
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


711
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


712
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


713
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


714
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


715
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


716
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


717
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,300


718
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,320
The moon was in their control.

719
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,340
And they helped me do all this.

720
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,380
We took a picture of approaching the moon.

721
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:41,300
We landed on the intersection where it was dark and light sort of area.

722
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,800
And we did see things that they claim are not there now.

723
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,320
So I can't prove anything.

724
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:52,840
35 years ago, we thought the whole space story was going to be imminent.

725
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,220
It was going to be really quick.

726
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,660
Everyone is going to accept the idea that there are higher civilizations, that we're

727
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,720
We're going to learn from them.

728
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,260
We're going to interact with them.

729
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,900
No way.

730
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,600
How can they deal with us?

731
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,280
Who can they deal with on this planet?

732
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,000
The UN?

733
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,280
We're just beginning to cooperate at the UN level.

734
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,140
We haven't even begun to communicate with one another and to be civilized.

735
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:18,640
That's true.

736
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,640
It's very, very barbaric, and it's frightening.

737
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:39,340
We've been listening to some amazing cut-ups by the beautiful and talented reverend Susie the Flusie of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse in beautiful WREK Atlanta.

738
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:47,460
Actually, that material is taken from her show number 477.

739
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,160
Can you believe that?

740
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,220
About the coming X.

741
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,340
Dang.

742
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:01,600
This music in the background, by the way, is by Soso Dada.

743
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,080
Soso Dada.

744
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,360
Yes, 6X Day.

745
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:40,200
Actually, it began on a Thursday before July 5th with an invocation or sort of an introduction to the whole thing by me.

746
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:47,400
But I've done so many of these things that for me it's all really hard to get excited about, if you don't mind my saying so.

747
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,800
However, luckily for us, there are always the young doctors.

748
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,620
The ones that are the most precise people.

749
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:59,940
who come along and still are young and stupid and naive enough to have the fire in their blood,

750
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:09,400
the fire in their brains, the fire of Bob, and the soothing warmth and ointment of Connie in their

751
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:18,800
loins. And one such new youth young preacher would be, of course, needless to say, the young,

752
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:30,240
indeed very young, Reverend Alex. Heard here in the true opening ceremonies of X Day 6. Thank y'all.

753
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,820
Stang is a harsh old man who should have died years ago.

754
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,600
I love him.

755
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,500
But we can say that.

756
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,940
When the con has us. When the con has us in our grips. We can't say that here, because here we like to come and finally break out of our shells.

757
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,380
We like to come here and finally experience some of the last vestiges of slack on this planet.

758
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:07,900
That are here at Brushwood, at this folklore center in upstate New York. That's why we come here.

759
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,480
But you can't experience the conspiracy. Yeah, we came to get, we came to get stoned.

760
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,340
No, we can come here and experience that.

761
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:29,520
But the thing is, the only thing that keeps us strong against the conspiracy, if we're not fucking Bobby's who give it up as soon as we leave this camp.

762
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:41,020
If we're true subgeniuses, if we're real actual subgeniuses, we acknowledge the fact of our difference from the normals.

763
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,960
We realize our true diversity and our true yeti heritage.

764
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,780
We understand that labels like this are just a fake.

765
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:48,780


766
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:48,780


767
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,480
Like man and woman.

768
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:56,600
And labels like black and white are not applicable.

769
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,120
We acknowledge this because we're subgeniuses.

770
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,680
Because we know what diversity really is.

771
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:13,180
Because we're the last, we're the last form, the last concept, the last idea of diversity.

772
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,360
And we're almost becoming an apocryphal concept.

773
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,760
We're almost becoming an outward concept.

774
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:18,760


775
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,940
We're an outdated, outmoded, old fashioned idea.

776
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:34,220
Because no one can afford an entire world of six billion, hell even six million individualists.

777
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,140
They just can't handle the slack.

778
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,960
That's the bottom line.

779
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,100
They can't handle it because their minds are too simple.

780
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,900
They can't afford it.

781
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,160
They have too much to lose.

782
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,000
That's what it is.

783
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,240
Amen.

784
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:56,940
But the only thing that we can go out here and we, and I admit I get a delight and I

785
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:03,080
get a joy like I'm sure Stan gets when he sees, adopts it on a t-shirt or some random

786
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,560
passerby or on the back of a car in the form of a bumper sticker.

787
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,820
And obviously that's all well and good.

788
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,780
But there are subgeniuses out there who do not know Bob.

789
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,100
Subgenius isn't just Bob.

790
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,840
Subgenius isn't just an icon or a slogan like slack or the conspiracy.

791
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,880
Subgenius is, well it's probably indescribable but we all know it is.

792
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,280
It's a reality.

793
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,740
That's thirty dollars.

794
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,940
Yes it's thirty fucking dollars.

795
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,760
And it's real.

796
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,900
That's my black ass.

797
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,280
Beyond all the slogans, beyond all the catchphrases that we all love because they're so true.

798
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:43,440
Beyond the divine excuses and rules and dictates and mandates and woman dates.

799
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:57,840
Is the fact that we, the subgenius, have made it our sworn goal not to follow, not to fit in to any type of cliche or stereotype.

800
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:04,720
Including the cliche and stereotype of not wanting to fit into cliches and stereotypes but doing them less.

801
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,940
Because you grow your hair out or you cut your hair.

802
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,440
We don't fit into the conspiracy.

803
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,540
Or you cut yourself.

804
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,060
We don't fit into the conspiracy stereotypes.

805
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,840
We don't grow our hair out just to be weird radical hippies.

806
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,580
We don't shave our hair just to be fat radical dyke chicks.

807
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,000
We live our subgenius reality.

808
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,180
We, as you said, it is a reality.

809
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,580
We live it and acknowledge it every day.

810
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,360
We can't do anything besides that.

811
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,440
We're trapped.

812
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,320
We have no other choice than to be subgeniuses.

813
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,840
Even if we didn't want to, we would.

814
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,600
It's just who we are.

815
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
We're all different from each other.

816
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,780
Because we don't fit the stereotypes.

817
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,500
We don't fit the cliches.

818
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:58,920
And to quote the fantastic bad film we saw last night, For Your Height Only,

819
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,700
We make a monkey out of the forces of evil.

820
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,020
Yeah!

821
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:03,800
Yeah!

822
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:04,880
Yeah!

823
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,380
We make them laugh.

824
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,420
We larf at the conspiracy.

825
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,120
We say,

826
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,740
Oh, look at those pink boys.

827
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,080
Look at that pink boy over there with the shirt that says,

828
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,000
You laugh because I'm weird.

829
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,360
I laugh because you're all the same.

830
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,240
Oh, if that pink boy only knew.

831
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,240
We don't have to wear the t-shirt.

832
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,560
We can.

833
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,680
And the t-shirt suddenly becomes a sacred object when it touches the flesh.

834
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,540
It doesn't become just an artifact of the pink boy's control of mediocrity and culture.

835
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,340
It becomes a sacred object, obviously.

836
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,520
Like anything else.

837
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:38,960
Like music.

838
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,520
Like bad TV shows.

839
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,100
They become sacred when subgeniuses are there.

840
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:42,700
And subgeniuses watch them.

841
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,180
And enjoy them.

842
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,100
Because they realize what they're for.

843
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,720
We acknowledge the fact that pinks may never understand the church in the subgenius.

844
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:54,880
But we do.

845
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,840
We revel in that fact.

846
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:05,680
We revel in the joy that we get from the slack of, well, just about any fucking thing that gives us slack.

847
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,120
And that is the only defense we have.

848
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,500
Now, a while ago,

849
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:25,140
the Lord God, Jehovah One, Wotan 16, Yahweh 23, sent me a defined divine prophecy.

850
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,880
He said unto me,

851
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,440
Bob will die if the exes do not arrive this year.

852
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,700
Now, some of you may say, well, Bob dies early.

853
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,080
Bob's already dead.

854
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:38,800
Bob dies early.

855
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,600
Well, actually, the truth is a little bit different.

856
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,200
Stane won't acknowledge it.

857
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,640
And the other filings certainly won't acknowledge it.

858
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,500
Wait, this is the time when Bob is really supposed to die.

859
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,220
Well, yeah.

860
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,380
I would say so.

861
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,960
Because Bob's been wily enough to escape conspiracy.

862
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:02,760
I mean, Bob has been wily enough to infiltrate the conspiracy and escape the mortal death that's come to him each year past.

863
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,900
I mean, in 1998, there was the bit about, oh, well, he was 86, 61.

864
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,660
And Bob showed up in 1999.

865
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,980
And all the exes should have just took off.

866
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,560
Without a goddamn single fucking one of us aboard except for the truce of geniuses.

867
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,620
Now, I, this would be enough.

868
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:31,800
We would be, it would be well enough for us to live out our little church fantasy camp until the end of the earth through nuclear holocaust or environmental devastation or eternal perma war.

869
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,800
We could live or monkeypox or SARS or infant diarrhea, which could be cured with pennies worth of sugar.

870
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,580
We could drink sugar and water every day.

871
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,700
That kills 30,000 people.

872
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,740
We could eat disease.

873
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:46,960
Captain Tramps.

874
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,880
We could have our little church fun until the world ends.

875
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,140
And that's good enough for me, man.

876
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,640
Believe me.

877
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,020
I could put up with that.

878
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,920
But I don't believe that would be the case.

879
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,240
At least not for Bob.

880
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,180
Because if the exes do not arrive this year, well, I mean, let me rephrase.

881
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,840
If the exes do not take us up to planet X this year, then Bob will die.

882
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,780
Bob has not arrived.

883
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,600
Bob died in the past.

884
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,200
But Bob will die this year.

885
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,700
Simple enough.

886
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,680
That was the prophecy the Lord God gave you.

887
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,220
Now, we know something big will happen.

888
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,200
Maybe the exes taking us up.

889
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,280
Maybe Bob's death.

890
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,920
We know something big will happen.

891
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,980
And that's what we can look forward to, basically.

892
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,380
While we slack off.

893
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,820
While we frock off.

894
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,360
While we laugh hysterically in this glorious folklore center in upstate New York.

895
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,200
We can know that.

896
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:40,760
But if we go back to our conspiracy theories.

897
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:40,980
Our conspiracy homes.

898
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,120
And our conspiracy countries.

899
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,020
And our little townships and hamlets and counties.

900
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,640
We have to carry within us, regardless of whether we want to or not, the fact of who

901
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,040
we are.

902
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,860
The fact of our subgenius heritage.

903
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:01,580
Maybe the fact that we exist is the fact that we should express ourselves to other people

904
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,480
and fuck them over as hard as they fucked us back.

905
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,400
Well, that's what happened.

906
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,980
And that produced a conspiracy.

907
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,620
It hurts.

908
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,300
It'll hurt.

909
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:16,820
For the next two years, and possibly even more, I'm going to be seeing a lot of more

910
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:23,980
jocks take a lot more attractive young girls and warp minds with a lot of lesbian subgeniuses.

911
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,060
Thank you, Rachnar.

912
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,640
Let's keep crossing our fingers.

913
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,740
I'm going to be seeing this a lot more often.

914
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,940
But I won't fret.

915
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,660
I'll go home.

916
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,880
I'll listen to emo.

917
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,680
I'll masturbate.

918
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,360
But I won't fret.

919
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:39,600
I'll go to work.

920
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:39,600


921
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:39,600


922
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:39,600


923
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:39,600


924
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:39,600


925
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:39,600


926
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:39,600


927
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,640
I'll go to work.

928
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:40,640


929
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:40,640


930
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:40,760
Because...

931
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,080
Break masturbation!

932
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,760
Because masturbation is my sole salvation.

933
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,560
Because I know what the conspiracy is.

934
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,860
Because I can laugh.

935
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,660
I can fly by the seat of my pants.

936
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:58,040
And I can live my own fucking life to the full extent of whatever I want to make it.

937
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:03,780
And what I want to make it is what we innately all dream for.

938
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,840
The ideal of a pure, honest life.

939
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,260
Live to the fullest.

940
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,820
Enjoying every single moment in a new squirty slack.

941
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:16,820
That is our greatest contribution to Earth Farm 1.

942
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:26,640
So, until next year, until July 5th, when you all find yourselves in the lounge of my

943
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:32,360
saucer, praise Bob, hail Connie, fuck the con.

944
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,960
Fuck them in the ass.

945
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,340
And...

946
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,240
Make them laugh.

947
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:43,640
And for a brief change of pace, a quote from Sex Mortis.

948
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:48,960
Wake the fuck up and wait hours to wake up with me.

949
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:49,720
Thank you.

950
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,080
Amazing French Reverend Alex.

951
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,480
Well, what can I say, folks?

952
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,140
You've got a lot of promise in that young man.

953
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,460
Thank you.

954
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,040
Thank you.

955
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:13,420
Yes.

956
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,640
Yes, it's true.

957
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,960
I am always right.

958
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:24,280
And although Bob is also always wrong, and in so doing is somehow always right, yet...

959
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,100
The subgeniuses shall...

960
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:37,980
Awaken!

961
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,100
Hey, where'd the amino acids go?

962
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,520
Oh, there they are!

963
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,680
Well, just for a sec.

964
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,120
I thought I heard the amino acids for a second there.

965
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,980
Oh, there they are again!

966
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,040
Yeah!

967
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,020
Here they are!

968
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,060


969
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,060


970
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,060


971
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:02,840
What is this?

972
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,660
What is this?

973
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:04,760
What is this?

974
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,720
We'll be right back.

975
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:44,720
We'll be right back.

976
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:09,940
We'll be right back.

977
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:47,560
We'll be right back.

978
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,260
We'll be right back.

979
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,060
We'll be right back.

980
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:34,720
We'll be right back.

981
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:36,520
We'll be right back.

982
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,640
We'll be right back.

983
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:35,920
We'll be right back.

984
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,920
We'll be right back.

985
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,300
We'll be right back.

986
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,280
We'll be right back.

987
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,440
We'll be right back.

988
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,780
We'll be right back.

989
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,660
We'll be right back.

990
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:57,440
We'll be right back.

991
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,720
The crop circles promise to lead us the way home

992
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,680
The pipe of Bob dolls is waiting for us

993
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,980
The escape vessels of the sex goddess is coming

994
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:31,060
I paid thirty dollars to fly into space

995
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:35,620
My father had told me not to go off to Hex Day

996
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:39,660
So I took cash from his wallet and was on my way

997
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:44,140
My brothers and sisters, they said it's all a sex cult

998
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:48,140
They tried to stop me but I shot them all dead

999
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:57,580
Goodbye to the con, hello margaritas Adios to your old friends, here's a better idea

1000
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,040
You won't have a name when you show up

1001
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:05,100
To Hex Day and all they will call you will be

1002
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,140
D-Bobby

1003
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:14,820
Some of us are smelly and some are not wanted

1004
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:18,940
Codini has told us we have to move on

1005
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:23,320
We went into T-Base just to meet all our heroes

1006
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:27,340
But Lagoon's got a really big knife and a gun

1007
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:31,020
We cried in the woods and we cried in the woods

1008
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,820
We cried in the hot tub, we washed down our pride with the water of fire

1009
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,320
We cried with some hairy old man they called Mojo

1010
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:44,260
But we just want to hang with the ones we admire

1011
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:53,840
Goodbye to the con, hello margaritas Adios to your old friends, here's a better idea

1012
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:01,020
You won't have a name when you show up to Hex Day and all they will call you will be

1013
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:01,020


1014
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,420
D-Bobby

1015
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:11,120
The campsite erupted just when we all passed out

1016
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:15,080
A fireball of liquid that singed my young face

1017
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:19,380
Who were all these people who taught me the lesson?

1018
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:23,540
Never pass out stone drunk at Tranquility Base

1019
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:27,860
But is this the best way to teach the young preacher?

1020
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,000
And is this the best method to show up?

1021
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,000


1022
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,000


1023
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,000


1024
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,000


1025
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,220
What's the way to set us on fire and laugh at our screaming

1026
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,380
And be known by no name except D-Bobby

1027
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:49,900
Goodbye to the con, hello margaritas Adios to your old friends, here's a better idea

1028
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:57,380
You won't have a name when you show up to Hex Day and all they will call you will be

1029
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,560
D-Bobby

1030
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,980
D-Bobby

1031
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:00,980


1032
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:00,980


1033
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:10,980
Goodbye to the con, hello margaritas Adios to your old friends, here's a better idea

1034
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:18,640
You won't have a name when you show up to Hex Day and all they will call you will be

1035
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,000
D-Bobby

1036
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,120
And all they will call you will be

1037
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,180
D-Bobby

1038
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,460
D-Bobby

1039
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:35,660
And all they will call you will be

1040
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:37,740
D-Bobby

1041
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:59,420
V-A-C-O-I-N-S-W-I-N-S-A L-I-N-G-I-O-B-O-B-B-I-N-E-S-T-O-B-B-E-L-L-L-A-N-A-N-I-O-L-T-O-V-I-N-E-N-E-N-T-A-N-T-A-T-A-T-T-T-A-T A-T-T-T-A-T-T-A-T-A-T-T-T-A-T-T-T-A-T-T-T-A-T-T-A-T-A

1042
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:00,980
D-Bobby

1043
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:04,280
Bob is their god! Praise Bob!

1044
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:11,160
And when he was studying free action, he went to life in the world in Anne.

1045
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:20,280
He's gone. God, we could have had a new government for Bob's president since he's been around since no pause.

1046
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,380
I miss him. I don't care.

1047
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:25,720
No.

1048
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,380
Don't worry, Boris. We'll get to all of the cages eventually.

1049
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:40,360
But first, you must climb into, and then escape, the cage of B-B-B-Bob!
