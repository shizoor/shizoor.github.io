1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,520
We now return control of your television set to you

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,820
until next week at this same time

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,160
when the control voice will take you to...

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,180
Bob!

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,460
From the land beyond beyond.

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,760
From the world past hope and fear.

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,120
I bid you, Bob, now appear.

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,240
Oh my gosh.

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:53,620
Oh my gosh.

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,360
Oh my gosh.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,900
Oh my gosh.

12
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,040
Oh my gosh.

13
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,480
Oh my gosh.

14
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,200
Oh my gosh.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,260
Oh my gosh.

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,720
Oh my gosh.

17
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,940
Oh my gosh.

18
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,540
Oh my gosh.

19
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,480
Oh my gosh.

20
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,480
The following transcribed program is transcribed.

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,800
Friends, if you like rubbers, let's keep punching Bob till the Japs get theirs.

22
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,180
Tonight, as usual, Bob brings you Final Victory.

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,360
Meanwhile, don't hear Bob the greatest name in rubber.

24
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,200
I don't want to be no human being.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,340
I don't want to be no human being.

26
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,160
No!

27
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,440
Don't you call me no human being.

28
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,100
I ain't no human being.

29
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,940
Good work.

30
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,320
I'm a no good low down on principle crook.

31
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,560
We want you to know that we will interrupt this program instantly.

32
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,280
Bob!

33
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,780
Bob!

34
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,240
Bob!

35
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,920
Bob!

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:53,980
Bob!

37
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,720
Bob!

38
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,300
Bob!

39
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:00,620
Bob!

40
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,300
Bob!

41
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,820
Bob!

42
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,300
Bob!

43
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:02,740
Bob!

44
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:02,920
Bob!

45
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,140
Bob!

46
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,320
Bob!

47
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,580
Bob!

48
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:03,580


49
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,160
This is a coordinated monthly test of the broadcast stations of your area.

50
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,380
Bob!

51
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:08,760
Bob!

52
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,740
Equipment that can quickly warn you during emergencies is being tested.

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,000
Bob!

54
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,220
If this had been an actual emergency, official messages would have followed the alert tone.

55
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,340
Bob!

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:16,580
Bob!

57
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,200
This station serves the area.

58
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:18,600
Bob!

59
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:18,740


60
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,300
This concludes this test of the emergency alert system.

61
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,000
Attention, please.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,680
Attention, please. Attention, please. The commanding general will speak to you. Stand by.

63
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,740
Friends, it is imperative that you listen closely.

64
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,860
We're coming, but it seems they're strapped down.

65
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,540
Women here have been praying for God's help and guidance.

66
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,540
Julie's coming.

67
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,340
Not your kind of hypocritical praying, but the kind that comes from deep inside a man.

68
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,460
I'm sorry. I'll come back, Lee.

69
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,120
No, no, Eddie. We can't put things off till later.

70
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:52,580
Go.

71
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,700
We're the lucky ones.

72
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,020
I told you this would happen.

73
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,020
Now, to again emphasize our problem, most of it will be consumed,

74
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,600
but then, in turning completely around, every ounce will be needed to avoid crashing.

75
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,340
You don't know what people will do to avoid crashing.

76
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,680
Because in these boxes, we have placed numbered disks.

77
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,780
Of doom.

78
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,080
And so will you.

79
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,320
One disk.

80
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,100
Of doom.

81
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,440
I'll tell you what that mean.

82
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,020
Instead of d primo.

83
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,140
It won't событи anyone.

84
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,760
We'll soaked phoenix at

00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:37,760


86
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,120
D bevorst Look, my nou.

87
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,960
That's so much lage stuff you can't put on.

88
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,640
Is матem永 أم ف sí irgendwo tu

89
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,060
It thing?

90
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,280


91
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:52,740
allein before date know if it works.

92
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,260
Bob?

93
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,680
Hey, the new year is coming. Hallelujah.

94
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,980
Well, when I was up vomiting.

95
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,500
Seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Amen.

96
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,700
Surprise, surprise.

97
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,500
And this ministry is love.

98
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,920
We love you.

99
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,780
A Marfa Did It Duck choice.

100
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,720
We like to remind the duck people to stop humping in the middle of an all-day-days choice USDA steak.

101
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,880
It's no time like the present.

102
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,920
No time.

103
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,480
There's no time.

104
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,220
Shadim Hussain, your teeth are wearing down.

105
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,720
Your canine incisors are those of an evil beast.

106
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,700
It just sounds like another plate.

107
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,560
Well, yes, my friends and dear prayer partners,

108
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:11,920
this hour of Slack number 1,877 is a rerun of number 877 from 2003.

109
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:18,600
And the weird thing is, once again, everything that was happening then,

110
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,720
almost 20 years ago, wars and fake news,

111
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,120
SARS and tumors from SARS, it's all repeating again now.

112
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:35,540
I'm an old man and I keep seeing everything repeat every 20 years or so.

113
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,280
The wars, well, they repeat every three minutes.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,760
Wokeness.

115
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,720
Oh, heck, I remember correcting myself during women's lib in the 70s, for instance.

116
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,720
Anyway, these old shows seem so very strange.

117
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:52,720


118
00:06:52,740 --> 00:07:00,880
Strangely, to resonate today, just as 1950s Dobbs prophecy is always reflected in the headlines of today,

119
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,380
which are all too frequently grammatically incorrect and misspelled.

120
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,540
Headlines with no proofreading.

121
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,580
Lord, my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.

122
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,780
Hosea 316.

123
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:22,720
My point is, why should I stay up all night at my age editing new shows?

124
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,560
When the old ones from exactly 1,000 shows ago are more modern than new.

125
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:38,300
And on top of all that, we here at rural Stang Ranch have had to deal with one crisis per week,

126
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,280
such as wildfires over by Toler and up to Iredale.

127
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:51,820
Those came close enough to Stangville County that I actually packed my bug out bags and the cat cage

128
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,720
and had a big day.

129
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,660
I had to get them in the car ready to evacuate.

130
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:03,500
And I learned by practice there that you don't just throw the eight hard drives into a sack.

131
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,760
It doesn't work that way.

132
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,580
It was a good dress rehearsal for one apocalypse.

133
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,960
Then we had a different apocalypse.

134
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:16,820
The weather paranoia fear sites all telling us there was a storm coming with extreme high winds,

135
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,000
torrential rain, goat-sized hail, and sonic tornadoes.

136
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,540
And since I...

137
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,400
Just broken my back getting my food garden started for yet that other apocalypse,

138
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,140
I had to haul 16 tons of number six goat manure in pots

139
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,180
and batten down huge tarps over it all with tent stakes.

140
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,600
And then all it did was half-ass rain for one hour.

141
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,780
And there was the dogfight injuries to Buddy that, well,

142
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,840
the big ironically heart-shaped hole in his belly,

143
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,520
it's closing up real fast.

144
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,260
And it doesn't look like a heart anymore.

145
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,180
Buddy is okay.

146
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,520
And all the dogs and cats and goats and turkeys and geese and June bugs

147
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,560
are getting along just fine out here.

148
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,600
Did I mention there's a new Dollar General going up south of the river where we're near?

149
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,200
Man, that'll be like having a Walmart almost.

150
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,300
The background music is Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

151
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,780
Anyway, I hope this...

152
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,540
fills up the poorly recorded 2003 ESL radio section I'm replacing

153
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,360
with these exciting current events.

154
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,120
Praise Bob.

155
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,660
Okay, okay, so we got our freedom.

156
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,800
But management's lousing up everything.

157
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,060
Labor is at fault. It's ruining the country.

158
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,960
My constituents, as your elected representative,

159
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,020
I can assure you labor's right.

160
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,740
Management's right.

161
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,780
I'm strictly neutral.

162
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,760
Labor, management, politicians, phooey.

163
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,080
They can't tell corn from oats.

164
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,680
Work!

165
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,180
Drink!

166
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,900
Drink!

167
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,240
Hurry, hurry, hurry, step right up, folks.

168
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,440
Here's the answer to your problems,

169
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,180
Dr. Utopia's sensational new discovery,

170
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,100
ism.

171
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,700
Ism will cure any ailment of the body politic.

172
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,720
It's terrific.

173
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,820
It's tremendous.

174
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,080
Once you swallow the contents of this bottle,

175
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,100
you'll have the bountiful benefit of higher wages,

176
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,220
shorter hours,

177
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,240
and security.

178
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,420
Enormous profits.

179
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,420
No strikes.

180
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,940
Remember, you're the big boss.

181
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,380
Government control.

182
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,900
No worry about votes.

183
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,220
Name your own salary.

184
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,620
Bigger crops.

185
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,860
Lower costs.

186
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,400
Why, ism even makes the weather perfect every day.

187
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,360
And now then, because we are introducing this amazing item

188
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,400
for the first time in this country,

189
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,040
it isn't going to cost you one cent.

190
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,400
All you have to do is sign this little scrap of paper,

191
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,200
and you're good to go.

192
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,200


193
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,640
And then you get your bottle absolutely free.

194
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,740
I hereby turn over to ism, Incorporated,

195
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,760
everything I have, including my freedom,

196
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,980
and the freedom of my children,

197
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,780
and my children's children,

198
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,680
in return for which said ism promises to take care of me forever.

199
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,060
I was there first.

200
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,020
I paid too much.

201
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Get out of the way.

202
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,820
This is PR News from North Carolina,

203

204
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,320
who are still in Washington.

205
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,840
Support for PR comes from American Dead People Foundation.

This is PR News.

210
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,860
UN weapons inspectors have begun examining Iraq's 12 people,

211
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,360
who are still without weapons of mass destruction.

212
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,780
Iraq submitted its opposition groups door-to-door yesterday in Venezuela.

213
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,600
The US and the four other pages of information on its permanent UN Security Council members

214
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,180
following last week's snow and ice storm on its weapons program.

215
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,740
From Chicago, PR Radio, opposition groups report.

216
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:16,380
Anti-government forces say they have failed to report to some unqualified leftist president,

217
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,980
and could cause a plot to overthrow him.

218
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,840
It's unclear whether the United States will support this move,

219
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,760
or whether the United States is crude.

220
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,160
Maracas.

Hundreds of people are still without weapons of mass destruction.

224
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,040
At least the National Guard went door-to-door yesterday,

225
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,040
offering weapons in Venezuela.

226
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,160
This is PR News, offering mass destruction.

You can't breathe.

231
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,300
The traffic.

232
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,660
You can't think.

233
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,600
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

234
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,520
Look out for that truck.

235
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,600
Honk, honk.

236
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,620
Look out for that taxi.

237
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,420
Boing.

238
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,360
Beep, beep.

239
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,480
Roar.

240
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,600
Honk, honk.

241
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,140
Beep, beep.

242
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,180
Honk.

243
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,320
What's that?

244
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,480
Look.

245
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,060
It's the towers.

246
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,620
They're falling.

247
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:43,760
Ah!

248
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,440
Ah!

249
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,780
He can't stand dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous weapons.

250
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,740
Of course you realize this means war.

251
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,640
According to one conspiracy, the trade centers were faked.

252
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,280
That is something that will take us a long time to wrap ourselves around.

253
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,900
Now, whether what we were watching,

254
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,520
were simulation exercises being transmitted as the real event,

255
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,460
it's a possibility which needs to be examined.

256
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,160
It needs to be examined closely.

257
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,600
There has, in fact, been almost a media blackout,

258
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,320
a kind of a deliberate American policy

259
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,060
that's been basically there since the war in Vietnam,

260
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,300
and we saw it in the Falklands War and the Gulf War,

261
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,680
and now in the NATO war against the former Yugoslavia,

262
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,020
and now again in Afghanistan,

263
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,220
where the military do not want the media to be involved.

264
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,580
And the American media have been complaining bitterly

265
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,160
that they haven't got access to what's been going on.

266
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,160
They didn't destroy the two towers.

267
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,520
It just didn't seem real.

268
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,060
They didn't destroy the two towers.

269
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,960
We thought it was something out of a movie.

270
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,160
Just a little while ago, one of the volunteers,

271
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,580
who tried to go down there and help report it back,

272
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,300
and said, you actually got to the scene at the World Trade Center.

273
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,180
What was most remarkable, what was most amazing,

274
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,860
what was most horrifying is that basically nothing was happening.

275
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,020
This is nearly a 10-acre site.

276
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,360
signal

277
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:14,360


278
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,400
Deep in the Nevada desert.

279
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,400
A lot of open space.

280
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,760
A secret film studio deep in the Nevada desert.

281
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,280
Two hijacked planes

282
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,140
were staged and filmed

283
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,860
before the footage was transmitted

284
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,100
to a gullible world.

285
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,800
At the World Trade Center,

286
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,580
what was most remarkable, what was most amazing,

287
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,380
The most horrifying is that basically nothing was happening.

288
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,880
Basically nothing was happening.

289
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,360
Basically nothing was happening.

290
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,860
Basically nothing was happening.

291
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,320
Basically nothing was happening.

292
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,460
There's enough evidence there to make me doubt.

293
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,900
That is something that will take us a long time to wrap ourselves around.

294
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,500
Now whether what we were watching were simulation exercises...

295
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,640
They didn't destroy the two towers.

296
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,020
...being transmitted as the real event...

297
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,160
They didn't destroy the two towers.

298
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,980
...is a possibility which needs to be examined...

299
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,160
They didn't destroy the two towers.

300
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,160
...is such a multi-layered and complex situation...

301
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,700
...which needs to be examined closely.

302
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,340
In order to retain the prestige of American industry throughout the world...

303
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,220
...they had to fake it.

304
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,780
Private.

305
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,500
Public.

306
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,340
And the rest of you guys with funny names.

307
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,400
Mount your pieces, lock and load.

308
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,760
Handle over here by the perimeter.

309
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,040
Stop laughing.

310
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,140
The IRACs could hear you and blow your mind.

311
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,660
Or blow your head off.

312
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,640
Okay.

313
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,340
See that over there?

314
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:47,960
That is a fully transitional lunar module capable of whisking us out of here in a matter of five seconds if we so desire.

315
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,220
If not, we may take that objective below.

316
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,340
See it?

317
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,020
Put on your night glasses.

318
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,140
There it is.

319
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,280
See it moving around like little blue snakes.

320
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,480
I can't see nothing, man.

321
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,280
This ain't working.

322
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,060
These night glasses ain't working.

323
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,620
Get your earmuffs off your eyes.

324
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,900
Where should I pull this thing?

325
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,280
Take his earmuffs off his eyes.

326
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,000
There's no reason why...

327
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,840
There you go.

328
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,860
Now see them little blue snakes moving around?

329
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,460
Yeah, here.

330
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:09,760
Cool.

331
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,280
Those are Saddam Husseins.

332
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,320
The evilest, vilest critter ever invented.

333
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,020
I hate them Saddam Husseins.

334
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,120
Yeah.

335
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,220
Each one of them's got a weapons of mass destruction.

336
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:19,640
That's right.

337
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,360
See that one over there?

338
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,120
He's got a weapons of mass destruction.

339
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,660
Yeah, and he just...

340
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,220
I got one right here.

341
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,780
Wanna see it?

342
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,320
Oh, no.

343
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,820
Put that thing away.

344
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:27,960
All right.

345
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,780
You think you're gonna get off that?

346
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,140
That looks like a great big giant motorized vehicle.

347
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,340
Yeah, I think he's overexposed himself.

348
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,360
He can go back from the front.

349
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,280
Go back home.

350
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:36,820
He needs to go back home.

351
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:36,820


352
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,180
Oh, he's over there, no way.

353
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,820
What'd you do with that dang dildo?

354
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,000
Is he torturing a prisoner with that dang dildo?

355
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,880
No, I think the prisoner enjoys being tortured in that way.

356
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,080
Yeah, it's not...

357
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,220
It's not real torture.

358
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,440
Well, I think that's good level...

359
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:54,840
Oh, yeah.

360
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,560
Tengo que decirles algunas cosas.

361
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,320
Ustedes están locos de todos.

362
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,800
Tú y tú, todos y todos.

363
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:06,800


364
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:06,800


365
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:06,800


366
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:06,800


367
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:06,800


368
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:06,800


369
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:06,800


370
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:06,800


371
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:06,800


372
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:06,800


373
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:06,800


374
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,200
here.

375
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,140
Baby.

376
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:12,620
Baby.

377
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,580
Baby.

378
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,800
Head-ра-... .كن, baby.

379
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,740
Head- мел

380
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:30,880
Oh, yes, and that last horrible, horrible noise was My Baby, My Baby by Blue Marmalade

381
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,380
off of the old subgenius album called Bad Doctors.

382
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:47,620
Also, of course, we heard ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB in Cleveland with host Chaz Smith,

383
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:55,580
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Princess Wee, and yours truly Reverend Ivan Stagg.

384
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,300
The Great Twin Towers Hoax.

385
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,320
That collage about the hoax of the...

386
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:13,840
Twin Towers, and there's more of that to come, by the way, is by Reverend Buttress O'Neill.

387
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,320
Buttress O'Neill.

388
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,880
That's spelled O apostrophe K-N-E-E-L.

389
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,620
Buttress O'Neill, I believe from Australia or one of those under down places.

390
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,020
And, yes, Buttress O'Neill and Mega Conspiracies.

391
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,300
Friends, we've had a lot of cuts and clips in this.

392
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,360
And so...

393
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,180
And so, we've had a lot of cuts and clips in the surrounding Hour of Slack shows

394
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:45,640
from New Monet and Artemia Salina and others on alt.binaries.slack

395
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,620
who've contributed a lot of cuts.

396
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,860
But everything else on this show, I mean, all the collages on this particular show

397
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,320
are by Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

398
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,020
All those amazing cut-ups of sound.

399
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,000
The great Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

400
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,120
Well, also, I found this great old cartoon called Make Mine.

401
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:06,700
Freedom.

402
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,080
We heard some of that.

403
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:14,580
And because this war stuff, friends, it's gotten even me upset.

404
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,960
It's gotten so weird.

405
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,020
Like the other day when all of our watches and clocks suddenly switched over from, you know,

406
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:28,400
regular civilian time to military 0800 type time.

407
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,580
So, now...

408
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,300
Then you have them read.

409
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:32,720
You say...

410
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,860
Cranky and Henri, man.

411
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,480
Moby Dick.

412
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,180
Your watch went over to military?

413
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,360
Military.

414
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,360


415
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,360


416
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,360


417
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,360


418
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,320
Remember John Bush's pass?

419
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,620
Yeah, it's still...

420
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,780
And I can't get it to go back to regular 12.

421
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,140
And yeah, my computer clock went over to military time all of a sudden.

422
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,800
But they'll read it backwards.

423
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,520
No, it still says 2003, but it went into military, you know, 22 instead of 10 o'clock.

424
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,260
Well, we are all on military time now.

425
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,740
And time is running out.

426
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,720
If we'd like to quote Mr. George W. for war.

427
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,520
The balloon toots have dropped.

428
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,820
The balloon toots have hit the spatula.

429
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,460
And the chase is on.

430
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,360
The fat is...

431
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,360


432
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,080
Hit the griddle.

433
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,420
Sliding.

434
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,600
Well, actually, no.

435
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,580
The race is running.

436
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,720
Here comes heartbreak hung up behind the back stretch.

437
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,640
Don't say that.

438
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,040
There are weeks of surroundings to happen.

439
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,940
Weeks of smallpox inoculations for the lucky.

440
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,320
And weeks of procrastination for the guilty.

441
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,400
In front of the head of the smallpox goddess,

442
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:36,220
thousands and thousands of electees ready to be inaugurated as the president likes to call it.

443
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,360
Inoculate it with the smallest pox they can find.

444
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,260
Micro-inventesimal tiny little pox.

445
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,260
Tiny inoculations.

446
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:56,920
When you rub them, the liquid gel forms behind your eye cataracts and above in your modula oblongata.

447
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,340
Get the shot.

448
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,460
Be the shot.

449
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,980
It's good for you.

450
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,220
Take it.

451
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,320
Take your best shot.

452
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,080
The tiny...

453
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,660
Tiny nanobots in the smallpox vaccinations are there for your protection, your security.

454
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,580
Already I can feel the scent of a powerful missile system surrounding America.

455
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,400
You'll never be lost, my friend.

456
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,640
You may not know where you are, but the great geosynchronous satellites always will.

457
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,340
And the great geodesic domes, much like the random pillows in the prisoner,

458
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,100
will follow you and take you back, number seven.

459
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,060
Take you back.

460
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,420
Take you back.

461
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,200
I am not a...

462
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,440
I am not a number.

463
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,440
I am a teeny tiny little tiny little man.

464
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,920
No, the next version of that show, the guy will be running around going,

465
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,040
I am not a free man, I am a number.

466
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,820
I am number six.

467
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,860
The 2000...

468
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,840
You are number one.

469
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,680
I'm telling you, man, I'm a gas station attendant.

470
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,300
We want you to get the hell out.

471
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,760
You are number one.

472
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,460
Tell them I am...

473
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,620
God number one.

474
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,720
Mm-hmm.

475
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,940
It's time to dance.

476
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,200
No, I'm saying, no, I'm saying.

477
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,840
No, I'm saying, no, I'm saying.

478
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,640
It's time to release the...

479
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,180
What's that aroma in the air?

480
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,560
Oh, I guess one of those trouser ghosts is moaning.

481
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,060
I think it's maybe something more bachotastylistic than that.

482
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:33,840
You know, Cleveland is a testosterone city for those wonderful inovulations our president will be offering soon.

483
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,220
Oh, really?

484
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:35,940
Oh, really?

485
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,580
Are we one of the sample towns?

486
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,800
Yes, we're a sampling town.

487
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,560
They're taking DNA and little skull samples from the people here

488
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,460
and spreading them across their sandwiches and slides in Washington, D.C.

489
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,020
They're missing...

490
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,060
Or in Dietrich, Maryland.

491
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,740
Yes.

492
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,220
Oh, yes.

493
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,440
Brewing up a nice cocktail for all the good American boys and girls.

494
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,800
Now, I got my flu shot in September or so,

495
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,200
and then I got the flu in January,

496
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,220
and I wonder what else was in the shot.

497
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,740
I mean, because they didn't put the...

498
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,180
The flu inoculation was only half good.

499
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,140
Well, sign away my freedom.

500
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,400
Why, this is ridiculous.

501
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,060
Don't be corny, brother.

502
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,800
Sure, our system of free enterprise isn't perfect,

503
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,700
but before we throw it away for some imported double talk,

504
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,440
let's turn the clock back a few years to see what it's like.

505
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,220
Don't be for us.

506
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,600
The search for conspiracies is the search for explanation,

507
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,160
and in many cases, in many mysteries,

508
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,620
a conspiracy is a very plausible first hypothesis.

509
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,120
Two hijacked planes slamming into the World Trade Center,

510
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,580
and then shortly afterwards,

511
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,640
we had reports from Washington of an attack on the Pentagon.

512
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,260
A question I'd like to put to our listeners on the evening show tonight.

513
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,260
Do you feel that the coverage and the perspectives you're getting,

514
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,780
that you're receiving through the various forms of media that you receive,

515
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,400
that you consume,

516
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,480
that perhaps you pursue,

517
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,920
do you feel like you're getting a pluralist view?

518
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,020
Are you hearing different perspectives?

519
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,520
Do you have a prismatic view?

520
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,960
I guess that's another way of asking it.

521
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,680
Do you hear dissenting voices,

522
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,920
voices that are questioning orthodoxy?

523
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,840
Because none of these things are straightforward.

524
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,800
Obviously, there is no one given truth in all this.

525
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,040
It's a very complex and very multifaceted event originally,

526
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,220
and what's happened since.

527
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,900
I'm just wondering how you judge

528
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,800
what you've been able to learn through the media.

529
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:39,820
We saw them in front of our eyes being pulverized,

530
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,140
disintegrated in just a few seconds.

531
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,060
Obviously, gripping television.

532
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,740
But did it actually happen?

533
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,400
Everything seems to be wrong with everything regarding the record.

534
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,540
It was surreal.

535
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,140
As we looked at it, we thought it was something out of a movie.

536
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,660
Why is there a cover-up over what happened?

537
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,940
It's very simple, really.

538
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,740
There is supposed to be a cover-up.

539
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,940
It's official policy.

540
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,020
And now, of course, the towers became martyrs.

541
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,160
But did it actually happen, or is there a darker side?

542
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,820
It just didn't seem real.

543
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,000
They became the first skyscraper martyrs that have ever been.

544
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,220
It is an amazing thing to walk up and down the streets

545
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,940
and see vendors on the sidewalks

546
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,820
selling pictures of the World Trade Center,

547
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,240
the way they might have sold pictures of Martin Luther King

548
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,840
or Elvis Presley or something.

549
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,780
They're now selling pictures of a building of the World Trade Center.

550
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,440
I thought, that's what I'm watching. It must be true.

551
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,840
We saw them.

552
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
We saw them in front of our eyes.

553
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,940
And I thought, this is amazing.

554
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,940
We saw them in front of our eyes.

555
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,420
And I thought, that's what I'm watching. It must be true.

556
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,740
Disintegrated in just a few seconds.

557
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,040
But did it actually happen the way we've been shown?

558
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,840
They didn't destroy the two towers.

559
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,480
Or is there a darker side?

560
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,800
It just didn't seem real.

561
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,780
Now let's see what's happening to Judy and Jimmy and the Cinnamon Bear.

562
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,080
We left them at the bottom of the root beer ocean

563
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,660
where their airplane was forced down

564
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,120
after the Cinnamon Bear overtook the airplane.

565
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,940
This made them very sad.

566
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,960
And they were even sadder when Cinnamon Bear told them

567
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,880
there was no way to get out and punch the hole in the fuel tank

568
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,200
and slush all the soda pop gas.

569
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,500
Check it out.

570
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,420
We found it.

571
00:28:52,260 --> 00:29:03,800
It doesn't look very cute.

572
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:04,360


573
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,960
Great moments in oddball sports.

574
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,520
That's an excerpt from Saint.

575
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,040
Tentatively a convenience.

576
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,140
The material there from the bad doctors of genius type.

577
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,120
And this music in the background, by the way.

578
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,600
Is the amino acids.

579
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,160
You might check out theaminoacids.com.

580
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,140
They're in Detroit.

581
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,440
And we're hoping to do a revival with them soon.

582
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,980
Yeah.

583
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:16,940
Yeah.

584
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,020
All your wars is on TV now.

585
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,720
What is this?

586
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,860
It's all broadcasted on television.

587
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,820
Nobody dies.

588
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,340
You see what happens, sis.

589
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,160
You point one of them guns at the robot over there.

590
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,960
And you hear a loud kibble.

591
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,460
And if he's successful, that robot's out of action.

592
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,860
Now, these here weapons are so smart, they actually have an IQ.

593
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,180
It's a bit higher than mine.

594
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,080
That's not the main part of it.

595
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,240
The best part of it is where you can actually shoot.

596
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:57,860
As a matter of fact, I was just watching a TV special that depicted bullets that have tiny computers in them.

597
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,240
Bullets with hearts and souls and minds is what America needs.

598
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,280
Bullets with personalities and underpants.

599
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,760
Bullets with hearts and minds to fight the invincible.

600
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,100
Well, they don't have to have much of a heart.

601
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:18,120
In fact, that would probably prevent them from exploding right over the head of the guy hiding behind the wall.

602
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:18,940
Right.

603
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,080
Which is why they have little brains.

604
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:30,100
Seriously, bullets with microprocessors, 20-millimeter shells that are shot out of futuristic machine guns.

605
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,700
And the machine guns themselves are smart.

606
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,440
They are.

607
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:34,740
They are.

608
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:34,820
They are.

609
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:34,820


610
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:34,820


611
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:34,820


612
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:34,820


613
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:34,820


614
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:34,820


615
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,720
Bullets with hearts and souls.

616
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
A performing anal section.

617
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:48,620
They've got a great video camera hooked up to them so that you can see the kill in slow motion and broadcast it on Japanese TV later.

618
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,620
It's flying everywhere.

619
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:57,640
There's mastic mess and THM fluids and spinal fluids and brain fluids everywhere.

620
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,000
Oh, what a mess, what a mess.

621
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,920
Wow.

622
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,820
That was a great little rock on.

623
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:10,180
It was. We went from the beginning to the end of our military service in one quick little bite.

624
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,580
Go!

625
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,080
Go!

626
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:46,880
Huh? What? What? No!

627
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,140
I'm sorry for the mess.

628
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,420
I'm sorry for the mess.

629
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,220
I'm not sorry. I'm not sorry.

630
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:28,740
Yeah!

631
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,860
Yeah!

632
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,260
The devil!

633
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:34,820


634
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,400
Taking some time off into the morning air.

635
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,260
We've drawn in deep into you,

636
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,620
We've drawn in deep into you.

637
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,780
I'm the happy man

638
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,940
I'm the happy man

639
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:27,520
I'm the happy man

640
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:45,980
I'm the happy man

641
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,720
I'm the happy man

642
00:37:44,720 --> 00:38:04,800
I'm the happy man

643
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:22,500
I'm the happy man

644
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,720
I'm the happy man

645
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:19,140
I'm the happy man

646
00:39:47,380 --> 00:40:04,800
I'm the happy man

647
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:34,800
I'm the happy man

648
00:40:34,820 --> 00:41:04,800
I'm the happy man

649
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:34,800
I'm the happy man

650
00:41:40,220 --> 00:42:00,800
I'm the happy man

651
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:34,800
I'm the happy man

652
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:03,880
I'm the happy man

653
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:34,280
I'm the happy man

654
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:43,140
I'm the happy man

655
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:15,480
I'm the happy man

656
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:38,220
I'm the happy man

657
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:19,860
I'm the happy man

658
00:45:34,840 --> 00:46:04,520
I'm the happy man

659
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:27,880
I'm the happy man

660
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:58,180
I'm the happy man

661
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,420
I'm the happy man

662
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:07,620
I'm the happy man

663
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:07,620


664
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,380
I'm the happy man

665
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:08,380


666
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:08,380


667
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:08,440
I'm the happy man

668
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,300
Photographic records hold the clues to this conspiracy.

669
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,840
And here we see the footage.

670
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,580
If you've just joined us.

671
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,020
It just didn't seem real.

672
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,600
Within spitting distance of Wall Street

673
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,920
and even the Statue of Liberty.

674
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,080
We thought it was something out of a movie.

675
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,200
This is the scene after the planes have slammed into the side

676
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,660
and you see the back tower just crumpling like cars.

677
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,580
But did it actually happen?

678
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,220
Or is there a darker side?

679
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,380
This is the scene...

680
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:34,800
Out of a movie.

681
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,140
Film in a studio.

682
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,380
This is the scene...

683
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:37,940
Out of a movie.

684
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,140
Film in a studio.

685
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,340
This is the scene...

686
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:40,900
Out of a movie.

687
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,100
Film in a studio.

688
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,180
Now looking at this picture of the rock over to the left of the screen

689
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,000
has the letter C marked on it.

690
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,720
Why should there be a letter of the English alphabet stamped onto a rock?

691
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,980
Surely we're looking at the deliberate planting of props

692
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,040
in a pre-designated position

693
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,740
in the foreground of a photographic film set.

694
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,800
That is something that will take us a long time.

695
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:05,920
It's time to wrap ourselves around.

696
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,800
It's hard to contemplate, isn't it?

697
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:12,660
Now whether what we were watching were simulation exercises

698
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,420
being transmitted as the real event

699
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:20,320
is a possibility which needs to be examined

700
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,800
needs to be examined closely.

701
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,540
Of course they did that and that was no secret.

702
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:33,600
It was no secret that photographs and films were taken of models.

703
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,700
It worked as a simulation.

704
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,200
Nobody knew the difference.

705
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:46,080
Well, I think they've all got the chips implanted

706
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,720
just like the boys at Fort Benning.

707
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,680
What do you think of that idea?

708
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,340
Do you think that our American troops or troupettes

709
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,520
as they like to call the ones with the wandlers

710
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:55,660
What is?

711
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,120
Do you think they should be chipped and stroked on their way to

712
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,260
Afghanistan and Iran and Iraq and North Kenya?

713
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,760
Or do you think they should just be dropped from the grape trestles

714
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,860
and maybe swept up into a pile of dung?

715
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:09,800
Why not both?

716
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,680
Oh, well, I see it all the way from...

717
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,220
Let's be flexible.

718
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,560
Toa Baja Puerto Rico.

719
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,680
Don't bend over that way. Bend over this way.

720
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,660
He was in the war, you know.

721
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,080
He was wounded in the head.

722
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:21,640
Yes.

723
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,420
Makes him sort of, well, rather funny at times.

724
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,860
Yes.

725
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:25,780
Yes.

726
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:26,540
Yes.

727
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,720
Quiet. Quiet.

728
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,660
There's nothing so ominous as quiet.

729
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,340
Besides, it isn't quiet.

730
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,940
First, his heart is dead.

731
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:42,580
Hmm.

732
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,440
He's dead.

733
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:45,580
So?

734
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,040
What?

735
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,060
Goodbye.

736
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,040
See, that's all you gotta do.

737
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,440
That's all we can do.

738
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,260
But the thing with the paranoia, if you're getting CSB paranoia,

739
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:00,580
it's a residual kind of thing that lasts long after the listening experience, we'll say.

740
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,240
Because paranoia will imply...

741
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:02,240


742
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:02,540
...deploy you.

743
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:05,120
...odd dreams, strange discolorations of the knee.

744
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:05,780
Paranoia...

745
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,500
I get off on paranoia at this point.

746
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,500
Hey, if you're in the military, paranoia will deploy you.

747
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,800
Oh, yeah.

748
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,160
That's for sure.

749
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,140
The W stands for war.

750
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,800
Shaddam's got a good war bush.

751
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,520
Shaddam's gotta go.

752
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,840
Let's roll.

753
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,960
Let's roll a few...

754
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,220
Let's roll.

755
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,520
...frop sticks out of this...

756
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,760
Let's roll the nuclear device.

757
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,340
...combustible, post-deal coconut device.

758
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,260
Donated for a while.

759
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,340
Donated by Friday Jones.

760
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,240
My God.

761
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:32,300
My God.

762
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,260
Not ready for war.

763
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:34,400
Yeah.

764
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,500
A Friday Jones sentence...

765
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,560
You would ingest something that Friday sent you.

766
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:38,920
I'm not ready for war.

767
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,800
You've got a lot of...

768
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,820
You should be at going to war because you've got a lot of nerve.

769
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:42,980
I'm not ready to...

770
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:43,680
...for your mom.

771
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:44,760
This is military talk.

772
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,620
I'm not ready to drop the bomb.

773
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:51,560
I'm not ready to chew my heart.

774
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,220
And that's why I want to start.

775
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,540
I'm not ready for...

776
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,160
I'm not ready for war.

777
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:00,420
I'm not...

778
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,220
Sorry, quick.

779
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:01,920
I got it.

780
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,420
What? Jessica, she was supposed to take her clothes off while she's singing?

781
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,300
Seek!

782
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:07,320
Hide!

783
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:08,720
Seek!

784
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,420
Hide!

785
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:13,340
That's what she was supposed to say as she disrobed.

786
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:13,780
Seek!

787
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,020
Hide!

788
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:15,980
Seek!

789
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,340
Hide and seek!

790
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,280
Seek!

791
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:18,700
Hide and seek!

792
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:19,920
Seek!

793
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,540
Hide and seek!

794
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,060
How stupid. We entertain ourselves with this.

795
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,780
And no one else can care about it, don't you know why?

796
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,180
Of course you do.

797
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,340
You never know why.

798
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,740
It hurts to care.

799
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,120
It hurts, doesn't it?

800
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,380
It helps to hate.

801
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,940
It's like a poo-poo that won't come out.

802
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,860
It's like having the armature removed.

803
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,040
It's painful.

804
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:43,340
It's like having the sticks in your bag of sticks all broken.

805
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,280
Yes, yes.

806
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,840
It's like trying to smoke the sticks and they become...

807
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,780
All your broken sticks.

808
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,240
...in your heart.

809
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,080
It's painful.

810
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,300
It's like being in pain and hurt.

811
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:54,700
No, I'm saying. No, I'm saying.

812
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,260
Yes, I...

813
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,360
No, you're saying. No, you're saying.

814
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,500
I think I know what you're saying, but I don't know if I...

815
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,320
No, mine. No, mine.

816
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,120
No, wait a minute.

817
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,460
You're sweating a little bit, Mr. Stang.

818
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,680
Your left eye is...

819
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,600
I told you, man, I get off on the paranoia.

820
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,340
No, no, I think you're lying, Mr. Stang.

821
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,500
It's like, bring it on, man.

822
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,380
It's like all your reference, Stang.

823
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,460
Bring it on.

824
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,080
No, no, no.

825
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,060
The coyote, because he is the paranoid animal...

826
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:18,560
Oh, yes, talk about him again.

827
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,580
...is the most aware animal.

828
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,100
Yes, yes.

829
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,520
The coyote, because he's paranoid, is all aware.

830
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,320
He never sleeps.

831
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:25,800
No, no.

832
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,940
He's always on the prowl.

833
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,380
One eye.

834
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,400
He's always on the hunt.

835
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,840
The coyote...

836
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,320
That's coming up.

837
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:30,820
...sees.

838
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,160
...lifts.

839
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,200
He's changing.

840
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,200
And he whiffs.

841
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:33,860
He's changing.

842
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,680
He whiffs it.

843
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:41,040
He whiffs it.

844
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:48,200
The change was complete.

845
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,900
A radical mastectomy.

846
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,980
An arm full of hair.

847
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:57,220
And wings the size of buzzard ears.

848
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,700
Even a man who is full of slack...

849
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,040
...and lets his farts by night.

850
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,000
His feet...

851
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
...like the feet of a dog.

852
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,620
...may become the weird bob...

853
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,440
His hands were like the hands of a...

854
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,160
...when the pea-bomb blooms.

855
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,920
Yes, he was the coyote.

856
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,240
...and the furs are full of bed.

857
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:12,920
...was the last wind.

858
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:13,320
No!

859
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,260
Yes, the last wind.

860
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:22,240
...and the furs are full of bed.

861
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,980
Well, till next week.

862
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,040
Keep your head undyed.

863
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,580
You're back to the wind.

864
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:50,180
Wait for further instructions.

865
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,200
And keep your babies warm.

866
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,180
You know the sound...

867
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,480
...may not tell you more.

868
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,180
...of this week.

869
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,580
You're back to the wind.

870
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,680
...and the furs are full of bed.

871
00:53:59,680 --> 00:53:59,680


872
00:53:59,680 --> 00:53:59,680


873
00:53:59,680 --> 00:53:59,680


874
00:53:59,680 --> 00:53:59,680


875
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,600
Keep your babies warm.

876
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,420
The awaker shall sleep.

877
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,380
The awaker shall sleep.

878
00:54:40,420 --> 00:55:10,380
The awaker shall sleep.

879
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,500
The awaker shall sleep.

880
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,400
The awaker shall sleep.

881
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:40,400
The awaker shall sleep.

882
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,400
The awaker shall sleep.

883
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:35,480
The awaker shall sleep.

884
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,840
The awaker shall sleep.
