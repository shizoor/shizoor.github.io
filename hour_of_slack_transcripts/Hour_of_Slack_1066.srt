1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
Oh, I already got this free information by mail.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:08,340
You know, 66% of Americans favor banning

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,420
THE POWER OF SLACK!

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,160
Detroit will mainly be in Florida and the Four Corners region today.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,320
Unfortunately, in both areas.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,400
Seattle, now in Phoenix for the high.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,500
The biggest difficulty is knowing that it is so crazy inside

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,280
and trying to make it look good on the outside.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:31,760
Because...

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,820
That's right.

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,120
Praise the eyes of Bob that look into yours as you look into them.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,940
They are looking back and you are looking into them.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,400
You are falling into the eyes of Bob and you will never hit the bottom.

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,300
On and on and on.

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,080
Friends.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:04,320
I want you to bang your heads against the concrete cinder blocks in joy and pain

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,980
to the lilting melodies of King of Slack, Bill D. Miller!

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,020
King of all Slack!

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,200
Alright, first before I can go any further,

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,380
I must cast the Circle of Slack.

21
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
In the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,400
Connie Dobbs,

23
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,660
the Right Reverend Ivan Stang,

24
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,520
and the true Doctor of all Doctors,

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,500
Jimi Hendrix,

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,360
and myself, the King of Slack,

27
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,360
I cast the Circle of Slack!

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:49,720
Yes!

29
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,320
All are the same!

30
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,380
Test Variety Theater presents...

31
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,580
Yes, it's Test Variety Theater with first citizen Bob, first citizen Bob.

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,200
Why, Bob?

33
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,420
Well, thanks Bob, but ah-ha-ha.

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,940
You're going to be- you're gonna have to be on your toes, Bob.

35
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,780
I want you to meet Bob.

36
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,420
Glad to know you, Bob.

37
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,840
Thank you, Bob, for a delicious lip-smacking treat.

38
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,760
Head for a delicious lip-smacking treat.

39
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,340
Head for some...

40
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:19,980
your nearby...

41
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,500
What do you mean?

42
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,200
Gee, you're so romantic-like.

43
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,180
I went in after him and I hid.

44
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,820
He took a steam bath, then he had a massage, then he went into a shower.

45
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,040
When he came out of it, I knew I had him.

46
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,840
Don't tell me you...

47
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,720
Yeah, I picked him up by the ankles and I slapped him just like he slapped me.

48
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,480
Look up.

49
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,340
Up.

50
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,100
Up.

51
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,560
As soon as Bob gets the plumbing on his bazooka assembled, he's going to return to our variety

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,360
theater footlights.

53
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,380
Well, I didn't know how to spark a girl, and I didn't know anything about sparking any

54
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,320
kind of a girl, as a matter of fact, especially a sophisticated girl like her.

55
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:52,720
Oh.

56
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,460
Yeah, she'd been on more laps than a cafeteria napkin.

57
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,660
And I'll never forget the night I proposed to this sweetheart of mine.

58
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,820
I asked her for a hand.

59
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,680
She said, which one?

60
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,760
I said, don't make no difference.

61
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,820
I won't get nothing anyhow.

62
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,400
How come you do me like you do?

63
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:09,780
Well.

64
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,960
There's no way I'd even be seen.

65
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,240
You sure could

66
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,680
I was in tears.

67
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,500
And so, thank you for bringing your friend Bob I did your laundry for every little little

68
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,120
esas you didn't come here to scan on.

69
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,280
We got you taken care of.

70
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,280


71
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,060
Writing life-size files is just so real.

72
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,060


73
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,300
We're good to go.

74
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,460
Let's go.

75
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,600
Taste the blood on Satan's claw

76
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,200
Dance a jig in crimson bra

77
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,900
Build the fire for boiling pot

78
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,700
Watch the neighbors don't get caught

79
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,380
Ernest Borg and I knew him well

80
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,920
St. Bill Shatner straight to hell

81
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,680
What the hay, it served him right

82
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,300
Eyeball sockets wrinkled tight

83
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,420
Well, there's a big light shining in the coconut grove

84
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,800
Where Satan used to watch the Barney Miller show

85
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,760
Syndicated television puts him in the mood

86
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,380
Hoping a pagoda just might get nude

87
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,760
Satan gets an erection

88
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,660
Staring at a pagoda's butt

89
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,220
Meat and poultry by the pack

90
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,800
Extra servings, bring them back

91
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,520
Ain't no need to raise a fuss

92
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,200
Just yodel your way to that flaky crust

93
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,640
Satan was invented by religious fundamentalists

94
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,720
Just to keep you acting like the jerk you really are

95
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,980
Sammy Davis Jr. used to worship Satan

96
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,160
When he wasn't taking drugs

97
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,260
Staring in the mirror while his eyeball twitched around

98
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,940
Let's watch Sammy's eyeball twitch!

99
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,100
Well, don't bother asking if it's greasy or red

100
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,740
Or if he's got pointy horns stuck in his head

101
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,380
All you need to prove it is a Bible-thumping prick

102
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,020
Satan only happens if your tater's all shit

103
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,100
Hey, Satan!

104
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,540
Satan, he works better than guilt from your mind.

105
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,500
Taste the blood on Satan's claw.

106
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:34,800
Yodeling Satan from Joe Newman, or Joe Newman's Rudy Schwartz Project.

107
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,820
Joe Newman is the greatest sung hero of doctor music, my friends.

108
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,920
And you can find out everything you need to know at schwartztone.com.

109
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,880
That's S-C-H-W-A-R-T-Z, schwartztone.com.

110
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,100
The theme of this Hour of Slack, which is number 1066,

111
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,760
the theme is Bugs, Insanity, and God, Three Peas in a Pod.

112
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,160
And you might actually, it's also about yetis and squid.

113
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,580
And you might call this,

114
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,880
a Dr. Hal special,

115
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,160
because there's a lot of that worthy,

116
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,700
that covenant man from KPFA's Puzzling Evidence Show with Philo,

117
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,040
and from the last X-Day drill.

118
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,460
Plus, we have more Bill T. Miller,

119
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,220
the great king of Slack, Bill T. Miller,

120
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,140
who was heard earlier casting the circle of Slack

121
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,740
and mixing the eyes of Bob with irreverent Friday Jones.

122
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,180
Lee Murr, of course,

123
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,060
and the entire crew of the show.

124
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,160
So, we're gonna have to wait for the intro and PR news

125
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,220
and most of the short collages on the show,

126
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,780
which you'll hear which peel your brain from the middle out.

127
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,800
But now, Fat Harry White from his album, Mmm Baby.

128
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,800
Hey there, sweet little nurse.

129
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,600
Come into the strong yet capable hands of Dr. White.

130
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,500
Ow!

131
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,380
I'm gonna perform

132
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,560
some delicate surgery of the heart.

133
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,560
So, come here my child

134
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,420
and lay right down on my operating table, yeah.

135
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,220
Hey, I tell you, talking about medical matters, right?

136
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,700
You know, I went to see my old mate Fat Larry at the hospital.

137
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,040
He's having his tonsils out.

138
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,700
Now, I had mine done about six months ago.

139
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,020
I remember I was having a lot of trouble

140
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,800
and my very, very handsome man friend, Dr. Simon,

141
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,400
you know, he's from Leicester's a shire, right?

142
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,220
Said I better let him operate.

143
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,660
Well, I submissively laid back while he came over me.

144
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,420
And after a few tentative probes and pokes,

145
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,200
he whipped out me big swollen pear

146
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,980
as soon as you could say Jack Robinson.

147
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,000
Brought me instant relief, I can tell you.

148
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,440
Although, of course, he did leave me a little raw

149
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,600
and it was quite a while before I could swallow properly.

150
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
Well, anyway, I went to see Fat Lass.

151
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,860
I took him some chocolates and for a gag,

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,440
I hid them under me ankle length black fur coat

153
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,020
with the single vent at the rear.

154
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,680
Well, when I got there, Fat Lass looked at the bulge down below

155
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,200
and said,

156
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,740
and turning me round, prized open the slit at the back

157
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,620
to get a good look at the old big box.

158
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,560
Well, he greedily grabbed it

159
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,860
and was just about to get stuck in when I remembered,

160
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,440
Oi, Lass, nil by mouth our kid.

161
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,240
Oh, well, he was right, act off.

162
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,820
Said he was fed up not getting what he wanted.

163
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,760
Said that very morning, the hospital cook had presented him

164
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,400
with his lovely spotted dick

165
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,360
and he hadn't been able to take that either.

166
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,260
Oh, blimey.

167
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,040
Well, I felt sorry for him,

168
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,920
but I fancied the chocolates meself.

169
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,200
And fair play to Larry,

170
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,120
he helped me push them all in me mouth.

171
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,240
And what a sight the very, very sexy ward sister friend found

172
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,360
when she came in, saw Fat Lass stuffing me between the cheeks, you know.

173
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,160
Well, I left him soon after, feeling very sorry for himself.

174
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,400
But I know it won't be too long

175
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,800
before he'll be able to gobble away to his heart's content.

176
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,960
But, you know, I mean, you should look after yourself, shouldn't you?

177
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,780
Which is why me and my very, very sexy lady friend, Foxy Fiona,

178
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,400
went to a health farm

179
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,740
just the other week.

180
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,780
Well, we got there, we got to our bedroom with our luggage.

181
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,100
I was just about to unload me big bag in the corner

182
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,800
when first sexy lady friend, Foxy Fiona,

183
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,320
asked me if I'd be, you know, rising early.

184
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,160
Well, when I told her I wanted to be up at six, her jaw dropped.

185
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,300
She said it might be a bit too hard for her,

186
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,680
you know, getting up so early.

187
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,840
Still, she soon got used to it

188
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,600
and particularly enjoyed an early dip in the pool just before breakfast.

189
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,320
I'd recommend it too.

190
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,680
You know, a quick length.

191
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,560
First thing in the morning always puts a spring in your step.

192
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,940
Well, when it came to breakfast time,

193
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,700
we were at it like rabbits,

194
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,440
you know, scoffing away at all the lettuce and carrot salad.

195
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,420
I also enjoyed the celery that was available,

196
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,520
but when I offered some to Foxy Fiona, she refused.

197
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,920
She said she didn't really fancy gobbling on a full store just then,

198
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,700
but if I, you know, gave it to her later in the sauna,

199
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,620
she might have a nibble.

200
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,740
Well, as we were on a strict vegan diet,

201
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,060
we weren't allowed to eat any dairy produce,

202
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,140
which personally I found very difficult indeed.

203
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,720
And I've got to confess, I did try to smuggle some butter in,

204
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,180
but unfortunately, would you adamant believe it, I got caught.

205
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,520
I mean, I only had a small knob and was really surprised

206
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,840
when the elf farm manager walked into my bedroom,

207
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,780
grabbed hold of it and tossed it out of the window.

208
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,600
Still, apart from that, we had an enjoyable time.

209
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,940
It's anecdotal really, but look after your health

210
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,480
and then you'll be in the mood for loving.

211
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,460
Come over to the good doctor, Dr. White.

212
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,860
The doctor of...

213
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,320
Fat Harry White.

214
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,820
And you can get more Fat Harry White from,

215
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,460
you got that pencil ready, myspace.com

216
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,400
slash fat harry white.

217
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,800
But now for some puzzling evidence.

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,080
And by the way, you can get every show of puzzling evidence

219
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,460
just about if you go in there,

220
00:11:59,460 --> 00:11:59,800
and you can get all the information you need.

221
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,720
And that's again by way of quiveringbrain.com.

222
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,740
Once again, that's quiveringbrain.com.

223
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,140
We have only a certain amount of time

224
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,040
to devote to every segment.

225
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,280
Yes, we need to move on to the next segment.

226
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,060
Thank you.

227
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,840
While we wash our way through the slush.

228
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,900
Somebody throw him a fish.

229
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,300
I'm glad I wore my waders.

230
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,360
Did we have a wader segment planned?

231
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,440
Did you know dust is a good thing?

232
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,700
It's expensive.

233
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,860
Did you know that, Reverend Howe?

234
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,400
Dust into dust.

235
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,260
Reverend Dr. Howe, Mr. Reverend Dr. Howe.

236
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,120
And under dust to die.

237
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,740
And did you know when you allow this dust

238
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,480
to circulate freely in your shop,

239
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,500
it will ruin expensive tools?

240
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,420
And worse than that, little chiggery booger bugs

241
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,660
will come crawling out.

242
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,500
They'll come out and they will crawl up into your little booger bugs.

243
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,200
They will crawl in there and crawl in there,

244
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,920
and crawl in there.

245
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,580
A name to remember when you think of...

246
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,920
We've got 35,000 listeners.

247
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,000
Yes, once one mentions those bugs.

248
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,760
Once we durabonded and we cut these listeners together,

249
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,080
much like...

250
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,820
Oh, sorry.

251
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,840
I didn't mean it.

252
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,820
I have a model somewhere of one of these bugs.

253
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,960
Here it is.

254
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,760
Now you'll notice on page 27,

255
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,880
Encyclopedia Entomologica,

256
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,060
this creature is described as a cowering menace.

257
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,860
Mankind's greatest foe.

258
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,720
The humble, simple...

259
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,080
Oh, you're getting out of here.

260
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,420
To provide a single...

261
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:37,700
I had this glass.

262
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
Yes, we need to resource that...

263
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,040
Are you here?

264
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,180
Yeah, we're here.

265
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,840
Right over here.

266
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,340
Come on in.

267
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,360
We're doing show.

268
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,800
Now we need to...

269
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,880
Honey, have you seen my bug collection?

270
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,060
I think she undercut your bug collection.

271
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:10,260
We don't know how much to charge it is...

272
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:27,140
I think she gets in TH clicker.

273
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,140
We need to be tough in that.

274
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,780
It may cut to 4.

275
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,040
I think you're

276
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,560
Come on everyone, join the fun

277
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,580
We've got thinking on the run

278
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,540
The Earth is circled by the sun

279
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,140
Creation Science Polka

280
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,640
Science classes in our schools

281
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,580
Taught by superstitious fools

282
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,520
Jerry Falwell sets the rules

283
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,120
Creation Science Polka

284
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,360
The universe was fabricated

285
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,020
In six literal days

286
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,660
The humans and the dinosaurs

287
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,020
Shared a condo in L.A.

288
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,500
Carbon dating makes us cringe

289
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,420
We're the right-wing lunatic fringe

290
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,400
Jesus died for our sins

291
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,040
Creation Science Polka

292
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,960
Science and theاب

293
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,120
Science and theاب

294
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:51,760
Science and theاب

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,680
asy

296
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:08,080
The Bible says the Earth is only 6,000 years old

297
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,480
Deny and Jesus Christ will roast your balls on burning coals

298
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,120
Come on everyone, join the fun

299
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,180
Ignorance has almost won

300
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,100
Get geology from a nun

301
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,760
Creation science polka

302
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,100
Take your children out of school

303
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,140
Homespun dogma is so cool

304
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,200
Prop them up, watch them drool

305
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,700
Creation science polka

306
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:54,580
A Rudy Schwartz project did creation science polka

307
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,740
Available, I guess, from

308
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,080
TheFNDC.com

309
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,260
Something like Schwartz.com

310
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,140
No, SchwartzTone.com

311
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,800
And now

312
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,380
Some live hour of slack

313
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,640
Recorded outdoors right in front of everybody

314
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,140
Well, everybody cool anyway

315
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,780
And in front of all the passing tractors

316
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,420
At Brushwood Folklore Center

317
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,540
During the 9X Day Drill

318
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,380
Well, is it working now?

319
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,840
It's working now

320
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,100
I don't know what happened

321
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, we had some kind of technical problem

322
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,960
The solution might have been as easy as blowing a puff of air into the old ding futcher

323
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,440
I don't want to bore you with a lot of technical terms

324
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,820
But some kind of watsit got caught in the whatchamacallit

325
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,600
So we had to make that contraptoid work the way it was supposed to

326
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,160
Because that ding buster had frozen right up

327
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,300
And it didn't record our words and our voices

328
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,700
And now, a loud

329
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:04,380
tractor drowns out even our words at the moment. The plowman homeward plods his

330
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,880
weary way and leaves the world to darkness and to me. Now fades the

331
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,080
glimmering landscape on the height while all the air a solemn stillness holds,

332
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,600
save where the beetle wheels his droning flight and drowsy tinklings lull the

333
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:29,780
distant folds. Save that from yonder ivy mantled tower the moping owl does to

334
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:35,900
the moon complain of such as wandering near her secret bower molest her ancient

335
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:44,120
solitary reign. That was better than that Benji the Yeti routine that we tried, we

336
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,220
missed recording. Benji the Yeti had fur from head to toe.

337
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,680
And the children say when they saw him that day that he stank like a buffalo.

338
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:06,880
Well sure to us he may smell offensive different. Our poorly evolved sensorium

339
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,480
is not able to deal with the many complicated organic molecules which are

340
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:21,900
part of Yeti's signaling array. That and the shiny rainbow

341
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,500
run.

342
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,360
Well you know the Yeti's I'm told use artifice in addition to their natural

343
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:34,140
secretions and I mean I don't know if this is blasphemy to say but I've heard

344
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:40,040
that by cultivating the use of special herbs and objects that are found in

345
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:47,960
their vicinity they can create important oils, olei and essences which do not

346
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,840
suppress but rather augment their natural effusions.

347
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:58,760
They do not use deodorant they use odorant and they use it far more wisely than humans

348
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:05,780
can ever understand and we have the temerity to say that they stink like a whorehouse laundry.

349
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,740
What do we know?

350
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:14,060
But there are I understand that the Sherpas in Tibet when they can would try to

351
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,360
scrape the oils from the Yeti.

352
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,520
Even from the leaves where the Yeti has passed they add this.

353
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,520
Scraping to their nanunyak or preparation as they call it.

354
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:34,600
Now as I understand it that's a kind of beer made from saliva chewed as old women chewed

355
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,920
beetle nuts or something like that.

356
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:43,560
It is fermented it is a watery yellowish brown liquid with according to the early German

357
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:51,360
explorer von Kieningswald an offensive smell but once again this is a subjective opinion.

358
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,040
Right and who cares if it gets you high?

359
00:20:53,420 --> 00:21:00,560
Well von Kieningswald was too credulous about some of the things he heard and refused to

360
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:08,340
believe other things which now we know to be true but he was important in deducing the

361
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,800
primary diet of the Yeti from an examination of its teeth and molars.

362
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:21,340
I thought one of the most amazing things that the Yeti did was the I don't know what it

363
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:27,400
was I assume it was the American Sasquatch Yetis who somehow managed to get that fellow

364
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,620
in Oregon to go around making fake Yeti tracks.

365
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,500
And Yeti films.

366
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,880
Right Yeti films just so that years later when he died it could all be revealed as a

367
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,020
hoax and at that point people quit searching for Yetis.

368
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:49,740
Well they live in the wilds and they take the long view they are not accustomed to immediate

369
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,800
gratification.

370
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:58,720
And immediate reaction and it pays off evolutionarily speaking it protects the Yeti gene pool.

371
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:06,820
However it has been said that the snaky hypnotic power of the Eastern Yeti is not really the

372
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,920
specialty of the North American New World Yeti or Sasquatch.

373
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:18,620
But you know at one time there was a Siberian land bridge and at that time both types of

374
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,960
gigantopithecus commune.

375
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


376
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


377
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


378
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


379
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


380
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


381
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


382
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


383
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


384
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


385
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


386
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


387
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


388
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:20,780


389
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:28,980
And over that strip of land which is now an archipelago and a dividing ocean even.

390
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:37,700
And of course there's always been people who especially ladies who found Yetis irresistible.

391
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,560
Yes.

392
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,780
We go out and lure the Yetis into cohabiting with them briefly.

393
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:49,280
Of course the husbands always claimed that the Yeti had raped the woman.

394
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:49,700
Yes.

395
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:56,220
In the book of Genesis we see how the seed of Adam was multiplied when the women lay

396
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:03,620
with the sons of the stars of the morning star thought said in the punitive Christian

397
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,980
tradition to be demons.

398
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:11,040
These are of course the forest men forest people or Yetis the other people Stanislaw

399
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,560
Zukalski has.

400
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:19,000
Zukalski was great in his understanding of the Yeti and its relationship to the humans.

401
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,060
But of course we in the Church of the subgenius believe that the Yeti was more welcome than

402
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:34,080
an intruder or an invader and that Yeti influence or blood and the old way of saying is something

403
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,000
benign and praiseworthy.

404
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,820
Yeah it's a shame.

405
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:45,080
Zukalski thought the Yetis were the source of criminality and dictators.

406
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,600
Responsible for war intolerance.

407
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:48,980
Yes.

408
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:48,980


409
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:48,980


410
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,260
And all the human failings.

411
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,960
It's so sad to see a self-hating Yetimson.

412
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,320
You know especially a guy who's so obviously only two or three generations away from pure

413
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,360
full-blood Yeti.

414
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,880
But the generations do mark the truth of the change.

415
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,380
Well I was called a kook by Zukalski.

416
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,380
Did you know that?

417
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,860
Because you dared to articulate your advances.

418
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,980
Because I tried to tell him.

419
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,760
Because you dared to articulate your advances.

420
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:18,980
Zukalski was a kook.

421
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,120
And he did tell me his theory about the Gigantopithecus.

422
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,700
That we were better off acknowledging that portion of our bloodline.

423
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,140
And that they were the sinned against, not the sinners.

424
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,460
You've always said that Gigantopithecus should be called Gigantanthropus.

425
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,140
Gigantthropus.

426
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,360
Because that's more manlike.

427
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:47,900
That was the that was what Dr. Carl Veedenrich said in his books Apes, Giant and Men.

428
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,980
Giant and Men.

429
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:48,980


430
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,960
and men. Because, it is

431
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,940
true, this is a principle of anthropology

432
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,640
and biology. You judge what

433
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,040
something is by its teeth, most of all.

434
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,340
And the teeth of Gigantopithecus

435
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,320
have humanoid

436
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,120
qualities, rather than simian

437
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,900
qualities. Girls, you know what big

438
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,960
teeth means. Well, this

439
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,820
creature had the advantage of immense

440
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,880
size. Big braces!

441
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,340
It was huge.

442
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,140
So huge!

443
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,000
So vast!

444
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,480
So vast! That their

445
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,520
footprints were mistaken for

446
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,360
legs. Yes,

447
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,740
it was said of the Anakim,

448
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,580
the sons of Anak

449
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,460
in the Bible, that they were so

450
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,360
vast that we, the

451
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,420
Israelite scouts, were

452
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,480
as grasshoppers in their sight.

453
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,540
There were giants in the earth

454
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,500
in those days. Amen, brother.

455
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,620
And one could draw out

456
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,440
Leviathan with a hook if one had

457
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,580
patience. But if

458
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,460
one had a really cute mini

459
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:46,880
skirt,

460
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,660
that was another way to draw out

461
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,540
Leviathan, so to speak. And the unicorn

462
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,740
from his bosky dell.

463
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,720
Yes, the world

464
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,580
could be at peace. And centaur,

465
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,760
triton, fawn, and

466
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,880
a flapping

467
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,740
phoenix shared

468
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,220
the golden woods

469
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,940
of the Hesperides.

470
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,960
Look at those geese

471
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,300
over there. Jolly cyclopses.

472
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:11,500
Birds of peace.

473
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,820
Battening upon the wines of

474
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,340
autumn, while merry

475
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,140
Silenus brayed his

476
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,080
laughter, surrounded by the nubile

477
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,920
nymphs of grove and stream.

478
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,260
Ah, those were the good old

479
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,920
days, Dr. Howell, before the

480
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,020
conspiracy came along and screwed

481
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,960
everything up. Before these sylvan

482
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,180
scenes were covered with parking lots

483
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,360
and decaying industrial installations,

484
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,180
business parks of

485
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,140
cracked concrete and toxic

486
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,020
dumps of plastic garbage

487
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,280
cans. There were yeti droppings

488
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,900
instead of plastic

489
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,740
bags and

490
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,060
aluminum cans. And the discarded

491
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,320
stems of the grapes consumed

492
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,300
by Silenus and the nymphs and

493
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:54,820
naiads.

494
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,320
What about those nymphs? I want to hear more about

495
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,760
these nymphs. Well, they followed in the train

496
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,080
of Bacchus, but what

497
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,300
one always sees is Silenus.

498
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,640
Bacchus was a beautiful

499
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,280
youth with vine leaves in his hair, right?

500
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,920
Like Caravaggio painted.

501
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,180
But Silenus was the fat,

502
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,920
old, drunk guy with a

503
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,220
red nose who was the head,

504
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,300
of the satyrs, and who

505
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,320
was always followed by the beautiful

506
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,900
Bacchantes. Women,

507
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,220
mysterious, lovely,

508
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,880
and wild, and also quite

509
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,240
dangerous when they were

510
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,000
in the wrong mood,

511
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,440
as many found out.

512
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,300
Oh, the lucky people

513
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,220
get to follow Bacchus. I had to, I

514
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,420
was, had to follow Sturculus.

515
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,200
But remember what happened

516
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,840
to Orpheus,

517
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,680
torn to pieces by

518
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,840
the Bacchantes, and some

519
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,080
even

520
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,940
say devoured. These lovely

521
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,520
girls devoured the

522
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,700
rich red strips

523
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,700
of his flesh, and

524
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,140
his blood was as red

525
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,120
as their lips and nipples

526
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,780
as they consumed him in an

527
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,180
orgy of pleasure.

528
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,160
And I think these rock

529
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,460
and roll shows are so

530
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,240
shocking and scandalous and exciting

531
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,080
these days. Yes,

532
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,080
they have no understanding

533
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,760
because they have allowed their

534
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,580
tools to become

535
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,360
preeminent. If a tool is an

536
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,100
extension of the hand, still one

537
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,760
must remember where the hand

538
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,860
clutches the handle of the tool

539
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,080
repeatedly.

540
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,000
.

541

585
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,460
compiled

586
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,020
in a

587
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,020


588
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,800
Èlite.

589
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:18,980
Le

590
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,140
était

591
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,500
normal,

592
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,500
me back to the hidden valley of Haddath by the Nile.

593
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,680
Yes, I was there with you that time when we were by the Nile.

594
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,260
Some vacation, huh? Yeah, it was really, I couldn't stand the bugs. There was just

595
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,760
too many flies and mosquitoes. The flies, yes, they caught

596
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,540
black rain there. They would crawl up into your

597
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,000
regions and buzz about all free and

598
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,400
aware of their own surroundings.

599
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,240
But you know the birds there are monogamous.

600
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,920
Ah, yeah, hygamous, hogamous, birds are monogamous.

601
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,060
Hogamous, hygamous, men are polygamous.

602
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,520
That's about right. I often recite that

603
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,120
for myself when in the shower, conducting an old

604
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,800
rehearsal with my father.

605
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,160
Yes, the ancient Egyptians

606
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,380
and life-changing

607
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:47,580
life, they lived in rooms of mud brick. In death, they built to last forever. Nothing

608
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:54,160
less than the world's largest building would do for the god-king Khufu. But why was it

609
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:01,360
built? How and by whom? What feats of organization, which no one else could rival, were used in

610
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,160
erecting the gigantic monument?

611
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,240
I know the answer to that.

612
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,700
Hidden entrances, secret passages, and people.

613
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,560
I know the answer.

614
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,240
Well, you know the answer?

615
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,400
Well, lay it on us then.

616
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,540
Space aliens.

617
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,000
Oh, god damn. That's absolutely...

618
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,180
Space aliens did it.

619
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,240
They didn't build Grand Central Station either.

620
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,260
They brought the plans with them

621
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,660
and they just gave them to the humans

622
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,260
because they said, these humans are too dumb to think of this stuff

623
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,440
on their own. There's no way they can do it.

624
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,760
We're going to have to give them...

625
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,120
So all of those bursts of

626
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,100
technology were only because

627
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,080
space aliens came and

628
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,460
gave us what we needed.

629
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,880
There were no space aliens.

630
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,280
Space aliens were not the guys you mean.

631
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,700
How do I know?

632
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,700
Because I was there.

633
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,680
Yes. In an earlier life.

634
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,180
And I remember when the foreman of the tomb workers

635
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,860
had a mysterious accident.

636
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,300
You will see it represented today that these pyramids were built by slaves.

637
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,540
But it wasn't so. Everyone was well paid.

638
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,740
Paid in beer?

639
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,160
Instructor starts out with速 I'm not addicting you.

640
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,160


641
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,980
Why don't you say some word of Ming Jah?

642
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:32,980


643
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:32,980


644
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,280
I did say are going to sell some delicious Sur-i chung chuscr,

645
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,300
I will do it all up, there's no sign of

646
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:33,300


647
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,700
Hey ya'll, to switches muitas ways.

648
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:39,700


649
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:39,700


650
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,220
By the time that thing becomes the cord ins Yup dxx so black

651
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,220


652
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:57,320
something to chew. So guess what I did do? I had some jello. I had some gum, some soup

653
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:13,980
and pudding too. But I'm just someone who likes to eat jello. I ate so much my belly

654
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:26,640
started to hurt. I threw up on my shirt and it was all jello.

655
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:57,300
Do you know, you know I love it so! I left my jello. So I went to sea and I climbed the

656
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:57,300


657
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:57,300


658
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:57,300


659
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:57,300


660
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:57,300


661
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,720
The dead Kennedys

662
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,160
The singer happened to be

663
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,320
Nangelo went to see

664
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,160
The women's wrestling

665
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,700
And they were wrestling

666
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,020
In Jell-O

667
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,460
Later that night

668
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,920
The waiter said to me

669
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,080
Maybe you'd like

670
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,880
To try some raspberry

671
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,660
I said no thanks

672
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,500
I'll have the strawberry

673
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,680
But he said

674
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,320
But he just looked at me

675
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,000
I went to sleep

676
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,900
My stomach full of goo

677
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,020
And then I woke up too

678
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:27,520
More jello while I have it for

679
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,800
My lunch and dinner too

680
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,460
Oh, nothing else will do

681
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,380
Except for the feed

682
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:57,320
And now for...

683
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,040
The president of the puedo

684
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,420
He, the president

685
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:02,740

angry you can feel hurt you can feel sad remember nothing in life has any meaning

702
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:28,100
well did you ever really like pity the entomologists for feeling irrelevant well they

703
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:34,840
usually feel bugs not elephants but the vast majority of insect species have no impact on the

704
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:41,640
gnp or the price of bread that's a misconception because these insects profoundly they do not cure

705
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,260
cancer they do not

706
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:49,420
taste good and many people think they don't even look good but maybe they think that you taste good

707
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,860
and maybe they think that you don't look good to them well i don't see them writing books and

708
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:58,980
talking on the radio right now to them you're the monster and you can't receive their radio i don't

709
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:06,100
see them out there saving lives and fighting wars they don't save you corrupting the youth they save

710
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:13,080
the lives of fellow termites and uh like that oh so you mean they're they're they're just basically uh

711
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:20,100
species biased huh they are on their own wavelength they just they just discriminate against us

712
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:28,260
because of our species can you imagine that as if typically this type of accounting is

713
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:36,820
no point in being so multi-culti all species are in one sense at war in competition for the

714
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,940
winning niche which ensures survival of the germ plasm into the coming generation

715
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:59,460
in an omic about others over 90 units is the pokemon

716
00:38:59,460 --> 00:38:59,580
here

717
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,200
in the

718
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:02,640
open

719
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,220
than

720
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:03,720
the

721
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,340
canceled

722
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:11,520
Large as we can, given the size of our mighty dollars here and there.

723
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:17,620
Over there, we can see the vendors that will take our dollars so freely.

724
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,560
Oh, and drop them in the water once again.

725
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:29,120
At a trial in 1150 BC, a robber confessed under torture to violating the tomb of Ramses II.

726
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:37,020
And then he compounded his crime by robbing the tombs of Ramses' twin sons.

727
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:44,060
But we will never know some of the secrets that keep the dead alive.

728
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,220
Did he take the corpse?

729
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,480
The reanimated mummy of the legends of the tomb.

730
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,420
The incision through which the internal organs were removed.

731
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,180
The scarab that protects the heart.

732
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,860
Witness to all you did in life.

733
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:03,820
The instrument used to pour liquid resin through the nose into the brain.

734
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,240
The linen used to wrap the mummy.

735
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,040
All 400 yards of it.

736
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:18,920
And the 70 days of ritual black magic that allowed a soul to return to its body.

737
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,060
We like to use those with all fields as measurements.

738
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:28,880
And with the infusion of the sacred tanner leaves passing its withered...

739
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,520
...lips.

740
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,400
It's a long way. How far is that?

741
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,360
The mummy regains its...

742
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:32,680
Why is that?

743
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,240
...and shambles to its feet.

744
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,220
Twelve million feet.

745
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,740
Off to do the bidding of the master of the temple of Puck.

746
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,080
Or twelve jillion inches. Or twelve quadrillion nanometers.

747
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,940
And yet there's two very good reasons for using a peerless standard.

748
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,880
The mummy. It's coming. It's coming I tell you. It's coming!

749
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,920
Why is it doing that?

750
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,600
Well, it...

751
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,080
It's abusing itself.

752
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:07,280
It wants to get the scroll of Thoth back and we have it. That's one problem.

753
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,240
It's unwinding itself.

754
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,820
Now, when he was alive, Imhotep would shower every morning and brush his teeth with salt.

755
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,940
He would moisturize daily with hippopotamus fat.

756
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,520
Drink beer through a straw. Write letters to the dead.

757
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,620
And at the age of twenty, began preparing a tomb for the perfect afterlife.

758
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,100
These are the kind of activities that we find young sump geniuses engaged in today.

759
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,920
Writing letters to the dead. Trying to save their dead relatives.

760
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,420
Much like our friends...

761
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:39,940
...Mum.

762
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:49,720
Imhotep was elevated to the priesthood after a successful military career in which he fought Nubians, Libyans, Syrians, and Sea Peoples.

763
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:55,060
He raised pyramids and crops, dug ditches, and paid taxes.

764
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,900
But does he dig duchies? That's a big deal.

765
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:57,900


766
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,700
That's the important thing.

767
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:03,900
Eventually, he actually achieved pharaonic equivalency.

768
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,280
A cytor spasm?

769
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,540
But his tomb fell and his song waned.

770
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,980
By iron hewn and by steel chained.

771
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,280
Greed that sang not, nor with mouth smiled.

772
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,420
And he was shut living in the tomb.

773
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,180
With his tongue removed.

774
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,160
And all that stuff.

775
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:27,420
And yet inbreeding depression follows inevitably from the mechanics of our genetic system.

776
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,540
You think it wouldn't be depressing?

777
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:35,300
Organisms such as ourselves are diploid, meaning we can obtain two sets of chromosomes.

778
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,080
For every malady there was a doctor in ancient Egypt.

779
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,360
Stomach doctors, foot doctors, ear doctors, side doctors...

780
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:42,960
Foot doctors?

781
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,180
...82 specialists in all...

782
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,520
Did they have gland doctors?

783
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,920
...the one who removes the evil third eye.

784
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,600
Teeth are filled...

785
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,200
Did they have third nostril doctors?

786
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,240
...brain tumors...

787
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,820
To pick the third nostrils?

788
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,840
...lions fat as a guaranteed remedy for...

789
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,560
...thinning hair...

790
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,360
...and the most expensive.

791
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:07,480
Some people might think that maybe in the third nostril there could be some type of incrustation.

792
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,500
As there were many in ancient Egypt from Megiddo to Kadesh.

793
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:17,800
Just like on the third eye you could get a little of that sleepy kind of sleep stuff you get in the corner of your eye...

794
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,360
Just imagine the sleep rising and falling.

795
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,880
...in the morning when you wake up, you get some of that in your third eye...

796
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,500
...and you try to rub your third eye with your finger to get it out...

797
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,900
...and next thing you know you're pushing an eyelash into your third eye.

798
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,340
...and you're rubbing back and forth on your third eye.

799
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,720
Pretty soon it's just completely bloodshot.

800
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,980
What are you going to do when you're out in public like that?

801
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,740
When people see it and they say, that's just some weird...

802
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:43,420
...weird permutation of your pineal gland.

803
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:52,440
Dr. Howell and Dr. Philo Drummond and puzzling evidence there from KPFA in Berkeley.

804
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,920
But new Kenneth New playing a Bach Prelude...

805
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:04,040
...as found on www.kenneth.new.n.u.

806
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,780
...and it's in the middle of a

807
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:43,800
...

808
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:43,820
...

809
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:43,840
...

810
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:43,860
...

811
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:43,860


812
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:43,860


813
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:43,860


814
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:43,860


815
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,220
...

816
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:48,440
...

817
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:48,440


818
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,660
... ...

819
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,840
... here.

820
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:48,420
Dr. You wanna hear some great music?

821
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:40,440
ニ

822
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,780
That's right. Surgeons for Connie.

823
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,800
Perform healing orgy to viable surgery.

824
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,400
Sicken the masses.

825
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,520
Bombard the patient with subgenius anti-music noise.

826
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,200
Surgeons for Connie.

827
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,640
Standing by.

828
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,100
Ready to operate.

829
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:12,860
Scammo.

830
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,320
Golf club.

831
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:19,760
Pipe.

832
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,320
Light the pipe full of froth and insert the golf club into the third nostril of the patient.

833
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,940
And the deprogramming will begin.

834
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,720
Stop it! Stop it! Please! I beg you!

835
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,140
You will no longer believe that Connie's little puppet J.R. Bob Dobbs.

836
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,600
You will now realize the truth.

837
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,980
That Connie is the one true slack master.

838
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:47,400
Praise Connie! Praise Connie! Praise Connie!

839
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:48,420
Praise Connie! Praise Connie! Praise Connie!

840
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,340
Praise Connie! Praise Connie!

841
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:52,760
Don't worry.

842
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,620
The spurting, bleeding head side effects are part of the treatment.

843
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,320
Now whenever you hear the name Bob,

844
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,660
you will automatically substitute the name Connie.

845
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,360
Connie.

846
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,400
foolishly fatigue lightly

847
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,440
Love Connie.

848
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,060
Hate Connie.

849
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:29,780
Funny.

850
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,600
You are out of control.

851
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:39,440
They set me at a cold metal table and prodded me with humiliating probes.

852
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,160
Now don't you feel better?

853
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,460
Lobby.

854
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,760
Master Suicide BillUh.

855
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:46,940
Saints.

856
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:55,940
Slack Bill T. Miller and Slackbangers from BillTMiller.com or KingofSlack.com.

857
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,880
I believe you can download his life works there.

858
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,620
Truly, friends, one of Bob's biggest tools.

859
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,620
Well, we're all tools.

860
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,080
First, the exes used the yetis as tools.

861
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,920
The yetis made humans into tools.

862
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,880
Millions of miles away.

863
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:18,720
And now...

864
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,220
Through the inky darkness of interstellar space.

865
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,200
Bob uses us.

866
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:30,940
They stretch forth their tentacles, reaching up from below to seize the basis of the subgenius unconscious mind.

867
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,020
Tickles when that happens.

868
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:40,400
Ever been troubled by giant octopuses or mile-long squids reaching up from below?

869
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,520
Even in your dreams?

870
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,140
This cephalopod, this round head...

871
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:53,820
at the nexus of many writhing arms, is a profound symbol of the secret self, standing for the unconscious mind.

872
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:07,640
And it is no error or idle chance that the squid has such a prominent feature in the lives of subgeniuses and in their fellow travelers.

873
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,520
Well, not only are they...

874
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,040
Like the laughing squid people.

875
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,540
Right, the laughing... praise laughing squid.

876
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,120
The squid...

877
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:15,120


878
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,640
The squid is not only sexy, but very intelligent.

879
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:19,720
Well, yes.

880
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:26,520
And even horrible conspiracy propaganda like Hanna-Barbera's Squidly Diddly cartoons put forth this view.

881
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,680
I never actually...

882
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,420
I don't think I remember Squidly Diddly.

883
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:31,740
Oh, it's horrible.

884
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,440
Well, I can describe it for you in a very few sentences.

885
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,880
He's a squid.

886
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,100
He lives at an aquarium.

887
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,800
He wears a sailor's hat.

888
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,340
His body is more like that of an octopus.

889
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,960
He has only six tentacles.

890
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,500
And he's got a smart mouth personality.

891
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:56,700
While Mr. Twiddles, the aquarium owner, who's only about two heads high and has a mustache, is eternally frustrated by Squidly and his antics.

892
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,480
Oh, so it's a yogi...

893
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:58,760
Squidly!

894
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,720
I mean, you're familiar with that sort of thing.

895
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:02,700
Yogi squid.

896
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:12,120
Well, more like Lippy the Lion or Wally Gator or some late-coming Hanna-Barbera loudmouthed asshole.

897
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:17,120
But that is the conspiracy version of the noble squid.

898
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:28,960
That hydrostatic organism which has managed by evolutionary manipulation to have no weight in its chosen medium.

899
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:32,740
To hover for millennia on end.

900
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,500
This is true slack.

901
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:38,740
The weightlessness deep beneath the heavy ocean.

902
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,320
And then there is also the Kraken.

903
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,260
That giant beast.

904
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:49,080
And by the way, you know that they've got that in the new Johnny Depp pirate movie, right?

905
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,500
They got Kraken?

906
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,560
They finally got Kraken?

907
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,700
They brought the Kraken into it.

908
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:59,040
And they're constantly having to battle this outsized cephalopon in the film.

909
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,300
Yes.

910
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:05,120
One must be in awe at the Kraken or that type of leviathan.

911
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:10,080
The largest thing to swim the ocean stream.

912
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,020
Below the thunder.

913
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,220
The thunder of the upper deep.

914
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,520
Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea.

915
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,940
His ancient uninvaded sleep.

916
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,980
The Kraken sleepeth.

917
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,180
Faintest sun lights flee about his shadowy sides.

918
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:32,320
Above him swell huge sponges of millennial growth and height.

919
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:40,240
While far above into the sickly light from many a wondrous grot and secret cell.

920
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:47,360
Unnumbered and enormous polype winnow with giant arms the slumbering green.

921
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:56,620
There hath he lain for ages and will lie battening upon huge sea worms in his sleep.

922
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,560
Until the latter fire shall heat the deep.

923
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:08,400
Then once by men and angels to be seen in roaring he shall rise.

924
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,180
And on the surface die.

925
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:19,440
Special animation effects by Ray Harryhausen.

926
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,120
That's right.

927
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:25,060
Well, you know, there's a very interesting picture.

928
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,820
And his brother Joe Bob Hausen.

929
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:34,440
In that book, An Animated Life by Harryhausen, the first of two large volumes that are now available.

930
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:42,340
There's a picture of Charlotte Knight, the woman who wrote some of his fairy tales.

931
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:50,760
And anyway, he took his octopus model from It Came Beneath the Sea and threw it.

932
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,440
And it stuck to her cleavage.

933
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,300
Astonishingly likely like something that happened to Susie the floozy here.

934
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,420
That same Ray Harryhausen octopus pressed to the chest of Charlotte Knight.

935
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,420
It's a photograph in the book.

936
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,120
In that book, Ray Harryhausen, An Animated Life.

937
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:16,840
And so millions of years ago, giant dinosaurs roamed the earth.

938
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:26,740
While volcanoes belched forth their stercorous pollution into the steamy atmosphere of the Mesozoic.

939
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:33,480
High above, giant pterodactyls on membranous wings.

940
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,240
Curled, scurrying over the smoking jungle below.

941
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:45,660
Emitting high cries like the screeching of phantoms and banshees.

942
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:50,980
To Christian the Mesozoic world with their barbaric yaup.

943
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:54,320
As heard in the background.

944
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:02,800
Time, space, travel, forward and backward in time.

945
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,440
The geographical time, time, time.

946
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,220
Train borders me.

947
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,440
Was the king of tea.

948
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,080
Ray.

949
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,680
No need to breathe.

950
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,940
Bibles say love varies.

951
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,660
Railroad 1890 Tim.

952
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,720
I can't get you sleep.

953
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:26,420
Yeah.

954
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,420
Ray.

955
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,280
Ow.

956
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:30,760
G 없다.

957
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:30,840
GoTi.

958
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,340
Uma.

959
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:00,260


960
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:00,260


961
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,280
..

962
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,820
I should talk about you

963
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,340
Little Peter

964
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:16,780
Shake and complain and sing

965
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:30,520
Remember every day and night

966
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,340
Just stay away

967
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,240
All these great pornographic records can now be yours

968
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,780
Well I'll be whining and swaggering

969
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,560
If I ain't that old legend's juice

970
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:16,760
But I'll be whining and swaggering

971
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:22,380
Boy, jumping naked salivating on my poochy chips ahoy

972
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:26,640
Squirt that venom my way

973
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,080
Nasty onion boy

974
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:36,520
Got my googly green garbles and a beer for my old food dreams

975
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,840
Squirt your venom my way

976
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,280
Can't make me cry

977
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,520
Can't make me cry

978
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,380
Nasty onion boy

979
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,160
Nasty onion juice boy

980
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,780
Pull that corn dog up to the light

981
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,560
Shake that onion fist and give it a fry

982
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,720
So pretty when you smell like a rose

983
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,700
So gorgeous when you do that twinkle toes

984
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,600
Floyd will trip my mustache like Otis Cutting Strong

985
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:15,460
Barney knows my special spot and Van is making stuff

986
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,460
Squirt your venom my way

987
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:22,060
Nasty onion boy

988
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,480
Can't make me cry

989
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,720
Don't lay Jose

990
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,800
Nasty onion juice boy

991
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,080
Nasty onion juice boy

992
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,240
Nasty Onion Juice Boy

993
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:45,380
By Joe Newman of Rudy Schwartz Project and Schwartztone.com

994
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:50,440
Before that, time and space travel can be yours

995
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:54,460

That's what I'm talking about

1028
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,200
Ayeaaah

1029
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:11,500
There's a problem, problem

1030
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:12,260
Well hell

1031
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,740
Who, what, and where?

1032
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:16,720
Oh, I told you.

1033
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,340
It's Rob.

1034
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,420
He was killed once.

1035
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:21,280
Jeepers.

1036
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,440
That answers the who part.

1037
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,300
Now, how about what and where?

1038
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,620
Stone Rob.

1039
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:27,040
That's the what.

1040
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:27,980
Mm-hmm.

1041
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:28,460
Go ahead.

1042
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,680
You dirty rat.

1043
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,540
Now, that was real smart.

1044
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,280
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look.

1045
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:39,760
Cake.

1046
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:40,640
Square.

1047
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:41,720
Fake.

1048
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,060
Smurf.

1049
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,140
Smurf.

1050
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,140
Smurf.

1051
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:45,920
It's cake.

1052
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,120
Why?

1053
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:46,740
Cake.

1054
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,020
Cake.

1055
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,700
Satan only happens if your tater's all shit.
