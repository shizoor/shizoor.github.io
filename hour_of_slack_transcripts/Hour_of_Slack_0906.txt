Listen.
Alright, I'm one.
Going up in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
The Super Genius Power of Swag Team!
We'll meet again at midnight.
And now live from the Pothakurin Ballroom here in beautiful Katsourmas,
it's time for King Koyos and the Kritorai.
Beginning promptly.
No, not beginning promptly.
Beginning is a relative term for them.
Things.
And tell her that you love her.
Like you know it should.
Dave knows how to tell her he loves her,
because he knows all the scientific words for all them body parts.
I use a stick to get my way.
And he uses his tongue, baby.
He uses his tongue to talk dirty.
I am here.
Long night long.
I am built like a dog's head.
My face is long and cylindrical.
Lupine.
Canine.
Look at my incisors.
Just a dirty dog.
He's just a dirty dog.
As cruel and as ordinary as any other lover of that defecant, deviant Bob Dobbs ever existed.
You gotta learn to treat her right.
Gotta learn to spank in between the down times.
You gotta learn to give her slaps.
You gotta give her a massacre massage.
You gotta pound it where it don't feel right.
Yeah, sure you do.
Now we've all had these problems in communication in our love relationships.
For instance, Bob. The love of Bob. The adoration of Bob.
When we come to the force- the squank table, the swag table.
It's not queer if it's Bob.
Well, nobody ever-
That's a different kind of love.
If there's nothing queer about spunking into a picture of Bob.
It's like the obvious.
Over and over again.
Adoration of Sai Baba or something.
Until it makes the inkjet ink run.
Oh, jeez.
And mix.
That is an awful thought.
That's why in all the subgenius babe conneaut calendars we put pictures of Bob in the corner of each page.
So that just at the climactic moment you can divert your attention to the true object of your love.
Which is J.R. Bob Dobbs. That one savior.
Muscly and brown around the eye ridges.
He's been here.
He's been there.
And he's been in between.
He's J.R. Bob Dobbs, your secret slack master and avatar.
And he wants the breath from your soul.
Well, he wants your money too.
And he realized the similarity between pornography and religion.
Well, there's many similarities.
There's an altar to pound upon.
He made them even more similar.
A lot more similar than they were in most movies.
There's no other religious studies besides the tantrics of India.
India.
Back in the day.
India.
Back in the era.
And I don't mean macrobiotic tantric practitioners.
No, none of that.
Clevelandites who brag about it to their friends.
None of that.
Not here.
I'm talking about the ones that could not stop.
I'm talking about people that knew about sex hurt.
You hear this music in the background?
That is the sound of your nervous system on sex hurt.
It is painful but beautiful.
I wonder, I wonder.
Don't look at the colors.
When you get bored with the drugs, then you see the secret.
I hold on tight.
I hold on tight.
I hold on tight.
Sex.
Until it hurts.
All right.
All right.
Look, look, look way above your body there.
Hey, look down.
Here, check it out.
I'm a little bit of a gyration.
Disgusting.
It's beautiful.
I can't.
I don't.
This is .
Shut up.
Well, first, the blonde with more curves than the road up Pike's Peak.
And dumb.
That's right.
Insult me.
Second, a blonde.
Okay, you can't argue with a blonde.
That's right.
It's a blonde.
Trust me, and believe me.
Set aside today.
Luciano Berrio.
What is this mess you're playing?
This is actually not, it's actually not Ligety at all.
It's not Art.
It's Aerosmith.
Or Luciano Berrio.
Backwards.
Or George Crumb or any of those 20th century composers.
Is this the recording of every single What's Her Name song played simultaneously?
And now, the song's playing.






Carl Heinz Stockhausen brought to you in an easy-to-listen-to format that the children love.
Listen to Carl Heinz.
And that's how it all ends.
Play every single Carl Heinz Stockhausen song.
I didn't know Carl Heinz Stockhausen had a high tenor voice like that.
And here's how it all comes to an end.
Lin with happiness.
Big German fella.
Can you imagine that? What a diaphragm.
Chaz, I feel that you could call that art and it would still suck.
Yeah.
You know, just because you put a capital A in front of it doesn't mean the cows are going to low and low and low, low, low.
You know what I mean?
We're talking about the Brahmin cows with the big, big wisdom teats.
The ones that need to be extracted every 7,000 years.
Oh, is it the wisdom teat you're after?
Yes, those nipples must be extracted and expectorated by the mildly amused gentlemen without salivary glands.
Addicted to philosophy.
Sucking on the wisdom teat.
It's sad, actually, if you ask me.
Pitiful, absolutely pitiful.
But nobody asked the old question answerer.
The old questionnaire-er-er-er.
Nobody ever ponders those in his way.
Sex with underage boys is a holy secret.
I downloaded the whole PDF file.
Holy W-O-L-L-Y?
Yeah, the whole PDF file was on CBS News.
I call that an unholy secret.
And it details from the Vatican.
It details.
And this was written in like 1964 or something and all that.
And it details in great detail how anybody involved in a sex scandal, including the person who got sexually molested,
it would be a holy secret or a holy sin to reveal this holy secret and you would be excommunicated.
Get out of here.

I'm not kidding you.
Don't go down there.
Want to find it?
Let's go find it right now.
That's getting pretty bizarre.
Well, I mean, no, that makes a lot of sense.
There's nothing bizarre about it.
I think old Papa John's getting, you know, I thought he was kind of okay considering his, you know, role as a Christian.
But geez, that sounds a little bit weird.
Okay, number one, it makes the church look bad if they find out the old fathers are deflowering the young altered boys.
And number two, the old fathers will run out of young altered boys if everybody's on them.
And they can't stop the buggering of young altered boys just because it traumatizes forever the altered boys.
These priests are men of God.
They have needs.
And they deserve to bugger the little 10-year-old boys.
However, that old drunk in the front row was playing with his camera right on the restaurant.
Oh, he's a sinful man.
The Catholic priests need to do more than lay people, as the old church does.
Geez, I must be so far out of the loop-de-gar.
I guess even older jokes.
It just doesn't play as well anymore.
You know, what kind of meat does a priest eat on Friday?
None.
None.
No, that's too hetero.
Yeah.
That's too normal.
That's way too normal.
Yeah, way too normal for, that's not a holy secret anymore.
That's a holy bride.
Wait, wait, wait.
Did you know this is a decision angle American problem?
Oh, Father McBride!
Look at this guy.
That's his McDobs family.
Look at this.
Look at this.
There we go.
A Dobs father-in-law.
Where's my racket ball bag?
And this guy.
Look at this dude.
Look at this dude.
He's the guy who owned the restaurant that they all met up these little teenage boys at.
That's Marshall McLuhan.
Marshall McLuhan is having sex with teenage boys.
Actually, his name is Marshall McCarron.
Oh, my God.
Owner of Len Ernst Burger.
Come right in here.
Had a pension for underage lovers.
We gotta shut up the chairs early.
Quote, unquote.
Here, quote, unquote.
Young boys made me feel alive and young again.
That's him.
Young boys make me feel alive and young again.
Ah, damn.
Where's my golf bag?
Young boys.
And then look at this one.
Look at this guy.
He got them all involved.
He was taking the old gay priest around in the bar, the gay bars, and then they ended
up at his restaurant picking up little teenage boys down in Ohio City.
Well, there's a nice story, huh?
Now, wait.
Where can you go and pick up young teenage boys?
Where can you go pick up priests?
Oh, dear.
I'd like to go somewhere and pick up a priest tonight, and believe me, if we're in the
Now, here's this guy.
Young boys.
This guy.
Look at that face there, and he says...
Radio listeners, turn to page 14 of the script.
You'll notice all the white hairs in there.
Follow along with Chaz as he looks at the advertisement man on the...
Father McBride is an old, frail man who wasn't much fun to hang out with, but he agreed to
take McBride to a few gay bars.
That's it, man.
Wow.
Can you imagine that?
The driver.
Can you imagine?
This guy and the father.
He looks like a driver in a mops.
The father over here.
Let's get back to the father.
Cruising around Ohio City together.
That's what those kids were running from in our backyard.
Oh, my God.
We had these mystery kids running out of...
I'll just let them make it.
Just that I don't feel guilty.
Amazingly visual type of thought there.
I mean, the radio listeners can't see these pictures, but...
Well, go online to scene...
Glee scene dot com.
I think TV for the Blind is working quite well.
Just imagine any...
Clearing scene or glee scene dot com.
Red-faced, old, white-haired...
White-haired guy.
I'm sure those...
A collared...
Looks like a mugshot.
Some rotten old guy.
Father of patio, Matthew O'Mara.
When you read the story, he took him out to Lake Chautauqua, where he has a cabin.
Oh, boy.
And even detail in the story.
In this story, you can read about how he took him out to his cabin in Chautauqua, and then
he douched his anal sick, and then had the 17-year-old youth have anal sex with him,
and they did that, and then they came back to Cleveland.
Well, that's what I'd do.
I'd get right back in the car and cry all the way home back to Parma.
Tee.
What did I do?
Cleaned himself out with a little, like, I guess, portable enema douche thing, and then
had a...
I'm sure.
Doesn't everybody have...
A little bit too much information there.
And then had the 17-year-old boy...
That's part of your diocesan packet now.
Nowadays, when you know...
Give him an anal probe, I guess.
Each diocese passes out the special packs with the handy wipes and the gloves.
Do you think he went pretty slick?
Imagine what a great career this man has.
What a great career this man has had in his ministry.
Well, thank God he's not in a necrophilia, you know, for all those families waiting at
the hospital.
Who knows what this cat could be into.
I mean, come on.
Well, you know, they say that these...
All them cats, man.
Yeah, they buried all them bishops in the basement of the cathedral.
This just makes me ashamed of the Church of the Subgenius.
Because what are...
Too many heteros.
I mean, just...
What the hell are we doing?
What a boring dog.
Yeah, right.
I mean, what do you get?
That little bit of swapping out there at Brushwood, what nobody ever tells me about.
Are you changed?
Hey, I better not hear about it.
But I do.
And there's, you know, I mean, there's...
There's sure, there's the occasional crush and balls and vice versa.
But people want that.
They pay extra for that crap.
Don't ask me why.
They like it.
But...
Well, it's visually...
How the hell are we going to keep up with the Catholics?
When you see them pat?
I don't know, man.
And then it's a holy secret to reveal anything.
It's just a holy secret.
Well, see, that's what we've been doing wrong.
We've been bragging about it.
Every time somebody deflowers somebody in subgenius land, they shout it from the rooftops of the internet.
All I'm waiting for now is pictures of it.
Them lay sisters to be wearing spandex pants and those dike belts.
You know what I'm saying?
They do that in our church.
But that's like tame crap compared to these really perverted...
I mean, these guys rape little children.
What?
And teenagers that are not exactly little children, but easily confused by mushrooms and beer.
Well, when we take into consideration...
Various aspects of the apologetics involved.
Don't we think that perhaps, although we're all sinners, some of those small children enjoy being buggered?
No.
No, probably not.
No, probably not at all.
Well, don't you think one...
Speak for yourself!
One?
I think I know something that's coming out in the confession booth of the radio.
Damn, damn, damn.
One.
Stop lunging where you don't belong.
The little boy...
Next time you attend mass, you leave quickly and don't hang around waiting for cookies from the elf people, because it doesn't exist.
Why do you think they call it my ass?
You're just coming up with new stuff all the time.
I will ask Jesus to help me to keep my heart from sin.
After reflecting his goodness and awe, we shine.
We shine for him.
A sunbeam, a sunbeam.
Jesus wants me for a sunbeam.
A sunbeam, a sunbeam.
I'll be a sunbeam for him.
Questionable.
Ejaculation.
Unemotionally.
Ejaculation.

Since you set that horrible subject matter early in the game. No, it was Chaz this time talking about butt boys.
He's always getting after you.
He was talking about your butt talk. Now he's Mr. Butt-Oriented. You got to read the gross butt stories out of the local weekly...

We're like friends, should we?
We're like friends, should we?
Wally, we're making out.
Oh, well...
You can sit down, everything's ready.
Look, we got plenty of time together.
Well, I like to make out, dear.
Will you just forget about it for a while?
Oh, well, well, don't you want to?
Oh, it's not that I don't have fun or anything, but I've been meaning to talk to you about that.
Uh, Wally?
Wally, uh...
Oh, gee, Dad, you're not gonna make me, are you?
He's never failed to cooperate before.
I'd really like to, but I just can't.
Well, what can I say?
Well, tell him that he just has to.
Well, now, June, I'm just as anxious to have Wally as you are.
Yeah?
But I'm not gonna make him if he doesn't want to.
Poor?
We're making out.
Yeah, the boys love it. They really go wild.
Hi, Wally.
It's a sporting universe.

Get your finger off that box.
You break my heart

Son, step in here and let me put on a little music for you.
Do you like poppers?
Father, that hurts!
You're hurting me, father!
You're hurting me, father!
You're hurting me, father!
What do you think of the night is, baby?
Do you like poppers?
Climb aboard the art wagon, children.
We're all going.
We're all going to have a little canister of soup,
and we're going out to the art wagon to play with the wooden donkeys.
And your five Hail Marys and seven Our Fathers.
And by the way, do you like poppers?
Now you understand what we mean when we talk about the Holy Trinity.
That's three in grade.
Great.
Great, great feelings in the wagon.
Here, son, let me show you a purgatory.
I'll keep it in my closet right here.
Let me show you what to do with these prayer beads.
She like a pearl necklace!
Well, I'm telling you, then he described the damn rosary.
It's one of those butt beads that the Orioles use.
And for crying out loud, me and Mae was sitting there for two more hours
just trying to figure out what they were talking about.
But I can tell you one thing for sure.
It wasn't right in the head.
And it wasn't right, I don't think, for the children to be listening.
And so, well, we called up a number of people.
I wonder how many priests, like, when they're having mass,
and then the little altar boy comes up and he genuflects.
I wonder how many priests are sitting on the altar at that moment going,
man, I can't wait till, like,
all over his, everybody.
Oh, jeez.
Well, now they have altar servers, so...
But it would be a holy secret if they did.
Now, in Scientology, it's a whole different thing.
It's not a holy secret at all.
It's just holy.
They like the holes and they make no bones about it.
Bones, so to speak.
That's why I say the hell is the church of the subgenius
is supposed to be this nasty, terrible church.
How the hell are we going to keep up with the Catholics?
The temple...
Impossible!
Much less than even the Scientologists.
The great whore of Rome, or whatever they call it there.
Or the Raelians.
In the Baptist churches down south, they call those Catholics
the great whore in the Bible or something.
Ain't it like them Rome's old Rome's old.
Nice.
I understand what I'm saying.
I understand what I'm saying.
I understand.
I understand.
I understand.
I understand.
I understand.
You've got to believe me.
You've got to believe me.
Help me escape.
I understand what I'm saying.
I can't think.
I have a mind.
They make the same things.
They torture me.
They torture me.
I can't think.
I hate this thing.
I have a mind.
Don't let them kill me.
They torture me.
Kill me.
I have a mind.
Oh, you don't care.
They torture me.
I have a mind.
Go ahead.
I have a mind.
Shoot me.
Kill me.
They torture me.
I understand what I'm saying.
I have a mind.
I can't think.
I have a mind.
They torture me.
They torture me.
Why?

And now, more lemur.
You know, we get lots of calls from people who are wanting their family members neck fractured.
If God can do this, then there's not a trace of Jesus in heaven.
That comes from Matthew up in Iowa.
Hallelujah, give praise to Ralph.
Tumor growth, tumor growth.
The Lord ballooned up, and God is all ballooned up, and God is cancerous.
Leukemia or ralphoma in a vital brain growth.
I come against this canthoma, lymphocera, cancerous Jesus soaking the growth, every trace of cancer, in Jesus' stomach tumors.
And I pray right now for 6,700 cancer tumors and growths.
And say,
I want it all.
Well, this just explains all of my hatred and confusion.
Can you imagine Christians behaving this way?
And of course, they do every day, and I'm just...
Yeah.
Well, I mean, look, I've been to subgenius services where the preacher looks up and goes,
What's that human wanting?
Yeah, what's that human wanting?
Oh, I guess that human's getting a bit uppity coming into a subgenius.
Man, I think the sub-Gs are, you know, they're getting outdone big time, and no one is outdoing anybody better than the Catholics right now.
You know what it is?
Slack.
Slackards.
They're just not motivated.
They think about boogering the altar boys, but they're just too busy fropping and watching Futurama or listening to music.
And we all thought it was real big when Jimmy Swagger, you know, did a hooker.
He came out about that, you know.
Look at what's coming.
Well, then now where are we at?
Oh, yeah.
Nobody even cared.
A preacher does a hooker.
Yeah, they get a medal for it now.
Oh, he's almost as good as Jimmy Swagger, but he's pleased he's not a Catholic.
At least he's not gay.
Sexual conquest has always been a part of the pastornage.

Hey, can you like poppers?
Father, father,
you're hating me!
Forgive me, father!
I like my Nikes!
Forgive me!
Love me!
Father, father,
you're hating me!
Why do you think...
Jesus wants you to do this.
Father, put white pee in my front box.
This is like shooting fish in a bucket.
I'm not here right now.
Like shooting fish in a bucket.

Damn.
I finally get to get them back
for all them years of torture.
I love that.
I love Father Rod McCloughan.
I knew this was coming.
When I was eight years old,
I could see this coming down the road.
Listen to the world.
They never even touched me.
You just knew something was wrong.
Oh, hey, can you like poppers?
I'm a-having sandwiches and punch
over next to the retro area.
Can you hear this space?
Oh, yeah.
I'm inside a church.
You know, in the entrance,
you'd like to stop by for some cookies
and sandwiches.
Over in the...
Hey, you want to join me
over in the rectory?
What does this have to do with Jesus?
What would Waylon do?
What does Jesus have to do with anything?
Jesus ain't got nothing to do with anything.
Paint WWWD on the back of your pickup truck.
What would Waylon do?
We're going to start that new thing.
Pickup trucks with WWWD.
Pickup trucks with WWWD on the back.
What the hell does that mean?
Well, you better just put that on your car
and you'll find out.
What would Waylon do?
Till next week.
Oh, he ain't even up here yet.
I would say, what would Walrus do?
I'm back, back, back, back.
What would Waylon do?
He'd start wailing on you guys for your blasphemy.
What's with Willy Wonka?
Why?
Nah, I bet he'd be cutting right in there with it.
Warbens, boom.
Well, actually, it's...
Listen, we're not blaspheming the Lord,
but rather some members of his fan club.
While we were blaspheming the Catholic Church,
Waylon would have been hitting on the princes.

The Bob-Bob-Bob-Bombs
This is Whipley Snidelash, UFO victim and crowd-pleasing sound pornographer.
Oh, Whipley Screamer.
Yes, no, Whipley Snidelash.
Whipley Snidelash!
Somebody please the Lord!
What is the question for you today, honey?
Whipley Screamer?
You aren't there or everywhere.
We understand that these things could not be done by humans.
They can only be done by aliens.
And that's the only possible explanation.
Did you mean humines? Humines, right? Humines?
The only possible explanation is that this is an alien intelligence operating through some unknown means.
I think intelligence is not the right word to describe what you have done, sir.
Meet me on my knees. On your knees, Friday night at 7.30.
Praise Bob!
Praise Master Lighthouse.
You see, I think this whole thing is easily explained.
Simply by the UFO phenomenon and how they are adhering us to their mindset.
That's the story.
And I think this avoiding taking it seriously is going to cause more problems with our understanding them and they understanding us in the future.
Yeah, exactly!
Can I just offer one thing, Wiper?
Didn't it make your faith even stronger, brother?
Faith?
What does faith have to do with it?
Faith has nothing to do with what's happened here.
Now, now listen to this.
What is this?
This is damn sick of you.
It frightens me.
Sometimes I think there's a man who sits behind a counter and says,
Faith!
Faith! Faith is the most important sponge!
Sponge?
Do you think a man should have the sponge?
Of course!
This man!
This man!
Wishes to be a sponge!
To think!
But your client is deluded!
Well, uh, it's possible.
Do you ever think about things that you'd think about?
I do not think about things that I'd think about.
Sponge!
My friends, I believe in those principles.
I'm upset.
Yes! Good!
I protest!
Look, Mr. Free Preacher.
This is not only irrelevant and immaterial, it is illegal!
Stop it! Stop it!
Oh!
My mother brought me here, and I feel that God has touched me.
Yeah, I know he did.
And when the special place is you,
then you're never the same again,
because this is what the UFO phenomenon offers us.
It's communion.
Yeah, it's a form of communion you're found to be seen doing in the backyard.
Yeah, it's a form of communion you're found to be seen doing in the backyard.
I've been to the backyard and the valley ways of various creepy sex clubs in your town.
Isn't it your town?
What you may see as creepy is perhaps normal to another.
Yeah, a creep.
I find those orifices you plug your cannon into to be absurd.
Her suit and enough to make a grown man go away.
Well, I think Dr. Lagume said it best when he suggested the drill.
I think that's the way that, you know, they can all sort of go.
He said the drill!
Did you let that get out of the air?
Were you nuts?
The tree planing, as it were, is that what they call it?
Man!
Oh, that!
Oh, they're talking about that.
Oh, yeah, yeah, that, sure.
The psychotic fondling.
There's nothing wrong with that.
There's nothing wrong with it.
And it's like when the Pennsylvania Tech was in the middle of the night,
and the Dutch people make pretzels,
you have to respect it and know that it cannot have been done by humans.
It can only have been done by an alien intelligence.
I think it was done by an Amish penis.
That's how they make the little holes.
They put them on the shelf,
and Grandpa Yoder comes by and pokes each one with his own secret sauce.
What you may see as merely a penis
is really how the aliens
adhere themselves to us.
Sort of like friction in a tube,
or maybe it's like a scap lock?
Like Velcro!
Exactly.
I believe that Princess Wee...
Princess Wee in a can.
And she would know
because she can adhere herself
to the alien intelligences.
We've been corresponding for some time now.
Princesses are not aliens.



They are creatures of antiquity.
Ten million years at least in age.
I'm sorry?
Could I just ask you how long you were there?
Did you actually feel the drill go by?
Or was it a nasal implant?
That was what the first alien called himself,
was Drill.
Drill, that's right.
And when he took me out...
That's the drill.
During the first encounter,
where I thought my memory was being erased by hypnosis,
but it was actually a real memory.
It was actually being replaced by a dream state
or fugue
sense of reality
which is impossible
to prove, certainly in a
scientific environment.
It's almost as if you were making it all up.
You sound very hot, my friend.
How long has it been since your last...
Your last...
No way I could have made this up,
thanks.
Hello, operator.
I've just had a particularly idiotic idea.
Oh, that's incredible.
There has been no English lady here.
Yes, that's why it's an idiotic idea.
There has been no English lady here.
Nothing but lumps of raw flesh.
We are not in England now.
I don't see what difference that makes.
What difference does it make?
There has been no English lady here.
Oh, but, but...
There has been no English lady here.
Nonsense.
I mean, after all, people go about tying up nuns.
Seems a bit queer.
Well, I may be very dense, but if this is some sort of a joke,
I'm afraid I'd see the point.
I understand she's dumb.
Shut up.
The pressure that I was feeling
constantly was in fact
something that the aliens
had actually placed in the bowel,
which they used to observe us.
And it's benign.
It's not harmful.
It's really...
You only feel the sharp stabbing pains
occasionally in your bowel.
And the knowledge that they traded me for that
is really infinitely worth it.
...inferiority of being right
is a formidable outcry in defense of cost.
So, so, I don't see what your problem is
and why you're a skeptic.
There's no problem,
and there are no skepticisms.
There are no skeptics,
and there are no scatological rumors
going about you.
Everything that you've dreamed
is a dream of someone else's.
As a certifiable UFO victim
and crowd-pleasing sound pornographer,
I've mixed many sounds of the aliens
speaking through various organs
and orifices of my body.
And I believe
Stang is familiar with this.
He's certainly tried to debunk me
along with the amazing Randy,
but I have proof.
Oh, yes.
Those old hollow dreams
of being raped by sound effects.
I remember your face,
that soft peach fuzz,
that tiny little cranium.
It is you, isn't it?
Stang, it's his effort to debunk you.
The camping fee goes to the...
Because the only explanation
for what's on your website,
especially the recent pictures
that were taken in Switzerland,
is that there is actual contact
with Planet X.
That Planet X is real.
And this whole,
you know,
so-called fictitious story
that people think
that you've been telling
is in fact a very true,
real tale.
And I think you should be proud
that you've been able to stand up
and erect for Bob
what you've been erecting.
What do you see?
This is real.
And the shoes that you've been wearing
have been the right shoes.
The suits you've been wearing
have been the right suits.
And the cards you've been playing
have been the right cards.
I think that's the main point.
Because the only way you could have been playing those cards
is to be actually
an assistant of alien intelligence.
It's funny how they always
are telling...
They always tell me instead of asking me.
It's so nice to know.
Well, isn't that
what they directed me to tell you?
Right.
From PR News in Washington,
I'm claiming to be the former Iraqi dictator,
despite rebel pledges
for a sexual abuse scandal.
Meanwhile, an audio tape
of some Archbishop of Boston
says the rebels are now into
increased sexual abuse.
The 59-year-old Archbishop
will immediately have to tackle
more than 500 children in countries
where costs are lower.
This is PR News.
It's burning in Colorado
as predicted by Xcel Energy.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Well, just like a tiny little spider,
I'm going to recluse myself
from these proceedings
as I have a vested interest in my vestments.
You'll notice here
my popper belt right beneath
the...
And then me is going to evacuate
himself in some way.
Like Father
O'Brien O'Malley or whatever
he is.
You know, when you cross yourself,
you don't make any sacred signs
below the waist.
Well, what about when you genuflect?
Well, yeah, you bend over, baby.
That represents something else.
You bend down.
Here comes my crucifix.
And then supplicants to the Lord
thy God.
The new children.
A thousand spokes
went into the young boy's brain
when he considered what had happened to him.
He wanted to go on retreat
with Father McClellan.
But he knew his geodesic dome
would only fit the two of them.
So as he curled up into his cot
and pulled the blankies up around him,
he said his prayers.
His Hail Mary, his Our Fathers,
and his prayer for his mom and dad.
Now I lay me down to...
Hey! What are you doing?
Father! Father, no!
Hi, folks. Captain Midnight here.
And now the first full-blooded Jew
to ever appear on the Grand Ole Opry stage,
Kinky Friedman
and the Texas Jew Boys.
Well, a redneck nerd
in a bowling shirt
with a guzzling lone star beard
talking religion and politics
for all the world to hear.
They ought to send you
back to Russia, boy,
or New York City, one.
You just want to doodle a Christian girl
and you kill God's only son.
I said, has it occurred to you,
you nerd, that that's not very nice?
We Jews believe
it was Santa Claus
that killed Jesus Christ.
You know, you don't look Jewish,
he said, near as I can figure.
I had you lamped for a slightly anemic,
well-dressed country boy.
Lord!
They ain't making Jews
like Jesus anymore.
They don't turn the other cheek
the way they've done before.
He started in to shouting
and spitting on the floor.
Lord!
They ain't making Jews
like Jesus anymore.
Oh, they ain't making Jews
like Jesus anymore.
We don't turn the other cheek
the way we've done before.
But hear that honky holler
in the air,
as he hit that hardwood floor.
Lord!
They ain't making Jews
like Jesus anymore.

Friends...
I dreamed it was,
well, Father Oclaris
and Father Von Stumpf
had a big white SUV,
and they were like tooling around town
and stuff, and one of them
gave me the finger, so I said,
I'm gonna chase them, you know?
Now, will this start,
what I wanna know is, will this now begin
to be a new emphasis in the
fetish fashion scene
with Catholicism?
Will there be now more nun outfits,
rubber nun outfits?
Oh man, didn't Madonna wear that out
15 years ago?
Really? It's been there.
Well, you know when you get your last...
Well, now it'll become all that it'll be about
will be now, you know, that Catholic goth.
That'll be what people wear in the supermarkets
in Walmart now.
Pretty soon, when you go to the fetish ball,
they'll be doing the Stations of the Cross.
It's like, you know, when you get your last righteous
stuff, and the priest has your last purple thing on there
and stuff, the bishop will come and slap you
in the face and anoint your head
with oil. Didn't that get old with
Marilyn Manson? Actually, didn't it
get old with Alice Cooper? Isn't that how
Alice and Marilyn both got old? Actually, didn't it get old
with the Dottas in World War I?
Didn't it get old with Robert Johnson?
Yeah, I mean like... Didn't it get old when
Peter the Great started with all the
drunken sign-off things? Didn't it get old
when that nearsighted caveman
talked to his buddies in the
barnyard and went to get him some food?
And what, uh, did he
town, did he?
It's real old. Yeah.
Wasn't it old when that... It's old.
...old, old policeman bent over
and was roundly
invigorated by that old, old, old
policeman? Penta... I mean priest!
Bent... bent across...
Pentecost.
Had to go through
Benteclaw.
Pentecostal studies.
Ha ha ha!
I was Catholic and I don't like what you guys
were saying on the radio tonight. Oh, man.
I was raised Catholic too, that's why
I can come up with the better jokes.
That's what the guy with the shotgun's gonna
be saying in the parking lot.
No, because you know what?
I know from growing up in that church
that everybody out there
who did the same is sitting back on
my God, I don't want to
show my face to the world.
I don't even want to admit it.
I've never had anything to do with that thing anymore.
...closed as far as my head is...
Hey, DJ A is here!
Until next week,
keep your head on tight, you're back to the
winter sack in the saddle!
...in the sack to princess me!
Auf Wiedersehen, you swine!
...in the saddle!
...in the saddle!
...in the saddle!




...in the saddle!
...in the saddle!
The path of the righteous
man is beset on
all sides by the inequities
of the selfish and the tyranny
of evil men.
There is
a God I
know. I'm God
you
