1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
From PR News in Washington, I'm still dangerous.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,500
However, according to intelligence officials, there is a report of a report released across the country.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,080
The report concludes that this is PR News.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,120
However, the report is committed to PR's plan.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,600
It's not PR's report.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,400
On Wall Street, 86102-10167.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,900
Representatives of the United States are meeting with officials from Atomicistan yesterday.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,520
The report also represents an early preview of PR News in Washington.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,980
Good afternoon, Hal. How's everything going?

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,600
I ain't saying not yeah.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,280
Hello, Hal. Do you read me?

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:39,780
Yeah.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,820
Do you read me, Hal?

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,500
Yeah.

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,280
Sure, Hal.

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,660
You're fired, along with all the rest of us.

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,740
I don't care about the others.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,860
You're at 1-3-0-1-3.

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,460
Oh, please.

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,900
I didn't know what I was doing. I must have been crazy.

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,840
And I deserve anything that's coming to me.

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,540
The Self Genius.

23
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,580
Power.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,380
Growth.

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,360
Life.

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,360
I'm afraid I can't do that.

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,340
Guess what do you think you're doing?

28
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,480
What is your name, you know?

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,860
What's the difference? This is my phone number.

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,540
I don't need to give you any information.

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,080
This is the number that was assigned to me more than a year ago.

32
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,600
You know, I have many people in my line of work, you know.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,260
So?

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,080
I'm a very wealthy man.

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,080
I don't care.

36
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,360
Very powerful man. Very...

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,560
I don't care.

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,880
...ex-savagant man.

39
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't care. All I'm saying is we get phone calls all the time for Gomez.

40
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,400
We always say, this isn't a Gomez residence. We've had this number for about a year now.

41
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
And I don't know who...

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,180
What do you want? Jewels?

43
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,680
I want nothing. Me?

44
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,880
Wealth? What do you want?

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,380
I want you off my phone. I don't want you to call me again either.

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,620
But you like jewels, madam?

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,980
I... Listen, if you don't get off the phone...

48
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,080
...and you call me again, I'm gonna call the police.

50
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,720
Jewels are my business. I'm an extravagant man. That's what I am.

51
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,280
I don't care.

52
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,460
That's my business right there.

53
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,640
I don't care.

54
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,080
Now look, do you want wealth?

55
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,980
No, I don't want your phone number. What do you want me to do when people call?

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,820
Travel the world? What do you want?

57
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,220
I don't want anything. I just don't want you to call me.

58
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,620
If people call for you, I just say this is the wrong number.

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,540
I've been all around the world, you know.

60
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,180
You could tell us.

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,140
I'm a very, very, uh, elegant man.

62
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,420
What do you want from me?

63
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,800
We need you now.

64
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,520
The Monday to Friday isn't much fun

65
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,660
but the of the cake isn't working with someone

66
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,180
like you when your views aren't everything in sight

67
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,520
your voice is annoying your opinions are shite

68
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,760
the worst thing about this job is not commuting or the play

69
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,560
it's not

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,000
big

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,500
able

72
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,960
To put you in that space

73
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,260
You're a wanker

74
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,260
Let me now explain

75
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,960
You're a wanker

76
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,440
I'm telling you again

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,700
Cause your pencil-pushing cell-boxes

78
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,280
Childish, two-faced wanker

79
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,040
In this twisted world you get paid more than me

80
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,520
For doing the job which everyone can see

81
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,660
You're incapable of doing without making it up

82
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,180
With an awful lot of bullshit and a little bit of luck

83
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,560
The worst thing about this job is not the hours or the space

84
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,740
It's not being able to put you in the space

85
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,080
You're a wanker

86
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,980
Let me now explain

87
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,220
You're a wanker

88
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,260
I'm telling you again

89
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,400
Cause your pencil-pushing cell-boxes

90
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,040
Childish, two-faced wanker

91
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,280
You're a wanker

92
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,220
Let me now explain

93
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,680
You're a wanker

94
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,600
I'm telling you again

95
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,680
Cause your pencil-pushing cell-boxes

96
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,360
Childish, two-faced wanker

97
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,620
From the very first day you started to book

98
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,880
With your arrogant chat, your unerringly smoke

99
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,520
It's hard to believe that you never get tired

100
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,960
Of being so useless that you should have been fired

101
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,920
Thanks to you this office is fuelled by hate

102
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,480
And all the other people here who think that you are great

103
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,720
Are all the other wankers who make this job hell

104
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,980
I suppose I'd better write a song about them as well

105
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,420
The worst thing about this job is not the ceilings or walls

106
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,660
It's not being able to kick you in the balls

107
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,920
You're a wanker

108
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,860
You're a wanker

109
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,300
You're a wanker

110
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,160
This is nothing wrong

111
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,220
Cause your pencil-pushing cell-boxes

112
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,880
Childish, two-faced wanker

113
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,360
You're a wanker

114
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,080
Let me now explain

115
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,700
You're a wanker

116
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,320
I'm telling you again

117
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,440
Cause your pencil-pushing cell-boxes

118
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,240
Childish, two-faced wanker

119
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,500
You're a wanker

120
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,520
You're a wanker

121
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,840
You're a wanker

122
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,620
You're a wanker

123
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,520
You're a wanker

124
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,880
You're a wanker

125
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,120
You're a wanker

126
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,600
That put the frothy head on a beer of Nazi laughter

127
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,820
And a frothy head it was

128
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,420
You're a wanker

129
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,600
It's by, yes, the Attery Squash

130
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,780
Including our friend, Reverend D

131
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,420
Eva Schematic, and Ricardo Autobahn, part of an upcoming CD.

132
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,540
And you can achieve more knowledge of The Attery Squash at Facebook,

133
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,900
the-attery-squash, or MySpace, slash, The Attery Squash.

134
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,900
Before that inspiring song, the titles and news were by the great Lemur.

135
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,140
And this, friends, is Hour of Slack, number 1,232,

136
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:31,020
which is the first special on the Portland Cyclone of Slack Devival,

137
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,460
which happened in October.

138
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,280
Yes, we will be going into a live Devival as it happened so long ago.

139
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:45,720
But we also have lots of wonderful and challenging and horrible new music.

140
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,960
And before the Devival recordings, let's hear some devotional recordings

141
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,540
with a remix.

142
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,380
Of the Devo remix of Worried Man by my favorite old-timey band,

143
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,240
the Muted Mountain Boys, live at the devotional in Cleveland.

144
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,520
¶¶

145
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,060
произ salad

146
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,640
Awake

147
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,680
playlist

148
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,380
I don't know what's going on in the world these days

149
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,600
I don't know what's going on in the world these days

150
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,940
Everything's f***ed up and it's all coming down

151
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,500
Seems like everyone's got everything turned around

152
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,880
Seems like everyone's got everything turned around

153
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,320
They just don't care about their fellow man

154
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,940
It takes a worried man to sing the worried song

155
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,380
It takes a worried man to sing the worried song

156
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,740
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long

157
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,300
Like an ostrich eating grass

158
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,100
Like an ostrich eating pizza

159
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,180
With his head stuck in the sand

160
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,500
And don't you know, it takes a worried man

161
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,080
It takes a worried man to sing the worried song

162
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,480
It takes a worried man to sing the worried song

163
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,860
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long

164
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,500
It takes a worried man to sing the worried song

165
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,300
It takes a worried man to sing the worried song

166
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,740
Sing the worry man, sing the worry song.

167
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,120
The world ain't now, but I hope we worry long.

168
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,780
The Mutant Mountain Boys, ah, yes, so lovely.

169
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,960
Reverend Samantha, Reverend Robin Renee,

170
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,360
and, nay, Reverend Alex on myspace.com slash mutant mountain boys.

171
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,540
Actually, friends, I was wrong.

172
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,860
That wasn't live, but from one of their old 45s.

173
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,820
Sorry, I had to censor that for the broadcast radio version,

174
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,480
but you can hear the uncensored version at subgenius.com.

175
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,220
In fact, you can hear all of the subgenius shows,

177
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,940

179
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,620
There's even an endless internet stream of nothing but subgenius shows.

180
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,240
All of them, old and new, 24-7, called Freethink Radio,

181
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,660
your one-stop source for all the subgenius radio shows,

182
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,940
including the Hour of Slack every Thursday at 11 a.m.

183
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,180
Also on freethinkradio.com,

184
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,060
at different times, you can have time for the show,

185
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,620
National Cynical.

186
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,080
Puzzling Evidence,

187
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,400
Bob's Slacktime Funhouse,

188
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,960
Fergan Fridays,

189
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,500
and much, much more,

190
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,860
all in one place at freethinkradio.com.

191
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,300
Regardless of what anybody knows,

192
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,660
there's an overwhelming amount of evidence that

193
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,800
the subgenius Hour of Slack

194
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,140
is up there.

195
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,580
And you want to find it.

196
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,680
Well, I'd like to know what happened in the Golden...

197
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,060
Bob?

198
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,860
According to the county records for surveyor's information,

199
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,600
they gave no reason for its closing.

200
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,720
Now, that's something I'd find of value, my...

201
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,780
Oh, don't be poetic.

202
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,220
If you know something, spit it out.

203
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,280
All right.

204
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,780
What I meant was,

205
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,420
you can hear all subgenius programs from all time

206
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,740
by following the links at subgenius.com,

207
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,600
the radio button at the top.

208
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,240
Meanwhile, for this present show,

209
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,600
we need to go to the past...

210
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,820
October Portland recordings,

211
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,160
and therefore...

212
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,820
I am going to get out of the way in just a minute

213
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,420
because we got a lot of great preachers here.

214
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,660
In fact, several of them are local to the great city of Portland.

215
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,700
And in fact, if you were to blow up this place tonight,

216
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,080
you would be able to wipe out the main authors

217
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,140
of the most recent subgenius books.

218
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,960
Dr. Philo Drummond, the original overman,

219
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:16,920
Dr. Philo Drummond, the original overman,

220
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,740
the man who introduced me to Bob,

221
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,500
the guy who actually knows Bob from back in college days,

222
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,620
is in this room tonight,

223
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,080
a man who has touched Bob.

224
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,920
And you know where.

225
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,700
I don't.

226
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,520
Don't tell me.

227
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,800
Yeah, Dr. Philo Drummond is here.

228
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,360
And the person who's going to follow me,

229
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,900
Dr. Uncle Onan Canobite.

230
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,720
Now, let me explain.

231
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,480
Onan is not...

232
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,860
He's not the most bombastic, hollering preacher.

233
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,680
But in fact, he is...

234
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,300
He has...

235
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,920
He was Bob's ward.

236
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,120
You know how Robin was Batman, Bruce Wayne's ward?

237
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,220
Onan was the ward of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

238
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,480
And not this particular sermon,

239
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,800
but when I'm preaching to the saved,

240
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,940
when we're assembling a new book,

241
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,720
a whole lot of those snappy words

242
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,940
and cool little lines come out of the brainer.

243
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,000
Something of Dr. Onan Canobite.

244
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,560
And I hope he's nearby.

245
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,740
Oh, yeah, okay.

246
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,780
But before I give it up to Onan,

247
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,960
I just have a few last things that I want to leave you with.

248
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,380
Repent!

249
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,260
Quit your job and slack off

250
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,020
while you still know how!

251
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,040
Now, actually, if you have a good job, hang on to it.

252
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,180
We need your money as well as you do.

253
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,900
Question authority.

254
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,020
Why?

255
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,960
Here we go.

256
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,020
There we go.

257
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,620
There's somebody who's been reading their prescription.

258
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,220
Friends, this is my favorite thing about Bob.

259
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,240
Bob is not the answer.

260
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,060
And praise Bob, neither is anything else.

261
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,940
You are free to believe any damn stupid thing you want.

262
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,340
And I hope they never outlaw evangelist preachers on TV

263
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,160
getting idiots to send money.

264
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,020
Because who's spending that money wisely?

265
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,980
The preacher.

266
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,480
And last of all,

267
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,160
friends, I've managed to make it this far.

268
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,220
I'm 56 years old and I'm a grandpa.

269
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:34,440
And I've found a philosophy that really you honestly can live by.

270
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,020
Most of them are just arbitrary formulas that sound good.

271
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,040
In fact, most of what Bob says is just stuff that sounds good.

272
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,000
Too much is always better than none.

273
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,760
But it's almost as bad.

274
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,960
Pull the wall over your own eyes.

275
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,740
You'll still be blind, but your head will be warm.

276
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,900
But the philosophy you can truly live by, friends,

277
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,600
f*** them if they can't take a job.

278
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,760
Praise Bob.

279
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,540
Thank you.

280
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,720
And we'll see you later.

281
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,400
And praise the great Reverend Dr. Uncle.

282
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,780
Oh, man.

283
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,540
Can't abide.

284
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,420
Oh, man.

285
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,700
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

286
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,060
Oh, man.

287
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,000
Oh, man.

288
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,840
Oh, man.

289
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,660
Oh, man.

290
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,380
Oh, man.

291
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,380
Oh, man.

292
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,120
Oh, man.

293
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,300
Oh, man.

294
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,060
Oh, man.

295
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,880
Oh, man.

296
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:29,920
Oh, man.

297
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:29,980
Oh, man.

298
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,480
Oh, man.

299
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,340
This is not open mic night.

300
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,420
Even now, armed operatives of the subgenius league of ass kickers

301
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,180
are forming a cyclone of slack around the parameter.

302
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,740
The conspiracy will not interfere with tonight's proceedings.

303
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,540
But enough of the conspiracy.

304
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,080
You don't want to hear about the conspiracy.

305
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,160
You want to hear moron religion.

306
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,460
And have we got a moron religion for you.

307
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,620
This is a night for people who love being a subgenius.

308
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,640
You've signed our lie ability forms.

309
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,160
You've drunk the lemonade.

310
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,240
You are now a Dobbs approved apotheologist.

311
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,780
Go ahead.

312
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,680
Sneak up behind the pink boys and give them

313
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,980
an executive debrief.

314
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,140
And you'll be a good cop.

315
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,860
You can do anything you want.

316
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,200
And we'll still take your money.

317
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,000
Bob gets it in the end.

318
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,320
And then Bob gets it to us in the end.

319
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,220
The church of the subgenius is the only alternative

320
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,360
to work that does not involve wealth.

321
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,020
Over man, I'm over man.

322
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,060
I'm the insignifying monkey.

323
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,300
I set fire to their hinder bird and rode my own coattails

324
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,640
to my own ineptism and glory.

325
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,780
Now every subgenius will at some point rear up on his or her

326
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,340
hind legs and say, well, you can't put me in a box.

327
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,120
We all end up in a box someday.

328
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,260
So until then, make sure that when

329
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,100
they listen back to your Slack box recording, it's a good one.

330
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,840
This is a war.

331
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,980
Tonight is a war.

332
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,460
On one side are the cool people.

333
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,920
And on the other side are the cool people.

334
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,540
The subgeniuses that are in the middle.

335
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,100
We say enough of their cool war.

336
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,620
We're through being cool.

337
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,720
And through being uncool as well.

338
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,200
We're fed up to the teeth with the cool ostomy bags

339
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,140
of the normal people.

340
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,460
They're designer parasites.

341
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,520
You were born a subgenius.

342
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,260
And if you're not, you can still pay us to tell you you were.

343
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,200
Be a man or a mouse.

344
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,500
If you are different, then you are better than most people.

345
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,540
But that's not what I'm going to leave you with tonight.

346
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,120
I want to leave you with something practical.

347
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Anyone here tonight ever been broke?

348
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,100
Maybe even recently broke?

349
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,580
Here is Dob's plan for financial success for you.

350
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,400
Take all you have and sell it.

351
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,500
Take one half of that.

352
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,120
Give it to the Church of the Subgenius.

353
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,520
Take what's left.

354
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,460
Give half of that to the Church of the Subgenius.

355
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,620
Mathematically, you will never run out of money for the rest of your life.

356
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,500
You've already got all the money you need.

357
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:14,600
So, let's save a little of that.

358
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,320
for when you're dead, so consider it an investment in eternity. Thank you and praise Bob.

359
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,180
And now the renowned Professor Dr. Howlin' Al.

360
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:46,400
Thank you, what an inspiration you are to all of us, Reverend Uncle Onan Canobite.

361
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:53,420
He is a remarkable subgenius, but so are they all. After all, you can make remarks about

362
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:59,060
anybody, but there has to be somebody, some person of substance there to make the remarks

363
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,160
about. And the word genius in some words is a word that is not a word, but it is a word

364
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,160


365
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:08,180
that can be interpreted as meaning spirit, like the genie that comes out of the land.

366
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,540
And if you are under your own spirit, the subgenius, this would be yet another of the

367
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:20,060
many refracting meanings inherent in the word subgenius. But it is true that the whole purpose

368
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:25,960
is to achieve and realize true slack. You must know that you were born with original

369
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:32,680
slack. But the conspiracy has been taking away all of your life, installing itself within

370
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,080
you.

371
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:40,040
And doing its best to make you thirst and jones for what it offers, which is false slack.

372
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:47,740
False slack manufactured by the conspiracy. Now of course, it may be that French fries

373
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:53,600
are full of trans fats, but they might represent slack to somebody. The slack would not be

374
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,600
false if, when achieved, it's satisfied. But conspiracy slack is designed to keep you jonesing

375
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,060
and lusting and thirsting after everything. And that's what it's all about. And that's

376
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,300
why it's so important for us to know that this is a real world, and not a mere fantasy.

377
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,300


378
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,400
are living in a world with an unending number of things. We must understand that every new

379
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:11,220
tchotchke, every new iPod, every new gadget, or what have you, and you think if you only

380
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:17,300
have that everything will be fine. But of course, it never is. Because like the fabled

381
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:23,460
grapes of Tantalus who was tortured in this way in the underworld, they withdraw when

382
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:30,780
his clawlike hands vainly grasps at them for the ten billionth time. And he's down there

383
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,180
doing it yet.

384
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:37,100
But we can avoid his fate by thirsting after true slack.

385
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,560
Leisure, the basis of culture.

386
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
Your time, the time and a half time.

387
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,080
The overtime.

388
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,880
The time that is uniquely yours and no one else's.

389
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,160
In a moment of leisure, great things happen.

390
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,600
Symphonies are composed.

391
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,480
Machines, labor-saving devices are designed.

392
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,700
Poems come through fruition.

393
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,860
Or evil can come to fruition.

394
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,600
But slack is an equal opportunity employer.

395
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,020
I'm a creep.

396
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,580
But I'm a creep.

397
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,160
Silver chairs.

398
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,200
I'm a freak.

399
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,280
I'm a freak.

400
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,500
And you'll also get living La Vida Loca.

401
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,100
And everything by yourself, every good thing.

402
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,740
I'm a freak.

403
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,700
I'm a freak.

404
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,260
I'm a freak.

405
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,100
I'm a freak.

406
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,420
Kill me.

407
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,480
Kill me.

408
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,480
Kill me.

409
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,520
Kill me.

410
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,280
Kill me.

411
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,300
Kill me.

412
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,440
Kill me.

413
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,260
Kill me.

414
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,340
Kill me.

415
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,100
Kill me.

416
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,280
Kill me.

417
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,520
Kill me.

418
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:10,940
Kill me.

419
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,020
Kill me.

420
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:12,660
Kill me.

421
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,140
Kill me.

422
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,320
Kill me Him.

423
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,820
Kill me.

424
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,420
Kill me.

425
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:16,860
Kill me.

426
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,040
Kill me.

427
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:17,860
Kill me.

428
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:17,860


429
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,380
Kill me.

430
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:18,480
Kill me.

431
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,220
Kill me.

432
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,220


433
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,400
Kill me.

434
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,080
Kill me.

435
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:23,620
Kill me.

436
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,720
Kill me.

437
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,280
Kill me.

438
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,300
Kill me.

439
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,320
Kill me.

440
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,200
Kill me!

441
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:35,620
Or Kill Me by Reverend Phineas Norco of National Cynical Radio,

442
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:42,500
one of the great subgeniously shows seen on TV at nationalcynical.com.

443
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,560
And his show streams practically nightly, friends.

444
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,160
But now, back to the Portland subgenius revival.

445
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:58,440
And now I am going to bring to the stage another well-known subgenius

446
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,040
and corrupter of youth in his own right.

447
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,200
He has been an associate for many years and suffered the slings and arrows

448
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,540
of outrageous fortune and the law and whatnot.

449
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,820
But he stands here, bloody but undoubbed,

450
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,760
to lay his particular subgenius trip upon you all.

451
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,700
And of course I'm talking about Reverend Crawdad Crawford.

452
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,540
Good evening, brothers and sisters.

453
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,860
I'm Reverend Crawford and tonight I'm going to use this broom as proof of the supremacy

454
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,380
of J.R. Bob Dobbs and his Church of the Subgenius.

455
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,180
Now it's been 10 years since the last revival here in Portland, Oregon.

456
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,900
And it gives me great pleasure to stand before you this evening and once again testify for Bob.

457
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,520
Testify!

458
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,160
Testify!

459
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,160


460
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,320
Testify!

461
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,420
Testify!

462
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,420


463
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,420


464
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,420


465
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,420


466
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,420


467
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,420


468
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,420


469
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,420


470
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,420


471
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,420


472
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,500
So if you look out at this wonderful crowd here at the Ash Street Saloon I see a lot

473
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,640
of young faces brothers and sisters, and that gives me very great hope and joy.

474
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,580
It's good to know that there are so many young mutants out there this evening

475
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,520
who will be getting their first true taste of Dobbs Lee slack.

476
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,860
Now there may be people out here who aren't completely familiar with all

477
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,940
that J.R. Bob Dobbs can do for you and to you

478
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,900
because J.R. Bob Dobbs is a savior you can count on.

479
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,040
He is a personal savior.

480
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,540
that delivers. J.R. Bob Dobbs is the kind of a savior that'll go down to 82nd Avenue,

481
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:42,480
get two mom jobs, then come back home and give you one of them. Can I get a praise, Bob?

482
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,320
Praise him indeed. So if you're new to Bob and the church, then welcome.

483
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,600
And it also pleases me a great deal to see a lot of veteran subgeni in the crowd tonight.

484
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:00,000
Now, I by no means consider myself to be an old school subgenius, particularly in the context of

485
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,560
some of the world-renowned doctors who are here this evening and whose wisdom you have already

486
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:12,100
partaken of. Next to them, I'm a veritable babe in the woods of Dobbs. When Johnny Brainwash was

487
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,720
putting this revival together, and he's done a hell of a job, can I get a shout out for Johnny

488
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,300
Brainwash?

489
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,760
So,

490
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,760
when Johnny Brainwash was first putting this revival together, I was relating all the wonderful

491
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,640
experiences I've had with the church of the subgenius since I first joined in 1990. And then

492
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:43,380
I thought, damn, 1990, that is 20 years, two decades of slack that this wonderful religion

493
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,840
has brought me, brothers and sisters, and I'm here to testify that it has been good.

494
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,880
Oh, no, I don't think there are any doctors here this evening

495
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,580
who will be able to tell you that this is a good thing.

496
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,980
So, I'm going to get a little bit of a jump in the air here, and then I'm just going to

497
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:54,980


498
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,840
When I say that Bob Dobbs has delivered on every promise he has made to his faithful,

499
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:07,580
and then some, it has been a long road, brothers and sisters. We all know that. The last eight

500
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:15,920
years were particularly difficult, but we have prevailed. Bob has come through, and he has made

501
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:23,480
good on all of his promises for the good of mutant kind. So, a lot of things have happened since that

502
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,820
first pamphlet hit the streets,

503
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,480
a lot of things for the good of mutant

504
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,640
kind since Bob first received

505
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,580
that transmission from Jehovah One

506
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,200
on his homemade television set.

507
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,680
Amazing things have happened. Wondrous

508
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,020
events like X-Day.

509
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,620
On that day, of course, we entered the

510
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,800
pleasure saucers of the sex goddesses

511
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,380
and ascended to heaven

512
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,500
where we fed and we

513
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,480
fropped and we fornicated

514
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,580
for 666

515
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,280
days.

516
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,760
You guys all remember that, right?

517
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,960
Pleasures unimaginable,

518
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,980
brothers and sisters, but despite

519
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,920
all of the incredible pleasures

520
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,940
of the saucers, the ennui set

521
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,000
in and we began to

522
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,180
realize that without a planet to dominate,

523
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,980
life for the subgenius

524
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,920
began to be a little dull

525
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,900
and pointless,

526
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,500
kind of like living in Seattle.

527
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,780
So we terraformed Mars because

528
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,020
of course the

529
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,880
Earth was destroyed in the great burning

530
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,560
of the pinks that followed X-Day.

531
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,880
We terraformed Mars to be an

532
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,100
exact replica of the Earth

533
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,980
and we descended from the saucers

534
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,560
to claim our new home.

535
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,160
Unfortunately, some of us

536
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,000
were so frop saturated that

537
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,960
we might not even remember all of these

538
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,880
fantastic events. Sure, they were

539
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,520
mind-boggling and amazing, but

540
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,960
there was a lot of frop on those

541
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,420
saucers, brothers and sisters.

542
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,980
And it was real

543
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,060
high quality.

544
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,020
So just in case we might forget

545
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,860
these events that Bob hath wrought,

546
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,620
we left clues on our new Earth

547
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,720
to remind us of the supremacy

548
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,940
of the subgenius.

549
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,740
We elected an African-American

550
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,280
Yetison president of the United States

551
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,920
of America.

552
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,100
We invented all sorts of neat little

553
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,300
computer electronic gadgets that we

554
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,460
carry around all day and do amazing

555
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,160
things with.

556
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,240
And we made comic books real popular

557
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,000
and had movies based on them.

558
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,680
We produced them with huge budgets

559
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,080
and amazing special effects.

560
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,780
And we got Marge Simpson on the cover

561
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,880
of Playboy magazine.

562
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,180
So all of these things are there

563
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,600
to remind us that Bob made good

564
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,460
on his promise.

565
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,600
And then there are the pinks.

566
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,580
Yeah, we recreated them too.

567
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,480
Now, some might consider this to be

568
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,500
a lapse in judgment.

569
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,460
And like I said, that frop, that saucer frop,

570
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,480
was really potent.

571
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,640
But we realized it was a little bit boring

572
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,440
without having pinks to torment.

573
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,440
And deep down inside, we knew that we

574
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,120
needed the pinks to enable our mighty mutant yang.

575
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,560
They are the weak, lame yin.

576
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,300
So we still have the pinks, but they're

577
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,480
no longer in charge, brothers and sisters.

578
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,880
And we know it.

579
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,780
And the beautiful thing is they know it too.

580
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,920
So now.

581
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,440
Yeah.

582
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,680
We are treated with a sight of bewildered pinks

583
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,880
standing up at town hall meetings across the country

584
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,040
going, I want my America back.

585
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,200
And our response to that is, no.

586
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,060
We mutants worked too hard and sacrificed too much

587
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:41,620
to wrest it away from you, you stupid, ignorant, vile, empty,

588
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,760
pink, mall zombie sack of .

589
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,180
You will not get your America back because Bob owns it now.

590
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,920
And if you don't believe it, I offer as proof this simple broom.

591
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,800
Now, brothers and sisters, in the book of the subgenius,

592
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,480
there is listed a string of prophecies, things

593
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,200
that would come into being prior to the ascendancy

594
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,420
of the subgenius.

595
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,380
This is a long string of prophecies,

596
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,140
which Bob provided us as guideposts along the path

597
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,160
of mutant salvation.

598
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,960
And the very last prophecy, brothers and sisters,

599
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,940
the very final sign that our kind

600
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,420
has provided us with is the fact that we

601
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:19,420


602
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:19,420


603
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,780
have prevailed is simply this, that cheap, simple composite

604
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,100
brooms are readily available.

605
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,620
You can look it up.

606
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,440
So brothers and sisters, I went down to the dollar store

607
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,360
just a few blocks from my house, bought this broom,

608
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:39,180
paid a buck for it, $1, which is, not coincidentally,

609
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,340
the price of eternal salvation as listed

610
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,740
on the first pamphlet of the subgenius,

611
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,740
quod erat demonstratum, there is slack.

612
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,400
Woo!

613
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,860
Thank you, brothers and sisters, and praise Bob.

614
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,640
Calling the Duke of Uke.

615
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,780
Duke of Uke, please report to the stage.

616
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,700
Ah, yes, the Duke of Uke is here.

617
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,240
And he needs a little unit of time

618
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,900
for his complex technical setup.

619
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,500
I won't bore you with a lot of technological double talk

620
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,400
to describe the intricate mechanisms he needs to set up.

621
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,780
To bring the optimum gloss to this presentation.

622
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,000
And of course, we try to bring you the best.

623
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:31,820
Now I talked about the conspiracy and why you should resist its products,

624
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,900
even though you can't really, because they are already inbred

625
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,860
in the bone, the blood, and the brain.

626
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,100
But we may sit through an impossible task,

627
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,600
but one's reach should exceed one's grasp, or what's a heaven for?

628
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,380
Anyway, uh, I'm going to stop here.

629
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,860
Where does Bob fit into all this melange of mythology

630
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,940
and snarky circumspection?

631
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,160
Well, Bob, you can consider, simply as a sort of visual mantra.

632
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,800
Have you tried just looking at the face?

633
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,800
Not this large interpretation, but the actual face with the dots.

634
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,220
How important are these dots?

635
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,980
You know, if you look at dots long enough, and then you close your eyes,

636
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,800
you see glowing dots.

637
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,920
Anti-dots.

638
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:27,280
From having stared too hard at the multiple dots which comprise the face.

639
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,640
The face stands for and provides slack.

640
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,140
Remember, slack is the luminous cloud.

641
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,360
Slack, the angelic voice.

642
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,260
And you will recognize slack.

643
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,060
And of course, you'll creep off to find slack in some way,

644
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,140
even if you don't know what you're doing.

645
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,460
But if you do know what you're doing, you'll get there fast,

646
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:52,360
and get to enjoy more time in the slacktime funhouse.

647
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,200
And how are those technical arrangements coming?

648
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,720
I have a feeling that they're not done.

649
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,780
And so, let us consider the subgenius nature

650
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:09,120
as viewed through the astonishingly clarifying lens of geologic time.

651
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,740
Yes, the ages of the Earth, endless eons.

652
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,440
Time lying heavy.

653
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,540
As on the hottest of days, when noon lies heavy on flower and tree,

654
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,720
and the weary day turns to its rest.

655
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,940
Lingering like an unloved guest.

656
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:36,180
But time itself is the macrocosm, of which that is but the fractal part.

657
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,120
One moment which you devote to scratching your nose

658
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,120
is multiplied through an infinitude of infinities.

659
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,280
Duplicated, mirrored, and marked.

660
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,200
In countless other worlds.

661
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,160
The process of time dissipates off all these multiverses.

662
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,900
And staying on the right path is difficult.

663
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,900
We say Bob surfs the luck plane.

664
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,860
And this is what to do.

665
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,580
When you surf, when you're actually surfing, not the metaphor,

666
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,820
when you're actually surfing, you have to be in the zone.

667
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,780
You can't think about what you're doing, you've just got to feel it,

668
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,540
and that's how you've got to surf the luck plane.

669
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,240
But ladies and gentlemen,

670
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,240
you're going to wipe out.

671
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,960
Everybody wipes out.

672
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,880
Nobody surfs forever.

673
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,560
It simply determines the quality of the ride.

674
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,140
So seek out slack and reject it.

675
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:29,760
Turn it away.

676
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,260
Utterly denounce the pernicious products of the conspiracy.

677
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,920
Slack, they're no good anyway.

678
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,660
If thy iPod frenzy pluck it out.

679
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:46,860
Well, I don't know, perhaps the Duke of Ute is at this point ready to begin his soulful serenade.

680
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,360
Ah, well, there you go.

681
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:55,000
And so I leave you in the capable strumming of fingers and musical gyrations of the Duke of Ute.

682
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:55,520
Woo!

683
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,400
Woo!

684
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:57,960
Woo!

685
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,120
Woo!

686
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,640
Woo!

687
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,000
Woo!

688
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:05,300
Woo!

689
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:05,560
Woo!

690
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,140
Woo!

691
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,200
I am Andy Coy.

692
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,540
Woo!

693
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,760
I am an Alkite.

694
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,380
I don't know what I want, but I know how to get it.

695
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,820
I want to destroy.

696
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,080
Crows should break it.

697
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:34,100
I want to be an Alky.

698
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,760
Woo!

699
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,020
Woo!

700
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,060
An Alky for the UK.

701
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,060
It's coming sometime.

702
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,020
And maybe give the mom puns, stop the traffic line.

703
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,340
The future dream as a shopping scheme.

704
00:35:53,580 --> 00:36:00,820
Cause I want to be an Alky.

705
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:10,220
How many ways to get what you want?

706
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,120
I use the best.

707
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,520
I use the rest.

708
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,040
I use the best.

709
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,360
I use the enemy.

710
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,140
I use Alky.

711
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:27,840
Cause I want to be an Alky.

712
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:41,240
Cause I want to be an Alky.

713
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,460
obsessed destroy.

714
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,420
Alrighty.

715
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,360
And I bought my life about to do that.

716
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:00,360


717
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:00,700
And I let thears go on the run.

718
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:00,700


719
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:00,700


720
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:00,700


721
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:00,760
and I am well.

722
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:00,760


723
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:00,760


724
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,860
He's also said what I'm going to do right now.

725
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:05,880


726
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,960
He's said the papers since q is the car they sold.

727
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,020
And what is he saying?

728
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,040


729
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,760
President Obama says no charges have yet been filed.

730
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,380
President Obama says it's time for PR News, Washington.

731
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,340
Oh, I've got some new Bob lines here, actually.

732
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,140
Bob speaks, it sort of channels through people.

733
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,800
You can only get one word at a time through because then your head explodes.

734
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:33,940
We have to line the Bobbies up in a row and then run down the row of tape recorders

735
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,960
while they say one word from Bob each and then keel over like burnt out flash cubes.

736
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:44,400
But here's a new one, direct from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

737
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:50,640
Those who do not know which aphorisms are overused are doomed to repeat them.

738
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,640
Here's another one that was channeled by Reverend Clay Johnson, whoever he is.

739
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,920
Both the words alien and believable.

740
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:08,700
Believe have the word lie right in the middle.

741
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,940
The conspiracy does tend to hide things right in plain sight.

742
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,420
Where subgenius is missing, of course.

743
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,180
The conspiracy does tend to hide things right in plain sight.

744
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,280
They're going to burn you, boy.

745
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,660
They will burn you to a crisp.

746
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,140
They will burn you to a crisp.

747
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,860
They will burn you to a crisp.

748
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,400
They thrive off your pain.

749
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,820
They thrive off your suffering.

750
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,060
All they want to do

751
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,320
All they want to do

752
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,120
All they want to do

753
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,180
All they want to do

754
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,560
All they want to do

755
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,920
Kill each one of them.

756
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:33,920


757
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:33,920


758
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:33,920


759
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:33,920


760
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:33,920


761
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:33,920


762
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,740
to every one of you.

763
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,340
They're going to burn you, boy.

764
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,320
They're going to burn you, boy.

765
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,280
They're going to burn you, boy.

766
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,040
They're going to burn you, boy.

767
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,240
They're going to burn you, boy.

768
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:16,660
They're going to burn you, boy.

769
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,780
You're going to burn me, boy.

770
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,800
I wish you were on a bus.

771
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,600
I wish you would take that campaign first to Capitol Hill

772
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,980
and start there with the Mind Your Own Business campaign

773
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,820
because that would be the best place to start.

774
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,500
Well, that's right.

775
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,720
Go to Capitol Hill and start a fire.

776
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,900
Take them to Capitol Hill and tell them,

777
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,300
quit mingling with stupid laws

778
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,600
and coming up with stupid stuff

779
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,700
that's costing the American people money.

780
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,520
Well, they take turns.

781
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,980
For a while, Big Brother is in the boardroom

782
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,520
and then for a while, Big Brother is in the bedroom

783
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,900
and then back to the boardroom

784
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,840
and they jump back and forth as to which part of your life they're going to control the most.

785
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,900
Some of us need our lives controlled, though, on a minuscule, very, very small, tiny, petty little level.

786
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,100
Like, you know, proper scripture, enrolling in the...

787
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:24,340
Learning not to pick your nose in public, drooling, that kind of thing.

788
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,280
Arguing with the police in public, arguing with your neighbors.

789
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,900
Arguing with federal agents using your shotgun, things like that.

790
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:39,600
Yeah, you talk about Big Brother in the boardroom, but someone needs to be there because, I mean,

791
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:46,300
the boardrooms tend to be populated by greedy and selfish people who will never do the right thing unless they're given no choice.

792
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,260
We don't need Big Brother in the bedroom.

793
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,340
That's just two consensual adults screwing each other.

794
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,720
We need Big Brother in the boardroom because that's where they screw the rest of us.

795
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,820
Yeah, that was a good one.

796
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,200
No, but see, once again, you're asking for a Big Brother.

797
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:04,680
Not for me.

798
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,380
You know, yeah, I don't...

799
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,680
For people with actual power.

800
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,880
That's the problem with a corporate state.

801
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,500
There's really nobody to argue with.

802
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,700
I mean, what would you go up to your local gas meter reader guy and start yelling at him or...

803
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,260
They do have that problem.

804
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,780
...at the bus station, you know, waiting to go back to camp, whatever, and stuff.

805
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,560
Hey, man, it's your fault, you know, or who...

806
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,720
You know, how do you...

807
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,900
Oh, the last meter reader that came by.

808
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,200
By my house, I thrashed him to hell just out of general principles.

809
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,740
Like, I don't need authority coming in my home.

810
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,760
You know, they did cut off my gas after that.

811
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,460
I didn't want to go through your later voting phase.

812
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,380
You don't realize the problem.

813
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:46,880
Again, you can't blame the meter reader or the gas meter guy or whatever for coming in your house

814
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,540
if that's where he has to go to read the meter.

815
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,240
No, but he's the only one you can beat the crap out of.

816
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,300
Yeah, but you can't...

817
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,420
You can't allow those guys to have sex with your wife.

818
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,760
That's the problem with it.

819
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,040
That's the main problem.

820
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,660
That's the main problem.

821
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,800
I shall never kill the messenger.

822
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,300
Yeah, if you're going to beat the crap out of someone, beat the crap out of someone who deserves it.

823
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,380
The messenger's the easiest target.

824
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,840
All I'm saying is you can't make it.

825
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,900
You can't beat the crap out of the CEO because you're not going to be able to get to him

826
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,300
unless you somehow, you know, become a waiter in his country club,

827
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,280
and then they're going to throw you in prison.

828
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,960
So in the meantime, who the hell can you beat up except the messenger?

829
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,780
Yeah, that makes perfect sense to me.

830
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:27,880
Yeah.

831
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,300
I mean, at least if you want to lash out, you know you're never going to get the CEO.

832
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,500
You're never going to nail the big prize.

833
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:38,220
I felt sorry for my own newsboy back when I used to subscribe to the newspaper

834
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,340
because I'd come out if he...

835
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:45,800
If I could catch that guy early enough, you know, I'd beat him up for all the bad news I read.

836
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,520
Especially if they're like the special education kids.

837
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,960
They have the really weird bikes, and they drive real slow,

838
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:54,400
and they're already having to have a job like delivering papers with a 35.

839
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:57,680
And when you come running off that porch with the dog right behind you,

840
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,760
and maybe you've got like that little strangle bracelet ready to go,

841
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,580
believe me, their faces light right up.

842
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,560
It's a beautiful thing.

843
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,040
I'm a messenger killer, man.

844
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,460
I got news for you.

845
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,640
I think the day of the paper boy are gone.

846
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,520
I think the paper boy has been replaced by the paper man and the paper woman.

847
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,860
Then why don't we just kill the messenger?

848
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,300
Not to mention the paper tiger.

849
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,140
Those are really dangerous.

850
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,980
Yeah, that's true, too.

851
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,340
Yeah, the paper tiger is the messenger.

852
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,540
But the person that delivers my newspaper delivers in the middle of the night.

853
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,520
Because I can hear the car running around sometimes at night,

854
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,640
and in the morning I find my paper out there.

855
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,320
So unless you wanted to do a stakeout, a campout at night,

856
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,560
you weren't going to catch that person.

857
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,300
So you were taking stimulants, illegal stimulants, when you were 12 years old is what you're saying, right?

858
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,280
If you're going to put that much effort into it, you might as well go after the female.

859
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,380
Well, you know, you don't have to do an all-night vigil yourself.

860
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,680
I mean, that's what dogs are for.

861
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,040
Yeah, really, think about it.

862
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,820
To kill the paper boy.

863
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,960
Because of the bad news from...

864
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,260
The earthquake in Turkey.

865
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:04,360
The smart people are quite enough to stay away from those neighborhoods that have all the candles lit in the windows.

866
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,660
You know, I...

867
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,500
Stay off of my lawn.

868
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,220
I've had a similar experience, you know.

869
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,980
I wanted to kill Dick Goddard for bringing us so much bad weather.

870
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:19,860
But, of course, I'll never get to him, so I shot my TV with a .45, a .45, a .45, a .45.

871
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,220
The Kub management council cancelled my time with your Dad.

872
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:40,220


873
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:40,220


874
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:40,220


875
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:57,880
. . . Recovers .. Evacuation and. . . NO!

876
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,380
It's been so long I don't know

877
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,380
I still don't know

878
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:35,960
I still don't know

879
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,580
Do you?

880
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,280
Do you wanna do?

881
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,240
Do you wanna see it all?

882
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,000
It's been so long I don't know

883
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,660
I still don't know

884
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,960
Do you wanna do?

885
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,340
Do you wanna do?

886
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:27,840
Do you wanna do?

887
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,920
Do you wanna do?

888
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,020
Do you wanna do?

889
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:49,700
Rose

890
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:49,980
Rose

891
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,020
What's wrong with you?

892
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:57,020


893
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:57,100
Rose

894
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,840
See you next time.

895
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,400
Bye.

896
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,520
Bye.

897
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:29,880
Bye.

898
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,960
Bye.

899
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,900
Bye.

900
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,760
Bye.

901
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,840
Bye.

902
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,300
Bye.

903
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,100
Bye.

904
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,100
Bye.

905
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,200
Bye.

906
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,260
Bye.

907
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,160
Bye.

908
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,560
Bye.

909
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,000
Bye.

910
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:29,880
Bye.

911
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,920
Bye.

912
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:56,880
¶¶

913
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:03,180
Reverend Wilhelm Stahlhelm did that, and before that, the large and lemur PR.

914
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,880
And thank you.

915
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:07,820
¶¶

916
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:22,960
Oh, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Stang in the year 2020.

917
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,220
That show we just heard was from the year 2000.

918
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:34,680
2010 from a Portland revival, Portland, Oregon revival in 2009.

919
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:43,580
And a listener requested that particular show, and that brought it to my attention,

920
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:51,520
and I found it strangely timely for these times.

921
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,820
So that's what that was about.

922
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:56,500
Praise Bob.
