00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
From PR News in Washington, I'm Carly Fiorina.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,540
Fiorina said she is Ted Cruz.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,480
Fiorina says she is the man to do it.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,180
Fiorina said Fiorina ended last month.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,860
And said PR News is stronger with her voice.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,400
B2B, B2B, we weigh the only set of lives lost will be by Ted.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,480
PR's reports left one person dead and sick and five others.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:29,000
A report released this week by a committee of scientists says PR News produced a completely unusual effect that damaged the subject's brains.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,060
Those who got lower doses will make recommendations to improve PR News.

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,600
The Dow is 27 PR.

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,080
PR News would enshrine discrimination in the state's institution later this week.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,240
Carly Fiorina is endorsing PR News in Washington.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,480

48
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,880
in the back it is that was the music for professor lampini's carnival after lampini himself was

49
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:49,200
assassinated by hugo the hunchback hey uh now known for his percussive theme for the wolf man

50
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,320

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:02,440
house of dracula the mummy's curse the house of mummies the house of the creature they're all

sun

55
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:26,460
something a couple years ago their movies are are kind of fun they're based on dolls but they're

56
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,340
they're teenage girls but they're monsters but they're teenage girls but they're monsters no

57
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,220
they're teenage girls and they're monsters yeah it's girls and monsters what's not to like the

58
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:43,160
girls are monsters well they could it could be that because it's a pink toy line aimed at tweens

59
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,160
that it would be really stupid and it kind of is especially if you spend a lot of money on it

60
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:57,780
yeah anything begun on a tie-dye and some

61
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,580
boys don't know why they're broken one of the day they are

62
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,540
well i guess i as of last glass Hassan

63
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:07,540


64
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:07,540


65
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:07,540


66
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:07,540


67
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:13,620
or six movies you're actually pretty if you're a fan of old universal monster pictures they're full

68
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:20,340
of inside jokes you see there's one that's like a frankenstein and one that's the dracula and yeah

69
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,000
draculaura is the daughter of dracula really he is the daughter of frankenstein she's only 16

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,460
days old and there's robecca who's an automaton but cute cleo is the daughter of the mummy and

71
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:43,100
she walks although she looks like a beautiful teenage girl cleopatra style she walks with a

72
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:50,520
little hitch in her walk cycle which only you and i and dr howell would know was a reference to her

73
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:58,540
dad the mummy right limp all the time limping yeah this tall long-legged stuck up she's kind of the

74
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:05,240
rich girl the rich girl of the house yeah except it's cleopatra yeah you know and her dad's a pharaoh

75
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,060
or something

76
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:14,360
in this case but yeah it's it's it's pretty fun there's a tragic romance between

77
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:21,920
the son of the creature and the daughter of the sea serpent because one's fresh water

78
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:29,540
and one's salt water is one of their names uh gillian or jillian yeah gill is it all is uh

79
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:36,040
the voice he's an earnest boy he has to wear a bowl over his head a water-filled bowl

80
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:45,300
oh so he'll breathe yeah so you can bring and uh laguna who actually is she's the although you'd

81
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:53,380
think laguna was the creature's daughter she's actually the sea surface she's australian and uh

82
00:07:53,380 --> 00:08:01,340
oh is she hot well i haven't seen that one i hadn't been following it recently i didn't know

83
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:06,000
anything about her that australian accent is kind of kind of hot too

84
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:13,840
but there's there's a mexican girl who's a like day of the dead look okay she's a sort of a

85
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,520
skeleton the only doll that we bought was one they wouldn't say who she was the daughter of and i was

86
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:28,040
assuming it was cthulhu uh she's got tentacles for legs she's really weird looking now that's

87
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:34,340
undersea and most things like it turned out that the the the hidden gimmick was she's the daughter

88
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,440
of the crockett yeah okay okay so i'm just gonna let you know about that and we're gonna see you in

89
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,440


90
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,740
which is sort of

91
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,320
not as good as Cthulhu

92
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,520
no

93
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,200
Crackdown

94
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,420
they didn't

95
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,780
Cthulhu

96
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,880
there are no Lovecraft elements

97
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,980
in Monster High

98
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,860
that I saw

99
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,880
and Princess Wee and I

100
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,480
got to be

101
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,920
real experts on that

102
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,200
yeah

103
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,120
the webisodes

104
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,260
were little animated

105
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,280
drawn cartoons

106
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,140
about three minutes long each

107
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,800
and we called those

108
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,300
our crack

109
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,100
because we would

110
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,800
binge watch these little

111
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,820
three minute episodes

112
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,940
they had the same music

113
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,900
at the beginning and end

114
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,400
sort of like Clutch Cargo

115
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,780
a minute of title music

116
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,180
a minute of plot

117
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,560
a minute of end credit music

118
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,480
and then

119
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,360
but

120
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,060
twenty of those

121
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,040
in a half hour

122
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,700
oh

123
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,620
yeah

124
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,480
so

125
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,440
I will look into that

126
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,140
obsessive compulsive behavior

127
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,200
but girls

128
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,040
it's monsters

129
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,160
what's not to like

130
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,640
you had

131
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,880
you know hot rods in there

132
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,780
and it's everything

133
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,900
well it's not in the

134
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,740
when are they going to do a kids

135
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,140
show that's about hot rod monsters

136
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,560
why haven't they yet

137
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,360
or have they

138
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,600
because

139
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,180
today don't have those hot rods

140
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,060
anymore

141
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,100
no not really

142
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,540
you see

143
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,520
you'd have to have that

144
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,140
hot rod culture

145
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,640
that we don't have superheroes anymore

146
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,380
but look how popular those are

147
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,080
in the movies

148
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,560
so hot rod weirdos

149
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,580
yeah

150
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,140
which I'm not sure about

151
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,800
I'm all about those

152
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,440
just do a series where there are

153
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,820
hot rod weirdos

154
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,140
and then

155
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:11,740
how many

156
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,580
life would imitate art

157
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,800
and soon it would follow through

158
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,120
how many scripts do you think have been pitched

159
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,460
to Pixar

160
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,100
about hot rod

161
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,400
monsters

162
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,560
at least three

163
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,780
I would think so yeah

164
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,460
I would

165
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,700
the rat think movie

166
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,500
have you ever

167
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,160

168
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,480
the video game

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,800
Grim Fandango

170
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,280
yeah

171
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,440
if they could

172
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:36,720
be

173
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,260
you know

174
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,260


175
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,260


176
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,080
all the

177
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,300
games

178
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:40,300


179
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:40,400
every

180
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:40,400


181
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:40,640
they

182
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:40,760
have

183
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:40,760


184
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,580
does

185
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,460
ац

186
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,260
in

187
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,520
all right

188
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,140
you know

189
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,080
Jim

190
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,060
of Reverend Aaron.

191
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,020
First X Day for these two.

192
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,460
Happy X Day.

193
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,740
We know them from Starwood.

194
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,860
Yeah.

195
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,480
Yeah.

196
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,980
Yeah.

197
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,900
Uh-huh.

198
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,340
Yeah.

199
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:23,600
If you want to know where the really cool hidden spots are around here, ask them.

200
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,340
They know.

201
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,220
Yeah.

202
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,340
Yeah.

203
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:38,260
His dad is Maruga Booker, the all-purpose musician, I guess you would say.

204
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,100
Uh-huh.

205
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,740
He's been in a lot of bands.

206
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,960
Many musical performers are going to appear there.

207
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,840
Oh, blessed, blessed silence, which I broke.

208
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,480
Somebody has to.

209
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,880
As you grope in the darkness.

210
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,720
That music isn't really appropriate.

211
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,500
I don't feel the suspense that that music is supposed to.

212
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,060
I had some suspense this morning for about ten minutes.

213
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,800
Yes.

214
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,400
And, uh...

215
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,520
Then it was the usual.

216
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,400
X Day, 24th X Day Drill.

217
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,300
I've been at every one except the last one.

218
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,100
What happened at 7 a.m.?

219
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,660
Who'd everybody stare at?

220
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,080
You and Philo?

221
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:50,900
Yeah.

222
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,440
It was just that way.

223
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:52,980
Oh, Philo.

224
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,460
Well, he, yeah, they should.

225
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,880
It's really his fault.

226
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,780
He got the potatoes thrown at him.

227
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,300
Yeah.

228
00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,440
Yeah.

229
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,520
If it's anyone's fault besides Bob's, it's Philo's.

230
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,120
Yes.

231
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,800
That's...

232
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,180
Thanks, Philo.

233
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,500
He'll be all modest and try to claim that it's my fault.

234
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,840
Thanks, Philo.

235
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,400
Yeah, way to go, Philo.

236
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:13,760
Way to go.

237
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,280
Thank you.

238
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,000
Thanks a whole bunch, Philo.

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,360
Yeah, thank you so much.

240
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,340
Yeah, another wasted...

241
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,120
I'm glad I could help.

242
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:21,960
Yeah.

243
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,660
Well, uh, what was the...

244
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,100
Yeah, I got up at six in the morning because of you.

245
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,280
And what was the deal with the red and green?

246
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,840
Green tickets.

247
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,300
Oh, God.

248
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,080
Okay.

249
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,040
We had returned...

250
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,380
Some of you weren't here yesterday.

251
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,020
Returned trips.

252
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,560
Last night, Susie and I were going around handing out these green tickets.

253
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,840
Yes, I've got mine.

254
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,080
It turned out...

255
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,340
I'm not sure how this...

256
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:52,180
Why Susie was the one who ended up channeling this, but it was...

257
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,800
There were these green tickets that you couldn't...

258
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,680
It was the last minute thing.

259
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,080
They'd kind of replaced the membership.

260
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,560
They'd replaced the membership cards.

261
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,480
But we know who's a member.

262
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,580
But I...

263
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,800
Visually, now, there's only ten anyway.

264
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,580
So we handed out these green tickets.

265
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,580
And then this morning, I asked her, after the saucers didn't arrive,

266
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,980
I asked her why she had handed me this other bag of red tickets.

267
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,080
And she got a very sheepish look on her face and realized she'd gotten confused.

268
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,820
That red meant real.

269
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,260
And green didn't.

270
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,220
It did not mean go.

271
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,440
And that we were supposed to have the red tickets.

272
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,400
I see.

273
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,360
So next time, if it's pills next time, take both.

274
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,900
Just take both.

275
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,940
Take both tickets.

276
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,060
You cannot...

277
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,300
You know, we've got to look out for every option at this point.

278
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:50,940
Yes.

279
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,060
We're desperate.

280
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,040
I'll admit it.

281
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,340
My mind wasn't on it.

282
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:54,960
I should have.

283
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,040
I don't want to wait for the saucers 25 times.

284
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,260
But I will.

285
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,500
I will.

286
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,040
That's going to happen.

287
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,060
That shows your faith in Bob.

288
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:03,720
Yes.

289
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,400
That you will come out each time knowing that Bob will set it right.

290
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,400
I'll keep coming here, too.

291
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,240
Yes.

292
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,420
I don't live in Ohio anymore.

293
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,400
But you'll come all this way.

294
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,840
I don't live in Ohio at all.

295
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,600
Right.

296
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,260
Well, but I don't even live up north anymore.

297
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,120
I live a thousand miles away now.

298
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:26,580
Oh.

299
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,920
Deep, deep in a forest.

300
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,420
Deep in the heart of Texas.

301
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,320
Where no one bothers me and my two children.

302
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,160
The dogs.

303
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,760
Two bounding dogs.

304
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,080
Yeah, only now Princess Wee is going to go back with me.

305
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,700
And her mom.

306
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,860
So there will be human companionship, finally, for once.

307
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,480
Oh, my God.

308
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,360
The clowns are here.

309
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,080
Oh, shit.

310
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,040
Well, there it goes.

311
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:48,580
That's it.

312
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,520
Okay.

313
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,280
Okay.

314
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:59,080
The whole tenor of the event has changed from slackful and calm.

315
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,460
To very uptight and scared.

316
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,960
A what?

317
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,560
Very uptight and scared.

318
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,320
Yeah, uptight and scared.

319
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,360
Because, yeah, now I'm uptight, Larry.

320
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,060
Don't give drugs to the clowns.

321
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,080
Hey, did they get their pills?

322
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,760
Maybe they don't need the pills.

323
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,320
It is possible.

324
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,820
We love clowns.

325
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,380
They taste funny.

326
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,440
Yeah, down there in the ring.

327
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,380
Down in the ring.

328
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,820
Not up in the stands with us.

329
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,620
Slobbering on us.

330
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,200
Spreading their baby wieners.

331
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,200
They're flaming baby wieners everywhere.

332
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,520
That's right.

333
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,780
I forgot about the baby wieners.

334
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,620
Yes.

335
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,600
I wish I could.

336
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,760
A flaming bicycle.

337
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,000
Yeah.

338
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,460
The clowns have done some real stunts out here.

339
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,560
Many people have been nearly injured or killed.

340
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,480
I mean, this is, you know, this.

341
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,160
Shut up.

342
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,800
Rivals, you know, Evel Knievel.

343
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,720
Yeah.

344
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,120
You know.

345
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:02,500
Yeah.

346
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,460
If Evel Knievel was.

347
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,660
Rode a bike over a flaming car.

348
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,480
Yeah.

349
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,180
First year.

350
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,200
Then it was flaming.

351
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,600
I don't even want to say what it was.

352
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,120
You guys need to.

353
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,060
I don't want to tell the audience again.

354
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,560
I don't want to think about it.

355
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,280
Over a flaming school bus.

356
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,620
Filled with baby wieners.

357
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,520
Wieners.

358
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,180
Yes.

359
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,020
Entries.

360
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,460
Favorite.

361
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,880
All for the editing process to resolve.

362
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,740
A flaming school bus.

363
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,460
There was some jamming last night.

364
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,320
I don't.

365
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,320
I barely remember.

366
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,080
Is that what you call that?

367
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,780
I was actually on stage shuffling around and staring at what was going on.

368
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,700
There were some.

369
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,700
All I really remember.

370
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,160
Good notes played on the stage.

371
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,900
Reverend X doing some kind of.

372
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,000
It sounded beef hearty.

373
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,940
That jam last night.

374
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,620
On the.

375
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,560
The.

376
00:17:59,700 --> 00:17:59,780
Him.

377
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,740
Through the.

378
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:03,840
Megaphone.

379
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,520
Or him playing.

380
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,500
We didn't have any.

381
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,640
We didn't have a single mic on stage.

382
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,480
No, I know that.

383
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,120
I was up there.

384
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,580
But they did have a megaphone.

385
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,040
He was playing guitar.

386
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,340
Oh, during that part.

387
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:16,600
Right.

388
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:16,880
Yeah.

389
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,120
Okay.

390
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,320
You were playing some bass, I think.

391
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,400
I was playing bass and drums at the same time.

392
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,300
During that time.

393
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,860
It was a heroic effort.

394
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,660
It seemed like it was a broken.

395
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,640
Stumbling rhythm.

396
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,860
With jerky spastic.

397
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,600
I thought it was great.

398
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,080
Yeah.

399
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,480
Spastic.

400
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,680
I remember that.

401
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,460
It was not the same old thing.

402
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,540
It's doctor music.

403
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,480
And actually, Princess, we was playing killer flute.

404
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,180
Oh, I know.

405
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,520
But you could only hear it if you stood right next to her.

406
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,120
That's is a.

407
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,660
Sex.

408
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:49,960
Guy.

409
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,520
It's.

410
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,160
It's.

411
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:51,620
It's.

412
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,140
It's.

413
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:52,620
It's.

414
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:52,940


415
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,060
It's.

416
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,200
It's.

417
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,560
It's.

418
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:53,600
It's.

419
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,740
It's.

420
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,140
It's.

421
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,360
It's.

422
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:56,420
It's.

423
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:56,480
It's.

424
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,600
It's.

425
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:57,600


426
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:57,660
It's.

427
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,560
It's.

428
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:58,760
It's.

429
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,060
It's.

430
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,140
It's.

431
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,040
It's.

432
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,040


433
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,040


434
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,040


435
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,540
Yeah.

436
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:09,820
There.

437
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,700
Crap.

438
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,180


439
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,280
Good.

440
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,280


441
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:16,880
Yeah.

442
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,820
Yeah.

443
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,420
Yeah.

444
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:18,920
Yeah.

445
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,420
Yeah.

446
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah.

447
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,560
Yeah.

448
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:21,660
Yeah.

449
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,020
It's.

450
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,020


451
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,120
It's.

452
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:27,680
It's.

453
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,040


454
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,140
It's.

455
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,580
Ha ha ha!

456
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,160
You got the tickets to go!

457
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,700
Go baby, go!

458
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,560
It's like a machine.

459
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,520
A ticket dispensing machine.

460
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,000
Woo!

461
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,000


462
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,100
Get your tickets right here boys.

463
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,380
Step right up.

464
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,180
Get your tickets.

465
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,140
Get your tickets boys.

466
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,620
Right up!

467
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,600
Ha ha ha ha!

468
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,660
I didn't have to play TV!

469
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,280
But yeah, there's no microphones up there, so yeah.

470
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,240
No flute amplifications.

471
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,640
No flute amplifications.

472
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,260
We're missing some parts this X-Day.

473
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,180
Not just flute related.

474
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,060
The excess tight bits and pieces of us and the campground.

475
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,660
Just as the Native Americans always said.

476
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,880
Yeah, we never know what it's going to be from year to year.

477
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,080
Boy, my immune thing.

478
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,340
I hope they're having fun with my immune system.

479
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,060
I hope they're really having a ball with it on their damn Exos spaceships.

480
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,060
And my memory.

481
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,220
And my morals.

482
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,580
And my hair.

483
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,760
There must have been a real bald Exos stuff.

484
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,040
I wanted the whole top half of my head.

485
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,440
For his wig.

486
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,440
Those are trophies.

487
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,920
In their way of thinking.

488
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,760
They count coup on the humans.

489
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,520
They have the wall that has the predator trophy head.

490
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,240
The alien trophy head.

491
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,160
The human trophy head.

492
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:39,760
Right.

493
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,760
One of the ancient bobs trophy head.

494
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,440
And the bleeding head.

495
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,540
And all of the presidents.

496
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,720
Of the United States.

497
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,880
The hall of the presidential heads.

498
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:56,500
Yeah.

499
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:03,060
Didn't you say that you had the baby that Legume had?

500
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,060
Yeah, that's kind of a mystery.

501
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,960
I was trying to remember if I had.

502
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,120
I thought it was going in the subgenius museum.

503
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,140
I think maybe that's where it is.

504
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:20,280
That I left it in Texas because it was too dangerous to bring here again.

505
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,640
Well, yeah.

506
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,800
Because if it actually did reanimate, we'd all be in trouble.

507
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,100
Right.

508
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,860
It can be seen by appointment only.

509
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,880
You know, I had my second heart attack right here at this stage two years ago.

510
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,940
And it's been that whole muddled thing about May 7th.

511
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,960
Oh, yeah.

512
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,280
The May 7th movement.

513
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:38,660
Yeah.

514
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,400
It turned out the original date was a telephone number.

515
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,200
And the real thing was not 75 but 57.

516
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,820
Which would be better weather.

517
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,560
Depending on where you are.

518
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,100
Not always.

519
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,820
But then there was this hint that it was really supposed to be somewhere in the Antarctic.

520
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,600
So, on May 7th.

521
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,420
Which is much more temperate time in North America.

522
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,520
But down there it's...

523
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,700
The only creature that would show up there would be guar.

524
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,700
Yeah.

525
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,200
And you know it's a trick.

526
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,100
Oh, yeah. Of course.

527
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,840
On the ice shelf.

528
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,500
Boy, whatever happened to guar?

529
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,100
Old odorous got ruptured.

530
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,080
Yeah.

531
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,540
Oh, yeah.

532
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,620
Now the fella that used to play bass.

533
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,880
Beefcake?

534
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,420
Yeah, but it's not Beefcake.

535
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,460
It's the manager of Beefcake.

536
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,480
I actually knew three different Beefcakes.

537
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,300
Well, one of those Beefcakes is now their vocalist.

538
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,260
Well, it's Sexy Kushner retired.

539
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,240
Oh, yeah.

540
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,880
He was the sub-genius.

541
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,360
Yeah.

542
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,220
Yeah, I remember when he...

543
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,160
I married him.

544
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,820
Yes.

545
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,180
At Ground Zero in New York City.

546
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,260
Married one of the guar people.

547
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:55,740
Yep.

548
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,400
Sexy Kushner.

549
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,400
I like telling people you used to open up for guar.

550
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,320
His sister was really cute.

551
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:01,920
Yeah?

552
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,100
She was married though.

553
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:03,960
Oh, well.

554
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,960
She was big.

555
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,460
She was big.

556
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,120
Yeah.

557
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:14,820
I only heard about the fact that he was at X Day and somebody popped an earth...

558
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:15,800
Yeah.

559
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,800
Legume had made a globe filled with...

560
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:18,800


561
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,600
With fake blood.

562
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,240
Right.

563
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:25,180
And of all the people to get splattered with fake blood on his vacation...

564
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:25,460
Right.

565
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,320
Was one of the members of Guar.

566
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:33,740
He'd come here to get away from that and not wear the foam rubber suit and not get splattered

567
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,260
with blood.

568
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,760
Who gets splattered?

569
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,060
Him.

570
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:36,940
Yep.

571
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:44,200
By the same token, who got injured in the premature explosion and dynamiting of the

572
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,700
bleeding head of Arnold Palmer?

573
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,780
The one doctor at the camp.

574
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:48,780


575
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,820
Dr. Tillis.

576
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,280
Oh, geez.

577
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:51,980
Yes.

578
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,360
He took head shrapnel in his chest.

579
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,360
Oh, my God.

580
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,880
Shrapnel from the head in his chest.

581
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,340
Well, it was rubber.

582
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:00,700
It was foam rubber.

583
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,760
This wasn't a true bleeding head, obviously.

584
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,760
It wasn't actually really Arnold Palmer's head.

585
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,920
No, we wouldn't have been able to dynamite it.

586
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,460
It was the best replica we've ever had.

587
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,580
Right.

588
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,060
And it really was dynamited accidentally too soon.

589
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,640
And it went off too near him.

590
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,220
It was all...

591
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,620
Everything was thrown out of whack.

592
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:18,760
It was all...

593
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:18,760


594
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:18,760


595
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:18,760


596
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:18,760


597
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:18,760


598
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:18,760


599
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:18,760


600
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:18,760


601
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:18,760


602
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:18,760


603
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,160
I think it was a lot of work because my wife of that time, Reverend, someone else

604
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,960
insisted on doing a belly dance right then.

605
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,640
Oh.

606
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:31,160
And it was starting to rain and Leguim was going, we've got to shut off the head.

607
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,780
I was going, there's nothing I can do about this.

608
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,860
And I just had to watch it all on TV.

609
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,300
Right, right.

610
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,020
In real time.

611
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:42,800
Yeah.

612
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:43,780
Yes.

613
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,560
Speaking of Guards, Sleazy P. Martini has got his own show on...

614
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,060
Oh, yeah.

615
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,360
Oh, yeah.

616
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,020
Sleazy and Philo share airwaves on the book.

617
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,080
Yep.

618
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,120
And now my show is on ISO.

619
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,980
I didn't know that.

620
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,600
OSI 74.

621
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,200
Yes.

622
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:58,640
Oh.

623
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah.

624
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,220
Now, are you going to the Horror Host Convention?

625
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,660
Which one?

626
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,260
Well, I've heard...

627
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,220
I've been reading in Scary Monsters magazine...

628
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,820
It's not Monster Bash, is it?

629
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,740
Well, there's Monster Bash, but...

630
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,420
Is that a different one?

631
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,660
No, there is a Horror Host.

632
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,900
Yeah, there's a Horror Host Convention and there's some Sir Graveson.

633
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,840
Yeah, well, that's me.

634
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,880
That's what I thought.

635
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,640
Yeah, that's me.

636
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,540
But it...

637
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,640
I mean, that's not me.

638
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,980
That's somebody else.

639
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,620
Yeah.

640
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,980
Well, okay, but...

641
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,260
Someone with a slight Hungarian accent, sort of.

642
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,220
Could there be another Horror Host with...

643
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,800
There was Sir Graves Gasly.

644
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yes, that's what I was thinking.

645
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,220
No, there was Sir Graves Gasly, which was the Detroit horror movie host.

646
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,480
And I grew up watching him.

647
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,760
And then when...

648
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,760
Maybe that's the name that I saw on the list.

649
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,760
Well, because he's long dead.

650
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,500
Right.

651
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,160
But this was a Hall of Fame thing.

652
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,800
Oh, then that would be Sir Graves Gasly.

653
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,220
Horror Host Hall of Fame.

654
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:53,360
Right.

655
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,620
And so there was always the other...

656
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,260
There was like the Son of Ghoul and the Son of Ghoulardy, blah, blah, blah, and all that.

657
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,380
There was always the Son ofs.

658
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,520
And I didn't want to be the son of Sir Graves Gasly.

659
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,740
It just didn't sound right.

660
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,340
So that's why I came up with Sir Graveson.

661
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:07,860
Yeah.

662
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,100
I know.

663
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,680
Ghoulardy people, they're ghouls.

664
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:10,920
Yeah.

665
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:11,920
Ghouls.

666
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,020
Real ghouls.

667
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,200
Yeah.

668
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,880
The Detroit ghoul just died.

669
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,080
So, yeah.

670
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,800
Which he was also the...

671
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:18,740
Yeah.

672
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,480
The Cleveland ghoul.

673
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,360
Too cool for a ghoul school.

674
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:21,940
Yeah.

675
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,740
Philo and I both shared the Fort Worth horror host, Gorgon.

676
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,060
Oh, right.

677
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,560
You knew him.

678
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,900
Gorgon from Nightmare on Saturday nights at 7.30 and lively 11.

679
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,940
What you looking at, Channel 11?

680
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,000
Good looking.

681
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,960
It was the station owner.

682
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,720
Yeah.

683
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,060
He was also the horror host and the kiddie show host.

684
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,500
Right.

685
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,100
How often does that happen?

686
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,840
That seemed to be the thing that they used to do back then.

687
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,060
Yes.

688
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:58,680
It'd be like the weatherman from Channel 4 or whatever would, you know, he would go

689
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,400
on and do...

690
00:27:59,400 --> 00:27:59,820
Bill Camfield.

691
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,100
The great Bill Camfield.

692
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,680
He had a tragic personal life.

693
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,960
His wife had serious mental illness.

694
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,000
She was rich.

695
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,260
That's probably maybe how he ended up running that TV station.

696
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:15,820
Yeah.

697
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:22,460
She caused him great grief and terror in his real life.

698
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:28,440
And yet every day he put on that icky twerp fright wig and hat and entertained us kids

699
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,280
before the cartoons and Three Stooges.

700
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,840
What a thing.

701
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:42,320
Philo and I could easily perform the slam bang theater intro theme, but we will spare

702
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,380
you that for now.

703
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,240
Maybe later during the...

704
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,420
We should do that for Doctors for Wotan.

705
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,160
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

706
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,460
How long was the show?

707
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,600
We could do that.

708
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,240
How long did they keep the show going?

709
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,380
What was the time of the show?

710
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,800
Long, long time.

711
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,780
How many cartoons did they show?

712
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,620
I never thought I'd see any of those clips, but they're on YouTube.

713
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,240
They're kinescopes.

714
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,660
There's quite a few of them.

715
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,740
He was kind of a...

716
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,920
Might have been Ernie Kovacs.

717
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:21,340
Ernie Kovacs inspired a bit, because he did some fourth wall breaking and weird, kooky,

718
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,420
trippy things, all with a thick Texas accent.

719
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,220
There was a lot of...

720
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,300
I told you to shut up!

721
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,220
Gorgon, on the other hand, was...

722
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,780
He had those apes, the apes that go in and out.

723
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:44,900
Yeah, his pet apes were the cameramen who would lock the camera off, throw these ruby

724
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,660
rubber masks on, and then prance around in front of the camera.

725
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,720
Ajax and Delphinium, yeah.

726
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,480
Yeah, these are very important.

727
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,220
These are...

728
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,180
Every subgenius has these iconic local figures in their lives.

729
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:07,660
Look to your memories, and you'll see that there are these weirdos that may have served

730
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,700
as role models.

731
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,660
I remember well.

732
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,520
Oh yeah, without knowing it, maybe that crazy guy that sold the used cars late at night

733
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,800
on TV, maybe he's really one of your Shorterpersavs without you knowing it.

734
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,900
In a sense, it's always possible.

735
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,300
Of course.

736
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,240
What?

737
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,900
What are you doing out there?

738
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,920
Philo's doing...

739
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,680
Philo is doing sign language to me.

740
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,420
Yeah, sign language for...

741
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,780
For the differently hearing-able...

742
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,500
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

743
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,640
And now he's...

744
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,060
I love you?

745
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,860
Is that what you said?

746
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,840
I love you.

747
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,680
I love you.

748
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,400
Huh?

749
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,100
He's a palaver.

750
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,340
He's palaver.

751
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,900
More laughter?

752
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,020
Palaver.

753
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,500
Palaver.

754
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,340
Okay.

755
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,300
Dr. Drummond, why don't you get off your old tottering geyser butt and come up here?

756
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:53,820
Duff.

757
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,760
Good God.

758
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,720
What a slacker.

759
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,060
Oh, this is great, folks.

760
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,480
Dr. Philo Drummond is coming up.

761
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,160
The pink definition of slacker.

762
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:03,920
Yes.

763
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,360
The blazey.

764
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,720
Oh, those are some really nice pink Crocs you're wearing.

765
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,480
Thank you.

766
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
They're not Crocs.

767
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,200
They're Nikes.

768
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,120
Oh, those are Nikes.

769
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,480
I'm sorry.

770
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,860
Those are endangered species, you know.

771
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:12,880


772
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:12,880


773
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:12,880


774
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:12,880


775
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:12,880


776
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,340
But they are pink.

777
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,920
Here comes the feedback again.

778
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,880
They may be pink, but their money is green.

779
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,120
Philo's aura is already making everything sound real.

780
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,780
So, yeah, I wanted to talk to you about Sir Graveson's show.

781
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,280
Oh, yeah.

782
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,360
If you're interested in doing your own punch-ins and stuff.

783
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,000
Yeah, you're going to tell everybody on how to do that on the air?

784
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,380
No.

785
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:31,860
Okay, good.

786
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,280
Well, no, you wouldn't.

787
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,000
Reverend Stank forced me to come up here.

788
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,920
You were out there doing the hand gestures like you were trying to land a plane.

789
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,460
Yeah.

790
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,420
I was saying...

791
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,140
Philo gestures hypnotically.

792
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,060
It's me and you who talk big business later.

793
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,020
I'll have my guys call your guys.

794
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,180
Okay, I got you.

795
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,780
And now we have a bit of a blabber going on about...

796
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,160
That's not my imagination.

797
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,580
...the distortion of certain elements.

798
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,620
Yeah, so it sounded really bad before I ever got here.

799
00:31:59,640 --> 00:31:59,680
At an unacceptable level.

800
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,720
I could hear...

801
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,860
I was way down there at the other end of the...

802
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,560
Camp.

803
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,240
...at the very...

804
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,520
Almost imperceptible end of the camp where you can't even know it exists.

805
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,340
Yeah.

806
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,220
I was just looking from there and I was thinking, that sure sounds shitty and I'm not there to

807
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,320
be the cause of it.

808
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,580
That's what I thought when I was a long ways away.

809
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,520
Well, but it's your amp is what all of this is running through, Dr. Drummond.

810
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,020
So there's either that or nothing.

811
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,320
Your amp is the only conductor of this system.

812
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,600
I'm not even adjusting it.

813
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
I don't even know what's happened to it since I left.

814
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,340
But it did get worse as soon as you sat down.

815
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,840
It's gotta be...

816
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,700
My voice just brought the situation to the forefront.

817
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,120
Yeah.

818
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,120


819
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,120


820
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,380
It changes the bell curve.

821
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,360
It can't draft my mighty voice.

822
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,260
We do hear an unusual sequence of buzzes and hums.

823
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,980
That's why Abraham Lincoln couldn't do public addresses with a microphone.

824
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,860
Yeah, like the voice of steel.

825
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,760
Yeah, because his voice would blast out the microphone and completely overmodulate the

826
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,140
system.

827
00:32:59,280 --> 00:32:59,660
Exactly.

828
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,320
Yeah.

829
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:05,480
Yes, the recording in old Honest Abe's day was not up to our standards of today.

830
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:05,500
They had like a one watt system back then.

831
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,340
It ran through James Watt's one horsepower.

832
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,240
They stuck it in James Watt.

833
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,000
It was just...

834
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,100
It was just...

835
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,100


836
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,100


837
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,100


838
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,100


839
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,700
Reverend Watt.

840
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,620
Reverend Watt.

841
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,280
Half a watt goes in here.

842
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,320
Watt Default.

843
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:15,860
Yeah.

844
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,920
What was that you say?

845
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,480
It comes out here.

846
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,000
So, anyway, later on...

847
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,720
Yeah, we'll do that.

848
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:21,840
...we'll do that.

849
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,700
Because that's...

850
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,400
It's really...

851
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,140
It could be fun.

852
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,960
And if you want to do that...

853
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,400
It will be fun.

854
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,620
It'll be oodles of fun.

855
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,000
Subgenius TV on the Roku.

856
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,160
What I really want to do is...

857
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,020
Channel OSI 74.

858
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,920
If you have a Roku box, look it up.

859
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,080
You won't be sorry.

860
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,700
No, there's some terrible stuff on there.

861
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,080
CZP Martini's got a show on there.

862
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,080


863
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,080


864
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,080


865
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,080


866
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,080


867
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,080


868
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,240
And he will make you laugh.

869
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,720
You'll see what TV would be like if Subgeniuses took it over.

870
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,700
Everybody else's show.

871
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,500
Yeah, we got it made in the shade.

872
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,920
Someone replace me, please.

873
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,480
I'll go get my beers.

874
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,740
Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub.

875
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,340
Replace me.

876
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,000
Secret Stride number 274.

877
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:57,940
Uh-huh.

878
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,520
More louder.

879
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,380
This is how I get here.

880
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,920
You put the right channel on the right side and the left channel on the left side.

881
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,660
Great.

882
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,260
I got Stang's Ear Funk now.

883
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,440
This will be great.

884
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:10,960
Yes.

885
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,060
I'm going to put it on the left side.

886
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,060


887
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,060


888
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,060


889
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,060
You're not going to put your earphones on.

890
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah.

891
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,540
Your head phonics.

892
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,960
You'll get hooked on that.

893
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,900
Well, at least we got somebody intelligent on here, Dr. Hal's ears, for me to do something

894
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,180
with.

895
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:31,100
We're just going to get to the bottom of certain persistent X Day rumors that have been percolating

896
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:39,280
through the camp, bubbling up through the psychic substratum here at X Day 22.

897
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,620
Quick.

898
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,060
Get the text out.

899
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,540
I'm going to get the tarot cards.

900
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,400
I'm going to figure it out.

901
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,560
Do you have your cards read every now and then?

902
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,920
Do you have someone read your cards?

903
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,080
I did, but then they went blind.

904
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,760
Oh, well, you see.

905
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,440
It just did not work out well for them.

906
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,880
Which tarot was the one that was used?

907
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,000
It was Vinton and Old Relay and probably not the best idea.

908
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,320
You know, Cthulhu, Ketag and all that.

909
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,620
The Book of Thoth.

910
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,180
Oh.

911
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,720
All right.

912
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,020
As a preview of the Ask Dr. Hal show.

913
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,600
How's that?

914
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,900
Well, we're going to do that now.

915
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,300
Just a preview of the Ask Dr. Hal show, which I assume will be performed tomorrow, since

916
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,460
there seems to be little enthusiasm for enacting it today.

917
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:34,760
And right now, we have Reverend Joie de Vivre with her special question.

918
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,260
I'll do my best to answer it.

919
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,600
And that is, if you're interested, you can ask Dr. Hal.

920
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:39,960
I'll do my best to answer that.

921
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:39,960


922
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:39,960


923
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,680
But that's basically what the show is about, answering questions.

924
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,280
Of course in the show, classically, we have other people.

925
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,760
We have good people in the show.

926
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,800
So, here is, then, that question.

927
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,980
Thank you for your donation.

928
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:03,660
And the question appears to be, why are the Blue Ridge Mountains blue?

929
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,400
The Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, no doubt.

930
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,920
as noted in the famous song

931
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,400
heard in so many Laurel and Hardy movies and others.

932
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,380
So why do the mountains look blue?

933
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:26,180
Distant objects tend to because they are distant

934
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:31,820
and the shade of blue is dependent upon the distance involved.

935
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:38,680
The atmospheric haze confers blue on any distant object

936
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:44,520
as well as the sky itself.

937
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,060
So the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia

938
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,600
are most often observed from a distance

939
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:00,540
which renders this effect vigorous and live.

940
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,800
.

941
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:01,800


942
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,580
And thus they need not defend their name

943
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:11,040
from angry cartographers wishing to give them

944
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,580
the name of some trendy individual of the present time.

945
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,280
And here I thought it was just a bad case of blue balls.

946
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,680
The Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia?

947
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,400
Yeah, think about it.

948
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,060
They've been standing up there that hard for that long.

949
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,540
The blues just kind of traveled up the shaft

950
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:31,780
and that's it.

951
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,140
At that point.

952
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,220
Yes, they were larger and are being ground down

953
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:41,960
into tiny rocks, each one in its own way, they say.

954
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,040
A fractal portion of the giant mountain

955
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,240
that can be seen behind it,

956
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:53,180
rendered down into these essential chunks or chunklets.

957
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,500
One small pebble could be the result of it.

958
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,560
The entire continental system of massive,

959
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,440
geological upheaval worn down by counter forces.

960
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,540
It could have a terrifying pedigree.

961
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,780
No one could possibly guess at or understand.

962
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,880
Just some little rock under your foot.

963
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,280
How in the hell are you sitting there wearing a six-piece suit?

964
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:29,700
That's not precisely correct, but you see...

965
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,320
I just realized,

966
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,340
I have pockets about me containing various objects.

967
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,820
I prefer to have...

968
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:37,700
Gloves.

969
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,500
I'm being asked now why I'm wearing pants.

970
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,160
You know, it's been said that in the new world,

971
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,100
we won't need pants.

972
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,540
And I understand the stubborn consistency

973
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,760
of this eternal principle.

974
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,360
You just gotta find a way to stop the chafing first.

975
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,520
Yes.

976
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:05,040
Well, remember, there are many things out here at X-Day,

977
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,080
and I'm specifically speaking of ticks,

978
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,660
which may be anxious to gain an intimate acquaintance with you,

979
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,000
and if the way for them is easy,

980
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,620
that acquaintance may come sooner than later.

981
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:26,580
All these crawling arachnids find a human heat signature

982
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,500
as the human passes beneath them,

983
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:29,840
and they'll be able to be seen in the tree

984
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,900
where the creature is waiting,

985
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,280
and then they drop down,

986
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,260
and being so small,

987
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,380
one usually doesn't even notice them,

988
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,100
until later one finds them partly buried in the skin

989
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,420
and partially engorged with the blood of you,

990
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,960
its human host.

991
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,540
Furthermore, these here ticks give you Lyme disease

992
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,060
and all sorts of other delicious flavors.

993
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,320
Yes.

994
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,500
And now all the listeners can hear you.

995
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,080
They can feel that itchy, crawling sensation on their scalp

996
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,600
as the ticks slowly set themselves in.

997
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,840
They are not insects, but small arachnids,

998
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:17,340
and looking at them closely reveals the standard arachnid anatomy.

999
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,720
But these are little blood-sucking spiders

1000
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,540
that are after your vital juices,

1001
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,100
and to contaminate them with disease,

1002
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,480
and it could be their own fault,

1003
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,360
and it could be their own fault,

1004
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,400
and it could be their own fault,

1005
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,980
as does the kissing bug,

1006
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,560
the terror of the Southwest,

1007
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,460
that bug that creeps on you at night

1008
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,140
and scrapes off your skin

1009
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,800
and laps some of your blood,

1010
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,260
but also manages to get its feces into the wound,

1011
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,640
which festers and becomes the breeding ground

1012
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,040
for Chagas disease,

1013
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,480
an endemic condition found in the American South,

1014
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,100
Southwest, and Northern Mexico.

1015
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,220
The Sonoran Desert bioregion

1016
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,920
is home to these large insects,

1017
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,500
which bestow their kiss at night

1018
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,100
while one is asleep and helpless.

1019
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,720
I also brought to X-Day a special scorpion light,

1020
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,240
since I happen to have one.

1021
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,200
When you shine it at the ground,

1022
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,420
every scorpion that you hit with it

1023
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,680
will fluoresce like a neon sign.

1024
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,500
It's the most intriguing sight.

1025
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,980
And who would guess that there were so many scorpions around?

1026
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,460
The scorpion light makes this very plain.

1027
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,040
It is an ultraviolet light,

1028
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,980
which shouldn't be looked at directly.

1029
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,400
I just brought a finger death light.

1030
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,740
I put it on the end of my finger,

1031
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,540
and it just blinds everybody I point at.

1032
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,580
Temporarily?

1033
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,580
No.

1034
00:41:59,340 --> 00:41:59,740
Permanently?

1035
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,220
Yep.

1036
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,140
Uh-huh.

1037
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,000
Ooh, that spiked.

1038
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,320
Yeah, I found out before,

1039
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,520
I thought it would be a nice little E.T.

1040
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,300
I thought it would be a nice little E.T. light there.

1041
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,840
You know, like phoning home.

1042
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,100
Yes.

1043
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,200
And blinded the whole campground.

1044
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,660
That's why we couldn't find the saucers.

1045
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,520
We couldn't see them coming.

1046
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:23,260
Again, something about the incompatibility of phones and phone systems.

1047
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,560
I am very impatient when this is offered as the excuse for everything

1048
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,180
that doesn't exist.

1049
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,940
It happened, or could have happened, but it did not happen.

1050
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,580
Are these phones of such central importance

1051
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:42,180
that they can be charged and credited with the operation of our affairs?

1052
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,360
Even our special festivals and meetings?

1053
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,780
Nay, let it never be so said.

1054
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:58,820
I know not what course others may take, but as for me, the KISSY app is the...

1055
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:03,260
only indignity I have been forced to bow the knee to.

1056
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,120
Oh, you're now on the dating apps there, Dr. Howell?

1057
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,380
No, in order to do my podcast in San Francisco,

1058
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,600
I have to get into the building of the Impact Arts Hub there,

1059
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,460
which is so new, so modern,

1060
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,120
that the only way you can get in is by taking out your phone

1061
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,660
and downloading an app called the KISSY app.

1062
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,540
And when it works, the door clicks and admits you

1063
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,140
to the building.

1064
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,020
But when it doesn't work, you're out there in the rain

1065
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:36,580
with your bags of radio stuff, with homeless people screaming at you,

1066
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,680
and for some reason, the KISSY app is just not working.

1067
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,560
It's collecting information, or you touch it,

1068
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,700
but it doesn't respond the way it should.

1069
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,140
And so it is.

1070
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,460
And just to get into that building, I had to purchase a cell phone.

1071
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,240
Well, it made you buy it, too?

1072
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,520
Well, how else can I...

1073
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,420
Well, to do it, I have to have a special phone

1074
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,500
that has the KISSY app installed, and so I do.

1075
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,700
I just figured they'd give you the phone for free

1076
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,920
to have you on the station again.

1077
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,340
Oh, no, they don't give anything away.

1078
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,980
In fact, we have to pay them station dues

1079
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,140
in order to continue with that enterprise.

1080
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,640
So, I can't remember, did you get up

1081
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,940
and head out for the parade ground this morning?

1082
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:26,760
Oh, yeah.

1083
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,660
Of course.

1084
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,420
You bought me like me.

1085
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:33,800
I got up into the sky and waited for the descent of the saucer.

1086
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,980
Of course, it could be that the saucers will burrow up through the ground,

1087
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,840
but that would be something entirely unexpected.

1088
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,820
Sting's just always hoping for that hollow earth kind of theory, I think.

1089
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,280
He wants it to be in the ground.

1090
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,100
He just wants to be in the ground early.

1091
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,860
But even if they are underground,

1092
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,580
they have to come out through some convenient hole or opening

1093
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:58,300
that they control not to crash.

1094
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:02,120
They have to crash through the soil in some unseemly fashion.

1095
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,180
That would show that everything we were taught

1096
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:10,260
was extremely skewed somewhere and distorted.

1097
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,580
Yeah, that's about right.

1098
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,420
And the protocols of Bob were many and varied.

1099
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,400
And Sting brings beer to the people on stage.

1100
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:26,700
Some were allowed to swim in the ocean,

1101
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,000
and they grew strong.

1102
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,640
Some were not sinuous like their brethren the fish.

1103
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,100
Others tasted various artisanal beers

1104
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,400
and drank sample after sample.

1105
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,340
Their heads rang with the bubbles of good cheer.

1106
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:48,240
The horizon sloped and dipped alarmingly,

1107
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,400
and a staggeringly good time was held by all.

1108
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,720
Meanwhile, Reverend Lord Angry Larry

1109
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,520
brought in a tempting selection of beers.

1110
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:58,520


1111
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,600
And the

1112
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,540
audience was amazed.

1113
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,280
The audience was amazed.

1114
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,060
The audience was amazed.

1115
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,160
I just came to check out this big dickhead.

1116
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,800
Yes, it's still here.

1117
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,240
And that's for the Bulldada auction.

1118
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:26,820
This huge dickhead is one of the things that's going to be sold.

1119
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,580
Oh, no, I've seen bigger.

1120
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:27,820
So?

1121
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,080
Well, it's certainly of an exceptional size.

1122
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,240
And if it's going to be offered,

1123
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:41,180
I'm sure there will be much interested competition for it.

1124
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,540
Philo's already coughing on it.

1125
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,380
It's not the cough that carries you off.

1126
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,580
It's the coughing that carries you off.

1127
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,500
And yack, yack, yack, yack, yack.

1128
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,200
Well, let's see.

1129
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,540
We've...

1130
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,880
Also got action happening on the stage tonight.

1131
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,580
The main stage, isn't that correct?

1132
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,220
Because there's no rampaging thunderstorm

1133
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:10,220
as predicted a few days ago by the weather pages.

1134
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:10,960
Yeah.

1135
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,980
We got theoretical stuff happening.

1136
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,880
We'll see if actually it turns out.

1137
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,060
We're supposed to have rants and jams all night tonight.

1138
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,340
And some good guitar playing up there on the fiery stage.

1139
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,020
Yes, good guitar playing.

1140
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,400
Uh-huh.

1141
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,500
Sadly, air quotes do not translate.

1142
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,900
They can't transmit over sound very well.

1143
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,520
No.

1144
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,320
Well, it's a good thing.

1145
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:38,560
Because that gives some backbone and culture to this event.

1146
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,440
We're already cultured enough.

1147
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,520
It's steamy and moist.

1148
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,040
So we won't go too far.

1149
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,700
Now to get to the bait.

1150
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:11,700


1151
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:11,700


1152
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,500
Keep playing.

1153
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,400
Keep playing.

1154
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,400
Keep playing.

1155
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,620
Keep playing.

1156
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,000
Keep playing.

1157
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:22,380
Keep playing.

1158
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,820
Keep playing.

1159
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,740
Thank you.

1160
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:02,420
Thank you.

1161
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:37,420
Thank you.

1162
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,460
Thank you.

1163
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,420
Thank you.

1164
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,060
Thank you.

1165
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,040
Thank you.

1166
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,560
Thank you.

1167
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,120

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:00,900
Thank you.

Thank you.

1185
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:08,060
and Niji, which is the yoga of the gods, and the trickster. He is my true son and finger,

1186
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:12,560
who I'll split into the same, so metal from the surface of my hands, as I irritate them

1187
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:19,840
to suit me. I don't just need a hamburger, I need the hell out of it. She is a harlot

1188
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:27,200
and a fornicator. My kingdom is on the earth, not that I want it. A good deal is in the

1189
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:33,040
wallet of the beholder. Know ye this, knowledge of earth, pagan of the moon, is not a disarm.

1190
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:38,480
Extremism is a defense against the great order of patriarchy. Through my discipline, nine

1191
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:44,600
armies can triumph. The harlot will bribe thee with the rams of time, but the harnessing

1192
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:50,500
of it is unclean and shall lead to perdition. The divine king will be killed in the plaza

1193
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:55,680
by his own clowns. Darkness will fall. The Philistines will raid you.

If you act stupid, them three children will come indeed, with their pistols, and their

1195
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:06,160
minds and their tools shall be all stirred up together. The image will be made flesh,

1196
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:11,680
and thy dreams will be found over the head. The voice of the prophets shall be listened

1197
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:17,080
from their bowels, and they may witness the sound of their eyes. You may not know what

1198
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:21,440
you're really thinking, but that sign shall ye know them, and they shall command the source

1199
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,340
of all knowledge, which is like unto a book of the score. Knowledge grows everywhere,

1200
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,200
and they shall receive the sacrament from the angels, of light which preserves the

1201
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:37,260
rights in heaven. The chariots of the earth shall reign and will rise well in the place,

1202
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:42,300
while the number is still. I always lie, and I'm always right.

1203
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,860
My name shall spread there on the earth, and my name shall be known. Everything comes

1204
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,740
apart, and I'm not a man. I shall not be a man, but I shall be a woman.

1205
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:54,640
They are strong, but they are not men.

1206
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,260
I am a man, and I am a woman.
