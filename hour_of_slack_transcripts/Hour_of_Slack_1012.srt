00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
From PR News in Washington, I'm plotting to start a solar-powered PR training camp in Oregon.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,140
President Bush will not solve the nation's energy problems, but he says

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,420
the Energy Policy Act is going to help every American to expand.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,740
The U.N.'s watch agency has confirmed that PR News has restarted conversion activities,

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,700
a step that the U.S. and the European Union have warned would lead them to seek PR News in Washington.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,500
What is a drug?

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,560
A drug. Hallucinogens, such as LSD and psilocybin, mushrooms, cause

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,820
the self-genius power of slush.

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:44,820
Stimulants, such as amphetamine, cocaine, MDMA, ecstasy, speed up or overstimulate

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,960
the self-genius power of slush.

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,640
Did the person make an unusual action or statement?

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,420
Did the subject...

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Say anything about...

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,000
BAH! BAH!!!

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,040
Detective deleted the chronic user for up to 30 days

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,860
Pretty FCCk!!!

17
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,500

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,260
mı judgmentaliz kindly

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:14,260


20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,480


21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,480


22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,480


23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,060
So friends, I have not yet answered the question, what is the church of the subgenius?

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,540
And it's a difficult question to answer because basically it is an answer that didn't wait around for a question.

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,800
It's never straight up and down.

26
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,680
It's never straight up and down.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,500
It's never straight up and down.

28
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,800
It's never straight up and down.

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,740
It's never straight up and down.

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,300
Wiggly whale, wiggly whale.

31
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,880
Oh God, I want to live a little wiggly whale.

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,280
Wiggly whale, wiggly whale.

33
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,200
Now it can be told, friends, we're all defo.

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,400
This particular episode of this show, number 1012 of Hour of Slack,

35
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:52,600
will replace drugs by devolving your mind down far enough to make you almost normal.

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,480
Which for a subgenius...

37
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,280
is really, really messed up.

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,620
Sort of like being high but stupider.

39
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,460
Praise Bob!

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,160
And I feel sorry for anybody who's listening to this show on their car radios.

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:15,640
When you start hearing the druggishly disorienting files of Leemur, Norrell, Phineas, and others.

42
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,240
That would all be bad enough.

43
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,500
But also, Devo was in town and there was a devotional.

44
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,580
The annual celebration of...

45
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,940
De-evolution held in Akron.

46
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:34,900
For which our friend Reverend Toth Wilder helped produce this Devo cover album called

47
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,640
Not Necessarily Beautiful, But Mutated.

48
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,700
Number five, in fact, that is just great.

49
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,560
It makes you feel high.

50
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,340
In fact, this whole show will do that.

51
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,380
So let's go into that theme for tonight.

52
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,340
Which is De-evolution.

53
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,420
Through drugs...

54
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,040
disease...

55
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,500
pills...

56
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,960
and Bob.

57
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,940
And next week we'll be covering sex.

58
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,180
This is what the Leemur was really after.

59
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,460
And it rubs the chemical cocktail all over its body.

60
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,300
The toxins are a powerful insect repellent.

61
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,220
But they're also a narcotic.

62
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,780
And the Leemur gets more and more spaced out the more it rubs.

63
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,480
It's time to...

64
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,840
Downright drug abuse.

65
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,860
Black Leemurs are millipede junkies.

66
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,540
Always on the lookout for their next multi-legged fix.

67
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,020
This behavior is definitely bad for them.

68
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,480
But it seems that the benefits of the insecticide outweigh the risks.

69
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,300
So it's actually an imaginative use of another animal.

70
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,860
And there's little apparent harm to the Leemur's millipede neighbor.

71
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,580
So let's go.

72
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,840
Hi, this is Cosmoby.

73
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:08,640
We want amphetamines, cocaine, depressants, barbiturates, opiates, alcohol, tobacco, hallucinogens.

74
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,680
We want the downers and the uppers.

75
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,460
Better take a downer, take an upper.

76
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,180
Pills get high.

77
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,300
Downers.

78
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,080
Oh, isn't that much better?

79
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,940
My Pills.

80
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,740
ů

81
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,340
time we're havin', havin'.

82
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:52,500
H saint Haqq.

83
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,140
This is the boy who burns the books

84
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,420
This is the way he always looks

85
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,840
This is the boy who smashed his car

86
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,160
This is the boy who went too far

87
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,600
Washed his eyes with yellow soap

88
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,540
He stole his daddy's microscope

89
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,140
All alone or in the crowd

90
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,160
Never say his name aloud

91
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,180
Now he wants to know your unit's name

92
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,820
Where you go and where you came

93
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,020
He's a mecha-mania boy

94
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,460
This is the boy who'll never go slow

95
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,700
He is the one who destroys his young

96
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,960
Everybody got a new way to go

97
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,860
All alone or on the telephone

98
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,460
He knows the time you spent at home

99
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,700
Now he's saying he's a millionth old

100
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,880
Watch his hands over his daddy's face

101
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,040
He put himself in an altered state

102
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,120
Now he's a millionth old

103
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,120


104
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,120


105
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,120


106
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,340
In a crowd or all alone

107
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,360
No one's laughing anymore

108
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,420
Now he wants to know your unit's name

109
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,100
Where you go and where you came

110
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,280
He's a mecha-mania boy

111
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,680
All alone or in the crowd

112
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,720
Never say his name aloud

113
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Now he wants to know your unit's name

114
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,360
Where you go and where you came

115
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,520
He's a mecha-mania boy

116
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,900
In a crowd or all alone

117
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,920
No one's laughing anymore

118
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,980
Now he wants to know your unit's name

119
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,640
Where you go and where you came

120
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,820
He's a mecha-mania boy

121
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,220
All alone or in the crowd

122
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,260
Never say his name aloud

123
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,260
Now he wants to know your unit's name

124
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,960
He's a mecha-mania boy

125
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,760
He's a mecha-mania boy

126
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,360
He's a mecha-mania boy

127
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,060
He's a mecha-mania boy

128
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,780
He's a mecha-mania boy

129
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,980
He's a mecha-mania boy

130
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,480
Occupant did that song

131
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,800
Mecha-mania boy

132
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,280
Originally by Devo

133
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,000
From the Devo cover collection

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,120
Not necessarily because of the

135
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:59,920
Beautiful But Mutated, and you can contact Occupant at www.synthlabs.com.

136
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,600
Before that and after this, cut-up cut-outs by Lemur and Norel Preff.

137
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,460
But first, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

138
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:46,960
Pills in the day and pills in the night, yeah, pills, pills, talking about pills, pills, pills for the bad and pills for the good, pills for the young and misunderstood, yeah, pills, pills, talking about pills, pills.

139
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,000
Pills in my head.

140
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,940
Pills in my socks.

141
00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:18,200
Pills in the woods and pills on the rocks, yeah, pills, pills, talking about pills, pills, pills for the young and things to do, pills are better friends than you, yeah, pills, pills, talking about pills now, pills.

142
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,120
My friends the pills.

143
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:20,360
Pills.

144
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,720
Oh, just give me some of them pills.

145
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,340
Pills.

146
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,680
Oh, give me those pills, Bob.

147
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,400
Can we have some pills over here, please?

148
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,460
Here, have some pills.

149
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,040
Pills.

150
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,660
Take some more of these pills.

151
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,700
I just think you should be taking all those pills in the morning.

152
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Can I have some pills, please, from my heart?

153
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:35,860
More pills.

154
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,480
And that's just the sort of thing I was talking about exactly, gentlemen.

155
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:47,080
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the secret Reverend Bleepo Abernathy speaking to you over the airwaves of your local radio station there.

156
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,140
First of all, I want to say that.

157
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,540
Uh.

158
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,420
None of the pills are ever good enough, as you all know.

159
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:59,620
And as you're out there, out there, you know, you cannot, you cannot feel anything without some sort of pill.

160
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,460
Now, that pill could be, of course, you know, your average, you know, vitamin or dexatrim or something like that.

161
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,480
Or it can be Jesus.

162
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,040
It's any kind of pill that you mention at all.

163
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,920
We don't want to get too specific here, but let's just face it, friends.

164
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,340
You're all looking for a pill.

165
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,700
We're not talking quart of pills.

166
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,020
We're talking a bucket of pills.

167
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,580
Which is sometimes.

168
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,660
We're not talking barrels.

169
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,880
Some people relate to half an old-fashioned bathtub full of pills.

170
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,320
Like, sometimes, I don't know how much quarts of pills go for in Dallas right now.

171
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:36,760
But I think in New York, you can get about a half a handful of pills for what, like, a pint of pills might cost you in Austin or Chicago.

172
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,840
They've been smuggled in by the Tibetan llamas, which have been working for Bob for centuries.

173
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,000
I heard they put them on the bellies of sea turtles at one point.

174
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,940
They put them in the Atlantic.

175
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,560
They put them on seven-year voyage.

176
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,700
They put them on your tongue.

177
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,560
They put them on.

178
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,620
Ah-ha-ha.

179
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,040
Get your nail infection.

180
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,620
Get your discolored or flaky nails.

181
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,560
Get your live infection.

182
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,420
Get your kidney problems.

183
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,620
Get your serious side effects.

184
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,720
Get your serious skin reactions.

185
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,280
Get your diarrhea.

186
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,620
Ask your doctor about indigestion and rash from the liver or serious diarrhea.

187
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,320
Get your pills.

188
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,520
Now, what about things that you...

189
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,940
sniff up in your nose?

190
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,700
Oh, cocaine.

191
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,080
Right.

192
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,820
It goes in the membrane.

193
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,500
Feel high.

194
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,900
Snort it and sniff it.

195
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,820
Cocaine is good.

196
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,820
Why don't you take this and just sniff a little bit?

197
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,420
Feel good.

198
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,120
Thank you.

199
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,200
Getting high is important.

200
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,500
For some people, it's even more important.

201
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,040
Now, what do you do?

202
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,660
Well, if your doctor eliminates notice, you should power fresh.

203
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,220
Yes.

204
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,320
Yes.

205
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,540
Yes.

206
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,160
Without Bob.

207
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,080
Without Bob.

208
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,140
I was never...

209
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,780
I was an addict for nine years.

210
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,340
All for what?

211
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:56,900
For drugs.

212
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,100
I went eight times to jail.

213
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,060
I thought I was gonna be an addict, a dope fiend, a junkie.

214
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,760
But I heard about...

215
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:04,920
Bob.

216
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,800
I went to him.

217
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,260
Kneeling down, I gave myself to him.

218
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,020
Right now at this moment.

219
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,260
And I tell you he did...

220
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,660
because he's in me...

221
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,680
and he drills in me.

222
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,580
Yes.

223
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:18,900
Bob.

224
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,220
Bob yes

225
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:19,980
Bob yes

226
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,660
Bob yes

227
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,780
Bob yes

228
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,040
Me?

229
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,820
Disease

230
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,980
I thought it was just disease

231
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,180
I thought it was just that doctor

232
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,360
He had damaged the lining of my esophagus

233
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,560
He prescribed the motions of my esophagus

234
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,780
Said I needed serious stomach conditions

235
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,220
And headache, diarrhea, and abdominal pain

236
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,800
My esophagus needed my esophagus

237
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,180
Talk about pills

238
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,040
I'm feeling kind of nervous

239
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,820
Got a painful yellow headache

240
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,800
Got a painful yellow headache

241
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,700
Every page I see on the paper

242
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,240
You turn real

243
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,820
You turn real

244
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,560
And they scream out my instructions

245
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,660
Too real

246
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,100
Too real

247
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,000
Cold sweat on my t-shirt

248
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,760
Shaking in my boots

249
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,100
The pressure of brain alarm

250
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,800
Sets off the waves of nauseous pain

251
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,440
I am here

252
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,220
In the back of my head

253
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,800
There's a voice that never stops

254
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,140
Got a swelling itchy brain

255
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,180
And I need to go to work

256
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,260
Sending it in my head

257
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,760
Got a swelling itchy brain

258
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,240
And I feel like a deadless torture

259
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,940
Grinding out all of my thoughts

260
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,340
I'm between a heartbeat

261
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,340
And a teenager of youth

262
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,080
And the faces don't stop laughing

263
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,180
A swelling itchy brain

264
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,480
And I can't stop my abstraction

265
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,360
Swelling itching brain

266
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,700
Swelling itching brain

267
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,800
Swelling itchy brain

268
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,200
Swelling into brain, swelling into brain

269
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,920
Do the people not just pressure?

270
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,480
They control my energy and emotion

271
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,800
And a voice in the back of my head

272
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,980
Every single month is a day of old trash

273
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,220
Swelling into brain, swelling into brain

274
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,320
Over 20,000 people get sick from you

275
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:52,000
Swelling into brain, swelling into brain

276
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,520
Swelling into brain, swelling into brain

277
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:54,680
Swelling into brain, swelling into brain

278
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,500
Can you smell my extraction?

279
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,780
Do the people not just pressure?

280
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,160
Swelling into brain, swelling into brain

281
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,240
They control my energy and emotion

282
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,200
And a voice in the back of my head

283
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,200
Every single month is a day of old trash

284
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,040
Swelling into brain, swelling into brain

285
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,280
Brothers like a bad boy in black shoes

286
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,360
Brothers like a bad boy have nothing to use

287
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,920
Swelling into brain, swelling into brain

288
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,460
The pressure pad a lot

289
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,700
It's all the waves of nauseous pain

290
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,300
Too real

291
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,680
Swelling into brain, swelling into brain

292
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,860
Swelling into brain, swelling into brain

293
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,180
The thing in my head

294
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,560
We'll be right back.

298
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,600
Yes.

299
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,880
And friends, for this show, I pulled out an old rant from an ancient hour of slack

300
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,160
done when I was so young that Reagan was president

301
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,700
and we didn't even know how to pronounce espresso.

302
00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:10,140
Swelling Itching Brain by Gadgeto.com.

303
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,460
I wanted a whole bottle of heroin to be about three bucks

304
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,840
or you could go down to a heroin den and sit and shoot up with all your shooting buddies

305
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,340
until about 2 a.m.

306
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,140
Then you'd get on the expressway and drive home.

307
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,580
Or, for that matter, folks, in the heroin world,

308
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,300
where imagine that the authority is making heroin so much a part of their business world

309
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,400
that nobody closed a big business deal

310
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,160
without having to pay for it.

311
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,800
And a few shots of smack with the client.

312
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,140
When there'd be billboards all over the roads for the coolest brands of heroin

313
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,420
showing beautiful models, skin popping next to a waterfall.

314
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,640
And on TV, well, not only would there be all these ads

315
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,260
showing your favorite sports heroes shooting their favorite brand of heroin,

316
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,140
but in any party scene, any scene of any TV show

317
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,340
where people were shown relaxing or having a good time,

318
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,960
well, they're always taking a...

319
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,080
just a few little sniffs of smack.

320
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,540
Now, the leaders of a world like that would have to be pretty insane, right?

321
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,640
I mean, it'd be obvious that the leaders themselves were not only heroin users

322
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,420
but stood to gain quite a bit from the whole population

323
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,040
aside from a few anti-heroin fanatics

324
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,600
leaning on this substance to relax.

325
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,220
But let's take it a step further, friends.

326
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,680
Imagine if these people made coffee illegal.

327
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,060
Because they said it was addicting.

328
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,020
And it led to harder stuff like espresso.

329
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,920
But yet, untold millions of people had been drinking coffee for thousands of years

330
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,860
and no one had ever OD'd.

331
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,960
You drink it, and it sharpens you up a bit, and then later you crash a bit.

332
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,620
But it was... it's so illegal that the smugglers are getting fantastically rich

333
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,660
having contraband coffee beans flown up from South America.

334
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,440
And there'd be this whole subculture of bean heads.

335
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,260
People that were into coffee, and partly as a rebellion against the establishment,

336
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,760
and the whole reason that coffee led to harder stuff like

337
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,940
espresso or NyQuil was because to buy a coffee

338
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,340
you had to go to a coffee dealers house, a pusher's house.

339
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,200
Where you'd encounter people who were expresso users.

340
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,300
And on top of that, a one-ounce bag of coffee beans

341
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,780
would cost like a hundred bucks, just for ordinary, Maxwell House grade.

342
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,660
And people'd be arrested

343
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,900
and spend their whole lives in jail,

344
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,680
maybe even be executed for using coffee,

345
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,460
which is relatively harmless,

346
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,000
while this whole planet of junkies was going scot-free.

347
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,900
And President Reagan would be up,

348
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,920
you'd see him in the news at, you know,

349
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,060
partying with world leaders,

350
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,880
all of them snorting a bit of smack and shooting up.

351
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,900
Imagine what a horrible, topsy-turvy world that would be, friends,

352
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,620
where they made a powerful central nervous system depressant

353
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,460
not only legal, but glamorous,

354
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,740
while an organically grown, harmless bean off of a bush

355
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,880
could wreck your life only because of the laws against it.

356
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,640
I demand a sovereignty test.

357
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,080
That does it. Go like yourself, bud.

358
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,200
I demand a sovereignty test,

359
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,520
because I ain't been drinking.

360
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,380
The farmer, he got plowed.

361
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
The bricklayer got plastered.

362
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,860
The mechanic, he got tanked.

363
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,540
And the construction worker got blasted.

364
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,400
And daddy beat up mommy

365
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,120
and broke her collarbone for good luck.

366
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,600
And daddy beat up mommy

367
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,280
and broke her collarbone for good luck.

368
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,400
And everybody's drunk.

369
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,140
And everybody's wasted.

370
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,420
And everybody's drinking on the job.

371
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,800
The garbage man got trashed.

372
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,700
The janitor got messy.

373
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,500
The taxi driver got smashed.

374
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,200
And the waitress, she got,

375
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,300
she got tipsy.

376
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,160
In Kansas City, New York City,

377
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,260
Great big city, itty bitty city now.

378
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,300
Everybody's drunk.

379
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,120
And everybody's wasted.

380
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,340
And everybody's drinking on the job.

381
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,980
Well, there's a whole lot of places that I ain't been.

382
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:08,580
Well, there's a whole lot of places that I ain't been.

383
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,400
A whole lot of things that I ain't seen.

384
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,820
A whole lot of things I'll never be.

385
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,620
The generation that would change the world

386
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,840
is still looking for its car keys.

387
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:38,000
The generation that would change the world is still looking for its car keys.

388
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:47,060
The generation that would change the world is still looking for its car keys.

389
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,420
The terrorists got bombed.

390
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,420
The president got hit.

391
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,940
Security was tight.

392
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,560
Yeah, the Secret Service got me.

393
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:15,940
The FBI, CIA, DWI, USA.

394
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,160
Everybody's drunk.

395
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,900
And everybody's wasted.

396
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,240
And everybody's stoned.

397
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,260
And there's nothing that's gonna change it.

398
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,280
Cause everybody's drunk.

399
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,080
And everybody's wasted.

400
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,420
And everybody's drinking on the job.

401
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:54,440
I got it wanking on you.

402
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,580
You know, we were gonna have a saxophone play to our band.

403
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,040
But every word up we found was all tooted up.

404
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,140
Stomp down last night, let me off the hook.

405
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,040
You know we were gonna have a saxophone play to our band.

406
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,040


407
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,040


408
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,040


409
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,060
See, nobody's wasted, everybody's Team Blue now.

410
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,180
Somebody said, Dr. Drummond, are you going to smoke frop up there?

411
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,920
I said, I just don't know.

412
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,660
I can't tell you right now.

413
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,880
It just depends on how I feel at the time.

414
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,520
An honest answer.

415
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,940
I just don't know.

416
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,580
Well, we want you to profit by our example

417
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:34,420
and indulge the inner being whenever possible.

418
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,340
And as many times as you deem necessary.

419
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,640
I am completely aware of what chemistry and drugs can do

420
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,400
to assist and aid the body and mind.

421
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,440
Yet I don't really believe that what has happened to me

422
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,620
comes strictly from chemistry.

423
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,060
There must be an explanation for this phenomenon.

424
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,240
I don't believe it.

425
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,680
Thank you.

426
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,540
Thank you.

427
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,160
Thank you.

428
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,540
Thank you.

429
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,180
Thank you.

430
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,080
Thank you.

431
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,420
Thank you.

432
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,920
Thank you.

433
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,480
Going Under

434
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,700
by Steve-O-Matic

435
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,320
Destiny

436
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:39,960
And you can find more of that at steve-o-matic-destiny.com.

437
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,420
Before that, the Psychoskeletons.

438
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,820
Before that, that song, Drinking on the Job, is by The Rainmakers.

439
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,980
I did it. I admit it.

440
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,000
You're right. I bite the big one.

441
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,180
I'm crude and I'm awful.

442
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,460
I'm a pantload and a snootful and I stink.

443
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,100
And I'm lousy, I'm creepy, and I'm blousy.

444
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:17,220
I'm a Nazi and a commie and a homo and a lesbian and a tidal wave bedwetter.

445
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,300
And I don't care if I get better.

446
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,460
Cause I'm wearing leather panties to the old folks' home on Christmas.

447
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,420
And a t-shirt that says, I buggered Big Bird.

448
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,160
And a Santa hat and nothing else. Screw em.

449
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,380
And I do em like Puerto Rican skanks.

450
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,400
Cause I'm inferior to even Alabama whiners.

451
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,820
And I do the Edwardian earwig probe on the blind.

452
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,260
And I snap wet towels on your goodies.

453
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,020
And I soak em in your liquor first, you stupid hippie.

454
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,160
Cause I'm a snippy cruise director and a drunken Rosicrucian.

455
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,360
And I act like a giant chicken at funerals of people I didn't even know.

456
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,820
Just to sicken the relatives.

457
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,760
And throw a sack of garbage in the grave as I yell,

458
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,040
You owed me twenty dollars, you bastard!

459
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,860
I'm a dastardly crap sack and three quarters.

460
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,200
I fart at airlocks just for starters.

461
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,400
I screwed the movie.

462
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,600
I pooch and I diddle your cat.

463
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,920
I'm bald and stupid and way too fat.

464
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,980
I sprinkled ants in the punch bowl.

465
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,520
And squirted WD-40 in the onion dip.

466
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,300
I'm a twelve hour vacation drive with screaming kids.

467
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,840
I throw my poo at monkeys at the zoo.

468
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
And I whizzed on your guitar strings.

469
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
And I poured coke into your keyboard.

470
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,960
I gave Mama Cass that damn sandwich.

471
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,820
I sent your wife that latex arm for her birthday.

472
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,740
I paid your bills with photocopied money.

473
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,520
Just to watch you squirm.

474
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,400
Threw my binoculars when the feds came to kick your ugly booty.

475
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,220
I put super glue in your granny's brassiere and K-Y jelly on her dentures.

476
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,980
I put ball bearings in your hubcaps so you think your wheels are gonna fall off.

477
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,840
And I bought the nails for the crucifixion.

478
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:55,340
And I put leopard bikini briefs on the statue of Jesus at St. Patty's.

479
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,840
Figure out how, you cow.

480
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,880
And I goosed Mother Superior.

481
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,220
And went, wugga wugga wugga, moo, big girl.

482
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:02,720
And I went, wugga wugga wugga, moo, big girl.

483
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,780
And I put the vodka in baby Leroy's orange juice.

484
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,460
And I throw bubble gum and chicken legs in the dryers at the laundromat.

485
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,100
And I'm a 24-karat liar when I say everything I just said is true.

486
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,180
So Crisco, up to the elbow for you.

487
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,460
And thank you kindly, dumbass.

488
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,640
The End

489
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,500
Hell Pope Huey, friends.

490
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:45,320
You know, what Bob did for Hell Pope Huey, he can do for you.

491
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:50,820
Bob can turn an ugly caterpillar into a beautiful swan.

492
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:58,140
And a perfectly normal healthy individual into a great political or military leader better than irreversible brain damage.

493
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,680
CINEMATIC SCENE

494
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,520
A hell of a fix.

495
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
It is a fact.

496
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,100
This world is in a hell of a fix.

497
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,380
A hell of a fix.

498
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,800
Four can't cope without.

499
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,600
Now reveal your flakiness and redness.

500
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,380
Cholesterol only comes from footlong Grandpa Frank.

501
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,180
Your cholesterol only comes from food.

502
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,520
Ask your doctor about bad foods, increasing your risk of getting liver problems.

503
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,680
That's healthy pain or weakness.

504
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,240
He said, do you have any attention dystrophy?

505
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,200
Aspirin?

506
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,760
Can't disease?

507
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,400
I hope.

508
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:47,820
Heart sir?

509
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,040
Multiple reflux?

510
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,360
Fibro-pression disorder?

511
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,280
Diarrhea?

512
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,480
Fibias?

513
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,180
Multiple scolodyspis?

514
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
Wrong, but right.

515
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,380
I know you.

516
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:57,720
You're me?

517
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,580
You're sitting there.

518
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,880
Fat, failure, weight, infections, till tuberculosis?

519
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:01,520
Don't.

520
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,240
Infection, infection, infections, till you can't.

521
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,160
Fatal infections, not tuberculosis.

522
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,040
Don't.

523
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,120
Serious allergic nervous blood disorders.

524
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:09,680
Don't.

525
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,220
Not.

526
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:10,860
Do it.

527
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,940
Serious system disorders.

528
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,980
Sometimes fatal.

529
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,820
Do it.

530
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,460
Gone.

531
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,100
You.

532
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,340
Me?

533
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,820
You, you imbecile.

534
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,540
You bloated idiot.

535
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
You stupid fathead.

536
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:24,940
You.

537
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,000
Whatever.

538
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,580
Just fine.

539
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,840
Seriously.

540
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:36,840


541
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,860
Welcome.

542
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,700
I smell stucky.

543
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:52,540
َ

544
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,260
here. Hey, everybody, I pee freely.

545
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,840
From PR News in Washington, I'm being honored as a suitcase full of oil, natural gas and

546
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,940
electricity and heavy books. Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez never finished high school,

547
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:18,320
but he usually traveled with a uranium conversion plant. On Wall Street, 221055134, the U.N.'s

548
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,500
dog agency will meet in emergency session to decide whether to refer the matter to PR

549
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,460
News in Washington.

550
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:33,720
Lemur did that, friends. That's from the CDR called Lemur Oggs. Before that, Lemur

551
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:40,020
cut-ups galore, plus some movie clips sent in by Reverend Jacques Petty. And now begins

552
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:46,080
the mind-bending psychedelic part of our show, and I hope you aren't driving for this.

553
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:54,520
Meditation tapings. Greetings. Here's a tape for your court order.

554
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,240
Meditation.

555
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,700
Tape error.

556
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,840
Tape, tape, error, error, error, error.

557
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,360
Tape, tape, error, tape, tape, error, tape, tape, tape, error.

558
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:17,920
No matter what shape your stomach's in, acid, it's the best on any stomach.

559
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,440
Brings runny nose, watery eyes. Take Vistan.

560
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,040
Take Alka-Seltzer.

561
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:23,940
Irritation.

562
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,440
Yes.

563
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,360
Just remember.

564
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,620
Get certified lead. Get certified lead. And you get it.

565
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,780
Creamy body with less creamy, creamy, creamy body.

566
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,880
But it works out to a lot of coke. Tired of it.

567
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,100
Coke after coke after coke. Coke after coke after coke.

568
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,980
Coke after coke after coke. Coke after coke after coke.

569
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,360
Commonplace occurrences of day-to-day living.

570
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,220
Commonplace occurrences of day-to-day living.

571
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,740
Coke 45. Malt liquor.

572
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,020
Believe it or not.

573
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,540
But is it really art?

574
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:56,920
Greasy.

575
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,260
New disease.

576
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,980
Take, take, take, take, take.

577
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,560
Take it all now. Take it all now.

578
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,220
The flavor is. Come the flavor is. Come.

579
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,100
Proud pickle.

580
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,080
What's going on?

581
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:19,640
Oh!

582
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,120
Oh!

583
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,120


584
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:28,720
Oh!

585
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:28,720


586
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,120
Ha!

587
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,140
Ha!

588
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,460
Ha!

589
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:30,720
Ha!

590
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:30,900
Ha!

591
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:31,840
Ha!

592
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:31,900
Ha!

593
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:32,200


594
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:32,440
Ha!

595
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:32,560
Ha!

596
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:32,880
Ha!

597
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,340
Ha!

598
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:33,340


599
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:33,340


600
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,100
Oh, they, oh, they, oh, they, oh, they, oh, they!

601
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,220
Hyrums, hyrums!

602
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,220
Frisky, frisky, frisky, frisky!

603
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,060
Ah!

604
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,040
Ah!

605
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,900
Who is my captain?

606
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,260
He's a wonderful girl.

607
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:52,940
Ah!

608
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,420
Ah!

609
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,240
Don't you want to buy some verich Auf?

610
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:56,640
Yeah!

611
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,960
Yeah!

612
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,680
Yeah!

613
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,500
Yeah!

614
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,420
Get a TV set!

615
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,100
Get a TV set!

616
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,880
Get a TV set!

617
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,660
Get a TV set!

618
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:28,420
Tipper close. Put on. Tipper close. Tipper close. Hello, Johnny.

619
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,940
Who's there? Johnny. Johnny.

620
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,360
Who's there? John Smith, I believe. That's right. Who are you?

621
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,680
Put on. Tipper close. This ain't no joke.

622
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,420
Great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great.

623
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,580
Crazy. The whole world's gone crazy if you ask me.

624
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,140
As I was saying, we were talking about this country.

625
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,520
These United States of America. A bunch of hooligans.

626
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,860
You're found in fathers. Riff rat. Riff rat.

627
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,040
Today. Well, I haven't made up my mind yet.

628
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,600
But why keep a cow when milk's so cheap, huh?

629
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,040
Now, don't talk like that, Johnny. Well, I haven't made up my mind yet.

630
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,580
Young people who believe think, where is it today? Where is it today?

631
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,180
Do you need a garden? Garden? Give me a whistle, okay?

632
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:22,200
Yes. So the life. Yes. So the life.

633
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,280
Maybe you can do it alone. Harden. Harden.

634
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,100
Gag. Right. Right. Wait just a minute, John.

635
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,600
Blow and down below. Human rights over property rights.

636
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,480
I mean free speech, including the right of descent and human rights over property rights.

637
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,440
During your society. Ordinary people. The riots, the burning, the looting.

638
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,740
Gonna make an omelet? You're gonna break a few eggs. No, John. The right of descent.

639
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,120
The right of descent.

640
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:50,760
The right of descent.

641
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,460
John. John. John. John.

642
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,280
That should be more shooting than looting.

643
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,040
Bombs. And killing.

644
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,640
Filthy. Filthy. Filthy. Filthy. Filthy. Filthy books and magazines and filthy movies.

645
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,740
The fast buck. Free sex.

646
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,180
Hey, let's shack up, baby.

647
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,340
Give me a whistle, okay? Come on, get off it, John.

648
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,400
He's every inch of the man you thought he was.

649
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,480
It's only a question of time before it's legalized.

650
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,680
This is a nation that's in serious trouble.

651
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,180
Oh, and America wants to be loved, not war.

652
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,780
Oh, wow. Well, so who doesn't?

653
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,780
But they still want high wages that go along with wartime jobs.

654
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,800
And all the while, the national debt's going up and up and up and up.

655
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,680
And you want to cop out and leave it as a legacy to our generation to pay for it.

656
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,180
Broken head.

657
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,180
Baby, we are the new revolutionaries.

658
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,740
This person brought in a string of Christmas tree lights.

659
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,160
And the lights were different colors, and they would flash and blink on the screen.

660
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,240
And the lights would go on and off randomly.

661
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,820
The whole thing was just blinking on and off.

662
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,460
But the person didn't lay them out in any organized order.

663
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,800
He just had them clumped over his arm.

664
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,120
It was this big cluster of this string of lights.

665
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,580
And we in the audience looked at it for a while.

666
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,700
Not much happened. It was just random firing.

667
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,360
And then he turned on some music.

668
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,600
And first he put on a piece by Beethoven.

669
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,180
And within a very short period of time, within a minute,

670
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,140
the music had this magical effect.

671
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,160
It organized the lights, and they started forming a pattern.

672
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,160
In fact, they were in complete concordance with the music.

673
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:29,600
They formed the pattern of blinking that was in the same tempo as the music,

674
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,440
and went with the nuances of the music.

675
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,000
It was sort of amazing.

676
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:38,620
But then he switched off that music, and he put on a piece by John Coltrane,

677
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,000
a piece of modern jazz, my favorite.

678
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,820
And within another short period of time, in less than a minute,

679
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,140
the lights became reorganized.

680
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,740
And he reorganized again, and started going to the tempo of the new music,

681
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,440
and showing the nuances of the new music.

682
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,140
Isn't that amazing how sound can actually reorganize light?

683
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,280
Actually, it didn't happen, as you realize.

684
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,740
It wasn't that anything changed in the lights.

685
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,420
It was inside. It was in our minds.

686
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,240
And what happened for me happened for everybody else there, too.

687
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,000
We reorganized our thinking,

688
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,980
because when we saw this jumbled mess, this random pattern,

689
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,760
I would argue we don't like that.

690
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,460
We don't like confusion as humans.

691
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,440
And even when we're not trying to, even when we're unconscious of it,

692
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,920
we tend to organize our world.

693
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,600
And that's what we did. Our minds did it automatically.

694
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,140
Looking for patterns. Constantly looking for patterns.

695
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,580
So that's handy. Since we have that tendency anyway,

696
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,660
it makes sense that we're going to develop theories.

697
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,720
Now, I want to give you a test at this point.

698
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,560
You're thinking, oh, darn. I didn't want to have a test on the first day of class.

699
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,640
But here it is.

700
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:54,960
Lab liner

701
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,960
Lab liner

702
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,520
Thank you.

703
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,100
Thank you.

704
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,380
Thank you.

705
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,340
Thank you.

706
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,200
Thank you.

707
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,740
Thank you.

708
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,480
Thank you.

709
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,680
Thank you.

710
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,660
Thank you.

711
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:57,900
Thank you.

712
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,980
Thank you.

713
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,640
Thank you.

714
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,760
Thank you.

715
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,120
Thank you.

716
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,180
Thank you.

717
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,820
Everybody wants a good thing

718
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,920
Everybody, ain't it true that

719
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,120
Everybody's looking for the same thing

720
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,680
Ain't it true, just no doubt

721
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,800
There may be some things that you can do without

722
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,800
And that's good

723
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,360
Everybody's just like you, it's true

724
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:13,500
Everybody wants a good thing too

725
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,020
Now it's time to break the hand

726
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:26,000
For everybody who can understand

727
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,520
Life could be without a bunch

728
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,480
It's going great till you get stuck

729
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,660
But it's not, forget to count

730
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,820
Everyone who might have missed the boat

731
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:42,000
And to everybody else who waits

732
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,480
Till the end of the world

733
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,940
And next we sail in again

734
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:59,620
Everybody

735
00:53:59,620 --> 00:53:59,640
Everybody

736
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,020

737
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:02,540

00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:11,940


741
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,220
Everybody, what's used in this hand

742
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,840
Din destroyed it

743
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,500
It's something you can приб Logan

744
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:17,980
Everybody

745
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:19,860
Anybody

746
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,660
Anybody

747
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,500

00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,180
Pull theache

749
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,240
Everybody

750
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,900
Everybody

751
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:25,900


752
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:25,900


753
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:25,900


754
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:25,900


755
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:25,900


756
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:26,900
It's something mutual

757
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,920
Ain't it true, it's a monumental good thing

758
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,040
Everybody, it's a good thing

759
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,320
Ain't it true, it's a monumental good thing

Partially produced by our old friend

764
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,800
Reverend Toth Wilder of Akron

765
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,300
A true subgenius master, friends

766
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,780
And in fact, this song by the Rainmakers

767
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:00,780
We dedicate to Reverend Toth Wilder

768
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,460
Dreaming in my sleep

769
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:23,280
About the people that I love

770
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:23,420
And the people that I meet

771
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,060
Everyone that's got

772
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:29,280
A ticket to ride

773
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,380
Everyone was there

774
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,300
Everyone aware

775
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,560
The angels and the devils are out on the town

776
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,080
We rocked the house last night

777
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,200
Well, we don't know where we're going

778
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,240
And we won't till we arrive

779
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,720
Anything can happen

780
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,040
When the world's still alive

781
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,780
Turn me on to your wildest side

782
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,040
Turn me on to your wildest side

783

Turn me on to your wildest side

784
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,100
Back when we were young

785
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,560
Green and open eyed

786
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,020
You were the queen of everything

787
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,860
My love for you bona fide

788
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,560
For a journey is a destination

789
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:33,240
We're taking a trip through time

790
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,820
We'll see the world

791
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,240
We'll see the flesh together

792
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,920
We can be home by suppertime

Here's a sign

821
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,380
By the will of God

822
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:21,420
We've ever been

Son觉得

824
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:22,080
Perhaps the best

825

00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:58,560
Friends, this background music is by Magis Cyclops. It's a song called Mark Mother's Bob is God. And praise also Bob, and praise Lee Murr.

833
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:09,940
More than a hundred years ago, the United States Postal Service had to make a trip to the post office to pick up and send their mail.

834
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:13,040
So mail often went unsent and undelivered.

835
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:13,480
Delivered?
