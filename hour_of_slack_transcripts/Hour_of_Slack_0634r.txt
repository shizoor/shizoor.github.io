This is Doug Smith, radio operator.
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.
Yeah.
Anyway, we create special effects with an Ultimac color tone brainwave synthesizer.
You may have been reading about those lately.
They're illegal.
They trigger a total physical separation by stem cleavage of the left and right brains.
That's cerebral mitosis to you science fans.
Creating a forebrain-hindbrain sync lock, if you can dig on that.
And that's the whole reason for this show to exist.
This is a brain disconnection show which operates on a simple new break-thinking principle
by which your brainwave patterns are gradually forced into resynchronization
with this tape's underlying messages and instructions.
So...
What? Oh!
A bug of noise whizzing past your ears.
Okay, that's what we do.
Let's take the old cotton wad that comes with this station and clean it out.
Incautiously.
You did get a cotton wad with your station?
The subgenius.
Hour of Slack.
It's the recombination of its own devices.
Its history is only itself.
It doesn't touch the ground.
It is simply an endless recycling of what it has already done.
A kind of tedious...
rehearsal of its own problems.
Ready?!
Gotta go, guys.
That's Rory.
Here we go!
And...
the redistribution.

and
For lo, I stood in the empty desert places,
and I looked into the distance,
and I saw the whirlwind coming upon me,
and I gazed upon the whirlwind,
and I saw Bob,
and I heard the face of Bob speak,
and he spoke to me from the whirlwind,
and he said,
You dumbass, get out of the way.
There's a whirlwind coming.
Oh, thank you for the advice,
Sister Friday Jones,
Irreverent Friday Jones,
friends, and the other reason
for this tape to exist
is to get you saved
by July 5th, 1998,
this year, X Day,
the end of the world
for those who have not been saved in Bob.
And we are so very, very busy
here at Dallas Subgenius Church Headquarters
planning logistics
for the huge Subgenius
main X Day gathering
in Sherman, New York,
this July.
Now, X Day, of course, friends,
happens worldwide,
all over this vast, diseased planet.
Subgeniuses, dues-paying subgeniuses,
will be ruptured up and saved.
But all the doctors shall migrate
before this happens
to this campground in Sherman, New York,
far western rural New York.
It's a campground called Brushwood.
Friends, I'm going to give you information
on how to get there,
how to make it to the X Day event.
Subgenius.com
or on the World Wide Web,
there's information on how to get there.
You can get information
at www.subgenius.com
or you can send,
for free information,
send a self-addressed stamped envelope
to Bob at Post Office Box 140306
Dallas, Texas 75214.
We'll give all that information again
at the end of the broadcast
because, friends, this week
we're playing tapes
from the X Day drills
that we held in Brushwood
there in 1996 and 97.
Practice for the end.
And we're at the end of the world
where our whole cult membership
got together
to prepare for this great event.
And, friends, we'll be playing
some recent updates
from Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
But first,
well, actually second,
I have a very special
DeVival recording, friends.
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy
and Einstein's Secret Orchestra
at Winterstar.
It's a touching and amazing DeVival
and a good introduction
at the same time
to those new to Bob.
So be prepared, friends.
Be prepared.

July 5th, 1998.
It was a...
Oh, yeah!
7 a.m. in the morning.
What's a 3-D day?
July 5th, 1998.
7 a.m.
The world shall shudder.
Praise God!
I'm a subgenius for you!
If we pray hard enough,
God will take care of everything.
Jehovah's Lord may have something in mind,
starting with Fred,
and building up to the Peaks,
and then probably the rest of us.
The only thing standing in between us
and Jehovah's Lord squashing us
with the Peaks and the humans
is that man J.R. Bob Dogg.
And the only thing that's keeping
J.R. Bob Dogg
motivated is your fight,
your trust in that man Bob.
And you won.
All right.
Anyway.
Okay, so some of you may be wondering
what Bob is.
I'm going to give you a little primer
for those of you who don't know
who exactly J.R. Bob Dogg is.
J.R. Bob Dogg is the saint of sales.
You may recognize his face
that you see in that book
on that chair behind you, young man,
in the green.
Can you hold up that book, please, sir?
That's the face, the book on the chair.
Yeah, there we go.
That's Bob's face, see, there.
That's the face of Bob.
And he's the man who's going to bring us slack.
He's the man who's going to bring,
he's going to bring the slack back,
which you've been lacking,
because he's made a deal
with the people from Planet X
that basically on X-Day,
which is actually only Jeepers,
that's only,
my notes, my notes.
I think it's 127 days away.
Yes, it's 127 days away.
I had to roll up notes here.
And Bob is your friend, kids.
He's made the deal with the people from Planet X
that we're going to come and destroy the planet
or the normals,
and he's going to take the subgeniuses away
in the pleasure ships,
in the pleasure dimensions,
where, you know,
they will find themselves
with the sex gods and goddesses
in a state of eternal ecstasy and slack.
And slack is basically,

in a nutshell,
the thing that the teachers
were always trying to take away from you
in school
when they said,
wipe that smile off your face.
You know,
that was a time that you perhaps
had some of the rogue subgenius genes
inside you
and that the teachers
and the conspiracy needed,
felt threatened by you
because they know that indeed
the subgenius church
is a threat to them
whether they realize it or not.
And, you know,
they've been just trying to take away
your slack ever since day one,
but Bob is here to give you
your slack back.
Yes?
Yes.
His image is very,
very hard to find now,
as you may have noticed.
In these last days
before X-Day,
July 5th, 1998,
as predicted by J.R. Bob Dobbs
back in 1954,
I believe,
originally.
In these final days,
Bob's image is becoming
rarer and rarer,
although there was sort of
a peak of Bob consciousness
when you sort of saw his face
in lots of places.
He's a benign,
smiling guy with a pipe
and a male model,
sort of role model
for Ward Cleaver kind of guy,
always there with a pipe
and some good advice
for, you know,
junior,

So, all right.
Well, that's my bad primer
for the Church of the Subjects
and sort of what it is.
If you have any more questions,
please feel free to ask me
after this particular presentation.
Thank you, Jasmine.
Oh, I must mention
Einstein's Secret Orchestra
backing up yours truly.
We can call it
the Lonesome Star Cowboys.
The Lonesome Star Cowboys,
a.k.a. the Lonesome Star Cowboys
behind me today.
We haven't even got warmed up.
Why are you leaving?
Jeez.
Just know it.
Slam the door.
Slam the door.
Why don't you?
They don't know
what they're missing.
All right.
First of all,
now that we're here
and we're all assembled here,
I know it's been kind of crazy.
It's been kind of hectic
setting things up.
And I've been wanting
to just sort of
cool things down for a minute
and just prepare ourselves.
And of course,
they want us to be quiet
next door,
so I just wanted
to kind of bring things down
so all of us
can get prepared
for another day of sacredness.







So,

All right.
Praise God.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Sorry, I hope we're not
disturbing you too much today.
Thanks, Tori.
Okay.
Now, I want to take you
on a little guided meditation,
friends.
I want you to close
your eyes now.
And I want you to get
into a comfortable position.
Put your both feet
on the floor.
Close both eyes.
And feel your feet
on the floor, friends.
Feel your feet
on the floor.
And feel your soul
and intestines,
the very part of you
that is you.
Get in touch with that
that is inside yourself
that is the deepest
part of yourself.
I want you to go inside
and find that center.
Now, I want you to send
that center down,
down through your chest,
down through your torso,
down your legs,
your knees,
your ankles.
Send it down
through your feet.
Down into the carpet.
Down into the floor
beneath the carpet.
And now we're going to go
down further, friends.
We're going to go down further
and further through the cement
foundation of the building.
Down underneath into the dirt,
into the crust of the earth.
Down, down further.
Into the mantle that surrounds
the core of the earth.
And then into that
about 45 foot high space
that no one knows about officially
but yet many churches
have warned us about.
Yep, it's about 45 feet high
from ceiling to floor.
It's that place down there
that they've told you is hell,
friends.
Yes, friends.
It's just as you pictured it
in Catholic high school.
There are devils down there.
There's little men
with pitchforks and demons.
Tortured souls crying out
in eternal agony.
There's pain, friends.
There's suffering.
There's people up to their knees
and poo-poo.
There's people up to their chests
and poo-poo.
There's people who are just
drowning in poo-poo
for all eternity.
You look around you, friends,
you see the caverns of hell
and the stalactites
and the stalagmites as pictured
by all the great classic artists.
I'm dying.


And as you look around you
in this place,
you notice far off in the distance
there are buildings and trees.
And you look further in the distance
and now you can guide your body astrally,
or your soul body astrally,
off towards these buildings.
And you notice they look familiar.
You realize that as you look around this place,
it's a place you recognize.
My God, it's Cleveland.
My God.
It's Cleveland.
Or else it's Decatur, Illinois.
It's wherever you come from.
It's your hometown.
It's where you live.
It's where you work.
And my friends, you can open your eyes
because you now realize that you are in hell.
Yes, friends, this is hell on earth.
I have just guided you back to the place where you are
and you thought that you went below.
And in a way, you are below.
Because where we are now,
this is the hell of normality.
Friends.
And I'm sorry, I'm not trying to bum you out
or bring you down,
but this is where the conspiracy wants you to be.
And we're in a special part of hell.
We're in a kind of happy part of hell
this time in Winter Star.
It's a place where, you know,
we can sort of forget about our everyday troubles
and forget about our everyday cares
and let ourselves relax and forget for a minute
that we are really, truly living in hell!
Hell, I tell you!
You may be wondering what is happening now
on planet hell in these last few days.
These last 127 days before X-Day, July 5th, 1998.
You may wonder what Bob, the Saint of Sales,
is up to right now, friends.
I'll tell you, I got a communication recently
from some higher-ups in the church,
even though they never return my calls.
But I got some psychic communications from them.
I understand that Bob is now in negotiations.
Yes?
Bob is basically making the final deal
with the people from Planet X.
He is signing the contracts,
they're signing their part of the contracts,
and they're arranging it so that all the souls of the normals
will be basically fried when they come down.
And all the sub-demons will be, you know...
So the final part of the deal is being made right now.
And this relates to what's happened recently
in the Mideast.
And it relates to what's been happening, you know,
in other places.
Bob has basically been engineering this whole Iraq war thing
that you've heard so much about.
And it's the state of the world now.
It's only 127 days till X-Day, friends.
But, you know, I never thought that we would really see this day.
I always sort of thought that I would see, you know,
the end of the world maybe a little bit sooner
because of the whole nuclear menace
that was hanging over our heads for so many years.
So did you ever think that you would look around,
and see things the way they are now?
Did you ever think that we would make it this far?
Did you ever think that X-Day would really only be 127 days away?
Did you ever?
Did you ever?
Gosh, babe, I never saw anything like that before.
Did you? Did you? Did you? Did you?
Never.
Did you? Did you?
Did you ever see a dream walkin'?
Well, I didn't.
Did you ever hear a dream talk?
Well, I did.
Did you ever have a dream thrill you with?
Will you be mine?
Always so fine, and so, so divine.
Did you ever see a dream dancing?
Well, I did.
Did you ever see a dream romancing?
Well, I did.
Did you ever see heaven right in your arms,
saying, I love you, I do?
Well, the dream that was monkin' and the dream that was talkin',
the heaven in my arms was you.
Gosh, that's lovely.
Did you ever see a dream romancing?
Well, I did.
Did you ever see heaven right in your arms,
saying, I love you, I do?
Well, the dream that was walkin' and the dream that was talkin',
And I got everything by heart, it was you
It's a fact, sorry, I just can't get around it
But you know, that's the thing
See, now you people can appreciate the classics
I was at a Marilyn Manson party the other night
And I saw all these 25-year-olds standing around
All these 25-year-old MTV producers
And they were all waiting, pushing into line
Trying to get in to see Marilyn Manson
And I was like, yeah, sir
And they all thought they were so fucking cool
Because they've stolen all the cool ideas
That we in the Church of the Subgenius first gave them
We the true geeks
Yes, if you're a geek, if you're an outcast
The Church of the Subgenius is your church friend
Exactly, exactly
Those damn MTV producers, they're out there
They're like all these guys, they're like 24 years old
And they have a much better collection of 1950s Betty Page pinups
Than like your
You know, like your
My friend has been collecting them since 1952
These freaking 25-year-old kids
It makes me sick, you know
I mean, they're out here
They're drinking their cappuccinos at Starbucks
They all think they're so damn cool
Ha ha ha ha ha
Yep, when they come down
When the people from Planet X come down
And start wiping out all the humans
Like we want to kill a dog
That had been hit by a car on the side of the road
You just want to shoot it through the head
And its leg is broken
That's going to be their attitude towards the human race
And that's what they're going to do
These 25-year-old MTV producers
They're going to see
Yep
I mean, a friend of mine was telling me about
The Hanford Nuclear Plant
And how awful it is
This guy has gone in
I'm not going to name names here
But this guy has gone in
And he's looked around these nuclear facilities
He was part of a huge research project
That was into finding out just how fucked up
These nuclear facilities are
And he noticed it
They're like a hundred times more fucked up
Than you can ever imagine
Like for instance the Hanford Nuclear Power Plant
Nuclear waste dumping ground
Is what it is
They have these huge tanks of nuclear waste
And they spontaneously boil
They give off hydrogen and nuclear stuff
And you can sort of vent the hydrogen
Supposedly safely
The nuclear stuff safely
But the problem is
It's still glowing
It's still going
And it's going to blow up
And they think they got it under control usually
But they can't even get close enough
To measure how much of it it is
If they even bring their instruments within range
To measure how bad the nuclear radiation is
In these, coming out of these tanks
Like the instruments fuse
They melt
They cannot, this is true
And so they figure
They can't quite figure it out
They've done some calculations
They can't quite figure out whether it would be
Four thousand times
Or four hundred thousand times
Worse than Chernobyl
If this thing were to boil over
And the chances of this thing boiling over are great
So it's just somewhere between four thousand
And four hundred thousand times
Worse than Chernobyl
And that's in our own country
If this thing's enclave them like this
It's pretty bad
But I'm proud to be accepting this
Because I know
That I'll be taken away
On those pleasure ships
The pleasure dimension
We'll board the ships
On July 5th
The little knave
And the goldies
We'll board the ships
On July 5th



Like a little slave
Or fall out of the blue
And fate steps in
And sees you through
Yes, fate steps in
And sees you through
When you wish
Because Bob abandoned you
And sold you to fate
For seven hundred and fifty dollars
Dream comes
But at least he didn't sell you to
The Grim Reader
That is the dream
Or old Splitfoot
I never wanted to be sold
I wanted to be
A creature of comfort
Like a lord or a duke
I always worked hard
And if the universe was fair, Dave
That's what would have happened
If the universe was fair
I'd be a duke right now
The universe is unfair
And very extreme about it
Yeah
It's a rotten world
It's a horrible life
Your dreams
In fact they are
Our dreams
In fact
Our dreams
Our dreams came true, Dave
Our dreams came true
I'm a sandwich
I'm a sandwich
I'm a sandwich
You, Dave
Do they ever forget
Or forgive the whippings
And the harsh, strict words of command?
I wonder
I wonder
How can you forget or forgive
Those over and above you?
Those tall, silly dictators
Those haters
Those parents
There are a number of workshops
One of them on sadomasochism
That was billed as safe, sane
And consensual sadomasochism
An alternative way of loving
Mommy
Daddy
Where are you?
Peek-a-boo
Ah!
What in the world is a state university
Devoted to higher learning
Doing, demonstrating
Lesbian and homosexual techniques
And things related to perverse behavior
Music
Music
Music
Music
As the final project in this art class
She and two other women
Performed live sex in front of the class
Music
You even have a proliferation of courses involving witchcraft
There is a witchcraft movement in the United States
One of the things they accomplished by having witchcraft courses
Is to say that witchcraft is an equivalent religion
To any other major religions like Christianity or Judaism or anything else

The genius that right now can be seen in our young people,
the people that have promiscuity!
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow,
why, oh, why can't I?
Why, oh, why can't I?
The absurdity of it all is just so entertaining to us up here.
Even though you do have to feel the pain,
at least think of all the joy that it gives to everyone else.
Millions and millions of people in different worlds are excited by my sufferings.
You're a martyr like Jesus or some other idiot, Gandhi.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

You guys was all like a piece of lemon pie waiting to be sucked up by everybody,
and they did it.
They were like a cookie.
They hardly existed.
They did their stuff, and then they ate it up.
You're like Mother Teresa, a selfless, a giver, surrounded by takers.
Consuming our own secret sexual desires.
Women who have sent their daughters off to universities
have been shocked to discover that they come back with lesbian lovers.
I love you.
An age when that'sjachs Destroyed.
Who's this, Dave?
Look.
The vision.

Woo-hoo!
There's a little ditty now that Chaz Smith wrote.
And I want to do this sort of as a round.
Like a summer camp round.
I want to teach you.
The chorus is very simple.
And, uh, Chaz, why don't you give us our song?
Chaz, Chaz, is this on?
Yep, it's on.
Okay.
I get up every morning.
My life's in a jar.
I drive very far.
In my big fancy car.
I have a big fancy car.


I hear about the world, but it all passes me by.
I haven't the time.
What can one person try?
I come home every night.
And keep my eyes to the floor.
I go around the floor.
Just never hearing a sound.
I walk down the street.
And keep my eyes to the ground.
I go round and round.
Like a sad little clown.
And at the end of my life.
I finally see.
The world and my dreams.
Where it all was a dream.






And they see.
I get it now.
I see.
It's sort of like you're standing on the mountains of the moon.
And like you're looking out through space and across space.
That beautiful little planet.
That beautiful big blue ball.
Just sitting there suspended.
There's no strings holding it up.
And there it is surrounded by a blackness that's blacker than black.
And it's just sitting there like a jewel.
In the night.
And it's the most beautiful place you ever saw.
And you look at it and you think to yourself.
Gee.
All the people that I ever met.
All the places that I ever visited.
All the books that ever were written.
And all the songs that have ever been sung.
And all the great thoughts that have ever been thunk.
It all took place there.
That little beautiful sparkling place.
And as it rotates.
You see.
Africa.
The place where all life began.
And humanity took its first little stumbling steps.
Think to yourself.
Gee.
You know.
It looks the same now as it did then.
You can't tell if there's all this pollution and all this screwed up stuff going down.
It looks just the same as it always has.
And you think to yourself.
Wow.
You know.
I don't know how long your lane cracked.
No.
But I don't get how to tell you anymore.
I feel like ten to twelve days have passed since you think you're alive.
And you go, you know.
I tell myself three, four, several days—
It's hard.
This isn't over yet.
So.
But.
There sort of thing is that it's over already.


And the bottom of whole, this entire earth is just a ashes brass pile of dust.
And the bottom—
audience members up to testify.
If they have found slacklessness in their job or their personal life, I'd like you to
come here and tell the Reverend Lebo Arvin at the old about it, and I will try to heal
or sicken you as is appropriate.
And also, anybody who wants a short-duration marriage, I'm offering a short-duration marriage
to any person or object or animal that you desire, and it can be for whatever length
of time you desire it to be for.
So, anyone want to come up for either short-duration marriages, healing, sickenings, testifying?
You two folks, come on up.
Come on up.
Now, are you folks ready to be married?
For two minutes.
For two minutes?
Two minutes.
Two minutes.
The husband finds out I'm dead meat, so.
Yeah, yeah.
All right, so what's your name?
Bill.
Bill, and what's your name?
Hale O'Conney.
Okay, so do you, Reverend Bill and Reverend Hale O'Conney, do you accept each other for
better or worse, or for worse or better?
For whatever reason, you may or may not reject or accept each other's personalities or soul
traits for whatever time that you have appropriated for this particular marriage to occur or not
last.
So, help me, Bob.
So, help me, Bob, and Hale O'Conney.
So, help me.
So, help me, Bob.
You are now hereby married in the church for two minutes.
Let us come together.
Don't let your husband find out.
That's what I like.
That's what I like.
Anybody else testify or be healed or sickened?
Come on up, brother.
Do you have an object you want to marry?
I am blessed with slack in my life.
How's that, son?
Well, I work at a theater, and at this theater, I can work whenever I want, if I want to.
And when I work, I am allowed to smoke as much as I want with my bosses.
Smoke pot?
Smoke pot.
Wow.
It's a cash, smoke-loving thing.
And?
Maybe someday you'll be able to get a hold of the church air.
We have a prop ziplock that we can hire.
If you talk to me later, we'll see what we can do.
All right.
You know, I'm not selling it right now.
I want you to buy it.
Oh, no, no, no.
But, uh, but, uh, but now, and of course, it is a Tibetan or a prop ziplock.
Now, uh, so that's interesting, because, yeah, I mean, I didn't mention that Bob gave me slack.
I just fell into my job with High Times Magazine.
And, uh, I have the High Times Radio Hour, which is on in many stations around town.
You may be, if you've ever heard it.
I'm not going to say it.
I'm the Reverend Ken Bleeboe Abernathy, the producer of that show.
So, uh, so praise Bob and praise High Times and praise Jop.
We always pray for you.
We always pray for you.
We always pray for you.
We always pray for you.
We always pray for you.
We always pray for you.
That's a big part of it.
So, uh, hail Bob.
Hail Bob.
Well, friends, uh, we have a little closing number now that we, uh, worked out for you.
If we can handle it.
And, uh, this is a, this is a little song.
It's a, it's an old, uh, melody from, uh, oh gosh, it must be from about 1975, I believe,
when it came out.
Can I hit it?
It's by a man named Neil Innes, who, uh, also brought you to Ruggles.
Isn't he wonderful?
Yeah.
Yeah.
legendary out connaître.
Oh, once I knew your love so true, every inch of it.
In eyes of each and every other, every thing's more trusting, a good girl.
the world
but whose judgment
was reckless
and when in turn
she showed concern
she wore it
like an necklace
so come on
have yourself a good time
go out and share the blame
do what you should
but if it makes you feel good
I hope you feel
no shame
well I don't know about that
God has a divine sense of humor
let me tell you
and one of the reasons
what was that?
I don't get it
I don't get his sense of humor
you know I have a very
well you may not have
a good sense of humor
but God who is perfect
in all things
has a perfect sense of humor
well then why don't I get it
because you know I laugh a lot
you know I hear funny things
because it is
I'm a humie
it is unto man
to live in imperfection
a perfection which can only be attained
by the devout proprieties
of a Christian life
I know
I spend a lot of time
on the internet pal
and uh
you know
there's a lot of good jokes
on the internet pal
is that software?
well you know
God knows all those jokes
but I'm just saying
if God would tell a joke
it would be
so much better
than any joke
that you've ever heard
that you might even die laughing
in the first micro
what we would call
a microsecond
of hearing
just the joke
just the first
sound of the first syllable
of the first syllable

of the joke
would be so laugh provoking
that you would
be glad that God
is not convenient
your diaphragm
would be traumatized
you would probably
eventually die
of internal bleeding
if not from
that reminds me
if you see Jesus
you tell him
he still owes me
twenty bucks
now let's not get into that
I hope we don't see Jesus
you know
when that happens
we're supposed to have
another end of the world
situation
and things are happening
so fast
we're now
how many of us

are going to die

twenty months
until the end of the
the world
let me see
oops
you're making me nervous
when you talk about that
torture and saucer ride
eight months
eight months
let's just forget it
that becomes true
it's eight months
in a few days
and well
we know
it will come true
and only those
who wear these
special badges
will get by
alive
what were you saying Hal
I'm nothing
I was just
ahem
it's polishing my little badge
here
he was

the subgenius
of the National Orchestra
is ah
tuning up
it was in a dream
that we had
some kind of
radio show
anyway
the amazing
boar of the amazing
colossal Jesus
yea
they both wear
in the same kind of
He fell off Boulder Dam and scraped one side of his face off and one side of his halo and his crown of thorns.
And now he's hideously disfigured, seeking the woman he loves.
But he's mindless and he will kill her.
And he's only got one eye, too.
Right, one hideous rolling eye.
He's got like a shaved head.
He can't have like the regular Jesus hair because that's too, you know, that's too slick and bonafide.
The amazing, colossal Jesus.
I actually, I can't get over the fact I actually talked to Bob Larson today, himself.
Just like we were old, you know, fellow cult leaders.
And you are.
Or fellow charlatan, you know, fellow medicine show charlatan rainmakers.
And you are.
You know, false healing exorcist crazy.
It was great.
You are.
It was such, you know, it was so great to sort of bury the hatchet and just hate each other freely.
Did he turn you on any hot stock tips or you guys going to play golf soon?
No, we're going to get together later.
Maybe do.
Were you guys going to work on those tapes again and stuff?
No, we'll probably just do a little bit.
Now, don't get jealous.
We'll probably do a little radio stuff together.
But, you know, I'll figure if we could, I think if we could get Bob Larson to start calling the ESO show.
Wow.
That would be horrifying.
I can't imagine anything more horrifying.
I think that would be big fun.
We'd have a crossover Christian audience.
Well, that might be cool because you could insult them and they wouldn't know it.
Dave.
Dave.
Dave.
We could launch his head over the air.
We could launch, we could launch like little baby Jesuses right hot off the, right off the nativity scenes right out there in some of the audiences.
So we could get both crowds and then get a crossover thing going.
Once you've got a crossover thing going on pop music, buddy, you're in the money.
God, man, then we'd have the, we'd have enough money to be able to afford the coat hanger fetus launching crossbows.
For the little tiny miniature G-Zi.
See, Ty.
Man, that would, I don't know if you.
83D, geez, I fall in from the sky.
Can you imagine how hot something like that would be on a, on a shopping channel?
Hey, if we could sell it to the Spice Girls, it would be majorly hot, dude.
Take over the world.
Hello friends and welcome to the very last X Day ever.
X Day drill ever.
There will be no more drills for X Day.
This time next year, a huge XS Almada will appear in the X Day.
And thunder in the skies above Earth.
A giant electro voice loudspeaker will lower from beneath the craft.
And thunder the following warning.
Wake up, pink boys and girls.
This is not a drill.
It's a sledgehammer.
It is a sledgehammer.
A sledgehammer bomb.
We have gathered here today to celebrate this momentous free anniversary occasion.
We've come from Canada, Florida, California, and the United States.


And of course, all points in between.
And although we are jubilant about our future, we are also serious about our present.
This is no subgenius fantasy camp.
We have not come here just to hobnob with the subgenius celebrities.
To smoke froth with Stang, or drink beer with legume, or eat live prairie squid with Papa
Joe, or even swing naked with Suzie the floozy, although that is a rather tempting proposition.
Wait.
No, sir.
Who's that?
We didn't just come here to celebrate.
We came here to have a party.
And just to have a good time.
We came here to prepare for the end times.
Now, if preparing for the destruction of the conspiracy and its millions of collaborators
just so happens to trip your trigger and turn you on, well, I doubt Dobbs will get
too upset if you enjoy yourself in the line of duty.
There's nothing wrong with whistling while you work, especially if it helps drown out
the shrill screams of the night.














I'm sure you'll be happy to see the dreams of those you are exterminating.
Hey, someone's got to do it.
The sooner we sterilize this planet of peatness, the sooner you and me can leave this rock and
explore Planet 10.
Now, sometimes the uninitiated are shocked by our lack of sensitivity to the suffering
of others.
We love it.
Let them poop their panties all they want.
If they can't handle little Gallo's humor now, they can't wait to see the expression
on his face.











The only thing better than the look of horror on a dead pink's face is the look of disbelief
that precedes that look of horror.
Yes!
You know, I never, ever get tired of seeing it.
They rarely ever say a word.
But you can read their mind just by looking into their terrified eyes.
It's like that little light in the back of their brain is lighting up for the first time
and thinking, wow.
Like they were the ones who were scared.

They were the ones who were kidding about this X Day stuff.
Yes!
We really are going to die.
That new car and promotion just don't seem so important anymore.
If only I could buy some time.
But alas, their conspiracy money isn't worth anything anymore and their time is out.
It's not worth anything now.
Which brings us to where we are now, doesn't it dear friends?
And where we want to be by X Day.
That is, there are two...
There are two...
Two distinct branches in the Church of the Subgenius.
The highbrow, evangelical branch, led by Ivan Stang and his philosophical followers, who
believe that you become one with Bob by thinking about Bob and studying his word through scripture.
These are the church intellectuals.
We need them and they serve an important purpose.
But they don't actually like to dirty their hands with the down and dirty business of
battling for Bob.
What?
Those folks are welcome to listen to the Subgenius Hour of Slack and send in their love offerings.
But we need people who are prepared to roll up their sleeves and break a sweat for Bob
if we're going to make his vision of the future happen.
Yeah!
What we need on X Day are members of the other branch of the Church of the Subgenius.
The Holocaustal branch.
Led by St. Jane or Hyperclete, the preacher of the Black Lagoon, and of course yours truly, Papa Joe.
We are, as they say, the so-called...
Angry white men in black.
We need soldiers who are willing to kill or get killed fighting the conspiracy.
Let the evangelicals line up on the sidelines and act as cheerleaders because we appreciate their moral support.
But the fact of the matter is that the forest won't fall unless somebody, preferably lots of somebodies,
get out there and chop it down and stack it up like cords of dead wood.
Yeah!
Woo!

Woo!
What do you need to be a soldier for Bob, friends?
Well, oddly enough, it's not so much what you have, but what you don't have.
More times than not, the Holocaustal members of the Church have practically nothing.
No fancy cars, no fancy houses, usually unmarried, no kids.
At least not that we know of.
Soldiers of Bob travel light.
The only thing that we carry on our back is a big-ass chip with Bob's face on it.
A chip we want the conspiracy to steal.
A chip we want the conspiracy to dare to knock off.
It's one of the few pictures of Bob where his grin is not smiling.
That time will come our next day.
Turn on.
Tune in.
Why do you want to be normal?
The rupture is upon us, dear friends.
That fateful day, July 5th, 1998.
Next day's a-comin'.
And the pigs are bummin'.
Ah!
Oh, what I'd give once more to live
In childhood innocence
The things men do, words so true
Would seem much more like common sense
An empire built on civilized guilt
And yet the whole man still is the stranger
Looked to my friends to make a fence
But he tried, didn't see no danger
So come on, have yourself a good time
Go out and share the flame
Do what you should, but it ain't fair
With legs and fingers
I hope you feel no shame
I hope you feel no shame
I hope you feel no shame
I hope you feel no shame
Don't feel any shame, people.
Feel no shame.
Be who you are.
Don't let the conspiracy get you down.
Because X Day is coming.
Don't miss X Day, friends.
It's coming.
No shame.
Be proud of your subjigas heritage.
And don't be ashamed.

Won't you feel the shame?
I'm Tom Seager, I'm your show buddy.
I'm a chance man.
I'm a sound boy, hey.
That's Tom on the drum.
These occurrences are pure figments of imagination.
Any abnormal sound?
Roll.
Happily, delightfully, constantly roll.
May I inquire about your personal beliefs?
May I inquire about your personal beliefs?
My beliefs.
What do you believe in?
What stirs your heart?
What fills my eyes?
What's your dream to create a dream?
What do you feel in my life?
What's your dream to create?
To feel the very same thing I have in my life.
To feel the same thing I have in my life.
The hands.
The hands.
The hands.

The hands.
You don't know what you touch.
So, just lay down there.

I'll love you as they look at you without a brain.
Everyone else will be finding this easy.
One group, then the other.
The end.

Those were esses.
ência.c.a.s.s.a was an along the way choice so I spend a million bucks.
One shall find the good, only a million.
The whole business is mine, don't remember.
Totally and absolutely mine, don't remember.
A girl like that, you could take her with your pocket.
Two feet tall, two years old, he didn't care.
And if there was real young, you could hide her.
Greys.
The little greys.
Yeah.
Poor little innocent greys.
Old ones.
Of course, the greys are born huge and grow smaller as they age.
The littler they get, the better.
Yeah, I love them little geriatric greys.
They knew everything there was to know about it.
In fact, they taught me some tricks I could never tell anybody.
Like the real reason why we're not here.
They taught you the, that grey madam taught you the trick of the flying Philadelphia.
That special alien act that no human ever knew.
But yet you were given the privilege of sharing with the great Queen Grey.
The old ancient Queen Grey.
A poppy.
A poppy.
Lady Grey.
A poppy.
Whoa.
How dare you let me hit you.
Smart shamanistic.
Why are you doing that?
Can I boy?
Oh man, I never seen anybody take off a beard top with an appendage like that.
Man, hey, hey, what you, lady, how come you ain't working more, you know what I mean?
I seen you in the food stand flying a lot.
I am taking you, Dave, as my king.
I, the Queen, shall continue to play the queen.





I'm going to pump out eggs of more little greys.
Put on this red coat, Mr. Dave.
Put on a red coat for us, please.
And strap, strap this on with those big red straps.
We have been without a king for too many years.
A king and the land is one.
And without a king, we have no land.
I am the new Elvis.
Yes, I'll take your hand or whatever that thing is.
And I'll open beer bottles for you.
And I'll sing you songs deep into the night about Charlie and the Princess Di and, and,
and, and, and left-wing conspirators.
And we will keep you here in our great court.
And we will entomb you in this little hexagonal box and seal over the top with flags.
And we will try you for crimes against the universe.
When we need you, we will take you out and inject you with poison.
Thank you.
Long live our new king, Dave.
King?
Hey, I don't want no job like that.
You old, you weird creatures can just be gone.
I know I'm being like this anymore.
When his body has undergone the change, we will all of us queens shall lay our eggs in him.
And our children shall feast upon their father.
No, don't do that. Get away from me.
They grow up to be little grey larvae.
Get that thing away from me.
You can't inject that into my body, into my back there.
Oh, your children will be so cute.
Our children, Dave.
I'm too young to have children.
I'm only 48 years old.
I'm too young to have children.
I live a footloose and frantic free life and I especially don't want nobody injecting no eggs into my rectal cavity.
But you are the king, Dave.
I like the suit just fine.
The greatest king of all of us.
Can't I just sing and walk around in my red cape and stuff and get the world commands?
I mean, what do you got to do that for?
We need you, Dave.
And your children need you. They need to grow inside your viscera.
Children need a father.
I can't be a father to all them goofy looking things. I don't know what to feed them.
And I wouldn't know how to teach them nothing.
Oh, they will feed themselves.
They're melting and changing back into... They're Martians. Can you understand? Martians, not men.
You are the man. You are the man.
You will be the father of a great civilization of greys.
The Dave Greys, they will be called.
But Dave Greys ain't got no body here, see? They don't look nothing like me. I can't have no greys with all their...
But think of them as little children with sunglasses on.
I like the sunglasses. That's a nice touch. But they have no eyes.
And they have no sexual organs either, Dave. That's why we don't worry about you abusing them.
But...
That's why you make the perfect father.
Now, would you please give us those...
Step into the light, Dave.
Step into the light and give us those shoes.
Walk into the light, dammit.
We must take them off for later.
How much longer, Dave?
We've got this.
We gave up the ruby slippers. The fool. The idiot. Now he's trapped here forever.
You want to hear some great music?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just wanted to make money and have fun.
Hello, doctor.
How are you?
The doctor is on.
You could have a rewarding career as a subgenius doctor.
That's right. Surgeons for Connie.
Perform healing orgy-deviable surgery.
Sicken the masses.
Bombard the patient with subgenius anti-music noise.
I'm gonna die!
And all you need to do that, friends, is to write for free information from...
And here's that post office box number again.
You got that pencil ready?
Write to Bob, my friends, at post office box 140306.
That's box 140306 in beautiful Dallas, Texas, 75214.
Ah, yes.
The sacred box.
Zip code of Bob, 75214.
And you too can join us on the saucers, first in Brushwood, Sherman, New York, and then
on the saucers on that glorious day, X-Day, coming up so soon.
Oh, so very, very soon.
Are you ready, friends?
This morning, certainly you yourself may have tied your shoelaces, but tonight will it be
the undertaker who unties them.
Are you ready to meet Bob?
Are you ready?
I am, my friend.
I am certainly ready.
I've paid my $30.
I've got my subgenius minister's card in my pocket, and I am in.
I am ready to meet Bob, friends.
And praise Bill T. Miller for the music that we have used from his CD here and there, on
and off from Orgy of Slack, Einstein's Secret Orchestra, and oh, James Kocielka, superstar
at the very beginning of this half hour, doing that song, Show Respect to Michael Jackson.
And a special thanks to Reverend Bleepo Abernathy for such a great preaching.
And a thank you.
