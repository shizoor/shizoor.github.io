00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
And welcome, dear friends, to the Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,220
Praise Bob!

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,860
For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,640
Turn on the machine.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,360
This is Radio Yerevan.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,980
Wake up, puppet boy!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,660
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation to provide programs which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

8
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,660
There is absolutely no other possibility.

10
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,120
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

11
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,200
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,380
The Subgenius Hour of Slack!

13
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:29,680
The practice of hallucinatory drugs was big back in then and they were hearing these messages that the Beatles were placing backwards.

14
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,620
From PR News in Washington, I'm 89 years old.

15
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,240
People are watching television in the tinder-dry Southwest.

16
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,440
Officials in Oklahoma are now raising the debt.

17
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,860
The Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office reporting 12 adults and 6 children raised Friday.

18
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,180
On Wall Street, 8-9.

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,860
People dying today as a result of complications says this is PR News in Washington.

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,540
Ah, yes, dear friend.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,120
Thank you for the collages, Lee Murr.

22
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,840
And thank you listeners who pledged for the movie.

23
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,260
The Kickstarter fundraiser for the Subgenius documentary movie actually worked.

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,120
They reached the goal of $199,999.

25
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,960
And then went another $6,000 over.

26
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,740
So we were all like, yay!

27
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,460
But then I was all like, oh no.

28
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,360
That means I have to sign all those rewards I promised to sign.

29
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,040
And so my hand is killing me just thinking about it.

30
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:44,420
Anyway, we are at Stang Ranch and Tarzan's radio station is set up.

31
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,800
But we're still unpacking everything else.

32
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,100
And I have to change our address on everything.

33
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,340
The internet and dozens of printed examples.

34
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,840
Our Cleveland mailbox will be there for another year.

35
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,400
And the mail gets...

36
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,460
It's forwarded to the house sitting...

37
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,860
Forwarded by the house sitting Subgenius.

38
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,560
And we're looking for a renter, by the way.

39
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,880
But the new address for Subgenius Foundation is...

40
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,820
Got your pencil ready?

41
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,020
P.O. Box 807.

42
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,940
Glen Rose, Texas.

43
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,320
76043.

44
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,440
That's Box 807.

45
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,100
Glen Rose, Texas.

46
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,180
76043.

47
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,020
Short!

48
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,160
Okay, friends.

49
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,520
I saved a radio synesthesia show that hasn't been on the hour of slack ever.

50
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,600
Saved it for this week because I knew we were going to be really busy.

51
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:54,620
This was recorded at WCSB on July 9th of the so-called 2017.

52
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,580
Right after X-Day Drill number 20.

53
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:08,160
Although technically it was hoped to be 20 X-Day, but it turned out to be the 22nd X-Day Drill.

54
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,680
Dr. Sinister kept Princess Wee and myself and Dr. Hal in the station for two extra hours.

55
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,540
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave called in.

56
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,340
And this is the first hour.

57
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,700
Praise Bob.

58
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,440
The First Hour.

59
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,440


60
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,440


61
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,440


62
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,440


63
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,440


64
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,200
It's going to be a long way.

65
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,340
An hour.

66
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,860
An hour.

67
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,680
A grand 30.

68
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,280
Five.

69
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,340
Four.

70
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,260
Oh, yes, dear friends.

71
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,220
Ah, yes, dear friends.

72
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,780
This background music, which Dr. Sinister asked me to pick.

73
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,180
In this case, it's a Cincinnati band.

74
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,420
It's a Cincinnati band.

75
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,420


76
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,420


77
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,420


78
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,420


79
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,420


80
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,420


81
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,420


82
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,420


83
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,420


84
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,420


85
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,560
band called Mayan Ruins.

86
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,240
And I'll be

87
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,500
performing with them

88
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,840
next

89
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,400
Wednesday. This coming

90
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,060
Wednesday at Starwood.

91
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,840
In the portable

92
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,200
nightclub called the Puffer Dome.

93
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,780
With 360

94
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,000
degree projections by

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,480
Waking Dream.

96
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,180
But you have to be there to see it

97
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,300
and hear it. Well, we can't

98
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,420
call for action, but if somebody wanted

99
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,300
to know about it, they could check out.

100
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,400
I don't think it's a call

101
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,480
to action to say that one would have to be there to see

102
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,160
it. No.

103
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,480

104
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,360

URL

106
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,340
to check out if you were

107
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,920
interested in that. Starwoodfestival.com

108
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,320
one word. Princess

109
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,820
We is one of the co-directors

110
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,520
of that

111
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,220
world music and strange

112
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,380
knowledge festival that follows

113
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,040
X Day.

114
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,100
What a strange

115
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,800
coincidence that the

116
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
blasphemer cult

117
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,100
festival, well not

118
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,040
blasphemer so much as skeptics

119
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,340
of all rival cults

120
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,180
is back to back

121
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,800
mated with

122
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,840
in fact the

123
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,960
festival of all beliefs.

124
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,420
Including

125
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,380
the Church of All Worlds.

126
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,360
Yeah, including Church of All Worlds.

127
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,240
You can't have one without

128
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,860
the other.

129
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,720
Um, how did

130
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,220
you're familiar with the Church of All Worlds, right?

131
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,920
Indeed I am.

132
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,240
Well, that's right.

133
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,220
I told, I did

134
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,140
I explained all of that

135
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,060
during an hour of slack we recorded

136
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,240
at Wisteria, so I'm not going to go

137
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,020
into it now. But

138
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,060
they're cool. Yes.

139
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,620
They acknowledge

140
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,000
the possibility of life beyond

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,700
Earth. And they make unicorns

142
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,360
or they used to, out of goats.

143
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,480
Genetic.

144
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,820
That's a long time ago.

145
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,900
Why a goat? A goat has two horns that can be

146
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,120
slowly pressed together

147
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,880
and intertwined.

148
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,700
Well, the horned butt needs to be transplanted.

149
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,540
The first part of the operation

150
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,900
for Dr. Moreau's

151
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,700
laboratories.

152
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,240
Speaking of why a goat...

153
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,860
The stubborn beast flesh keeps creeping back.

154
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,500
Speaking of why a goat,

155
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,260
when's the last time the originators of that

156
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,500
meme showed up at X Day?

157
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,200
Well, the originator of that meme

158
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,800
was a judge who was

159
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,180
interrogating young

160
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,100
Reverend Magdalene.

161
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,860
And they haven't showed up at X Day

162
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,060
since then because

163
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,560
it's still a law in New York State

164
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,300
that that one individual,

165
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,760
Reverend Magdalene, may not

166
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,780
have subgenius materials

167
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
in her home.

168
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,880
So they keep them in the garage.

169
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,940
But yeah,

170
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,700
they took her kid away because

171
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,920
she was a member of the Church of the Subgenius

172
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,440
and she had made a goat

173
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,880
mask for

174
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,880
a little boy to explain

175
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,860
the sky goat who eats the moon

176
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,760
every month. That's why the moon

177
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,580
gets bigger and smaller.

178
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,060
And then it grows back and the goat eats it again.

179
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,440
Right, it was a science thing.

180
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,000
But, you know, goats, Satan,

181
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,540
New York family judges,

182
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,620
it all ties together.

183
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,080
He's been graduated from high school now.

184
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,040
So he's actually legally an adult now?

185
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,140
Yeah. They could probably,

186
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,460
you know, but it's got bad

187
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,060
memories for him, I'm sure.

188
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,000
And that's too bad because

189
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,880
we only are there for

190
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,500
enlightenment and enjoyment.

191
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,860
You know, there was actually an article

192
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,980
in, I can't remember

193
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,580
which one of the major news outlets

194
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,880
that I frequent regularly, but it's one of those

195
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,340
stories that keeps coming up about how

196
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,280
outside of New York City,

197
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,520
the rest of the state of New York,

198
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,920
its judicial system

199
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
is run by judges who have

200
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,720
absolutely no legal qualifications whatsoever.

201
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,800
And they frequently rule

202
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,880
on cases where there's a conflict of interest

203
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,540
and, uh,

204
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,360
this is one of those things that's

205
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,180
actually reported on repeatedly

206
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,320
in the media, not just the case

207
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,820
of Magdalene, but

208
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,760
numerous other cases.

209
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,360
Right, you would think that kind of thing would happen in Texas.

210
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,560
No! We did all kinds

211
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,720
of terrible things in Texas. Nobody cared.

212
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,460
Of course, we weren't Branch

213
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,320
Davidians.

214
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,240
Well, in Texas...

215
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,460
If you're a Branch Davidian, they'll firebomb you

216
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,900
and then call it an accident.

217
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,980
Well, in Texas, if you're

218
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,760
on trial for capital murder, there is,

219
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,780
there's no requirement that your lawyer actually be awake

220
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,540
during the trial.

221
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,040
That's actually gone through the courts in Texas.

222
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,300
Wow. Well, he's gotta get his beauty seat.

223
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,260
He argued that he was not given proper legal representation

224
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,860
because his lawyer was literally asleep

225
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,660
at the table.

226
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,220
No wonder my father was a Texas lawyer.

227
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,320
That explains a lot.

228
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,200
He was always so, you know,

229
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,260
well-rested when he got home from work.

230
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,980
Refreshed after a long day in court.

231
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,360
Hey, let's bring

232
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,340
on our favorite alien here.

233
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,240
Bring it on.

234
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,440
You're on the air.

235
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,080
I'm not, I'm not invisible.

236
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,220
I am twice as infectious and untrust.

237
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,680
I'm sorry.

238
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:16,720
Hey, we've got, we sold six copies of your book, Neighbor World at XDai for well above cover price.

239
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:25,340
We're talking to the author of the book Neighbor World, whose book was quite popular in the XDai.

240
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:25,340


241
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,060
It's called The XDai Auction, known as the Bulldowner Auction.

242
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,040
I only had 10 copies because they're proof copies.

243
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,000
It hasn't actually been published yet.

244
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,240
Making it all the more exotic and rare.

245
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,420
Yes.

246
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:37,940
Yeah.

247
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,900
You could sign it and put in pictures of like, you know, underage women wearing dildos in their ears and stuff.

248
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,900
Yeah, I guess you could.

249
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,940
You know, nobody did ask me to sign anything.

250
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,520
All these people came up and said, I hate to ask you this for everything.

251
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,800
I don't want to be a Bobby or anything.

252
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,320
I'd like to have you sign.

253
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,100
I'll sign my book later.

254
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:56,640
I want y'all.

255
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,220
I'd be honored.

256
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:57,800
That'd be great.

257
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,620
We do that all the time.

258
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,200
You get Dr. Howe, Princess.

259
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,740
We never own hands here.

260
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Did a doctor like you in here?

261
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,120
Come on.

262
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,700
Nobody asked.

263
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,560
No, but in the end, they they forgot.

264
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:18,340
They were so dazzled by the wonders around them at XDai or so sleepy from the froth or whatever they smoke.

265
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,640
It's not real froth.

266
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,300
No, it's not froth.

267
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:21,600
Yes.

268
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,300
But everyone calls it that.

269
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,560
It's just the metaphor.

270
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,100
See?

271
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,280
Yeah, for cyclone grease and leaves stuck together in a humongous paste.

272
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:36,620
I think it's one of the worst things you've ever eaten, especially since you turned me on to live springtime.

273
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,640
I think it was Tuesday.

274
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,480
You mean spinach pie?

275
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,160
No, no, not horseshoes.

276
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,920
That's the call in Greek, by the way, called horseshoes.

277
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,380
Spanakopita.

278
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,420
Spanakopita.

279
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,920
Sounds tasty.

280
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah.

281
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,540
Yeah.

282
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,060
It is.

283
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,200
But you know, what if you were to say Spasibo, Nichibo or something like that?

284
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,260
Do you think somebody want to pull their pants down then?

285
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,940
Well, you're talking about eating a huge mass of greenish mulch?

286
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,360
Of course.

287
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,600
Well.

288
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,120
Why not?

289
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,400
Okay.

290
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,900
Our friends and neighbors says nothing that beats the flavor on the moist, moist afternoon sometimes we have around here.

291
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,960
Why are you be chewing until the moment of the rupture?

292
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,520
Because that stuff is...

293
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,000
Let me say al dente.

294
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,880
You need four stomachs to handle that.

295
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,680
Yes.

296
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,660
At least four.

297
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,980
I only want it if it's studded with some fatted cheese.

298
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,340
I don't have four stomachs, but I do have four colons.

299
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,360
Well, you could go that one step further and cover your entire body with dirty words.

300
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,400
That's impressive.

301
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,260
Descending semicolon.

302
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,420
Anyway, we have...

303
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,180
You know, it's funny.

304
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,520
I've seen people with like a semicolon for a year.

305
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:54,520


306
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:54,520


307
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:54,800
They're a tattoo.

308
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,700
Yeah.

309
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,620
And at first I assumed it was like to raise awareness for colostomy patients.

310
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,060
But no.

311
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,500
It's actually about mental illness.

312
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,320
Yes.

313
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,080
They want to append another unrelated sentence.

314
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,820
Which kind of makes sense because I'm constantly appending my sentences.

315
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,760
Maybe it's because I still have my appendix.

316
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,840
Maybe I need to have that removed.

317
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,380
The colon suggests that there is some linkage there.

318
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,120
Especially if you're cross-eyed or something like that.

319
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,860
You can actually see with the mask off.

320
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,400
Elliptical dependency.

321
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,860
Like, I mean, two traverses, syllogisms, and a leftward passage.

322
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,260
I mean, what the hell do they call that?

323
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,180
The name where the two vehicles don't resemble homicide.

324
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,060
You know, like one, they're like parallel.

325
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,380
You know what I mean?

326
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,220
Parallel destruction.

327
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,800
Not at all.

328
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,720
No, you do know what I mean, but I can't grasp the right...

329
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,100
Grasp the right.

330
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,720
The word...

331
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,920
Oh, it's...

332
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,280
Parallel development.

333
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,800
There you go.

334
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,200
You mean convergent evolution?

335
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,700
Uh, could be.

336
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,400
That's what makes different things that aren't related resemble each other.

337
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,060
Because the same forces, the same external forces are acting upon them.

338
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,740
That's what I thought.

339
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,320
Like when you have two advancements happening independently of each other...

340
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,600
In different parts of the world.

341
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,320
That's why Superman, an alien, resembles a human.

342
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,380
That's how Newton and Leibniz both invented calculus around the same time, right?

343
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,680
Well, that was the great minds running in the same track.

344
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,420
And it might be the gestalt of science ready to come out like Alfred Russell Wallace and Darwin.

345
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,380
Somebody was going to, uh...

346
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,600
Going to, uh, have the big theory.

347
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,580
I've noticed a lot of comedians steal my jokes, except they've never actually heard me tell them.

348
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,200
I'm not going to tell these jokes.

349
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,200
Well, now wait a minute.

350
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,460
You were talking about Darwin.

351
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:03,160
Now all of a sudden you're stealing his materials so you can get another one of those weird, you know, mug nights going on Thursday.

352
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,260
Well, Darwin gets a lot of laughs.

353
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:05,900
Where you do your ridiculous routine.

354
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,760
Have you ever seen Dr. Sinister's routine that he does on Thursday nights at the...

355
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,540
It's aerobic?

356
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,240
At the hollow log?

357
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,340
Uh, he's, uh, he's exercising, eh?

358
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,260
That kind of a routine?

359
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,960
No, no, he's a stand-up.

360
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,100
And sometimes it gets real oblique.

361
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,880
And one time a guy knifed him for not...

362
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,220
Because he couldn't understand what the hell he was talking about.

363
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,580
Well, that's a tough crowd.

364
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,240
Since my sciatica started acting up, I'm actually a sit-down, not a stand-up.

365
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,820
Well, it's a wheelchair accessible profession.

366
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,820
And an ADA device.

367
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:42,260
Anyway, we're relaxing now, and the tremors of X-Day have almost died down.

368
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:51,140
Even these awesome and confusing new revelations, which are going to change it unaccountably.

369
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,880
Speaking of revelations.

370
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,000
I've heard, Dr. Hell, that you have a new song.

371
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,340
Why, I do.

372
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,060
Or rather, I have an old one which was never appropriately decanted.

373
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,280
Oh, sing it, please.

374
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,020
We wanna hear it.

375
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,540
Decant it, don't recant it.

376
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,320
I'm gonna decant it, and I'm going to be assisted in the chorus once again by the lovely Princess

377
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,080
Wee.

378
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,980
You think this would be a good time to do it?

379
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,840
Why not?

380
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,880
Yeah, whip it out.

381
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,860
Yeah, let's fade out this background music.

382
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:22,860


383
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,020
You better fade Dave and me out, too.

384
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,900
Oh, why, you can't fade me out.

385
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,900
I'll fade Dave out.

386
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,040
You can't fade me out.

387
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,100
Oh, well, I don't know, you'll just fade anybody out.

388
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,900
I'll let it be a lesson to you.

389
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,380
Don't bring me down, man.

390
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,520
No, I, no, no.

391
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:51,980
There's a man by my sidewalk in, smoking a pipe and to me talking.

392
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:57,520
And to me, here's what he's saying.

393
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,780
Take up the slack.

394
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,440
Take up the slack.

395
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,800
The conspiracy is all around you.

396
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,420
Its willing slaves will crowd and hound you.

397
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,160
When its ways craze and confound you.

398
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,580
Take up the slack.

399
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,980
Take up the slack.

400
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,780
They will slander and defame you.

401
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,900
Putting up posts to shame and blame you.

402
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,540
And yet still and all and just the same you.

403
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,180
Take up the slack.

404
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,420
Take up the slack.

405
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,500
They will hack.

406
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,520
Have no understanding.

407
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,240
Denial of Bob by you they'll be demanding.

408
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,580
But your true yeti self will keep commanding.

409
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,800
Take up the slack.

410
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,480
Take up the slack.

411
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,980
Take up the slack.

412
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,600
Take up the slack.

413
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,140
That's the most beautiful song about slack.

414
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,000
Slag that I've ever heard.

415
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,760
Slag?

416
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,140
Slag?

417
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:24,960
Slack.

418
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

419
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,060
What's that?

420
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,740
Slack.

421
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,180
What does that mean?

422
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,200
I have to say, when you hit that harmony there on the second repetition of slack, like that particular.

423
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,860
Is Dave still hidden?

424
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,280
Well, I don't know what he thought about that.

425
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,720
I have to say it sent a little shiver up my spine there.

426
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,300
That particular.

427
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,060
I like that.

428
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,280
That particular harmony there.

429
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,000
That particular gospel music of a tourist clear water variety.

430
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,900
Gospel?

431
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,660
It's possible.

432
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,300
It's the subgenius gospel.

433
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,860
It's supposedly good news.

434
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,960
Now I don't know what kind of news we've got.

435
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,060
It's all too new.

436
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:15,440
We've got alien messages coming at us saying that our basic precepts have been a couple of degrees out of whack.

437
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,940
Whack.

438
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,400
Whacked off, one might say.

439
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,700
Yes, it left us with dinosaur egg on our face.

440
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,120
Yep.

441
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,380
It's pretty painful to watch you guys crying on each other's shoulders like a pair of little baby women.

442
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,220
Well, we had to buck up and go on.

443
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,420
It's part of the theory is that it is possible that nobody is prepared for it.

444
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,740
And it did happen.

445
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,240
Well, yeah.

446
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,960
As it always does.

447
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,140
Every year we've, you know, it's just taken to the land of experience.

448
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,760
Expansion is such a point where it just goes on and on forever.

449
00:19:54,060 --> 00:20:07,860
Well, we hope the church is sufficiently elastic not to snap at such an additional adaptability.

450
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,340
I love that song.

451
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,320
Yeah.

452
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,840
Revile, revival, up in the morning.

453
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,960
Get up, Elijah, let us not to look.

454
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,080
Well, we always get up in the morning.

455
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,300
So early in the morning.

456
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,780
Dr. Onan Canobite sang a new song at this X-Day drill.

457
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,940
It was like a gang.

458
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,080
Some genius sea chanty.

459
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,440
Yeah, a sea chanty that was like to row, that slaves would row to.

460
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,100
Yes.

461
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,200
For the good skipper Dobbs.

462
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,840
What a great song.

463
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,900
Break your backs for the good skipper Dobbs.

464
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,980
He had the whole crowd singing along with it.

465
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,780
It was great.

466
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,400
And the movie people were there.

467
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,420
So that scene will be represented in the subgenius motion picture.

468
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,740
Well, maybe for five seconds.

469
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:07,060
They seem very competent and they've got lots and lots of subgenius footage in the can already.

470
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,480
But who knows how they'll put it all together.

471
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,160
I'm going to try to help them do that right.

472
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,420
They've been everywhere.

473
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,060
They've been to Arkansas and L.A. and San Francisco.

474
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,140
I'm going to try to help.

475
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,520
Well, that's better than standing right in the way trying not to help.

476
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,560
You know, we've got those two in the church.

477
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,600
Obstructionists.

478
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,240
Oh, but they think they're helping us.

479
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,180
They're obstructing the entrails of the church.

480
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,120
Going to cause a foul blast of doctrinal error to come forward.

481
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,640
Which is really needed at this point in time.

482
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,560
No, you think so?

483
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,020
The reformation of the spectrum.

484
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,220
Of the spectators.

485
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,440
Somebody open a window.

486
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,980
Light a match.

487
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,000
It was the dog.

488
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,160
The dog.

489
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,620
The war did it.

490
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,240
See, that means it was staying because he shares the doggy bowl with his dog.

491
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,480
You know, we brought a huge dog to X-Day this time.

492
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:08,180
And he, dog person, was there all the way.

493
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,140
Well, they don't allow his kind down on the camp.

494
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,940
Couldn't bring him down to the landing field.

495
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,700
But he was up in the big house, though.

496
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,140
And getting used to the fact that there were...

497
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,640
There were some cats walking around like they owned the place.

498
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,840
You don't understand.

499
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,300
Those aren't dogs.

500
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,380
Those are cats.

501
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,220
You can't feed them.

502
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,560
You can't pet them.

503
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,580
What are you doing?

504
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,920
You must understand.

505
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Those aren't dogs.

506
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,640
You must think they're dogs.

507
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,380
They're cats.

508
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,880
I'm telling you.

509
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,360
You must believe me.

510
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,040
Cats who don't back down.

511
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,580
It really does sound like Stang has had a complete and total nervous breakdown.

512
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,940
Cats that aren't impressed by dogs.

513
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,900
That's new.

514
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,120
That cat was so cool.

515
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,980
He was cocky.

516
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,580
Oh, he was the coolest cat ever born.

517
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,080
He's actually a former feral cat who's come in from the cold.

518
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,220
He's figured it out.

519
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,480
Figured that domesticity was the thing.

520
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:07,320
But he's not going to let any big old hound dog do anything to ruffle his equanimity.

521
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,280
He snuck up behind the dog.

522
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,220
That was incredible.

523
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,240
That was hilarious.

524
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,120
The dog had seen the cat go out the kitchen door, which is a glassed-in door.

525
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,100
He could see the cat out the door.

526
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,100


527
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,660
He was out there calmly looking at him.

528
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,360
He was .

529
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,980
Let me through that door.

530
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,080
Well, the cat wandered off.

531
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,040
The dog continued.

532
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,020
The cat climbs in the window behind the dog.

533
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,580
Who doesn't notice?

534
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,040
Who's still looking out the window.

535
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:42,440
The cat sneaks up, just saunters up behind the dog, sniffs his butt.

536
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,260
And he still doesn't know the cat's behind him.

537
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,480
The dog is just, there's a cat around here.

538
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,900
I'm going to get him.

539
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,000
He can't fool me.

540
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,220
And we're laughing our butts off.

541
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,340
There's four of us humans watching this and actually telling the dog, you're an idiot.

542
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,280
There's a cat behind you.

543
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,000
Right behind you.

544
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,860
But of course he doesn't smell English.

545
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,400
So the cat kind of flipped its tail and turned around and walked away.

546
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:15,540
The dog never knew that he had been made that cat's little, and I use this term correctly, bitch.

547
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:22,480
But there was another time when that dog did a big air bite at the cat just to show his hostility.

548
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,120
And the cat reached out and popped him on the snoot.

549
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:25,720
That's true.

550
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,120
True blood.

551
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,040
Just a drop.

552
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,380
Yeah.

553
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,400
It did drop blood.

554
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,800
It's expected that cats are allowed to be trifled with, eh?

555
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,700
Maybe there's something in the air at Westeria.

556
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,920
It's a kind of a magical place, see, where anything could happen.

557
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:49,940
You might even see a dragon in the bathtub bathing up or a flying saucer that is looking for its cup.

558
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,240


559
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:50,920
Eh?

560
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,480
Eh?

561
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,300
Tears.

562
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,060
Tears are magical places.

563
00:24:55,060 --> 00:25:04,560
Or you might be seized by a giant prehistoric snapping turtle when you go wading in the pond and snatch down into an abandoned mine shaft under water.

564
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:04,900
That's right.

565
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:11,800
Or you might put your delicate little toes down and come up out of the mud with a silver ring on them,

566
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,940
which has a strange inscription that has never been deciphered.

567
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,720
That did happen.

568
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,900
That did happen.

569
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,540
And everything is possible.

570
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:19,640
Yes.

571
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,060
Yep.

572
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,500
At X Day, you never know what to expect.

573
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,580
And I walked out on the yellow trail for the first time this year.

574
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,140
Oh, you did?

575
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,560
Yeah.

576
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
You took the yellow trail?

577
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,040
Yeah.

578
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,300
Racine and I walked out.

579
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,060
We walked out for a while, and then we turned around and came back.

580
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,820
Didn't know how long it was going to be.

581
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,480
No one knew.

582
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:41,780
No one knew.

583
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,760
No one knows where the yellow trail goes.

584
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,800
And is it very, very hilly down there in the Ohio Valley?

585
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,700
Well, we were in the forest.

586
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,920
It's hellishly hilly.

587
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,380
It's hilly, all right.

588
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,080
And the dense forest grows all around.

589
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:03,860
A dense forest crawling with insects of every possible variety every year, every day of every year that we're there.

590
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,600
It is known as a biological hotspot.

591
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,480
We end up photographing some insect we've never seen before.

592
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,020
It's true.

593
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,780
Like that huge spider that was in the pond several years ago.

594
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,800
I was going through some old pictures, and that popped up.

595
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,940
Somebody shot it.

596
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,600
It was crawling on the floats.

597
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,240
Yeah, I had my shotgun.

598
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,320
I shot it with my shotgun.

599
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,760
That was the one that kept Nikki Deathchick out of the water.

600
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,660
She saw that spider, and she said, I will never get in that water.

601
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,560
Oh, harmless.

602
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:36,380
I saw all the slime at the surface of the pond and said, I will never get in that water.

603
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,700
Well, I was wondering about that because they say the pond is pumped full of filters.

604
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,300
Filtered water.

605
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,420
But I think the filtered water pumpers were off having a beer or something.

606
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,360
I don't believe that for a second.

607
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,880
Where is this pump station?

608
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,740
Well, supposedly it's there.

609
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,480
Supposedly it's there.

610
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,020
Has anyone actually seen it?

611
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,880
When I got out, I was covered with the oobleck.

612
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:05,840
And when every person emerged, they were covered with the oobleck.

613
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,820
Well, it looks like hair.

614
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,820
That's the funny thing.

615
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,840
It looks like you're covered with a bunch of hair.

616
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,600
It looks like you've suddenly grown a yeti.

617
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,460
Yeti-ish pelt.

618
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,040
Yes.

619
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,420
It is the single most disgusting body of water I've ever seen.

620
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,360
And I'm saying this as someone who grew up on Lake Erie.

621
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,980
They say that that brown stuff floating in it is walnut oil.

622
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,540
B.S.

623
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,220
Walnut oil.

624
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,240
That is bull.

625
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,400
That is a whole lot of bull.

626
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:39,840
Well, maybe walnut oil has a special rural rustic meaning that they sneer at the city slickers and show them it's walnut oil.

627
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,360
Yeah, those sulfurous gases ain't coming from the mud.

628
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,160
They're coming from your own body, senor.

629
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,000
Well, that deep tarn has not been sounded.

630
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,160
It seems to be bottomless since nobody's ever actually managed to measure the depth.

631
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,060
But it goes down deep.

632
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,760
Well, there have to be mounds around there if there's places like there's real deep water sources.

633
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,480
That's a former mine.

634
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,540
Isn't it a deep shaft?

635
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,400
Yes.

636
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,700
Wisteria was a strip mine.

637
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,860
It was a desolate mine.

638
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,140
A completely blasted place with no plants, nothing, no life.

639
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,240
And now life has come roaring back a million fold with it.

640
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:28,320
The state of Ohio put a million dollars into reforesting it and making it into that nature preserve that we now visit.

641
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,000
What's behind that?

642
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,060
Why do they bother?

643
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,040
Why do they put a million bucks into that?

644
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,440
Another odd thing.

645
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,380
Five years ago this year there was something they called the D. Rachel.

646
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,200
Where all the power around Wisteria went out.

647
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,740
And was out for days in a hideous heat wave.

648
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,700
And the food rotted on the grocery store shelves.

649
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,440
And nobody could get gas or do anything since everything requires a computer now.

650
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,540
People were selling bags of ice for $75.

651
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,260
There was no power anywhere.

652
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:03,180
The people of Kazakhstan will be leaders of the world because all their analog information is still stored in water.

653
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,980
Well, here's the interesting thing about that statewide disaster.

654
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,180
Wisteria did start.

655
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:11,820
But it still has power.

656
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,080
It was the only place that did.

657
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,040
We couldn't tell anyone or we would have been inundated by refugees.

658
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,760
But everywhere else was out for days.

659
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:28,500
And the state suffered more than $2 billion worth of damage because of this event at that time.

660
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,900
But we, the subgeniuses, oh, we had ice.

661
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,100
We had ice cream for God's sake.

662
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,920
We had everything.

663
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,620
While those poor suffering pinks were quivering in horror.

664
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,680
I had to say.

665
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,900
It was like the real X Day.

666
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,600
Yes.

667
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:52,000
On the other hand, it was so desperately hot that there were a lot of people who will never ever set foot in Ohio again.

668
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,060
That was the last time I went to X Day.

669
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,940
Some of them left the country, didn't they?

670
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,980
They left the U.S. because X Day was just a little too extreme.

671
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,180
Good riddance.

672
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,860
They're not tough enough.

673
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,980
The funny thing is we've had beautiful weather the last three X Days.

674
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,600
Yes.

675
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,260
It threatened rain, but it never followed through.

676
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,440
There was no rain.

677
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,900
It was cloudy, breezy.

678
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:16,900
Yes.

679
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,900
In the 70s.

680
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,400
Even cool.

681
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,140
When I got there and set up, it was in the 70s.

682
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,140
It was cool, man.

683
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,280
It started out cool.

684
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,100
Now, how about for the pinks in the West, in Nevada, Arizona?

685
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,400
It was what, 117 degrees in Las Vegas?

686
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:32,860
It was 120.

687
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,120
Planes couldn't even take off.

688
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,260
So you mean cloudy urine.

689
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,960
Planes couldn't take off from Phoenix because it was too hot.

690
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:38,960


691
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,860
So nobody could get out of Phoenix, which was a terrible...

692
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,580
That explains the whole dystopian, thematic part of it.

693
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,580
We didn't even need planes to fly where we were.

694
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:46,960
Of course, sir.

695
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,580
We could just just flap our wings away.

696
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:55,060
I've got to point out at this juncture that Texas also gets mighty warm these days.

697
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,660
Texas can be hot as a griddle.

698
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:06,060
We'd want to spread your loins out someplace like that where you could actually fry your ovaries just by thinking about it.

699
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,580
Right on the nearby rock.

700
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:09,900
Petroglyphs.

701
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,300
That's what most of them are anyways, a bunch of vaginal excopheries.

702
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,640
Are there ancient fossils of those who were there before?

703
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,560
Well, don't you think that those big gigantic fish ever reproduce once in a while?

704
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,700
Constantly.

705
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:25,920
Especially on Thursdays.

706
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:31,100
That's all they had to do, besides eat and blow bubbles.

707
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,920
What a way of putting it.

708
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,960
Yeah, well, these boxcar-sized fish...

709
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,800
thought everything else was delish.

710
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,960
You're talking about things like the Dunkleosteus?

711
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,540
Dunkleosteus, formerly called the Deinichthys, or terrible fish.

712
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:57,220
But then there was also the Xiphactinus, one of the rare, giant, prehistoric fishes whose name begins with an X.

713
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,060
What does this have to do with the future here, the future of Bulgaria and the corner of the...

714
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,360
They're all over Ohio.

715
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,000
Past sets up the future.

716
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,680
They're all over Ohio.

717
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,000
They're mostly just underground still.

718
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,580
Or in deep tarns, lakes, channels.

719
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:18,760
So, that explains in the theater the aspect of the third customer of hearing the Bulgarian music in the background,

720
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,280
which makes you foresee the future.

721
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:30,520
Also, it's not just the old Sequaw, the giant snapping turtle, who is a cryptic monster of Ohio.

722
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,800
There's also, what do they call, the Lakeland Amphibian Men?

723
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,440
They'll come from very near.

724
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,880
Though not from the wisteria ground.

725
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,500
What are they called, you know?

726
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,020
We brought that chart last year.

727
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,080
The supersonic Nazi hell creatures from beneath the hollow earth.

728
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,700
No, they're like...

729
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,240
That's a different group.

730
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,840
They're reptile men or amphibian men or something from Lakeland, Ohio.

731
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,280
Anyway...

732
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:54,780
Newt people.

733
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:06,680
It's in the crypto map that you can look up online, which shows where all the monsters are that haunt the rare, out-of-the-way places in this great land of ours.

734
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,220
So it's kind of like a sacred goofball ground.

735
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:11,840
I just remembered.

736
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,360
Where the water runs uphill and stuff like that.

737
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,320
I just remembered. We have that in California.

738
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:21,380
I stopped there. It's called the Lakeland Frogmen. I believe you can Google them.

739
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,340
We actually have...

740
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:26,900
Everybody's got a Lakeland, especially like you around here. There's Lakeland Community College.

741
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,720
We actually have another caller trying to reach us here. By the way, I've been remiss to mention...

742
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,360
So they go to college.

743
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,820
The number is 216-687-3515.

744
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,120
Can you stay bald?

745
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,700
Let's hear what this... Dave, let's hear what this new caller has to say.

746
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
Hello, you're on the air.

747
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,460
Dr. Sooner.

748
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,420
I'm sorry. That's not my name.

749
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,480
I know, but that's okay because I won't go into it now because you have guests.

750
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,740
And I have a question for your guests.

751
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:57,920
Oh.

752
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,380
Ask Dr. Howell.

753
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,620
Yeah, we're here to be professional question answerers.

754
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,980
There you go.

755
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,940
There you go, old monkey man.

756
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,960
Why do you call turtles Nazi sinners? They are our friends.

757
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,600
I never called turtles Nazi or sinners.

758
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,100
You know, Nightwing, I think you need to pull your head out of your ass.

759
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:22,540
We are not sinners, right?

760
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,920
You seem to manage to mishear every single thing that comes out of the ear.

761
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,360
No, we like turtles here on the show.

762
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,180
Oh, of course.

763
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,120
And we understand that turtles have not been adequately represented.

764
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,020
Represented or respected in the past.

765
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:53,060
But we were also talking about a cryptid species, which is a giant form of snapping turtle called by the natives in the Wisteria area, Old Sequaw.

766
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,460
That's a translation.

767
00:34:54,700 --> 00:35:01,600
But there's also a turtle mound near there, which commemorates his existence in the pond.

768
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,020
But we like turtles.

769
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,400
And who doesn't?

770
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,020
Because except for Mitch McConnell, they're all good.

771
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,520
And too good for the planet.

772
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,520
I didn't get it.

773
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,260
I'm going to start crying and have a panic giant attack.

774
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,860
I didn't get it.

775
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:23,680
Well, there's also a YouTube video, which everybody ought to see.

776
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,800
You know, Mitch McConnell isn't 100% turtle.

777
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,180
His mother was actually an owl.

778
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,500
His mother might have been scarified by one.

779
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,680
I mean, there are stories out there.

780
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,980
But on YouTube.

781
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:41,620
There's an incredible video where a guy's pet dog plays in the backyard with his pet turtle.

782
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:51,680
And what's astonishing is that a turtle has any sense of play at all, let alone that it scrambles as adroitly as a turtle can and pushes the ball with its head.

783
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,600
And this thing goes on and on.

784
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,680
It amazed me.

785
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:03,300
It shows that we underestimate animal intelligence right across the whole spectrum of the animal kingdom.

786
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,900
Which a lot of people are saying now.

787
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,880
Some turtles have been trained in ninjitsu.

788
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,900
We've heard of those.

789
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,280
Those notorious four.

790
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,960
But this was like a, you know, this turtle was really into the game.

791
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,480
And the dog plays with the turtle as an equal.

792
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,340
And the guy just films it.

793
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:29,000
Now, I'm sure with the right search words, if you're diddling with the computer right now, you could find that video, which is an eye-opener.

794
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,020
And clearly not faked.

795
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
So, you know, a turtle.

796
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:42,820
A turtle may not seem like much of an intellectual or a games player, but that's just because we don't give it enough credit.

797
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:49,180
I actually have a pet turtle who is a red slider.

798
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,320
And she responds to my movement.

799
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,360
And she knows when she gets all crazy.

800
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,580
She knows when she's going to get food.

801
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,460
It's when I come to her and give her food.

802
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,400
And that's the most important thing in her life.

803
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,900
Because she can't get off that plastic island from out under that plastic palm tree.

804
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:12,460
That two-inch newt that we have displays a certain playfulness.

805
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,980
Yes, how about that?

806
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,460
She's going to be a friendly little doggy, you know.

807
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:24,700
This newt is maybe two inches long, although it is at least 37 years old.

808
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,200
Minimally.

809
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,100
It's an immortal newt, actually.

810
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,420
That is a weird, apparently true story.

811
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:36,040
It will follow your finger around the tank and it really seems to want more attention.

812
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,940
Years ago, I came here and they said, well, the newt died at last.

813
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,780
And I looked at it and I said, no, it didn't.

814
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,060
Look, it's breathing, you know.

815
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,840
Oh, my God.

816
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,860
Well, we thought it was dead, but it's still going.

817
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,100
And it still is, still making its way.

818
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,780
Yes, that was years ago.

819
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,240
Have you filmed any good amoeba porn lately?

820
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,740
The undying newt.

821
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,260
No, I haven't.

822
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,140
I did shoot some newt porn.

823
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:05,480
If you type in fig, the newt that time forgot, you'll see some special effects about that newt.

824
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,380
Great soundtrack, too.

825
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,220
He used to be the community chairman.

826
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:23,740
The last thing I did with my microorganism footage was two X days ago, I showed my collection of it and Dr. Howell and I narrated it and I put it back on YouTube with the narration.

827
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,340
It's only half hour long.

828
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,120
And it's highly edumacated.

829
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:33,300
I think it's called Micro Monsters on Rev Stang YouTube channel.

830
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:39,200
Can you dare to face the horror of the Micro Monsters?

831
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:51,300
Philo wants me to whip out more subgenius ads and short subjects for his subgenius Roku channel, but I just keep wanting to do nature movies.

832
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,960
Making subgenius nature movies.

833
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,300
Well, they are, but definitely not.

834
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,780
I'm trying to do a hot deadline to get that stuff together for those documentary ladies.

835
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,460
Yeah, they don't want to see any nature newts or anything.

836
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,240
No, I'm having to switch.

837
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:26,800
I'm going to be spending the next three months frantically going through every piece of footage of subgenius events I've ever shot, which is all of them, from 1978 till yesterday.

838
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,080
But is the quality good enough for the motion picture screen?

839
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:38,440
Uh, yes, if I go back to the camera originals, which I can do.

840
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,500
Once we pick the ones we want to use...

841
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,600
Oh my God, that is very hard among most modern humans.

842
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,080
No, I'm a professional.

843
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,700
Even if there's only 10 and you have how many hundred...

844
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,800
We're not talking about dilettantes here, but a level of professionalism.

845
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,440
I edited feature length documentary films for a living for 25 years.

846
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:04,340
And I've been collecting material for the subgenius documentary feature movie for 39 years.

847
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,560
And some of it is absolutely incendiary, too.

848
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,440
Yeah, most of it has been edited down, and I know where... I and only I know where the good parts are.

849
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:21,140
I can get to them faster than anybody else, but there's hundreds of them and I've still got to get to them.

850
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,640
But I've got them all lined up.

851
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:32,940
I have a 700 terabyte hard drive that's only half full, but it's got DV format versions of everything.

852
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,700
With the boring parts already removed.

853
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,480
The parts that are boring for me.

854
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:51,220
Now what I have to get rid of is the parts that are boring to everybody else, which will leave us 15 minutes of perfect fuzzy footage.

855
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,940
Boy, will they be tight.

856
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,700
And then the rest will be...

857
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:01,080
And you cannot let your dear babies be, you know, you have to be pretty ruthless and all that stuff, especially if you're, you know, doing part of it.

858
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:07,660
Well, Hollywood insists that we postpone no longer, but put up or shut up.

859
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,620
And so the subgenius movie is forcing all of this to happen.

860
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:20,960
They've been trying to shoot celebrities for us with video cameras because they want it to look important.

861
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:29,460
You know, it's not enough to have Dr. Howell, G. Gordon Gordon, Puzzling Evidence, Philo, Princess Wee, and Susie the Flusie and all that.

862
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,240
Old timers.

863
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:38,800
It's important to have celebrities who really didn't do much at all except for say a nice thing about us.

864
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:49,320
So we hung out with Jerry Casale of Devo and I believe they're going to go back and do Professor Mark.

865
00:41:51,080 --> 00:42:01,000
I've been encouraging them to send me to Las Vegas to shoot Penn Jillette, Reverend Penn Jillette.

866
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:09,640
And I'd really like them to send me to Portugal to shoot G. Gordon Gordon since he let Bob get shot that one time.

867
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,680
We live in hope.

868
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:17,260
And even to blighted Ashtabula to shoot Lonesome Cowboy Dave in the face.

869
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,520
That's a go.

870
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,280
That's a go.

871
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,900
He had a giant on-screen close-up where his face looms over the audience.

872
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:33,300
Yeah, but they tried to get Robert Crumb, the cartoonist, and he said, as I tried to tell him, he would say,

873
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,360
I didn't have anything to do with Church of the Subgenius. What are you talking about?

874
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,680
I thought it was really funny.

875
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,500
He wrote a very nice note.

876
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,600
I thought they were geniuses, not subgeniuses.

877
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,460
I published their stuff in my first Weirdo magazine, but I didn't really have anything to do with it.

878
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,620
And by the way,

879
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,480
I'm too old and you can't film me.

880
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,740
Was he still part of the Bay Area scene?

881
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,660
Certainly not.

882
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,380
He's lived in France for the last 20 years.

883
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:06,060
He's been living for two decades and more in a medieval hippie village in France in a chateau.

884
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,060
So try that on your piano.

885
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,620
And he's got an agent who protects him, too.

886
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,160
I didn't even know he was still alive.

887
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,380
Oh, of course.

888
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,040
He didn't know we were still alive.

889
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,820
Right.

890
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,440
He went out of his way to say so.

891
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,960
The last time Mavridis talked to him, he said,

892
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,040
So subgenius guys, they're still alive?

893
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,960
He's 10 years older than me.

894
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,840
Come on now.

895
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,040
Well, he knew that you lived hard.

896
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,940
I bet Gilbert Shelton would say nice things about us.

897
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,320
He would.

898
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,060
I bet he would, too.

899
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:34,680
He jammed.

900
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,860
He did jam with us once.

901
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,060
Well, his wife is Mr. Crumb's agent, after all.

902
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,980
Oh, now it all adds up.

903
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,220
Yeah.

904
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:44,940
Okay.

905
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,760
All righty.

906
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,560
Well, good.

907
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,760
Are any of David Sheridan's relatives still corpusculant?

908
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,200
I don't know about that.

909
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
He left us a long time ago.

910
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:01,100
But you see, there is a trend where the girlfriend of the famous cartoonist drags them out of

911
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:06,040
the U.S. to a life of European sybaritic luxury.

912
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:14,140
But the rest of us are sad and straightened without the strong satirical voice our world

913
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,080
and country need.

914
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,060
Oh, my God.

915
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,840
What other celebrities could they try to hit up?

916
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,160
Pee Wee Herman.

917
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,540
But again, Pee Wee Herman was just a guy who bought a membership a long time ago.

918
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,720
Oh, I know who they're getting.

919
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,900
Gary Panter.

920
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,880
Well, yeah, Gary Panter.

921
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,960
But nobody, he's not really famous.

922
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,220
David Byrne.

923
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,740
And what about Mark Mothersbaugh?

924
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,020
David Byrne.

925
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:37,420
David Byrne.

926
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:44,620
And it's not, and David Byrne did take an interest in us, but got distracted with other

927
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,000
things.

928
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,840
Indeed, in his movie, True Stories, there was supposed to be a scene with a subgenius

929
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:55,960
revival which nervous Hollywood executives had to change to a standard religious revival.

930
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:04,240
And yet, for those who pay attention to certain details, it's clear what the actual thing

931
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,940
was, the improvisation, the inspiration.

932
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:14,060
Everything changed when the Hollywood money came from the Ed Pressman Corporation.

933
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:18,600
Up until then, when it was just an underground movie, it was God was going to do the media

934
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:23,160
barrage, and David Byrne was going to be the preacher, and Puzzling Evidence was going

935
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,620
to be the Puzzling Evidence.

936
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,440
And that's why Byrne came out with that song, Puzzling Evidence.

937
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,760
We didn't get it from him.

938
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,760
It was about our guy known as Puzzling Evidence.

939
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,420
Simply true.

940
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,300
See how they do to you in the sideways media that's part of their organism and their orgasm?

941
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,940
No, I don't hold that against the truth.

942
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,040
I don't hold that against the truth.

943
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,200
David Byrne in the slightest.

944
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,500
I know how that kind of...

945
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,260
It was his first movie and his last basically.

946
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,320
It gets to be overwhelming.

947
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,220
Yeah.

948
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,900
He wore a huge hat in that movie, didn't he?

949
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,940
He wore many hats in the movie.

950
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,660
But, yes, he wore a big hat, a big suit.

951
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:02,260
I know that for a fact he wore many hats, but didn't he have a big, huge cowboy hat

952
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,760
that was four questions?

953
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,740
Well, I know I don't understand your point here.

954
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,120
A big, huge cowboy hat, is that necessarily...

955
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,360
That's what Yankees do when they're in Texas.

956
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,600
A signification of...

957
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,940
A gigantic cowboy hat.

958
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,780
Of...

959
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,540
Put on a pair of caps.

960
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,100
...villainy, pure villainy.

961
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,280
But putting on a cowboy hat doesn't make you LBJ.

962
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:27,660
No, my brother is an actual cattle rancher, well, former cattle rancher, now goat rancher.

963
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,220
I've never seen him in a cowboy hat, ever.

964
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,640
What kind of hat does he wear?

965
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,980
Have you ever seen him?

966
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,180
You've never noticed him making love with the goats and stuff like that?

967
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,100
A goat hat, of course.

968
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,080
Oh, okay.

969
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,180
Why a goat hat?

970
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,260
He wears something like a gimme cap.

971
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:43,680
Hmm.

972
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,180
And it doesn't say, make America goat again?

973
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,500
They do now.

974
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,040
Why?

975
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,760
They sure as heck do now.

976
00:46:49,920 --> 00:47:00,860
The greatest of all time ranch, or G-O-A-T ranch dot com, offers those t-shirts and goat yoga.

977
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:01,920
Yes.

978
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:11,740
You can go to Stang Ranch, pay money, and learn from a certified yoga instructor while in a pasture full of goats.

979
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:12,400
You don't like goats.

980
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,420
You're sure it's not goat yogurt?

981
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,040
Yeah, I was going to say, I like yogurt and I like goat cheese, so I'm like, yeah, yogurt

982
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,900
made from goat's milk.

983
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:19,180
Yeah.

984
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,840
But these are goats who do yoga, supposedly.

985
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:23,600
I mean...

986
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:23,860
Oh, yoga.

987
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,100
Yes, yoga.

988
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,760
One of them does the Indian rope trick.

989
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:28,880
Yeah.

990
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,060
That trick is very impressive.

991
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,040
It makes it a little bit more tender, right?

992
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,340
Isn't that part of the story of the old cat?

993
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,280
Just climbing the rope is hard for a goat.

994
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:40,120
Honestly, I read about goat yoga on the internet and thought it was a joke.

995
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,380
Then I read about it again and went, oh, there's really a goat.

996
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:42,380


997
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:42,380


998
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:42,380


999
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:42,380


1000
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,560
There's really somebody in Oregon doing that.

1001
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,180
How funny.

1002
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,440
I'll have to tell my brother.

1003
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,000
But why?

1004
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,920
The next day, I'm driving down the high road of the ranch.

1005
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:56,920
I look down at the goat pasture and there's a dozen young women in yoga sweat clothes

1006
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,640
doing goat yoga.

1007
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:02,680
Not only was it a real thing, it was happening in my backyard.

1008
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:09,860
On your property, you've got these leotard-wearing devotees who are in danger of having their

1009
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,360
yoga mats nibbled by a wolf.

1010
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:12,360


1011
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,260
Wandering goats.

1012
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:13,960
That's true.

1013
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:20,600
I'm sure this was invented by a very lonely goat herder who just wanted to see a bunch

1014
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,040
of women in tight clothing.

1015
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,300
Well, it's caught on by wildfire.

1016
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,980
Back when he was a very, very small baby.

1017
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,500
Now they call it the-

1018
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,280
That's when he climbed out of the womb and said, this is planet Earth, you know?

1019
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:37,540
Because that was the cave that was holy to his family and the refugees and stuff.

1020
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:42,280
I know all about that Middle Eastern stuff because I was a refugee too one time.

1021
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:42,360
Yeah.

1022
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,140
From the lands of goats and Jehovah, you mean?

1023
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:51,340
Oh, well, goats and Middle Eastern flavors go together, especially when they got, you

1024
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,120
know, the heads removed, the cabriolet suza.

1025
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:59,120
And sometimes they can make them fart in little bottles at state fairs in different parts

1026
00:48:59,120 --> 00:48:59,280
of the area.

1027
00:48:59,280 --> 00:48:59,840
And paint it.

1028
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:00,980
Yeah.

1029
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:02,580
Goat chinkum.

1030
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,500
Who's ever heard of it?

1031
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,360
We laughed at the shot of real things.

1032
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:05,420
Goat chinkum.

1033
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:05,700
Oh, yeah.

1034
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,720
You know, you've heard of the downward dog.

1035
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,580
Now you're going to hear about the downward goat, I guess.

1036
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,360
I just-

1037
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,740
I just can't keep up with it.

1038
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,860
A downward facing goat.

1039
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,160
They do have the eyes of Satan.

1040
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,500
They do.

1041
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,300
That's why I love them.

1042
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:20,460
Yeah.

1043
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,820
What have they done to his eyes?

1044
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,560
That's what Rosemary's baby said.

1045
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,420
They goaded him up.

1046
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:26,080
No, they-

1047
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,780
Their pupils are a bit puzzling.

1048
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,220
Yes.

1049
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:35,560
They have those slant and dicular eyes that look out at you out of the corner.

1050
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,040
Man, I'm getting hungry for some goat now.

1051
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,440
Like I can seriously go for some goat vindaloo.

1052
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,940
Where do you get it?

1053
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,360
Goat vindaloo.

1054
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,980
Where do you go to have Cabrito in this city?

1055
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,120
A non-vegetarian Indian restaurant.

1056
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,400
Cabrito can be quite delicious, but when you think of what you're really eating, then

1057
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:51,940
you get sad.

1058
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:55,280
You can get Birria Michoacan at La Plaza.

1059
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,140
It's mostly on the west side.

1060
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,840
Yeah, figures.

1061
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,040
But they're probably, their kitchen's probably closed at this hour.

1062
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:04,660
Right.

1063
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:10,120
There's a Jamaican place on the east side that serves goat only on Tuesdays.

1064
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:11,380
It closed.

1065
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:11,840
Oh, they closed?

1066
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,100
I thought it was goat custard.

1067
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,720
Well, so much for the-

1068
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,880
And we never made it there.

1069
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:20,960
If we're going to have any goat, we're just going to have to rustle one of my brother's

1070
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:27,960
goats or buy it, kill it, which is hard for me to imagine actually because they're so

1071
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:28,220
cute.

1072
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:28,960
They are adorable.

1073
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:29,340
They are.

1074
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,400
Strain it.

1075
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,260
The cuter they are, the more fun it is to kill them.

1076
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,780
Skin it, gut it, in something like that order.

1077
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,840
Chop it up.

1078
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,660
You hang it up.

1079
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,520
And it has to be a baby because the grown ones are tough.

1080
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,340
They're too tough.

1081
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:40,760
Yes.

1082
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,380
And then you whip it.

1083
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,960
Thrice Whippet Goat is the finest.

1084
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,740
Thrice Whippet Goat?

1085
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:51,720
Then you put it on your Rolling Stones album cover and Bob's your uncle.

1086
00:50:51,920 --> 00:51:00,200
And you get Alessandro Jodorowsky to come over and make an incomprehensible movie of the flayed, hanging, dead goat.

1087
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,460
Yeah, an Andalusian dog.

1088
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,900
You get to walk around like in a satanic ritual and stuff like that.

1089
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,640
To do the downward Andalusian dog.

1090
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:13,880
Oswald, J.R., Lee Harvey, Ozzy, Oswald.

1091
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:20,740
The Lee Harvey wallbanger at the bar, the full bar.

1092
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,900
Damn right full bar.

1093
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:26,160
We don't have no monkey words.

1094
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,860
I can't see what you think.

1095
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,340
Man, you can see the kind of noises they're making nowadays.

1096
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,100
I can see.

1097
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,220
Trouble in Congress and throughout this could end the world tomorrow.

1098
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,460
As we speak.

1099
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:42,000
Yes, well, we know that won't happen.

1100
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:47,880
It only will happen, well, actually we are now less sure as to when it's going to.

1101
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,040
We can't go away.

1102
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:54,600
These new revelations are going to cause us to do some recalculating.

1103
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,660
It might happen and we might die.

1104
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,280
Yes, tomorrow.

1105
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,200
Tomorrow.

1106
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:04,260
But I think we're going to go to Starwood Festival instead.

1107
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,220
Well, we would have done that either way.

1108
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,580
I've been saying for...

1109
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,120
For 22 years now.

1110
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,940
Starwood will be on my escape fest.

1111
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:14,360
Yes.

1112
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:21,080
But if worst comes to worst, it'll still be at the campground.

1113
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,120
Well, I was going to beam the campground up.

1114
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:24,580
Yes.

1115
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,600
A new heaven and a new earth.

1116
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:26,980
Right.

1117
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:31,640
Everything will be redone and fresher than usual.

1118
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,720
It's like watching two people turn into Trotsky and Lenin.

1119
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,620
You know what I'm saying?

1120
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:37,340
No.

1121
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:37,740
No.

1122
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,320
One so far to the left, he's actually to the right.

1123
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,460
The other one so far to the left, right.

1124
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:46,540
The pendulums flung all the way out there and stuff.

1125
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,460
Heredity or environment?

1126
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:50,480
Environment.

1127
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:51,560
Yeah.

1128
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,300
Oh, yeah?

1129
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,020
You think environment?

1130
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:53,740
Okay.

1131
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:54,840
Well, probably, yeah.

1132
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,420
I mean, they weren't born to be Trotsky and Lenin.

1133
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,520
You can't, you know, do your weightlifting drills and everything.

1134
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,880
Why the hell are you here on earth?

1135
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,260
Eh.

1136
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:03,660
Eh.

1137
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:08,620
Well, one must persist until one dies.

1138
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,800
Does it the right way.

1139
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,320
Oh, man.

1140
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,880
You just turned my stomach like a pound of butter.

1141
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,040
That's right.

1142
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,400
Practice makes perfect.

1143
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:24,100
And that churning, butter-filled stomach only shows that we don't do it in a blithe way,

1144
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:30,900
but are afflicted with peril and must behave in a valorous fashion to ascend this summit.

1145
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,960
That's why you see Hindus believe in dogs.

1146
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:37,040
Or Hindus believe in more than one fashion.

1147
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,360
Well, they've got a huge pantheon to keep track of.

1148
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,920
All we have is a guy with a pipe.

1149
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,080
Oh, so true.

1150
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:46,400
And that...

1151
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,540
Was that him?

1152
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,120
Well, we...

1153
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,640
Did you hear that bleep sound?

1154
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,700
It sounded like a bleep sound.

1155
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,700
It sounded like Bob was peeking through the wires underneath the brush.

1156
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,760
Bob don't bleep?

1157
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,440
Does Bob bleep shows?

1158
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,480
I don't think Bob cares what anybody says.

1159
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,260
He's a pathetic freak.

1160
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,680
Damn you.

1161
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,280
Can't you see that?

1162
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,440
He's the world's most slackful individual.

1163
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,900
That's why we never see him at X-Day, I suppose.

1164
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:24,320
Of course, he used to come to subgenius shows, but that puzzling evidence guy would always shoot him dead.

1165
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:29,140
He's met with jealous hostility from the head of other cults.

1166
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:29,640
Well, he did.

1167
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:34,060
Actually, puzzling evidence was just the only person following Bob's orders,

1168
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,260
because Bob had specifically said...

1169
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:42,420
Much like the Buddha suggested, if you see me on the highway, kill me.

1170
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:43,640
I've...

1171
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:44,520
I...

1172
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,620
And most people took that as some sort of a Zen thing.

1173
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,580
Plus, they didn't actually see Bob anywhere on the highway.

1174
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,020
I've seen Bob.

1175
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,820
Or if they did, he was going too fast and shot right by him.

1176
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,540
I thought he was Bob, officer.

1177
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,560
I've seen Bob get killed.

1178
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:00,380
Am I?

1179
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,140
I've seen it happen.

1180
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,080
Oh, I've seen it happen, yeah.

1181
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:02,940
I was right there.

1182
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,620
I didn't even have to lift a finger.

1183
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,320
I was about to do it, but...

1184
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,220
You know, he walked into this coffee shop I was at, and...

1185
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,620
I've heard this story.

1186
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,100
Yeah.

1187
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:14,500
Yeah, this...

1188
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,080
No, it's true.

1189
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,140
He met Bob.

1190
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,760
Yeah, and like he...

1191
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,920
You know, they're telling him,

1192
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,440
Hey, man, you can't smoke that pipe in here.

1193
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,600
And, of course, asking Bob to remove his pipe from his mouth

1194
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,020
is like asking you or me to remove an arm or a leg.

1195
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,620
Yes, about the same, actually.

1196
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:28,740
Yeah.

1197
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:29,560
It's just really impossible.

1198
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,440
And he just stood there grinning at the barista.

1199
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,680
All he can do.

1200
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,440
That's all he has to do.

1201
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:36,840
That's all.

1202
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:37,020


1203
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:37,020


1204
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:37,580
He has to do.

1205
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,980
And 99% of the time, actually 100% of the time,

1206
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,220
he'll get something good out of it.

1207
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,860
In this case, though, it resulted in him

1208
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,540
eventually getting chucked out the front door

1209
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,260
and thrown into the street right as a bus came along.

1210
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,300
And ran over.

1211
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:55,400
Ran over.

1212
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,180
Thrown under the bus.

1213
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,420
And after the bus went by, he was gone.

1214
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,660
There was no trace of him.

1215
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,720
The next day, I saw him...

1216
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,640
The next day, I saw him walking down the street again.

1217
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:07,460
And I was like, oh, my God.

1218
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,720
That time, I killed myself.

1219
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,440
It felt pretty good.

1220
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,100
Wow.

1221
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:11,560
Yeah.

1222
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,520
I can remember...

1223
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:12,900
He loved it.

1224
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,940
He loved every minute of it.

1225
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,440
He was smiling through the whole thing.

1226
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:15,760
I bet.

1227
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,880
It wouldn't happen if he didn't want it to happen.

1228
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:19,560
He's like that.

1229
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:19,560


1230
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:23,880
Even the worst things that happened to him are good luck because he is...

1231
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,520
It provides benefit in some unknown way.

1232
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:27,960
Yeah.

1233
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,000
Sometimes he wants pain as contrast.

1234
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:32,820
I guess it's an unconscious thing.

1235
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,940
He has so much slack.

1236
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,060
He has so much slack.

1237
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,540
I thought he got a little bit of pain.

1238
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:36,940
He's getting tired.

1239
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:36,980
I thought he got a little bit of pain.

1240
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:36,980


1241
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:36,980


1242
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:37,700
He's getting tired of having slack.

1243
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,400
He's getting tired of having other side flavors.

1244
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,420
He's saying, please, I've had enough slack.

1245
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,300
He says, give me slack or kill me, but you cannot give him slack because he's literally

1246
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,360
saturated with it.

1247
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:48,640
But you certainly can if you want to kill him.

1248
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,480
Which is why you have to kill him.

1249
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:56,140
I think it's the subgeniuses in general who say, give me slack or kill me, and it's...

1250
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,720
Actually, it was mainly sterno.

1251
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:58,480
Yes.

1252
00:56:58,820 --> 00:56:59,600
The uncompromising.

1253
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,800
But, you know, I mean, like I've heard that all the luck in the universe...

1254
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,960
In modern, you know, millennial periods of time, like 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000,

1255
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:06,960


1256
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:11,080
2011 and stuff like that, I think it's just far too ridiculous.

1257
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,180
I've heard that he's like a black hole when it comes to luck.

1258
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:18,900
Like all the good luck and bad luck in the universe gets sucked into him and it comes

1259
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,400
out as just whatever.

1260
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,660
It's distorted as it is sucked in.

1261
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,440
It changes in nature.

1262
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,520
I believe...

1263
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,460
See, all right.

1264
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,580
So, you know, a lot of people talk about Jesus Christ being the Lord because he rose from

1265
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:31,860
the dead.

1266
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,320
Well, you know, Jesus only did that once.

1267
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,400
How many times has Bob...

1268
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,800
Died and come back, huh?

1269
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:38,760
Right, right.

1270
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,800
Then the Jehovah's Witnesses only waited for the end of the world like 17 times.

1271
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,400
And we've waited 22 times for the end of the world.

1272
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:46,960
They're amateur.

1273
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:47,400
Yeah.

1274
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:47,760
Yeah.

1275
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,300
And like, you know...

1276
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:53,260
Just because there's 88 keys doesn't mean that nobody's singing the Santa Claus or playing

1277
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,320
the wrong song.

1278
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,960
And Jesus said that he is the Alpha and the Omega.

1279
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:00,420
Well, Bob is both the mouth and the anus of the universe.

1280
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,300
How's that for your Alpha and Omega?

1281
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:02,560
Yes, but that's absurd.

1282
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,180
But he's almost the Monsieur.

1283
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:04,880
Well, I don't know.

1284
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,700
You know, that's pretty much all it is, is unassigned flavors.

1285
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,740
That's why I'm for a real Ray Dopretto Originalist doctrine and stuff.

1286
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,360
Not everything is on the menu, though.

1287
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,920
Speaking of mouths and...

1288
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,160
He's stricken from the menu a few times.

1289
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,660
Speaking of mouths and anuses, this is WCSB Cleveland 89.3 FM.

1290
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,040
And blind mouths that feed.

1291
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,720
Portions of the following broadcast will be objectionable to some members of the audience.

1292
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,700
Therefore, WCSB advises listener discretion.

1293
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:34,860
Please contact your local WCSB representative.

1294
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:38,600
The views and opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of WCSB or

1295
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,580
Cleveland State University or anyone with their head screwed on straight for that matter.

1296
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:49,000
You're listening to a very special episode of Synesthesia, guest hosted with Dr. Howell,

1297
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,500
Princess We Are Doe, and the Reverend Ivan Stang.

1298
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,580
I am Dr. Sinister.

1299
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,780
And I am Dr. Sinister and I am actually cutting out early as I have for the last few weeks

1300
00:58:59,780 --> 00:58:59,980
here.

1301
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,080
Oh, cutting out.

1302
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,420
This is a temporary arrangement.

1303
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,580
So, we're going to pause here.

1304
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:08,160
To flip CDs, I guess.

1305
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,360
To do the big switch over.

1306
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,760
To do the big switcheroo on you.

1307
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,440
I will be back next week.

1308
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,280
That's not a threat.

1309
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,260
That's a promise.

1310
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,040
Until then, you keep it surreal.

1311
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:20,080
And stay tuned for more madcap fun.

1312
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:20,800
Woo hoo.

1313
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,520
I'm on some cowboy Dave, I forgot to tell you.

1314
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:24,860
.

1315
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:25,200

1328
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:30,480
.

1329
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:30,480


1330
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:32,920

1331
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:32,920


1332
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:32,920


1333
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:32,920
