00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
Actually, live and direct, our Slack fans, we actually have the Reverend is live and direct here in the house.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,100
So we're going to Slackers and Slackites, we will be getting a sermon live and direct.

3
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:17,580
Slackites?

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:18,940
Slackites?

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,240
Yeah, Slackites.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,060
Okay.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,280
Those are the ones that hang from the ceiling.

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:23,900
Okay.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,060
I don't listen to the radio.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,000
I read books.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,240
Don't be that guy that reads books.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,860
Listen to WCFB Cleveland 89.3 FM.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,420
From PR News in Washington, I'm the nation's drug czar.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:53,680
President Trump said that says the president is justifying false controversy over his fresh claim that his president didn't call families and nearby oil fields.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,860
President Trump said PR report.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,780
President Trump suggesting that he was killed while he was nine years old.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,980
In southern Afghanistan in Afghanistan.

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,040
I mean, you could ask, did he call him as Bob Williams?

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,360
No one could ask you my obrums.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,840
Trump said on Monday he was nine years old.

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,440
I guess I write letters and I also guess I call.

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,840
PR's reports.

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,860
Last month.

24
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,160
Reporting bad PR news.

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,540
On Wall Street, 22-972-1516-23.

26
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:28,500
I think 23 is only a number, but it's a number, you know, and so I think it's not the number.

27
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,240
Hugh Johnson.

28
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,720
Didn't stay that high very long.

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,920
At last checked.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,760
U.S.-backed militias in Syria say this is PR news from Washington and called it a self-declared caliphate.

31
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,520
Kenya's deputy president says.

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,920
The essence of all this.

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Kenyan deputy president says that, quote.

34
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:55,320
Kenya is taking part in an international effort to help Washington as that city attempts to recover from Saturday's PR news in Washington.

35
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,400
You saw me crying.

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,800
And the.

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,080
Self-genius.

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,420
Power of.

39
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,280
Squash.

40
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,300
The tears I shed were tears of.

41
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,100
Squash.

42
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,560
And you'll surely find the way.

47
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:49,620
Once upon a time in an ordinary town, a rather ordinary man named Broderick returned home from his ordinary job and stared blankly into his refrigerator.

48
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:59,140
Broderick decided it would be nice to heat up a Swanson's frozen turkey dinner and spend the rest of his evening binge viewing season.

49
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,220


50
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,080
Two of Duck Dynasty.

51
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:13,580
While he was waiting on his delicious turkey dinner, Broderick drank three cans of malt liquor and took ten hits of Hindu Kush from his beautiful red bomb.

52
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,760
Then he got up to take a piss.

53
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:23,340
But when he walked through the kitchen, he found a tiny little black caterpillar that seemed lost.

54
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,380
He picked it up with a tissue and was going to flush it down the toilet.

55
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:39,140
But in a moment of drug-induced compassion, Broderick decided to release the caterpillar into his backyard, where it would have a chance at a second life.

56
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:48,000
He opened the screen door, climbed down the rickety wooden steps, and set the little caterpillar down in the soft green grass.

57
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,580
But when it didn't move, Broderick realized it wasn't a caterpillar at all.

58
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,620
It was just a silly old clump of lint from an old sweater.

59
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,280
Broderick chuckled to himself and said,

60
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,180
Gosh, I must be very, very stoned.

61
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,820
I must remember to buy more of that wonderful marijuana from the nice man at the Department of Motor Vehicles.

62
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,300
Broderick went back inside to the bathroom, sat down on the toilet, and began reading a magazine.

63
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,680
While he was passing wind, he felt something damp brushing against his nether regions.

64
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,600
And before he could react, a long black tentacle sprang up from between his legs.

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,320
It wrapped itself around his testicles and began pulling ferociously at his delicate genitalia.

66
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:50,400
A strange razor-sharp cartilage emerged and began sawing at the base of his spotum, and blood sprayed out in all directions.

67
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,040
The strange tentacle also had an ingenious noise cancellation device,

68
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:03,880
which muffled Broderick's screams as it ripped his legs from their sockets and spun them in all directions around the bathroom

69
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,780
before tossing them into a quivering pile of veins and sinew in the mildew-encrusted bathtub.

70
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,580
When Broderick woke up at the hospital,

71
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:30,000
all of his family and friends were there, and everyone had a nice time recounting the day's events.

72
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,540
But Broderick's mom had brought him a surprise.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,360
Her eyes turned towards the hospital tray, and that's when Broderick saw it.

74
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,200
They remembered to bring his Swanson turkey dinner, with apple cobbler for dessert.

75
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,340
This was going to be the best Labor Day weekend ever.

76
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,700
And the best day ever.

77
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:54,700


78
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,500
And the best day ever.

79
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,300
And the best day ever.

80
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,300
And the best day ever.

81
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,020
And now, my friends, we have a very special guest vocalist.

82
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,720
A living legend from the beginnings of rhythm and blues.

83
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,020
Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only...

84
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,140
Bob!

85
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,760
He's gonna get me!

86
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,100
Honey, honey, who's gonna get you?

87
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,040
The President!

88
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,260
I saw him!

89
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,600
He's gonna get me!

90
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,960
The bomb dropped by the US President took out the entire city of Toronto,

91
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,560
and Fallout is expected to kill thousands more in the coming days.

92
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,900
Guess that's all the Whites can hope for these days.

93
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,520
Oh, for f***'s sake, White!

94
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,260
He's running around eating our pets and terrorizing our kids!

95
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,780
Okay, good. That's right.

96
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,300
So best thing is just lock up your garbage, and see if we can get the President to go away.

97
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,900
What are you doing, Bob?

98
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,280
Ah!

99
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,460
Have you been putting food out for the President?

100
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,000
Bob, come on.

101
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,460
You have to know it's not safe to have him here.

102
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,960
Bob, if Canada finds out the President is hiding here, they are going to nuke us!

103
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,680
What?

104
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,600
I think we have to assume that the President has...

105
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,560
eaten them.

106
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,800
Why are you here talking to me instead of trying to find the President?

107
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,280
Don't worry, we're close.

108
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,980
He's out in the woods somewhere.

109
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,160
Hackman Fears!

110
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,240
He's out in the woods somewhere.

111
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,380
Hackman Fears!

112
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,020
Hackman Fears!

113
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,300
Oh yeah, that's better.

114
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,880
Can we go, please?

115
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,940
I've got a Hackman Fears!

116
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,620
Hackman Fears!

117
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,340
I'm going out of my mind!

118
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,820
Going out of my mind!

119
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,320
Here it is!

120
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:34,900
I've got a Hack...

121
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,620
Bob, for the love of Pete, our country is about to go to war!

122
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,180
I'm past being grown up.

123
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,700
I'm old and withered.

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I am dead.

125
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,220
They wave ten pounds of wieners at me for the sake of the President.

126
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,220


127
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,800
But for no reason at all, they ask me if I'd like to go on a wiener fry.

128
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,180
I tell them no.

129
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,920
I've got you, Kanda!

130
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,240
I've got you, Kanda!

131
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,720
Did you eat your parents?

132
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,780
Rip, rip, rip, rip, rip them!

133
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,860
I've got pills for you guys, too!

134
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,740
My father ate that!

135
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,600
Dance, dogs, home, out!

136
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,980
Dance, dogs, home, out!

137
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,140
Scientists kill millions of free-roaming cats annually.

138
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,400
Cats face a host of hazards ranging from accidents to poisoning to disease.

139
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,600
Few cats survive, even if they appear to have escaped.

140
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,520
Come and do it. I am waiting.

141
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,680
I'm not going to take it anymore!

142
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,760
I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!

143
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,920
I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!

144
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,900
I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!

145
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,740
I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!

146
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,960
I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!

147
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,300
But you want to know something?

148
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,360
I think you're the freak.

149
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,940
I think you're the one that's different.

150
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,980
I can release a destructive power in a human being

151
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,200
that would make the split atom seem like a blessing.

152
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,860
But you're the one that's different.

153
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,780
To put it country simple,

154
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,280
Earth has a lot of things other folks might want,

155
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,320
like the whole planet.

156
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,000
And maybe these folks would like a few changes made.

157
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,380
Ow! I feel good!

158
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,260

00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,120
in the diesel in the Appalachia Mines?

176
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,140
Look with awe and wonder drifting way up high

177
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,980
where men who braved a hard new world

178
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,420
first stepped on the diesel in the city dock?

179
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,120
Do you think of them when you stroll along a

180
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,880
rock?

181
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,060
Ray-eye.

182
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,560
Have you seen the mighty Peet?

183
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,900
Have you seen an eagle roll along Missouri's shore?

184
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,240
Have you felt it rage along the shore?

185
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,840
Is the word why a Mary?

186
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,080
From Alaska's Everglades to Maine,

187
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,260
my heart runs out.

188
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,780
My pulse risest at the might for Domain.

189
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,500
You ask me why I love her?

190
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,020
I've a million Appalachia Mines.

191
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,220
My beautiful Appalachia Mines.

192
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,360
Beneath God's wide-hold fog sky.

193
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:34,300
And found my good from shining sea to sea.

194
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,340
Ah!

195
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,240
Ah!

196
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,240


197
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,240


198
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,760
Ah!

199
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,580
Ah!

200
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,800
Ah!

201
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


202
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


203
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


204
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


205
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


206
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


207
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


208
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


209
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


210
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


211
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


212
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


213
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


214
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


215
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


216
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


217
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


218
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


219
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


220
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


221
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


222
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


223
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


224
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


225
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


226
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


227
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,800


228
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,740
Dear friends, and thank you for that lovely collage there.

229
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,600
Fernanda Nandy, Lee Murr, and John Wayne.

230
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,480
That, and also the titles, and also for,

231
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,440
oh, that longer collage, Media Barrage,

232
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,380
there was by,

233
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,020
Cool Hand Chris.

234
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,720
I have no idea what the source material was,

235
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,420
although it was just called Track One.

236
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,160
But what you want to know about, I know,

237
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,640
is that little story about Broderick and the Magic Caterpillar.

238
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,280
And that's from a brand new Rudy Schwartz project album

239
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,160
called Postal Code for Ham that just came out.

240
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,720
And that song had yours truly on vocals.

241
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:47,400
But now we have this new song by the El Queso All-Stars.

242
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:56,220
And it's called Practice What You Preach.

243
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:39,680
And it's called Practice What You Preach.

244
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,380
Violence is bad

245
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,480
And if you try to prove me wrong

246
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,780
I'll kick your ass

247
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,920
So you just better love your neighbor

248
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,220
Don't drive fast

249
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,240
When you're cruising in your car

250
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,600
But let me pass

251
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,800
Come on now, do a guy a favor

252
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,180
I don't take my homemade remedies

253
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,880
Cause they're no good for me

254
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,180
But I'll force them down the throat

255
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,320
Of every person I see

256
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,580
I don't practice what I preach

257
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,700
Because I'm not a man of my word

258
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:09,700


259
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:09,700


260
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:09,700


261
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:09,700


262
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,720
I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to

263
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,180
And the lessons that I teach weren't meant to be

264
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,600
To a guy like me, cause they're for you

265
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,460
You can say that I'm a hypocrite

266
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,360
And all your stupid friends will think it's true

267
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,760
But I don't practice what I preach

268
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,980
Because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to

269
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,120
I don't practice what I preach

270
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,960
Cause I don't listen to music

271
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,980
And listen to ministry

272
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,340
Kinda get the ш me

273
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,540
Don't you hear this man?

274
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:05,540


275
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:05,540


276
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:05,540


277
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:05,760
Nothing goes up to the sky

278
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,020
But one life will rise another day

279
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,140
I come out hitting Ted Mechord cross Animal Friends

280
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,160
And it's without the'll of me

281
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,560
I just need to do dei—

282
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,860
I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

283
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,620
And the lessons that I teach weren't meant to reach a guy like me, because they're for you.

284
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:30,380
You can say that I'm a hypocrite, and all your stupid friends will think it's true.

285
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:39,040
But I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

286
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,700
And I think you're trying too hard at not trying hard enough.

287
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,120
The slack you lack will kick your ass because you're acting tough.

288
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,300
I know I leave you questions that you just don't understand.

289
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,920
But you can buy the answers, thirty-five bucks cash in hand.

290
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:05,240
I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

291
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,940
And the lessons that I teach weren't meant to reach a guy like me, because they're for you.

292
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,740
You can say that I'm a hypocrite, and all your stupid friends will think it's true.

293
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,360
But I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

294
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,380
And I'm preaching to.

295
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,340
And friends, that was the El Queso All-Stars.

296
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,000
With a new song, Practice What I Preach.

297
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,360
And this show is being broadcast and recorded on Sunday, July 4th.

298
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,700
At WCSB in Cleveland.

299
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,760
Four days before Thursday, July 5th.

300
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,700
At 7 a.m. X-Day, when the world will end for the normals.

301
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,380
And begin for the subgeniuses.

302
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,380
We just got back to Cleveland from Texas with a new doggie.

303
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,760
And we're about to drive five hours to the Wisteria Campground in Southern Ohio.

304
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,080
Which is going to make little Buddy.

305
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,500
Think we're homeless gypsies.

306
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:40,440
And then, suddenly, we'll be aboard my planet-sized escape and pleasure saucer built for countless.

307
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,880
And that little hell dog will really be confused.

308
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,120
Although, you know, that reminds me.

309
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,780
I'd better buy him a subgenius ordainment kit immediately.

310
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,580
Or he'll be left behind.

311
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,680
Like most of my neighbors and countrymen.

312
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,360
Friends, you should think about your priorities.

313
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:00,940
And your pets, too.

314
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,880
My fellow subgeniuses.

315
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,600
Otherwise, you'll be rising up to the saucers at 7 a.m.

316
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,240
Calling to your poor little pup, Spot.

317
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,660
Come, Spot, come.

318
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,540
But Spot will be stuck on the ground.

319
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,860
Because if he doesn't have that subgenius minister's card, Spot can't come with you.

320
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,980
But Buddy and y'all don't need to worry.

321
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,540
I'll beam up the Wisteria Campground.

322
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,380
The WCSB studios.

323
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,000
My old slacker mansion.

324
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,760
All of Stang Ranch.

325
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,760
Plus various museums and national and state parks.

326
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,220
Because to me, my friends,

327
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,560
X-Day isn't about destruction so much as preservation.

328
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:52,480
To my slack-filled heart, it's an opportunity to save everything cool from the humans.

329
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,880
Such as the subgeniuses.

330
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,520
And I'll let them do most of the killing and torturing while I'm gone.

331
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:58,520


332
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,540
While I go down my list.

333
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,740
Beaming up wonders of nature.

334
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,140
Majestic cathedrals.

335
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,800
And antique toy warehouses.

336
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,280
And now let's get back to this unusual collage.

337
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,140
By the cool, cool hand, Chris.

338
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,920
Praise Bob.

339
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:27,280
Oh, this music in the background, by the way, is by Reverend Nicholas McNutt.

340
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,880
It's called a sonata or tribute to John Lear.

341
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,360
And McNutt, he might be related to me.

342
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,340
Sort of.

343
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,300
Okay.

344
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:38,980
Okay.

345
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:39,900
Alright.

346
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,620
Three, two, and one.

347
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,480
Now to continue with the tape recording.

348
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,140
These guys need to turn those frowns upside down.

349
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,080
And I got just the thing for that.

350
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,580
We call it...

351
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,060
Bob.

352
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,540
How much for your wife?

353
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:07,000
that I'm answering your question about the

354
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,000


355
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,000


356
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,980
Boy, we're all doomed.

357
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,080
Difficult part.

358
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:26,940
Ah!

359
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:27,240
Daddy!

360
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,600
Get some more money for you tomorrow.

361
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
Oh my god.

362
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,400
That looks like a second plane.

363
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,860
We do not forgive.

364
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,320
We do not forget.

365
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,920
Get back to work, you slacker.

366
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,580
Get all the freaking cops away from the building.

367
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,120
What's wrong?

368
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,380
That's it.

369
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,820
One day.

370
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,500
Gotta go.

371
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,120
Bitch, remove yourselves from the location.

372
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,080
I'm a such person.

373
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,200
Remove yourselves from the location at this time.

374
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,980
We got another tower collapse.

375
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,040
Look at me.

376
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,400
I'll help you if you want me to.

377
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,480
Don't be afraid.

378
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,220
I'm blind, but I can see through your soul.

379
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,640
And I can tell you're good.

380
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,920
Don't be afraid.

381
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,640
You never did know when to quit, did you?

382
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,740
Can you take a hint?

383
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,760
I want you to get out and leave me alone.

384
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,300
I don't want you around, do you hear?

385
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,460
They hate you.

386
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,080
They hate you when you...

387
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,640
question them.

388
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,220
They hate you when you expose them.

389
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,500
They hate you when you speak out.

390
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,700
They hate you when you resist.

391
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,300
They hate you when you stand together.

392
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,160
They hate you when you fight back.

393
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,800
I don't know who you are, where you're from, or what you want.

394
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,620
But if you threaten my freedom,

395
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,920
I'll kill you.

396
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,840
Access denied.

397
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,960
Why is it so important that you want to contact the governments of our Earth?

398
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,660
Because of death.

399
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,560
Because all you of Earth are idiots.

400
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,940

00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,300
and the

413
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:06,020
We have members throughout society, and all stratas of it worldwide.

414
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,400
Yet we have no leadership.

415
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,640
It's one voice. It's not individual voices.

416
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,660
That's why we don't show our faces. That's why we don't give our names.

417
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,240
We're speaking as one, and it's a collective.

418
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,240
We're given this gift, don't you know? The ability to understand.

419
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,160
Yet no one wants to understand.

420
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,200
We're given the ability to read.

421
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,060
I mean, read Nietzsche.

422
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,500
Read Thomas Mann. Read Spengler.

423
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,120
Joyce. Rimbaud.

424
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,640
Everything's out of whack.

425
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,480
People just worry about money now and deny their inner self.

426
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,000
Money. Money.

427
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:43,160
They walk through the night crowd protected by money, lulled by money, dulled by money.

428
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,860
No least single object anywhere that is not money.

429
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,940
Money. Money everywhere and still not enough.

430
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,380
And then no money, or little money, or less money, or more money.

431
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,120
But money. Always money.

432
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,660
And if you have money or you don't have money, it's the money that counts.

433
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,220
And money matters.

434
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,940
Money makes money. But what makes money make money?

435
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,200
Keep your mouth shut!

436
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,120
Easy, easy, Reverend!

437
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,500
That whole game, that whole game, somewhere.

438
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,700
And the movies, the movies ain't doing but program your thing.

439
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,240
They say, put them all on dope.

440
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,540
And all the movies start glamorizing drugs.

441
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,840
That's what Hollywood is about. Hollywood ain't about a trick.

442
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,340
Glamorize drugs. The French Connection Academy Award winning.

443
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,080
And how many have seen a movie called Midnight Express?

444
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,220
About a white bar over there.

445
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,780
And a turkey smuggling drugs.

446
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,620
And they caught him.

447
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,920
And the movie made the white drug smuggling the hero.

448
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,120
And the Turks who caught him made him the pig.

449
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,080
Help you out, champ.

450
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,700
Yes.

451
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,640
I just don't want to grow anymore.

452
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,060
I don't want to grow anymore.

453
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,940
Most illogical.

454
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:49,980
Blast him!

455
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,180
I saw him! He's gonna get me!

456
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,200
I saw him! He's gonna get me!

457
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,540
The bomb dropped by the U.S. President took out the entire city of Toronto.

458
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,120
And Fallout is expected to kill thousands more in the coming days.

459
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,480
Guess that's all the whites can hope for these days.

460
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,060
Oh, for f*** sake, white!

461
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,820
He's running around eating our pets and terrorizing our kids!

462
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,360
Okay, good. That's right.

463
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,440
So best thing is just lock up your garbage.

464
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,860
And see if we can get the President to go away.

465
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,680
Bob, for the love of Pete, our country is about to go to war!

466
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,540
You wanna know where there's a war?

467
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,860
There's a war on Christmas!

468
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,400
Nobody cares about that!

469
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,280
Cause guess who loves Christmas?

470
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:28,700
Bob?

471
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,700
BLEAAAGH!

472
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,020
BLEAAAGH!

473
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,380
BLEAAAGH!

474
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,380
BLEAAAGH!

475
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:33,780
BLEAAAGH!

476
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:33,780


477
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,280
I am your father.

478
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,280
Suspicious auditory stimulus detected.

479
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,620
Heaven will never be an extension of your body!

480
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,260
Your body will always belong to someone else.

481
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,200
The moon ripens and turns red.

482
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,560
It rots and is swallowed by the darkness.

483
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,300
They call this living.

484
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:04,220
There must be kind durante this time.

485
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,940
But the air, this land obviamente, has something to hold on.

486
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:12,740
Some values sự 발생 from time overseas are not a matter of public expression

487
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:26,380
Shoot compilator for real time measurement,

488
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:36,920
We are sailors on the deep In the storm's raging power

489
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:48,220
And the captain is asleep See us through the sinking hour

490
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:07,060
We are pilots in the blue Losing contact with the tower

491
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:18,340
No horizon lining you Talk us through the sinking hour

492
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,520
And the hammer striking louder

493
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,360
And the hammer striking louder And the hammer striking louder

494
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,180
As we face the sinking hour

495
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,320
As we face the sinking hour

496
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,160
We are sculptors of the storm We are sailors on the deep

497
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:18,200
And the captain is asleep See us through the sinking hour

498
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,000
Only con-de-sci-te

499
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,000


500
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,000


501
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,000


502
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,000


503
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,180
And the hammer striking louder

504
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:29,780
And the hammer striking louder As we face the sinking hour

505
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,140
We are sculptors of the storm We are sailors on the deep

506
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:48,240
We are merchants moving minds

507
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,200
Towards life

508
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,340
And it's now or never

509
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,200
One more time

510
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,240
Walk with me

511
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,300
The sinking hour

512
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:12,500
And the hammer striking louder

513
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,180
As we pass

514
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,360
The sinking hour

515
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:56,320
And the hammer striking louder

516
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,900
It's Walkenhorst and Porter.

517
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,940
Two of the Rainmakers.

518
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,900
Bob Walkenhorst, promise Bob.

519
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,320
And Jeff Porter.

520
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,580
I think that's his name.

521
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,500
Just occurred to me.

522
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,020
I knew another Jeff Porter.

523
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,580
Very different.

524
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,840
Yeah, Walkenhorst and Porter.

525
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,740
It's kind of a duo solo album.

526
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,900
And Friends.

527
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,400
if you have a birthday coming up,

528
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,480
I have a birthday wish for you.

529
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Thinking of you on this most marvelous of days,

530
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,160
this kingly prince of a day,

531
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,880
this shining luck goddess of a day,

532
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,580
your birthday.

533
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,880
From now on, you can look forward to your years

534
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,580
becoming subjectively shorter and shorter

535
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,660
until they're like the day pages

536
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,840
falling magically off a calendar

537
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,580
in an old movie transition gimmick.

538
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,260
Months being ripped away every second or two.

539
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,500
Every birthday will increasingly feel

540
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,340
like it came too soon after the previous one.

541
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,440
Yes, you have much to look forward to,

542
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,480
but it'll gradually become harder and harder to appreciate

543
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,680
because it'll seem to be going by so fast.

544
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,540
You'll see.

545
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,820
If you're a king,

546
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,640
you're lucky.

547
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,820
This has been Reverend Stang's personal

548
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,900
happy birthday to you.

549
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,900
Although I originally wrote it for Dr. Argus Fox.

550
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,020
And while waiting for the lonesome cowboy

551
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,260
to call in again,

552
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,980
I'm looking at this cool newspaper

553
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,580
I just got in the mail from Dobbstown, Malaysia,

554
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,940
the Dobbstown Nanoheliograph 21X Day edition,

555
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,220
a special edition.

556
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,200
And the headline on it says,

557
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,300
subgenius ritual reaches majority.

558
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,140
X day, now old enough to vote.

559
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,460
Buy liquor, firearms.

560
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,000
21-year-old gathering obtains adulthood.

561
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,340
Because yes, friends,

562
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,000
in just a matter of four sleeps,

563
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,240
it's gonna come.

564
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,540
Finally, well, it'll be July 5th,

565
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,780
and it'll be seven in the morning.

566
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,740
And maybe this is 1998.

567
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,100
Maybe it's not.

568
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,100
Maybe it is.

569
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,840
We'll see.

570
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,500
And we'll see if this is Dave.

571
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,840
Is it Dave?

572
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,040
Dave?

573
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,300
It is.

574
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,100
It is Dave.

575
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,260
Regimondo.

576
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:54,620
Regimondo.

577
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,700
How the bleeding hells are you?

578
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,840
I got a little funny place in my back

579
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,380
from being too funny while moving stuff around,

580
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,460
packing the van for X day.

581
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,840
My back is killing me today also.

582
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,540
Extinction day.

583
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,500
I just thought of that.

584
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,120
X day.

585
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,560
Extinction day.

586
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,040
I never made that connection.

587
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,500
Because I'm usually not thinking about,

588
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,460
I usually am not thinking about all the killing.

589
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,120
I'm thinking about all the getting,

590
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,600
the acquiring,

591
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:24,720
the acquiring.

592
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,960
Well, you're also so close to the object at hand

593
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,700
that you, you know,

594
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,020
you can hardly force any enamels down there

595
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,140
in the first place

596
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,000
if you're like one of these big ceramic steelers

597
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,800
in Spokane or Washington or something.

598
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,580
But the main thing is

599
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,180
you're constantly out there reminding everybody

600
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,620
that, you know,

601
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,580
it could be extinction day indeed.

602
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:44,980
Well,

603
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,100
either way,

604
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,100
even if it's not the aliens

605
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,740
that give us the power to

606
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,240
change,

607
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,120
change the situation,

608
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,120
there's going to be,

609
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,720
I mean,

610
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,080
the whole human race

611
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,620
is an extinction event in progress.

612
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,660
Yeah, you got that right.

613
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,240
But you know,

614
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,400
extinction events are just God's way

615
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,840
of wiping

616
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,340
his fundament.

617
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,900
Getting everything cleaned up

618
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,920
to make a new,

619
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,960
to, you know,

620
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,860
to rear back and pass another miracle.

621
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,080
But in my estimation,

622
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,180
it appears to me,

623
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:23,980
what if there is,

624
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,700
there is no God to wipe the poopy whistle

625
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,580
from the area?

626
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,900
Then it's up to us.

627
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,980
Then we got to build our own ship.

628
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,320
That's what I agree with also.

629
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,100
It doesn't mean we're going to do it.

630
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,500
It just means it is up to us.

631
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,420
No matter if there is a God or there isn't.

632
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,460
Or,

633
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,320
wait a minute,

634
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,120
I take that all back.

635
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:41,340
Right, right.

636
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:41,700
It doesn't,

637
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,020
it doesn't,

638
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,280
it don't matter none.

639
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,780
It just don't matter none.

640
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,080
It,

641
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,860
it doesn't matter to me.

642
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,440
Oh, are you doing Moronica Oensky?

643
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:50,920
I mean,

644
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,940
Moronica Valvolino?

645
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,260
Oh, no,

646
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:53,800
I was doing,

647
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,480
I was doing,

648
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,320
Moronica Trump.

649
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,560
I was doing a,

650
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,080
a forgotten Devo song actually.

651
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,040
But,

652
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,460
did you remember Moronica Trump

653
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,980
walking down to meet the sick and children

654
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,060
of the occupants of the Southwestern zones down there?

655
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,580
Yeah,

656
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,200
wearing that,

657
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,660
that callous outfit.

658
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,140
Well,

659
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,780
that just pleases the heck out

660
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,060
of all the stupid rednecks

661
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,380
and racists

662
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,000
and peckerwoods

663
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,400
and numbskulls.

664
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,300
They love that

665
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,040
because they know

666
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,960
it irritates the smarts

667
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,260
and the smart people.

668
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,200
And that's all they're,

669
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,820
that's really all they care about

670
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,500
is how does it make them feel?

671
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,900
It makes them feel good.

672
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,100
It's not about what,

673
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,620
you know,

674
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,980
the country or,

675
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,620
or,

676
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,900
or certainly not truth,

677
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,360
justice of the American way.

678
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,940
It's all about what makes them feel good.

679
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,000
And seeing a,

680
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,720
a racist cop mocking a child

681
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,160
who's,

682
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,640
who thinks his parents may be dead,

683
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,400
or abandoned him

684
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,260
while sitting in prison,

685
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,660
in a child prison.

686
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,380
That's the kind of thing

687
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,960
that makes those dumbasses so happy

688
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,780
because they know it irritates us, Dave.

689
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,420
And just think of those self-same positioning people

690
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,220
that like when they were talking about waterboarding,

691
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,580
that was an instrument of torture

692
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,200
that was used in the days of Torquemada

693
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,940
in the Spanish.

694
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,600
Anybody who knows anything about it

695
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,760
agrees it's torture.

696
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,760
My dad,

697
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,360
had to go through some training in the Navy

698
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,700
that involved waterboarding a guy

699
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,680
that was training, you know.

700
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,820
And he,

701
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,280
he was,

702
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,000
he considered it absolutely to be torture.

703
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:37,580
And of course,

704
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,940
that's what John McCain

705
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,760
and anybody who's been tortured says.

706
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,500
And then also think,

707
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,180
I'm sorry.

708
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,640
Yeah.

709
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,380
I mean, it's just,

710
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,240
but,

711
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,160
hey.

712
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,520
And then think of even our beloved Obama liberal boyfriend

713
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,420
and even in those days,

714
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:51,620
well,

715
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,440
let's go kill,

716
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,480
kill Osama bin Laden,

717
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,340
who's probably been,

718
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,780
already been dead for five years.

719
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,960
Or kill somebody right in his own home

720
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,440
without abrogation or adjunction

721
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,200
by a legal person or something.

722
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,080
War is hell, baby.

723
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,020
War is hell.

724
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,520
Or hack, I'm sorry.

725
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,760
I wouldn't want to.

726
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,040
Oh, yeah, it's peace.

727
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,900
It's hack.

728
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,060
War is hack.

729
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,060
Peace hack.

730
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,740
Oh, wait.

731
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,160
I know.

732
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,740
I'm so confused now.

733
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,060
Truth and lies are the same now.

734
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,740
That's what they,

735
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,200
both sides keep saying.

736
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,820
I don't trust anybody.

737
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,900
Why should you?

738
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,480
Why should you?

739
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,900
Well, I trust,

740
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,240
I trust Bob to rip me off.

741
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,540
Oh, Bob Dobbs,

742
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,400
to rip me off.

743
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,780
That's one thing you can count on.

744
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,260
But it,

745
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:40,620
but it,

746
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,760
somehow I'll feel like it's okay

747
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,220
when Bob does it.

748
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,600
As long as the third nostril is opened wide,

749
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,860
and this is opened wide,

750
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,440
then...

751
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,860
Well, think about it though, Dave.

752
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,740
A year ago,

753
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,640
well, we were making satirical jokes

754
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,200
about the patriot camps.

755
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,820
But it'll be okay,

756
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,280
Reverend Pease said.

757
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,920
They'll have snacks.

758
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,580
And we laughed,

759
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,040
because we thought that was a little,

760
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,900
not really going to happen.

761
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,300
It was just funny to think that

762
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,820
they could possibly really kind of get that extreme.

763
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,980
And then they did!

764
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,560
Oh, yeah.

765
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,800
Then they did!

766
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,560
The Trump stops became real.

767
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,620
I mean, the worst fantasies

768
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,560
by sick humor satirists

769
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,920
have become real.

770
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,240
And everything's upside down

771
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,080
and flip-flop.

772
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,940
The right-wingers love the commies

773
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,180
and hate the freedom of the press.

774
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,740
What the hell?

775
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,780
There's only one amendment in their constitution.

776
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,960
That's the Second Amendment.

777
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,780
They constantly threaten you on the air

778
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,180
on these,

779
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,660
these AM talk shows

780
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,140
that threaten,

781
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,780
constantly threaten to kill you.

782
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,160
Especially if you have any socialist leanings

783
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,100
of which they don't even know

784
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,980
what that word means.

785
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,360
I mean, who does?

786
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:00,760
I mean,

787
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,400
communards must think

788
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,420
unlike, I suppose,

789
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,020
a little bit.

790
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,360
But,

791
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,140
um, man,

792
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,780
it tickles my fancy.

793
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,920
It irritates my torus,

794
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,800
my urethra,

795
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,820
and it makes me just

796
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,160
all go banana hog wild

797
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,300
just thinking about it.

798
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,600
Well, in that little country

799
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,500
only about 100 miles north of us,

800
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,060
they completely legalized

801
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,440
recreational marijuana

802
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,320
across,

803
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,320
the whole country.

804
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,000
As well as medical, yes.

805
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,700
I think that,

806
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,520
I think that may

807
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,580
shift some demographics.

808
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,080
I'm hanging on to my passport.

809
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,800
I was just thinking that today,

810
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,100
you know,

811
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,220
get a big boat

812
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,460
and it's only 52 miles

813
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,340
across the lake.

814
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,860
Go over to Port Stanley

815
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,460
or one of those places like that.

816
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,480
And apply for asylum.

817
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,560
Yeah.

818
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,200
Where they'll laugh at you.

819
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,340
Well, because it is a joke,

820
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,800
but they won't really laugh at you.

821
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,940
They'll actually give you asylum.

822
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,080
Because you're supposed to.

823
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,360
Well, it doesn't mean anything.

824
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,780
Of course not.

825
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,940
Today is Canada Day.

826
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,900
Did you know that?

827
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:00,960
Huh?

828
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:01,480
What?

829
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,180
Today is Canada Day.

830
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,360
It's like their 4th of July.

831
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,380
Oh, I did not know that.

832
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,440
You know, 1876,

833
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,000
all these three huge macro provinces

834
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,880
all decided to get together

835
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,340
and have more freedom

836
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:16,880
from the queen

837
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,900
or the aristocracy,

838
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,800
whoever it was.

839
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,040
And that's why

840
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,360
they all,

841
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:21,540
they all,

842
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:21,660
they all smoked

843
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,660
the humbling nomadic

844
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,460
herbal rest.

845
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,180
Because they were atrophying

846
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,320
in a scumbag.

847
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,920
At least the last time

848
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,700
I checked it,

849
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,760
I didn't really want to,

850
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,780
but I was forced to.

851
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,380
I've been having to

852
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,680
check a thing

853
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,620
and put

854
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,100
antibacterial ointments

855
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:48,600
on it.

856
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,460
Is it your thing

857
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,520
or is it your dog's thing?

858
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,920
No, it's mine this time.

859
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,920
I have to protect it

860
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,840
because I'm about to go

861
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,920
go out in the woods,

862
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,920
you know,

863
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,440
for a couple of days,

864
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,420
not for two weeks or anything,

865
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,000
but, you know,

866
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,200
because X Day's starting,

867
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,840
like, well,

868
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,700
I'm going to drive out there Tuesday

869
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,680
into the tick-infested,

870
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,880
beautiful, diverse forest

871
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,500
and use lots of bug repellent

872
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,000
of all kinds.

873
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,960
And then I'm going to be boarded.

874
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,800
I'm going to be boarding

875
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,660
the escape vessels

876
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,060
because of my faith in Bob

877
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,800
or Bob will completely

878
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
screw us again,

879
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,200
laugh at us,

880
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,220
go, X Day could happen

881
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,560
any minute, you fools.

882
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,660
Why do you cling to your ritual?

883
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,120
And then we'll have Starwood

884
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,740
and I'll end up being out there

885
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,800
at that festival ground

886
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,040
for two weeks solid.

887
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,500
Dressed up like Harry Potter

888
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,900
and all that stuff like that

889
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,220
with a big, with a cloak

890
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,260
and a pointy hat

891
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:48,760
and everything.

892
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,460
No, no, no.

893
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,600
I dress up like a subgenius

894
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,470
with a doctor's surgical outfit

895
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,390
and a big chainsaw

896
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,130
golf club combination.

897
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,170
That's the doctor look.

898
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,650
That's being a good subgenius

899
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,230
dressing up like a,

900
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,690
like a little Bobby.

901
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,710
Awful artists and drug addicts

902
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:09,470
were as similar or were as honest

903
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:12,050
as the air stuff in a crowd

904
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,270
that we might have to deal with

905
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:13,770
some days.

906
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,670
It's just too much to contemplate.

907
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,310
They got it from the left.

908
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,330
They got it from the right.

909
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,830
They got it from the top and bottom.

910
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,430
We feel like we're boxed up

911
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,410
into a Transylvanian little hole

912
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,850
or some decipherable

913
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,390
recreational room

914
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,730
and we can never, never escape.

915
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,970
I saw a little funny

916
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,130
two panel drawing,

917
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,230
a cartoon,

918
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:39,290
a two panel cartoon

919
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,090
by a subgenius

920
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,010
that I don't know on Facebook.

921
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,670
It said,

922
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,590
here's a genius

923
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:50,310
and the genius is a little,

924
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:50,990
little stick figure

925
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,270
and he's having a,

926
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,910
there's a problem on one side.

927
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,430
The genius looks at the problem,

928
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,150
solves the problem

929
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,710
and fixes the problem.

930
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,110
And that goes,

931
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,490
here's the subgenius.

932
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,750
The problem comes at the subgenius

933
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,970
and the subgenius makes a joke

934
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,950
and it has a funny,

935
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,490
it doesn't solve the problem

936
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:12,870
but he makes a joke about it

937
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:13,990
and it shows this,

938
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:16,010
the subgenius stick figure face

939
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,130
is laughing

940
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:20,010
but it has tears coming,

941
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,050
from its eyes.

942
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,250
Has this sad expression of

943
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,350
joyous sadness and pain

944
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:28,650
and irony.

945
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,310
And I thought,

946
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,070
that's pretty poignant there.

947
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:36,390
The genius solves the problem

948
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,270
and the subgenius

949
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,150
makes a funny joke about it

950
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,970
but it doesn't go away.

951
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:43,650
Either way,

952
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:44,510
it doesn't go away.

953
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,510
The subflamorals

954
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:47,930
or whatever you want to call them,

955
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:49,170
they're always joking.

956
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,310
It doesn't matter if anybody's,

957
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:51,010
dying or not

958
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:52,970
or if things have reached

959
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,190
the most sorrowful ending

960
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,470
they could possibly iterate.

961
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,210
They just like to ride the bus

962
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:01,010
and point at different people outside.

963
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,850
Just like Ken Kesey,

964
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:04,690
remember the magic warthog

965
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,350
in there?

966
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:09,830
Or that was the guy with the frogs.

967
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:12,610
That's funny you should mention Ken Kesey.

968
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,910
I was reading up on him

969
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:19,250
because I can't help but identify

970
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:19,790
with,

971
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:21,930
him and the Merry Pranksters

972
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:23,590
to a certain extent.

973
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:25,770
You know,

974
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:26,990
you write a book

975
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:28,930
and suddenly there's this weird club.

976
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:30,370
Anyway,

977
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,650
what I got to thinking,

978
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:33,510
well,

979
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,110
I've been worried about

980
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,510
being sick and dying lately

981
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,710
since I've got a Medicare card in my pocket now.

982
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:41,790
I'm about to turn 65.

983
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:42,290
I thought,

984
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,130
but hey,

985
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:43,510
you know,

986
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,270
I outlived Ken Kesey.

987
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,350
I think he died in his 50s.

988
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:49,950
So I looked it up.

989
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:50,970
I was wrong.

990
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:55,030
He died when he was a year older than I am now.

991
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:56,950
And he died of,

992
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:57,970
of a,

993
00:44:58,710 --> 00:44:59,230
well,

994
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,890
he had been diagnosed with diabetes

995
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,150
about a year earlier,

996
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:05,730
which is something I'm planning to do.

997
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,750
And then he had,

998
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,170
there was,

999
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:10,790
he had to have a liver operation.

1000
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:12,710
They found something on his liver.

1001
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,970
They were just going to remove a spot from his,

1002
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:15,710
just the onions,

1003
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:16,330
I guess.

1004
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,830
And he didn't survive the liver operation.

1005
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:19,770
He died,

1006
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:21,110
died rather suddenly.

1007
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:21,510
Well,

1008
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:22,450
you know,

1009
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,250
that wasn't supposed to happen,

1010
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,330
but again,

1011
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:27,750
I was thinking,

1012
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:32,590
what else do I have in common with old Reverend Ken Kesey,

1013
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:33,670
who was by the way,

1014
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:33,950
a,

1015
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:40,490
a subgenius minister whose subgenius name was Reverend Hardly Visible.

1016
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:42,990
Cause he had,

1017
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:43,810
he had done.

1018
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:46,370
That's a good name for somebody who wanted lots of visibility in this

1019
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:48,570
earth while existence of personality plus.

1020
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:49,610
Well, no, he did.

1021
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:49,970
He did it for,

1022
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:51,330
he did for a few years,

1023
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:54,510
but after his second pot bust,

1024
00:45:55,490 --> 00:46:01,890
he settled down and just kind of hung out on his farm and

1025
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:04,670
wrote occasionally for hippie magazines.

1026
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:09,950
And I can identify with that too.

1027
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:12,270
Well, you're a hypnotist,

1028
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,450
so you should take at least a modicum of sanity with a grain of salt.

1029
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:18,950
Modicum of sanity,

1030
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:20,430
a grain of salt,

1031
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:22,510
a loaf of fro,

1032
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:32,310
a jug of mind and a bag of toothpaste and pee some friendly orphans with no

1033
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:32,650
teeth.

1034
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:34,590
And,

1035
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:34,910
uh,

1036
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:35,970
I don't know.

1037
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:38,910
I think I might've crossed some sort of limits there.

1038
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:39,850
Yeah,

1039
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:40,050
man.

1040
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:41,850
You crossed the Lummox with the ox.

1041
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:46,490
You crossed the Lummox with a hound dog.

1042
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,210
You get a lum dog.

1043
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:48,930
Yeah.

1044
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:49,770
Lum dog.

1045
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,230
Well, that's ridiculous.

1046
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:52,830
There is,

1047
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:53,550
whoops,

1048
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:54,330
I'm sorry.

1049
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:54,970
Well, you know,

1050
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:55,290
princess,

1051
00:46:55,370 --> 00:47:00,110
we isn't here tonight because we don't know what'll happen when we,

1052
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:05,970
if we leave young buddy alone in the Cleveland house.

1053
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:08,730
We just don't know.

1054
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:13,470
There's not much he can tear up because it's almost completely empty,

1055
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:15,350
but I'm sure he'll find something.

1056
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:17,990
So we're,

1057
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:18,170
uh,

1058
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:18,810
yeah,

1059
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:19,150
we're,

1060
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:28,130
we're one of us has to dog sit constantly until we train that little fellow better or until the world ends on July 5th,

1061
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:28,150
1998.

1062
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,410
You either learn to relax real quickly or you could,

1063
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:33,370
we could just leave the planet and let it blow it all to hell.

1064
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:36,250
They're going to whether we leave or not.

1065
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:37,310
That's the problem.

1066
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,150
And even if they don't,

1067
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,630
it'll blow itself some way.

1068
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:44,210
But as George Carlin pointed out,

1069
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,650
the planet will be fine.

1070
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:47,250
It's us that are screwed.

1071
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:50,090
The planet will bounce back.

1072
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:55,170
Something like a dodo will eventually appear on some island again.

1073
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:03,550
And something like a human being will appear a million years from now again.

1074
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:06,930
And something like a human would,

1075
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,250
what might something like a human be not,

1076
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:13,050
not in that lesson of ranking and so forth,

1077
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:13,610
but human,

1078
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:15,770
what kind of human would it produce?

1079
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:16,730
Not a human being.

1080
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:17,250
Well,

1081
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:21,670
you like to think that they would discover the ruins of our cities and,

1082
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,470
uh,

1083
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:27,450
and figure out what we'd done wrong and then try to learn from our mistakes.

1084
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:31,510
But the problem is we haven't been around long.

1085
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:33,330
Even with our giant buildings,

1086
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:37,590
we haven't been around long enough to leave a permanent mark.

1087
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:40,470
Every city in,

1088
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:41,990
Oh yeah,

1089
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:42,390
yeah.

1090
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:42,910
But it'll,

1091
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:46,550
it doesn't take nature very long to just devour it all again.

1092
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:55,690
The reason I bring that up is it's been pointed out that there could have been an Atlantis quote unquote.

1093
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:56,830
Uh,

1094
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,170
and in fact there have been.

1095
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:00,410
South America,

1096
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:07,470
it turns out is full of completely buried cities with huge pyramids,

1097
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,970
not the famous ones that have been dug out,

1098
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:13,290
but a whole lot of them that have only been recently discovered.

1099
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:14,030
In fact,

1100
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,250
people laughed at the,

1101
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:20,550
at the archeologists who said that there were buried more buried cities and there've been,

1102
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:21,310
you know,

1103
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:21,850
those guys,

1104
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:24,510
those cities were around for thousands of years.

1105
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:25,290
Well,

1106
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:26,510
just think of Cahokia.

1107
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:27,850
Then they disappeared.

1108
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:29,110
You know,

1109
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:29,670
they,

1110
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:30,030
they,

1111
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:34,650
those cities disappeared long before the Europeans got here.

1112
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,650
Think of Cahokia and East St. Louis,

1113
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:43,530
city of over 2 million people just appeared as far as historians are concerned to,

1114
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:47,010
to just wiped off the map not long after Columbus landed,

1115
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,330
which turned out not to be true at all.

1116
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,250
And then what,

1117
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:52,230
what was I saying again?

1118
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,110
Oh man.

1119
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:54,010
Well,

1120
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:57,170
it doesn't take long for a society to collapse.

1121
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:00,030
We're going to put them all in Cahokia until somebody said,

1122
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:00,330
you know,

1123
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:02,390
this pyramid here looks really obvious.

1124
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:03,450
You can't hide this.

1125
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:04,490
You can't tear it down.

1126
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:07,930
And they started this movement and they turned into a national resource.

1127
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:09,270
Well,

1128
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:09,930
you know,

1129
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,290
it won't be one for long.

1130
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:12,310
It'll,

1131
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,310
it'll be a,

1132
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,610
a Mr.

1133
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:17,330
Moneybags resource and they will put a mall there.

1134
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:23,990
The Trump administration is trying to make sure they can put malls right in the middle

1135
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:26,150
of Grand Staircase Escalante,

1136
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:28,290
the last barely,

1137
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:28,830
the,

1138
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:33,370
the almost the least explored remaining part of the United States.

1139
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:40,130
And they want to make sure that it can be explored by highway with Burger King's lining

1140
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:40,790
the highway.

1141
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:41,410
Yep.

1142
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:42,650
And,

1143
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:42,870
and,

1144
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:43,730
you know,

1145
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:46,590
a tram to the bottom of the Grand Canyon.

1146
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:56,350
And it won't be so grand when they fill it up with plastic cups and plastic water bottles.

1147
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:58,350
But,

1148
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:58,830
uh,

1149
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:02,610
I won't be around to see that cause I'll either die first,

1150
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:03,730
I hope,

1151
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:07,650
or I'll be on my escape vessel laughing,

1152
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:08,650
you know,

1153
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:11,170
toasting the old earth.

1154
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:12,870
And,

1155
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:13,370
uh,

1156
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:15,290
toasting the people.

1157
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:15,590
The old,

1158
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:16,550
old earth is toasted.

1159
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:20,610
And toasting the non-subgeniuses on it.

1160
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:20,870
Perhaps you might be.

1161
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:21,050
Of course,

1162
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,070
they're going to toast anyway.

1163
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,390
It's getting hotter.

1164
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:24,870
Yep.

1165
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:26,450
They're going to be as red as reptiles.

1166
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:26,670
Well,

1167
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:29,730
it's getting hotter in some places and colder in other places.

1168
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:33,350
I don't know what places it's getting colder in.

1169
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:33,630
Oh,

1170
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:36,050
it's getting colder in the Northern US.

1171
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:37,850
It's getting colder in,

1172
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:38,070
I,

1173
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:41,150
it was 70 degrees in Stang Ranch this morning.

1174
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:41,150


1175
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:41,150


1176
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:41,150


1177
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:41,150


1178
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:41,150


1179
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:41,150


1180
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:41,150


1181
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:41,150


1182
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:43,910
And 90 here in Cleveland.

1183
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:45,850
How does that happen?

1184
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,610
Changing weather patterns.

1185
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:51,070
Uh,

1186
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:54,410
global warming doesn't mean everything gets hotter.

1187
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:57,470
It means there's kind of an overall heating.

1188
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:02,070
But when the wind patterns and the ocean patterns change,

1189
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,050
that can cause glaciation.

1190
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:07,010
So go figure.

1191
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:10,830
You just don't like me when I think some people know how to manipulate the weather.

1192
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:11,130
Well,

1193
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1194
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1195
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1196
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1197
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1198
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1199
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1200
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1201
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1202
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1203
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1204
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1205
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1206
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1207
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1208
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1209
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1210
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,130


1211
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,170
I don't think they manipulate the weather for profit.

1212
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:12,870
No,

1213
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:14,030
I don't think they do.

1214
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,650
I don't think that they can.

1215
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,210
And I don't think,

1216
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,890
I think it's going to take a long,

1217
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:21,590
long time to manipulate it back to normal.

1218
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:30,410
You can't just wave a wand and make gases come and go in vast unthinkable quantities.

1219
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:31,570
Well,

1220
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:32,210
just think of what,

1221
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:35,910
like it almost melted almost all the way up to the North Pole this year.

1222
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:36,850
Oh,

1223
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:37,070
yeah.

1224
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:38,390
Yeah,

1225
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,510
I know.

1226
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:40,990
Oh,

1227
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:41,090
I,

1228
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:41,650
oh,

1229
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:43,630
I know much worse things than you do,

1230
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:44,010
Dave.

1231
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:45,190
Much,

1232
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:45,810
much worse.

1233
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,350
I don't like to go on and on about it,

1234
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:48,550
but,

1235
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:48,790
uh,

1236
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:51,010
I think the oceans are all going to be dead.

1237
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:52,170
Look,

1238
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:52,490
again,

1239
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:53,250
it'll take,

1240
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:56,270
take a little longer than I won't be around for it.

1241
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:59,570
But I just found out I got another grandkid on the way.

1242
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:04,890
And he or she is going to have to see that stuff.

1243
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:07,570
They're going to have to read,

1244
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,170
they're going to have to pick up a paper and go,

1245
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:09,450
well,

1246
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:10,970
the last gorilla has,

1247
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:11,210
dog.

1248
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,670
You can see it sometimes without trying.

1249
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:20,590
I remember there was a fish and chip shop I used to go to that had a thing on the wall

1250
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:24,470
that showed that there were a thousand different varieties of Great Lakes fish.

1251
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:24,830
I mean,

1252
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:26,170
you can just live on fish.

1253
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:27,690
And now there's what?

1254
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:28,210
There's two,

1255
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:28,910
there's walleye,

1256
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:29,510
or there's three.

1257
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:30,230
There's perch,

1258
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:31,410
walleye,

1259
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:31,690
pike,

1260
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:33,730
and zebra mussels.

1261
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:36,210
They are delicious.

1262
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:36,630
Oh,

1263
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,810
and they're trying to bring back the Lake Erie oysters,

1264
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:40,430
but they're having problems.

1265
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:45,150
The water is so polluted that even if they reproduce and everything,

1266
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:46,390
what difference will it make?

1267
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:51,190
What difference is it going to make?

1268
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:52,730
My God.

1269
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:59,070
Think of the floating massive debris of plastic in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

1270
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,550
I never thought I would see anything like that.

1271
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:03,690
Now my grandfather's going to have to see it.

1272
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:04,750
I mean,

1273
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:06,570
my grandchildren.

1274
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:07,250
From heaven,

1275
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,030
because he's in outer space now.

1276
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,350
Heaven is a big cloud.

1277
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,050
I'm a spaceman now,

1278
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:13,830
but my grandchildren are not spacemen,

1279
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:14,310
I swear.

1280
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:15,910
I promise to.

1281
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:17,510
Oh,

1282
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:21,510
they'll find a way to build condos on that floating pile of trash.

1283
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:29,690
It's just that there won't be anybody to live in them because there won't be any fish or rain or crops or,

1284
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:31,210
you know,

1285
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:33,330
because the rain will be all acetic and,

1286
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:34,910
and,

1287
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:37,250
and there are no more family farms.

1288
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:39,150
But wait a minute,

1289
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:39,550
come on,

1290
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:39,710
man,

1291
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:40,570
if you're going to vote negative,

1292
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:42,290
let's go out and vote.

1293
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:43,830
Because when you don't vote,

1294
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:46,590
that meant you voted for the person that won,

1295
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:49,230
which means you voted for Trump.

1296
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:51,710
If you,

1297
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:52,270
if you,

1298
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:52,850
listener,

1299
00:54:53,910 --> 00:55:02,970
if you're an American and didn't vote in that election because you wanted to teach someone a lesson because it's really all about you and how it makes you feel,

1300
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:05,430
you voted for Trump.

1301
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,070
It made more sense to you as it my case,

1302
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:08,690
but I still,

1303
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:09,550
I never mind.

1304
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:10,090
Well,

1305
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:10,750
Dave,

1306
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:11,770
believe it or not,

1307
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:15,650
the show is coming towards an end.

1308
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:18,610
Casi abierto,

1309
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,090
meaning almost closed.

1310
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:21,230
Open.

1311
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:22,090
That's right,

1312
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:22,590
abierto.

1313
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:30,970
And so that means we have to say it's the hour of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1314
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:37,310
And you can learn more by subgenius.com.

1315
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:43,070
It'll make you so calm at subgenius.com.

1316
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:46,750
And we have two post office boxes.

1317
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:49,830
The Cleveland one is still good for the next few months.

1318
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:53,050
But I'm not going to give that.

1319
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:53,590
Okay,

1320
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:54,390
Dave,

1321
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:55,650
thank you.

1322
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:57,210
Thank you.

1323
00:55:57,330 --> 00:56:01,210
And good night and thank you for the luxurious appetite.

1324
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:03,510
We'll see you on the saucers.

1325
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:05,550
I believe.

1326
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,050
I may be.

1327
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:07,930
Rob said,

1328
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:08,230
Oh,

1329
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:08,830
I may not.

1330
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:09,590
I hope.

1331
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:10,230
I hope.

1332
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:10,730
I hope.

1333
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:11,630
Well,

1334
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:14,370
keep in touch,

1335
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,750
but not touchy feely.

1336
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:18,910
No means no,

1337
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:19,350
Dave.

1338
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:20,570
Right.

1339
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:22,030
You're supposed to say keep in touch,

1340
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:22,970
but not too much.

1341
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:23,490
Know what I mean?

1342
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,210
He's supposed to wink.

1343
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,470
He's supposed to get real flatulent,

1344
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:30,730
real loud and real gumpy and stuff like that.

1345
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:33,930
And then I guess they arrest you and take you to one of them camps.

1346
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:34,510
Right.

1347
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,450
But there'll be snacks.

1348
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:37,010
Okay.

1349
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:40,030
Time for PR news.

1350
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:41,530
Snacks.

1351
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,890
From PR news in Washington,

1352
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:47,450
I'm fighting terrorism and attacking the U.S.

1353
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:50,270
Authorities should be considered armed and dangerous.

1354
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:54,910
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell should stand during the national anthem.

1355
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:55,950
It's,

1356
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:56,070
uh,

1357
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:57,050
and it's also,

1358
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:57,450
uh,

1359
00:56:57,590 --> 00:56:58,590
and it's also,

1360
00:56:58,830 --> 00:56:59,150
uh,

1361
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,690
On Wall Street,

1362
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:01,150
58,

1363
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:01,610
23,

1364
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:02,210
56,

1365
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:02,790
58,

1366
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:03,310
55,

1367
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:04,090
41,

1368
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:05,010
42,

1369
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:06,170
46,

1370
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:06,430
47,

1371
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:06,430


1372
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:06,430


1373
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:06,430


1374
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:06,430


1375
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:06,430


1376
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:06,430


1377
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:06,430


1378
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:06,910
48,

1379
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:07,470
53.

1380
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:12,730
Secretary of State Ray Tiller says this is heartbreaking PR news.

1381
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:15,090
Someone will be held accountable.

1382
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:20,150
Where'd you two take this elevator from, Shangri-La?

1383
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:22,810
I was supposed to be a boy named Thomas.

1384
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:24,690
Whee!

1385
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:26,170
I'll get him.

1386
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,150
But no talking behind my back.

1387
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,290
This is so rich.

1388
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:33,050
It was a stone groove, my man.

1389
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:35,290
I have a brother who's a drug addict.

1390
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:36,750
I'm very proud of him.

1391
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:44,070
Thank you for representing me, man.

1392
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:46,090
We are connected!

1393
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:52,510
Mac Douze Vs.

1394
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:54,730
Fox News away!

1395
00:57:54,770 --> 00:58:01,250
All characteristics and assumptions introduced in thisnel.

1396
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:05,270
I'm very proud of you.

1397
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:05,270


1398
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:05,270


1399
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:06,890
for a revolution.

1400
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:08,150
A revolution.

1401
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:09,630
A revolution.

1402
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:10,930
A revolution.

1403
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:14,730
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1404
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:18,290
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1405
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,770
Stones and sticks,

1406
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:29,570
bones and bricks,

1407
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:32,310
hear the sound of something breaking.

1408
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:35,090
Wrong look,

1409
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:36,890
right hook,

1410
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:39,350
with your bad combination.

1411
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:43,930
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1412
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:47,310
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1413
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:49,810
Ain't going down,

1414
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:51,310
bound and gagged.

1415
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:54,850
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1416
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:05,850
I'm in deep water here,

1417
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:08,890
hear the sound of something sinking.

1418
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:13,430
Faith and hope ought to get me afloat.

1419
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:16,030
What was I thinking?

1420
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:20,410
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1421
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:24,230
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1422
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:28,530
Ain't going down, bound and gagged.

1423
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:31,390
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1424
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:32,290
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1425
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:35,030
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1426
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:42,170
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, a ton of bricks, a ton of feather.

1427
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:49,290
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, the room's in the living room,

1428
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:50,790
I can't sweep it together.

1429
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:15,230
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, the room's in the living room,

1430
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:15,230


1431
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:15,330
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, the room's in the living room,

1432
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:15,330


1433
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:16,250
Where's my coat?

1434
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:18,170
Where's my hat?

1435
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:20,770
Where's my shredded dignity?

1436
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:23,870
Where's my gloves?

1437
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:25,530
My lost love?

1438
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:27,410
You pounded it out of me.

1439
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:32,070
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1440
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:35,730
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1441
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:40,210
Ain't going down, bound and gagged.

1442
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:42,990
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1443
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:46,070
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1444
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,310
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1445
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:54,650
Ain't going down, bound and gagged.

1446
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:57,570
I ain't gonna be your punching bag.

1447
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:01,570
All right, but how's the ball almost there?

1448
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:01,630
Yeah, it's nice and high out, right down, you say?

1449
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:01,630


1450
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:01,670
Yeah!

1451
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,890
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1452
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:37,650
That was Bob Walkenhorst from an early solo album called The Beginner.

1453
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:43,430
Punching Bag from The Beginner by Bob Walkenhorst.

1454
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:45,690
And now this.

1455
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:50,750
From PR News in Washington, I'm expected to top the agenda.

1456
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:57,790
President Donald Trump is accused of involvement in the 2012 attack on an American consulate in a U.S. court.

1457
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:03,250
Trump is the second person brought to the U.S. to face charges for PR's reports.

1458
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:07,330
Faces three charges, including his alleged PR news, Washington.

1459
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:15,610
Trump is due to touch down in Tocan and south of the Philippines on Sunday, where he'll be welcomed by Japanese PR News instead.

1460
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:21,970
One key factor is a state's members with Indians who admit the palisade from this direct stemson.

1461
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:26,130
A Libyan man reports movie producer Harstein is incredible.

1462
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:29,210
Incredible for the cultural agency's founding ideals.

1463
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,430
New York City police believe this is PR.

1464
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:37,470
That's right.

1465
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:42,070
I mean, I mean, so.
