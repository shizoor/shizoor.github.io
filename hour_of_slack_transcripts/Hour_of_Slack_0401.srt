1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
The sickest, sickest, sickest thing coming up I ever heard.

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:07,960
Why, yes.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,400
Oh, listen to those interesting new buzzes come in as I push buttons here and there.

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:15,800
Hmm.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,820
This is Side 5.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,780
Follow in your book and repeat after me as we learn three new words in Turkish.

7
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,080
Back off, you bum! I kill you!

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:39,540


9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,620
If anything goes wrong, we may have to...

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,440
We may have to scrape you off the landscape with a soup spoon.

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,460
Come on, I want to be slammed against the pavement and scooped up with a soup spoon.

12
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,560
Come on, I want to be slammed against the pavement and scooped up with a soup spoon.

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,480
Come on, I want to be slammed against the pavement and scooped up with a soup spoon.

14
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,580
Okay, now we're doing it, and here's the soup spoon.

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,240
The Soap Genius Hour of Swag.

16
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:14,740
Swag.

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,220
Radio violence is possible.

18
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:23,840
Without...

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,660
I got you on the trigger.

20
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,120
Give up now. Tomorrow is another day.

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,000
They believe their dream minds are just as real as their waking time.

22
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,460
It's my mind.

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
It's not stopping.

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,320
It's not stopping. How do you control this thing?

25
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,920
It's one of these newfangled car interactions that thinks.

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,060
It thinks, but it doesn't think the way I do.

27
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,900
Hey, what's going on here?

28
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,920
Hey, what kind of...

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,500
I've been fouled. I've been fouled.

30
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,400
Some big San Diego chicken.

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,520
I've been flashed.

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
My, uh, my...

33
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,360
What's the catch?

34
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,680
This show is not for children.

35
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,780
I don't believe this either.

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:12,400
That is that driver of the limousine that turned around and shot John Kennedy through the forehead, according to Bill Cooper.

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,440
That's why they wait until they turn the corner, so the driver could get a better shot when he turned and started going on that street.

38
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,220
Slowed down to almost a stop there.

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,920
That's when he turned around and shot Kennedy.

40
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,080
I have not seen that.

41
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,520
Yeah, well, Bill Cooper's got that.

42
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,580
He's got...

43
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,660
He had one of those guns that slid up his sleeve, and he just turned around.

44
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,540
They were driving.

45
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,040
You could be like your Kennedy, and the chauffeur turned around like...

46
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,140
He turned around this way, didn't he?

47
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, a palm-accompanied...

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,120
Yeah.

49
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,980
Turned around this way when Jackie was trying to put his brains back in.

50
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,360
It's the time travelers must have placed the chips in Kennedy's brain.

51
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,520
I heard it was just tubes.

52
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,340
Vacuum tubes.

53
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,180
It was great technology.

54
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,340
Well, Truman made that deal with the group in 1990.

55
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,140
I hear that Kennedy was struck with a bullet that was made of sintered uranium or something,

56
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,220
or some really dense, heavy metal that splatters.

57
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,380
Well, some people think it may have been a mini black hole that actually...

58
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:05,840
Not possible.

59
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,040
Not possible.

60
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,580
Not possible.

61
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,260
Not possible.

62
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,800
Not possible.

63
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,500
It's certainly...

64
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,180
That's why there was so much disturbance in the brain material.

65
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:13,780
It's not.

66
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,780
It's not.

67
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:28,780


68
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,240
Hey, Matt.

69
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,120
Matt, I heard the song that refuses to die was in town.

70
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,300
I hope it doesn't come by here.

71
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,560
I hope this song doesn't come by here.

72
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,400
I don't hear the music, but gold.

73
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,460
Baby, gold.

74
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,140
Coming up in 10 seconds.

75
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:15,300
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

76
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,220
Mark.

77
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,800
What happened?

78
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,140
What happened?

79
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,600
What happened?

80
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:22,600


81
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:22,600


82
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:22,600


83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:22,600


84
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:22,600


85
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,200
What happened?

86
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:25,940
Okay.

87
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,020
Hey.

88
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,600
Hey.

89
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:26,920
Hey.

90
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,140
Okay.

91
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:28,820
Yes.

92
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,360
Yes.

93
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,920
It's okay.

94
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,920
It's okay.

95
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,160
We'll have the show under control.

96
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,480
Well, no, we won't.

97
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,480
We're never going to have the show under control tonight, my friends.

98
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,480
Because tonight is the show that refused to die.

99
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,720
The surreal hell show.

100
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,040
It's a surreal bunch of hell.

101
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,460
Think of what that sounds like.

102
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:53,460


103
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,660
Uh, I thought probably if it felt like it, like you're trying to get a situation out

104
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:54,660


105
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:54,660


106
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:54,660


107
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:54,660


108
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:54,660


109
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:54,660


110
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,280
because we'll have to take Lonesome Cowboy, Dave back to hell

111
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,140
and the Swing in Love corpses are having toâ€¦

112
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,960
Well, we've already given birth to it.

113
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,540
It's here, it's on the show.

114
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,080
The song that refused to die will continue

115
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:16,260
And of course, puzzling evidence in Dr. Hal Robbins will have us in for all sorts of trouble.

116
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:27,540
In the meantime, before we go completely deep, deep, deep down in,

117
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,400
first we're going to try to figure out what in the world is going on.

118
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,360
Come on!

119
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,500
In the world is going on.

120
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,480
Who can figure out what money's about?

121
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,440
I don't want to talk about it.

122
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,400
What goes on in the realm of the high priests of human value,

123
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,160
these souls forever, these souls so long?

124
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,540
I don't want to think about it.

125
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,000
I can't understand it. It's too complicated.

126
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,300
I mean, I don't know what goes on.

127
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,840
I don't want to talk about it.

128
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,720
What can I do about it anyway?

129
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,180
Well,

130
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,780
what is it you don't want to talk about?

131
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,360
About it?

132
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,980
I don't want to think about it.

133
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,300
I don't even want to hear about it.

134
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,580
It's like a tune that keeps haunting your mind.

135
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,360
What in the world is going on?

136
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,300
I don't want to think about it, okay, let's not.

137
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,440
I don't want to talk about it.

138
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,960
Don't tell me I don't hear you that I don't know why you don't want to.

139
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,840
Don't tell me why you don't want to talk about it.

140
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,460
I don't want to hear about why you don't want to talk about it.

141
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,960
I don't want to think about it.

142
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,680
Let's get into total denial.

143
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,920
But I do kind of actually wonder about it.

144
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,440
I just don't know how to talk about it

145
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,760
because I don't even know what it is.

146
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,280
What in the world is going on?

147
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,420
Who owns the world?

148
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,280
Whose world is it?

149
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,080
Who owns whose stuff?

150
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,140
Should you stuff your stuff when someone screws up?

151
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,700
Who pays someone sells weapons to Iraq or Iran

152
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,420
and there's a problem?

153
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:21,980
Who pays?

154
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,080
Somebody made billions off these fiascos.

155
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,020
Who pays?

156
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,060
Was it a race war?

157
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,900
Was it a class war?

158
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,020
Who cares?

159
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,720
We can fight over anything.

160
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,400
What in the world is going on?

161
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,220
What in the world is going on?

162
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,800
I mean, we spend fortunes to develop and build them.

163
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,560
And then we spend tons to agree to this time.

164
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,440
And then we spend twice as much to dismantle them.

165
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,060
People are hungry.

166
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,220
What in the world is going on?

167
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,560
I mean, we're spending our spiritual,

168
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,600
mental, and physical resources to create weapons

169
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,120
to kill each other over ideologies

170
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,000
that are supposed to make our lives better.

171
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,660
What are we doing here?

172
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,860
What in the world is going on?

173
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,900
I mean, we need to get clear what we really want.

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,020
I mean, what do you think I mean when I say I'm really mean?

175
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,820
Do I mean I'm mean or do I mean angry?

176
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,980
Do I mean angry or do I mean mad?

177
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,800
Do I mean mad or do I mean crazy?

178
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,680
Do I mean crazy or do I mean insane?

179
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,920
Or do I just mean incoherent?

180
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,600
Quick.

181
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,700
My mind is going to go crazy.

182
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,140
Find me an enemy.

183
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,680
Quick.

184
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,800
Find me someone to hate.

185
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,500
Do I mean hate or do I mean blame?

186
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,400
Do I mean blame or do I mean unload on?

187
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,260
What in the world is going on?

188
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,640
Think about it.

189
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,700
Is it true or not that your thought structures

190
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,980
and belief systems limit your ability to be present,

191
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,940
creative, and authentic?

192
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,520
Think about it.

193
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,040
Is it true or not that you're prejudiced?

194
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,260
Think about it.

195
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,100
What do you live in denial about?

196
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,780
That you're motivated and manipulated through hot buttons?

197
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,640
That you react more than you think?

198
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,900
Do we see the invisible forces that shape our lives?

199
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,080
Do we want to think about it?

200
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,880
Or are we too busy to care?

201
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,840
I mean, how free is the human spirit?

202
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,720
What in the world is going on?

203
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,520
So we're here because this is the best dream we can come up with as a group.

204
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,300
Pay attention to how you feel.

205
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,700
It's habitual.

206
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,120
Careful what you think about.

207
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,880
And what you don't think about.

208
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,140
What in the world is going on?

209
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,200
Oh, the tube of gloom.

210
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,880
The Will-O-Dobs brought me this tube of gloom.

211
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,260
The Will-O-Dobs brought me this tube of gloom.

212
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,180
It kind of, uh,

213
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,000
fits the financial situation of the church.

214
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,120
But that was, uh,

215
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,040
the new juke savages.

216
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,700
New improved juke savages.

217
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,980
Once again, dear friends, I'm so glad to

218
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,640
be able to present them

219
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,580
on the show.

220
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,620
Uh,

221
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,800
they and, uh, Krishna Fats and the Night Nurses

222
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,340
on their album Radical Militant Vegetarians in Nazi Land

223
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,120
from

224
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,240
Holy Funk Records and Tapes.

225
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,380
Yes, and, uh,

226
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,960
I'm gonna give you their address right now because I don't think you can...

227
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,640
You know, I don't think they have these records in stores

228
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,200
and I can't play most of the tape on the radio.

229
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,980
But it's Holy Funk at P.O. Box

230
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,940
2329 San Anselmo, California

231
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:29,700
949.

232
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,280
seven.

233
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,520
nine.

234
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,600
That's Box 2329 San Anselmo,

235
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,560
949.

236
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,480
seven nine.

237
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,480
Yes, and we'll play their other song, The New Age Nazis, in

238
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,420
just a minute if this show will ever, ever die!

239
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:47,880
Guys.

240
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,300
For several reasons, I'd say it was gone.

241
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,300
Battered enough, you know.

242
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,260
For the first three weeks of training, he tried to move in on me.

243
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,500
Even insofar as to tell me he'd had a vasectomy.

244
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,640
So Guy did have a relationship with Olga.

245
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,520
Yes.

246
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,600
Yes.

247
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,060
As far as Olga was concerned, Guy was interested and available.

248
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,000
They had their affair and...

249
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,540
She got pregnant.

250
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,100
Exactly.

251
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,320
Then he killed her.

252
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,160
He didn't have to.

253
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,520
Olga could never go public about her pregnancy.

254
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,900
Her husband would have had her killed.

255
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,680
Guy was perfectly safe.

256
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,440
He knew eventually she'd have to have an abortion.

257
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

258
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,060
You're welcome, Guy.

259
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,740
Thank you.

260
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:29,780
Thank you.

261
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:29,860


262
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:29,860


263
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:29,860


264
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:29,860


265
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,920
This is a message for world peace.

266
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,500
Bob!

267
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,620
No, you can't kill me!

268
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,200
Bob doesn't make me sick!

269
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,600
No!

270
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,600
No, no, no!

271
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:37,960
No, no, no!

272
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,760
Bob doesn't make me sick!

273
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,260
No, no, no!

274
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,000
No, no, no!

275
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,700
No, no, no!

276
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,840
No, no, no!

277
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,040
No, no, no!

278
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,860
No, no, no!

279
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,460
No, no, no!

280
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,220
It's the song that refuses to die.

281
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,700
The song that cannot die.

282
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,680
It wants to die.

283
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,380
It wanted to die so bad.

284
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,100
It wanted to die so bad, but...

285
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,840
It just can't.

286
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,640
It just couldn't die.

287
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,120
As soon as one drummer died,

288
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,560
another one would just pick up the fifth old beat.

289
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,100
Until pretty soon...

290
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:07,940
Oh, my God!

291
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,780
The song came back!

292
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,440
Goddamn, I could've died!

293
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,860
We gotta sing this little stupid song now, man.

294
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,180
Examples?

295
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,240
We can always set our own examples.

296
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,920
We can't set examples for others.

297
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,360
Are you a voice box?

298
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,640
Uh, no, I'm not even that.

299
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,680
I'm a hallucination that you're having right now.

300
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,940
Actually, I'm just a bad dream.

301
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:36,760
Quiet down.

302
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,360
Our music...

303
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,600
Precisely, Professor.

304
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,420
We must increase the megavoltage to...

305
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,660
We're speaking from Guam.

306
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,520
Aganya, Guam is where the studios are.

307
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,320
We patch in the special glass fiber line right here at KPFA.

308
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:49,560
Woo!

309
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,020
It's itchy out.

310
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,640
In fact, somebody else is dreaming about us speaking,

311
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,780
and once that person wakes up, poof, we're gone.

312
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,680
What if that's a scary and mad killer?

313
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,200
Well, this isn't scary. This is wholesome.

314
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,840
Very mad killer?

315
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,880
This has a sense of family value.

316
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,940
Sense? Just sense?

317
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,660
Just a sense.

318
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,640
Rin Tin Tin.

319
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,720
Yummy family value.

320
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
Did you know that Rin Tin Tin,

321
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,020
who was a dog who lived in the 19th century at Fort Ridiculous

322
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,540
with Rusty, his little pal,

323
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,560
was revived recently as a TV series?

324
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,880
And guess what?

325
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,520
Now Rin Tin Tin is a cop.

326
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,140
He's out sniffing out small-time drug users and blah, blah, blah.

327
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,500
You know, what did they do?

328
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,160
Did they find him frozen in the ice at Fort Ridiculous

329
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,740
and revive him or something?

330
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,180
How did Rin Tin Tin get to the 20th century

331
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,360
and then he turns out to be a drug-sniffing cop?

332
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,180
Well, just like Walt Disney, isn't it?

333
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,560
Walt Disney has a wonderful world of law enforcement.

334
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,180
Walt's my cousin.

335
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,480
Oh, man.

336
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,180
Well, that's too bad. May he rest in peace.

337
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,520
Oh, Walt Disney.

338
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,360
Oh, Walt.

339
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,220
As he rests in cryogenic suspension,

340
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,480
60 feet below the surface of the Disneyland amusement park.

341
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,500
It's actually Saturday, but it's Friday.

342
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,080
It can't be a face-transfer.

343
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,600
I've never quite understood that.

344
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,660
Neuromotor functions slowed down

345
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,500
by the suspended animation procedure.

346
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,100
I'm over here, yeah.

347
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,780
Mr. Disney rests comfortably,

348
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,420
awaiting his revivification in the second century.

349
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,500
There's no phone to get from here.

350
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,180
No, I'm not talking to you.

351
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,480
Right.

352
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,340
And this is all an illusion.

353
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,740
But it's very tiresome.

354
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,460
It's a mold bugger.

355
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,380
This is boring.

356
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,460
Those callers aren't doing anything.

357
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,200
We should poke them with sticks and make them jump.

358
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,980
Here's a little Bernie stick.

359
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,600
A little Bernie stick?

360
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,980
Yeah, it's got little Bernies on the end.

361
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,540
Okay, you callers, here, take that.

362
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,460
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

363
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,680
Hey, they're trying to do things.

364
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,280
It just doesn't reach.

365
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,600
I need a slightly longer stick.

366
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,120
We'll have to waltz back over to the KPFA fireplace

367
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,480
here at the KPFA ski lodge and get other little sticks.

368
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,020
Let's not burn the place down getting too enthusiastic.

369
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,480
That's true.

370
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,180
I guess all this newspaper around here might catch on fire.

371
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,020
Look at that.

372
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,520
Bernie numbers dropping down.

373
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,040
I have some mighty fond memories connected with that.

374
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,320
Dr. Howell, what's happening?

375
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,800
Well, my pleasant imagination is soaring now,

376
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,300
up into empyrean realms.

377
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:20,840
A jug of wine, a loaf of bread, the stereo on at night,

378
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,120
in a lonely cabin, I call.

379
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,760
Honeymoon Hotel.

380
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,960
Yes, this was our honeymoon of horror.

381
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,280
This small, inconsequential muttering voice

382
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,160
takes me back to that mysterious room and that strange occasion

383
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,720
when I was not sure whether I dreamed or was awake.

384
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,600
But the more I tried to make sense of that maniacal,

385
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,500
I felt like, hey, you're not supposed to be there.

386
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,720
It was the song that refused to die.

387
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
Nobody wanted it.

388
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,460
God almighty, they could have used some sleep.

389
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,660
But the song refused to die.

390
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,900
The song started two years ago, but still, still it refused to die.

391
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
It wasn't a very pretty song.

392
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,080
You couldn't even call it an interesting song.

393
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,360
But it was, unfortunately, an immortal song.

394
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,380
All it, all it'd do was keep going and going.

395
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,640
Every now and then it would get on some semblance of an emotional tone.

396
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,320
But then somebody would get on a mic and couldn't even sing.

397
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,980
Then it would just splinter into a sargassional sea of sound

398
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,480
and maybe even a happy little emotional song.

399
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,280
Then it'd start to get murky again.

400
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,500
Nonsense.

401
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,320
I see Jane Seymour with a large,

402
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:54,840
midget.

403
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,120
Midget?

404
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,740
I think those are only extremely small giants.

405
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,340
They are giants in embryo.

406
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,900
For does not the small and the very large meet somewhere along the cosmic loop?

407
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,920
The average Protestant

408
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,480
has a very dim notion concerning the angelic hierarchies,

409
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,000
the great hosts of beings of another evolution than ours,

410
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,200
though children of the same heavenly Father.

411
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,120
The Kabbalah, however, is explicit on this point

412
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,100
and classifies them into ten archangels and ten orders of angelic beings.

413
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,160
Buddhist, Hindu and Mohammedan theology are equally explicit.

414
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,700
We may therefore reckon that in this agreement of witnesses there is surety of testimony,

415
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,840
and it may serve our purpose best to take for our guide that system from which Christianity took its rise,

416
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,260
mystic Judaism.

417
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,080
We will not go into the elaborate classifications employed by the Jewish rabbis,

418
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,100
which have their importance for purposes of magic,

419
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,220
but are not germane to our present issue.

420
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,600
It is enough that we realize that there are divinely created beings of various degrees of greatness,

421
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,580
from the mighty archangel whom Saint John the Divine saw standing in the sun

422
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:27,180
down to the nameless heavenly messengers who have from time to time visited mankind.

423
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,140
Well, what good is it to be unrestrained when you're sexless and bodiless?

424
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,280
Well, that's part of the fun.

425
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,460
They just get to do the will of God all the time.

426
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,760
And lots of space sex.

427
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,100
Or time sex.

428
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,160
I didn't know that time sex was an Olympic event, but apparently it is in my year.

429
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,600
Funny you should bring that up anyway.

430
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,920
Well, one day maybe. I don't know.

431
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,460
Maybe someone can call up and tell us what angel sex is like,

432
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,720
or what they imagine it might be like. I don't know.

433
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,440
I feel like making an adventurous enquiry here into the ether.

434
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,540
And maybe my angel will look down on me and say,

435
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,360
angel sex, that's something to look forward to.

436
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,140
Yes, this was our honeymoon of horror.

437
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,640
What I have to do to satisfy you?

438
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,740
Fiction on us.

439
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,900
Why don't you shut up?

440
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,440
What?

441
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,220
What?

442
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,020
Hasn't it occurred to you that I'm having a tough time keeping my hands off you?

443
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,760
Oh, I'm having a real tough time...

444
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:41,340
keeping my voice off of you listeners.

445
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,600
Because I like to caress you with my hideous foul breath and tongue.

446
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,800
You...

447
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,520
You would think...

448
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:51,780
You would think...

449
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,120
You would think...

450
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,560
Welcome to the new age.

451
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,780
We're the new age Nazis.

452
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,700
We hate everyone.

453
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,540
We hate those wimps and cowards who had to pick on someone in particular to hate.

454
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,980
We're the new age Nazis.

455
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,700
We hate everyone.

456
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,640
We hate everything.

457
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,040
We even hate ourselves.

458
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,460
We especially hate ourselves when we really look down on those wimps

459
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,500
who can't even stand their own hatred and try to protect it on other people.

460
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,960
We're the new age Nazis.

461
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,400
We hate everyone.

462
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,200
Let's kill everyone.

463
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,880
Don't give me that old-fashioned half-Nazi attitude.

464
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,120
Let's get real.

465
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,020
I mean, let's get real mean.

466
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,560
No one's good enough to live.

467
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,380
Let's hate and kill and not limit it to blacks or Jews or Asians or Republicans.

468
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,900
You know, just pick on someone who's different than you.

469
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,900
Come on, get creative.

470
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,720
That's been done.

471
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,740
Every asinine culture does that.

472
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,740
Let's hate and kill and really get into it full on.

473
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,360
Let's hate the 49ers.

474
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,560
Let's hate Billy Martin.

475
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,960
We're the new age Nazis.

476
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,200
We hate everyone and everything.

477
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,160
We hate the rainforest.

478
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,520
We hate the industrialists.

479
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,140
We hate the workers.

480
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,880
We hate the air.

481
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,600
We hate the oceans.

482
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,380
We hate the earth.

483
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,740
We hate being out of control.

484
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,340
We hate thought and religion.

485
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,120
We hate time.

486
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,480
We hate feelings and ideas.

487
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,360
We hate the banks.

488
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,180
We hate the homeless.

489
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,420
We hate the spotted owls and vegetarians.

490
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,640
But most of all, we hate life.

491
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,240
Where we can't keep it up is we love hate.

492
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,180
We love hate.

493
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,260
We love blaming.

494
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,020
We love killing.

495
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,760
We love hurting and projecting our pain on others.

496
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,140
But we're the new age Nazis.

497
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,640
Where we shine is we don't stop.

498
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,860
They're like the old fashioned Nazis who naively thought they just hated other people.

499
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,840
We hate ourselves.

500
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,820
We poison our own air and water and our own minds and souls with hatred and bad thoughts

501
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,940
and feelings and toxic waste and television for God's sake.

502
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,760
We're the new age Nazis.

503
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
We hate everyone and everything.

504
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,240
Join the party.

505
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,200
Kill for peace.

506
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,880
Join the new age Nazis.

507
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,920
Send us your dues.

508
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,500
And get put on the list.

509
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,000
Welcome to the new age.

510
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,660
We're going to turn the whole earth into an oven.

511
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,420
We don't have to round people up.

512
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,780
You can't win.

513
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,160
People love to hate.

514
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,360
So we can't lose.

515
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,280
Welcome to the new age.

516
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,420
Join the new age Nazis.

517
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,740
Welcome to the new age.

518
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,520
Join the new age Nazis.

519
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,900
Welcome to the new age.

520
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,500
No offense.

521
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:19,500


522
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:19,500


523
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:19,520
Don't try to featured into the documentary.

524
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,640
Ð¸Ñ€Ð¾Ð²ayIlhoseunic.com

525
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,740
The New Age Nazis.

526
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,680
Welcome to the new age.

527
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,340
And the church of the sub geniuss zaten ist EN dal Normal.

528
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:44,880
Der New Age Nazis Unver38 acontece is fram pity gewaltig hier lÃ¤h het.

529
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,240
Ut es verlag hier.

530
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:51,300
savages, the New Age Nazis, radical militant vegetarians in Nazi land.

531
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,960
Oh, just lovely.

532
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,520
And just before that, you heard some of Reverend Velveteen Sly,

533
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,740
the lovely Reverend Velveteen Sly, and the lovely Reverend Angus McGamora

534
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,740
talking about angel sex.

535
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:13,540
And as usual with any hour of Slack show, you get little bits and pieces,

536
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:21,000
sometimes long bits and pieces from the show that dare not speak its name.

537
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,060
They're from KPFA in Berkeley with puzzling evidence and...

538
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,760
Doctor Howell.

539
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,740
Oh, that feels good, yeah.

540
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,780
And people hoped it would be able to die, but it kept twitching.

541
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,360
Its heart wouldn't give up.

542
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:00,280
It might have been a nice song to begin with in some remote town,

543
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,260
but now it just wouldn't die.

544
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,600
Just when you thought they had given up,

545
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,360
it would scream and just keep getting uglier and uglier.

546
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,600
Oh!

547
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,720
Oh!

548
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh!

549
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,620
Oh!

550
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:12,960


551
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:13,520


552
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:14,860
Oh!

553
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,560
Oh!

554
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:16,800
Oh!

555
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,580
Oh!

556
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:17,740


557
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:17,740


558
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,420
Oh, now it's playing again.

559
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,300
Okay.

560
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,680
Oh, I bet that's what it was.

561
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,200
Okay, where's the, um, thing that adjusts the level?

562
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,020
Uncover the viewing dome.

563
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,380
This one?

564
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:29,960
Uh...

565
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,480
Okay, I'm talking, talking, talking.

566
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,300
All right, let's take a good look at this.

567
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,720
Okay, I'm talking now, and you're trying to adjust me to zero.

568
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,220
Adjust image size to zero.

569
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,520
That looked about right.

570
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,220
Yeah, I think...

571
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,600
Okay, this is a long, continuous tone.

572
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,040
Now we'll retrieve the signal.

573
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:59,360
Scratched out as it passes cosmic distance in interstellar space.

574
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,000
Hey, Hal, look, Bob's talking.

575
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,340
Oh, that blowhard, why doesn't he sit down and shut up?

576
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,460
Oh, is this an open channel?

577
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,460
Well, just joking, as you know, we maintain high standards of radio standards.

578
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,440
You see, that board is lit up like a Christmas tree,

579
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,060
and in fact, it is an old Christmas tree which we never did jettison

580
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,020
and is growing to be a fire hazard here in the control cabin.

581
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,840
I say that, and I don't mind anyone knowing.

582
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,500
For better or for worse, we've got to live with our usual telepressions.

583
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:34,800
One social critic.

584
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,780
A dangerous cult of techno-shamanists

585
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,520
whose mental health is at risk.

586
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,580
Members worship its billionaire founder.

587
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,540
E. Howard Higginbottom.

588
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,140
What do you think of that, caller?

589
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,280
That's your cue.

590
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,940
Can't you pick up your cues faster than that?

591
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,440
They always try, but you see, they never learn.

592
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,600
Even plenarian worms can learn,

593
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,720
but horrors can never learn to take their turn.

594
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,140
Very good.

595
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,600
Unusual group of true believers,

596
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,020
and...

597
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,460
...animalistic worshippers,

598
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,260
generally from backwoods, remote portions of the country.

599
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,900
Rural Texas, Arkansas,

600
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,000
and the darker woods of Iowa.

601
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,780
The desperate, the lonely,

602
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,420
losers, pencil-neck geeks, wimps,

603
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,760
the maladroit, those with yards,

604
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,600
all found under the aegis of subgenius fandom.

605
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,700
The

606
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,580
This is an authentic Bob lecture,

607
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,380
one of the first of seven seminars given by Bob in 1956.

608
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:08,760
He's divine.

609
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,840
And look at them lap it up.

610
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:13,980
He's divine.

611
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,500
There they all are, sitting in the front row in embryo.

612
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,280
The embryo jainer and the embryo stang.

613
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,540
And the embryo sterno.

614
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,480
He's divine life.

615
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,600
Even the embryo phylo.

616
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,380
And you will live in eternal bliss.

617
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,180
It went through three generations of musicians.

618
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,980
All the musicians who start playing the song are dead.

619
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,800
But not the song.

620
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,400
Oh, no.

621
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,260
No way.

622
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,180
No way.

623
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,740
Yeah, that old song ain't gonna die.

624
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,540
No siree.

625
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,000
Oh, you can pray for the song to die.

626
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,080
You can call up your mom and say,

627
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,820
Oh, ma'am, make the song die.

628
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,680
My ears hurt, ma'am.

629
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,200
But it just keeps getting louder and louder and louder.

630
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,960
It's like it wants to hurt you.

631
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,520
Just when you thought it was over,

632
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,240
when you thought you killed it,

633
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,920
oh, God, it brings you back to life.

634
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,560
Oh, no.

635
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,600
You just have to keep listening and listening.

636
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,200
Oh, a guitarist may die,

637
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,000
but someone else will come along.

638
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,020
Maybe they try to kill it,

639
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,500
but no, the song will just keep playing and playing itself.

640
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,560
The song that refused to die.

641
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,260
It was the song that refused to die.

642
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,160
It was the song that refused to die.

643
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,200
The song that refused to die.

644
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,440
It was the song that refused to die.

645
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,560
What? Is it dead?

646
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,260
Is it dead yet?

647
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,240
Is the song dead yet?

648
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:56,940
No!

649
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,340
Ah!

650
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,360
And I said,

651
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,780
Hey, you.

652
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,640
Hello, guys.

653
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,920
What's that voice saying on the radio?

654
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,640
Yeah, I know you.

655
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,460
Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.

656
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,600
Yeah, I know you.

657
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,960
This is Conor Red.

658
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:13,900
Red alert.

659
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,020
This is not a test.

660
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,160
This is an alert.

661
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,040
Yeah, that's a good idea.

662
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,020
Take cover immediately, everyone.

663
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,340
Yeah, yeah.

664
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,820
I repeat, this is not a test.

665
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,100
This is Conor Red.

666
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,660
Yeah, yeah.

667
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,760
Take cover immediately.

668
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,700
We are under attack.

669
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,560
Yeah, that's a good idea.

670
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,440
Yeah.

671
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,380
The drums were broken,

672
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,380
but that wouldn't stop the song.

673
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:35,940
Uh-uh.

674
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,580
The power went out.

675
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,480
You think that's gonna stop the song?

676
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,580
Whoo, you wish.

677
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,000
The song that refused.

678
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,240
Refused to die.

679
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,740
Bullets couldn't stop it.

680
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,640
Flamethrowers couldn't stop it.

681
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,060
The nuclear bomb, the harmonic convergence.

682
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,200
They tried everything they could think of,

683
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,340
but the song refused to die.

684
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,220
It continued to live,

685
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,280
relentlessly tearing into your eardrums.

686
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,980
You think it's dead?

687
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,400
Uh-uh, forget it.

688
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,700
Oh, this song's gonna be around longer if you're dead, boy.

689
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,340
Listen, listen.

690
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,780
It's heartbeats.

691
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,180
Oh, no, fibrillations.

692
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,720
Has the pain ended?

693
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
Oh, God, no.

694
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,860
Look at that EET.

695
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,500
It's incredible that it can keep in a coma for this long.

696
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,620
You still go on and on and not die.

697
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,120
State short question, please.

698
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,860
But hurry, because that volcano's molten magma will soon be upon us.

699
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,060
But you must hurry.

700
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,420
There's a computer file here of Bob images.

701
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,760
Must leave me, children.

702
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,260
Things are like this in California.

703
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,700
This is where Bob was screaming on the edge of the volcano

704
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,940
and he threw the Virgin in,

705
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,720
and that ought to portend a good harvest this year.

706
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,380
Sorry.

707
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,080
It's pretty neat.

708
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,880
Wow, there's Bob.

709
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,640
Look, he's an old man now.

710
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,360
He's standing on that glowing piece of pumice.

711
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,100
Oh, I see.

712
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,500
He's just a fake bum.

713
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,440
A hologram of projection.

714
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,600
And now we've got the vibrabed at the Toreador Inn

715
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,820
with Bob and his concubine.

716
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,040
It's just like that.

717
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,280
He's got thousands of tiny fingers telling him to let go.

718
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,080
And look, he did.

719
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,520
Oh, yeah, so he did.

720
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,860
He's let go and he's become free.

721
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,900
Floating free at the end of his tether in microgravity conditions.

722
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:24,900
Yeah.

723
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,760
Looks awfully small to me, too.

724
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,160
Okay, now he's floating over to the bathroom.

725
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,560
...forced him to flee.

726
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,740
Bob is needing to discharge his ballast in Earth's orbit.

727
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,320
...massive clips make it invulnerable to those who wish to get on...

728
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:36,360
Wow, look at that place.

729
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,560
Great place in the Pyrenees there Bob bought to get away from Arkansas.

730
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,320
...the only things on the mountain...

731
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,100
...are this 700-year-old village...

732
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,200
...compelled by the space tether to this giant mountain...

733
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,260
...and surrounded by a 700-year-old village...

734
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:49,860
...the temple is turned into a place...

735
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,180
...into a sort of shrine.

736
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,360
...an English archaeological shrine.

737
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:53,820
Hmm, yeah.

738
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,660
...who is it?

739
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,340
Oh, oh, oh, strangling the collar.

740
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,420
Now wait a minute.

741
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,140
At the top of my script here it says...

742
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,400
...we...

743
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,480
...oh, there it is.

744
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,240
Excuse me, sorry.

745
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,840
...a little escape button.

746
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,580
You just press this and whoop, there it goes.

747
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,440
Right off the screen.

748
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,540
That must be the cough button for some reason.

749
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:10,900
Yeah, sort of like that.

750
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,300
And, uh, he's got a little, uh, little, uh, little, uh, little, uh, little, uh, little,

751
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:12,300


752
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:12,300


753
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:12,300


754
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:12,300


755
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:12,580
Now, here we go.

756
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:12,840
Oh.

757
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,420
We've got the Heo people here.

758
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,200
These obnoxious child actors, I've never liked them.

759
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,600
They're all trying to get me to Heo, but all I know is lie down, roll over and play dead.

760
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,500
I'm sorry, I can't understand them.

761
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:32,060
And I refuse to participate in this cult-like mass insanity.

762
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,880
Can't you people understand me?

763
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,460
I'm unburdening my bosom to you.

764
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,380
Why, you cold, unfeeling...

765
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,520
It was too much for them.

766
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,420
And I wondered, was it also too much for me?

767
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,740
My heart was beating like a trip hammer.

768
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,500
I reeled, doubled back, lurched forward, and...

769
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:58,880
...collapsed.

770
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,780
My pain is gone.

771
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,860
You are the divine power.

772
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,980
He's turned the village and the temple into an armed fortress.

773
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,580
Oh, don't mention it all.

774
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,620
See these white lights?

775
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,820
They represent armed watchtowers.

776
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,960
Those green lights represent the checkpoints.

777
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,700
The roving band of guards.

778
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,940
In two weeks, the brotherhood will be in the last game

779
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,080
of its annual baptismal rituals for new comers.

780
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,900
From sunset to sunrise, they observe this night

781
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,760
with celebrations and indoctrination.

782
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,120
Look.

783
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,300
A year ago, two hot organizers abandoned the court.

784
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,160
We got through before the assassination was.

785
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,740
We developed a new prince diagram for West.

786
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,660
We even smuggled out a key to the temple's main entrance.

787
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,580
Oh, thank you, Dr. Howell.

788
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:00,440
That was lovely, Dr. Howell, and puzzling evidence.

789
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,260
I'm afraid things won't be quite so lovely anymore.

790
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,900
Because now, Sister Mary Squared au contraire.

791
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,420
And yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

792
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:23,560
Courtesy of Brainrot Radio Theater in WCSB, Cleveland.

793
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,700
In the town of WCSB, in the state of Cleveland.

794
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,640
In the country of Ohio.

795
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,640
In the universe of America.

796
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,600
We'll take...

797
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,660
Lonesome...

798
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,640
Cowboy Dave...

799
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,200
Back...

800
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:41,940
To...

801
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,500
Hell.

802
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,460
Sorry.

803
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,760
Hold.

804
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:47,640
Ha ha ha ha!

805
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,440
I wanted to kill people and stuff.

806
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,980
I just didn't have the guts.

807
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,680
Ah, now he's starting to catch on.

808
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,940
I didn't have the balls to do it.

809
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I didn't want to be good.

810
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,960
I actually...

811
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,920
Really wanted to, like...

812
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,420
Oh, now he's trying to talk his way out of it.

813
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,780
... torture people and stuff.

814
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,160
And remove, like, ligaments from their kneecaps.

815
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,140
Should we play him the tape of him trying to talk his way out of it the first time?

816
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:07,220
Should we play him the tape of him trying to talk his way out of it the first time?

817
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:07,840
Oh, we've already played it. Oh, now he's trying to talk his way out of it the first time?

818
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,280
We've already played the tape of him trying to talk his way out of it the second time.

819
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,460
Did I hear the tape the first time the second time?

820
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,840
Don't you remember, Dave?

821
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,460
I thought I remembered that one.

822
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,500
See, if you had remembered, the contract would have been voided!

823
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,120
But no, you didn't remember!

824
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,040
Mm-hmm.

825
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,460
So, it's still on.

826
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,920
Ha ha ha ha!

827
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,540
It's all right there in the print.

828
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:26,940
In the...

829
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,340
In...

830
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,900
It's not even fine print.

831
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,380
It's perfectly legible, Cyrillian, uh, text.

832
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,300
I remember...

833
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:34,800
You said you understood!

834
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,660
When Saint Cyrillus Methodius...

835
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,520
Why, I'm just gonna screw up again. Just listen to this.

836
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,560
This one is not the Swing Ship Manuscript.

837
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,660
Saint Cyrillius Methodius...

838
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,100
This is the Verdango Key to Freedom!

839
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,080
We... we dangle it right in front of his face, and then he just, like, that's the part that he misses.

840
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:49,540
It's true.

841
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,500
It just goes for everything else. He tries the pleading, the begging, the lying...

842
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,440
It's true. David, David, David!

843
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,620
Don't get Ren! Get Zen!

844
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,660
Become... become one with the key!

845
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,880
Become... become one with the... with the... the freedom of the... of the whole kingdom,

846
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,980
and the theme park, and the contracts, and the...

847
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,240
and the multi-million dollar movie screen. It's all yours! You can have it, Dave!

848
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,240
It can be fun if you accept the pain!

849
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,800
Yes! Enjoy the pain!

850
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,620
Learn to love the hate!

851
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,260
Love it! Embrace it! It's yours!

852
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,920
Learn to just sink into the pain, Dave!

853
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,860
I'm sinking into it like a four-year-old child.

854
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,520
Not that it's going to get you out of here any sooner!

855
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,360
What?!

856
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:36,960
But it'll seem... the time will seem to go by faster, although that's fairly, uh, moot point, when you're...

857
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:45,240
talking in terms of utter timelessness and eternity of awareness of the pain forever and ever and ever!

858
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,940
There's no place like my ego! There's no place like my ego!

859
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,800
Oh, Dave, we were... Hey, Dave! Dave, we were just kidding.

860
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,980
We were just kidding. We're really going to let you out of that box.

861
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,720
We're going to unhook you from the machine. It was all just a joke.

862
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,960
It was a... it was just part of the theme park! Yeah!

863
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,500
You're not really in hell. We didn't want you to get totally freaked out.

864
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,640
No. A little freaked out. We've had problems with people who believed it, you know, because it was so...

865
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,200
it was so convincing, but no, no. You'll be disconnected very soon, and it's all... it's still just a ride.

866
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,860
What do you mean by disconnected? You don't need to be upset.

867
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,760
It's fine. I guess I owe you that dollar.

868
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,300
I didn't believe when you turned it up to ten it would really do that.

869
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,640
What do you mean by disconnected, you guys?

870
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,220
Technology.

871
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,120
What do you mean by disconnected, though?

872
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,200
Does that mean, like, she used to exist or something?

873
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,220
Oh, would you rather stay hooked up?

874
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,200
No, no, no. I...

875
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,180
We'd be glad to leave you here. That's no problem.

876
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,620
Sure. I'll babysit you, Dave.

877
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,400
It's fun. Oh, I think he likes it. I think he likes being connected.

878
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,700
Okay, Dave. We won't disconnect you.

879
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,360
No, no, no. No, no, wait.

880
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,660
You can stay right there in the little box.

881
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,120
Wait a second.

882
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,200
Shooting the ticks.

883
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,600
No, no. All I meant was...

884
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,100
Oh, we missed that one.

885
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,160
I just want to explain.

886
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:58,480
You're confused.

887
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,220
Oh, I meant that, you know, I wouldn't get killed or anything, right?

888
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,400
If, say, for instance, when you said disconnected...

889
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:04,920
Oh, now I...

890
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,320
Oh, I was worried about being killed.

891
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:06,700
Be killed.

892
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:12,520
Oh, Dave, around here, that's truly the very last thing you have to worry about.

893
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,440
Absolutely.

894
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,540
Killed. Killed.

895
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,020
You'll be...

896
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:22,040
You're gonna be smoking packs of cigarettes ten a minute trying to give yourself cancer

897
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,120
when you figure out what's going on here, boy.

898
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,540
You're gonna pray for a car wreck and there won't be any cars.

899
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,360
You're gonna be banging your head against the wall.

900
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,920
Uh-huh.

901
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,200
No, we were just kidding. Really, really.

902
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,420
Let's be nice to him.

903
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,000
Oh, okay.

904
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,440
Let's be nice to him for a while.

905
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,520
We've been nice to him.

906
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,740
Actually, we...

907
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,240
Yeah, we could show him what it would be like to not...

908
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,180
Not be nice.

909
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,620
Hey, that's a good shoot here.

910
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,460
I have a nervous breakdown.

911
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,080
I can feel fish going in the middle of my brain.

912
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,780
Could that be?

913
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,280
Perhaps he's lost his mind.

914
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,300
Oh.

915
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,680
That would almost be a blessing, wouldn't it?

916
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,340
He could just give up.

917
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,580
He wouldn't have to think ever again.

918
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,960
Not a single thought for eternity.

919
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,620
Guess what, Dave?

920
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,360
We thought of that already.

921
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,440
All of your little tricks, losing your mind, trying to commit suicide and so forth,

922
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,700
everybody tries that.

923
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,720
Everybody down here does that.

924
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,880
I did it myself.

925
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,720
Sister Mary here, I remember the time you jumped off those...

926
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,440
That Empire State Building over and over again.

927
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,220
I just couldn't get it off.

928
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,620
Surely this time.

929
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,880
It was almost like a game, a pastime.

930
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,940
We all go through these little fates.

931
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,340
The only thing that we realize, is you'll become more accepting.

932
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,620
Of course, as soon as it becomes more accepting, you know, what's the point of that?

933
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,080
No, we're just kidding, Dave.

934
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:42,640
I do.

935
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,240
No, you're doing everything right.

936
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,320
You're doing exactly what the script said.

937
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,760
They always follow the script.

938
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,180
That's the amazing thing about it.

939
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,460
It's always the same.

940
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,940
But no matter how differently you set up the environment or the reality around it,

941
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,360
they still follow the script.

942
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,960
The curve is mightier than the sword.

943
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,380
If you can't go straight, you can always go around.

944
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,280
And around and around and around.

945
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,840
Around and around.

946
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,040
It's a big wheel, babe.

947
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,780
It is a wheel.

948
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,960
It's like, you know, you're true.

949
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,920
You're not on Earth anymore, but it's like Buddhism, you know?

950
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,880
You can just, perhaps someday you'll be able to escape the wheel.

951
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,500
Can I at least grab a spoke?

952
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,640
Let's dangle some hope in front of his eyes.

953
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,200
Yes, yes, you can be a spoke in the wheel.

954
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:29,920
Oh, and if you graduate, you can be a tack that pops the other wheels and gives them flats.

955
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,040
Or perhaps the tread of the wheel.

956
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,860
I remember when Andrew was caught in the body of a pig,

957
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,440
and then Klishner or Vishner or whatever the hell his name is

958
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,100
cut him in half and let the pigs come out,

959
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,960
and he realized he was injuring them.

960
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,880
That doesn't have to do with this either, does it?

961
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,620
No, no, that doesn't have anything to do with it.

962
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,560
No, no.

963
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,660
The pigs?

964
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,860
Absolutely not, no.

965
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,320
I don't know anything about the pigs.

966
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,780
No, that might be a way.

967
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,500
Get out, Dave.

968
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,200
Can we get the pigs out of here?

969
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,400
You might try the pigs.

970
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:02,560
Move the pigs.

971
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:02,780
Go ahead.

972
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,520
Move the pigs.

973
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,740
Let's help him.

974
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,300
Let's help him.

975
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:10,220
Maybe with the pigs he can, he'll stumble onto the special thing.

976
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,700
Oh, there.

977
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,720
What's the matter, Dave?

978
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,420
Not the kind of pigs you're used to?

979
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,300
My toes feel like plastic.

980
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,440
Oh, what a porker.

981
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,920
Oh, my aching feet.

982
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,620
Please.

983
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,100
I'll get this.

984
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,020
I'll get this away from my groin.

985
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,200
Oh, jeez.

986
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:31,920
Oh, he's complaining.

987
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,920
Well, for crying out loud.

988
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,400
He's complaining that he doesn't like the blue pigs.

989
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,740
It was a pretty sharp little nuzzle there.

990
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,280
You know, I'm only human.

991
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,680
Davey, Davey, behave.

992
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,800
Slaughter them.

993
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,340
Slaughter all of the pigs.

994
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:50,040
Cast the madman disease out of them and throw them off a cliff or something

995
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,340
in some hideous parody of some religious superstition of ancient days.

996
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,800
It's just like mythology, man.

997
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,720
People who thought they could somehow escape.

998
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,160
What has exactly happened to Dave and what happened to you and me?

999
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,240
But look at us.

1000
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,480
We graduated.

1001
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:05,960
We did.

1002
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,260
Now we get to do it to him.

1003
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:07,900
Well, come here.

1004
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,960
Dave, you'll get to do it.

1005
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,440
It goes around.

1006
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,700
It's the wheel and the spoke thing all over again.

1007
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,480
There you go.

1008
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,260
Uh-huh.

1009
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,020
In a nutshell.

1010
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,700
Soon you'll be the highway.

1011
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,440
You won't be the wheel forever.

1012
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,720
Someday you two could be the roadkill or even the highway itself.

1013
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,360
I've been the possum plenty of times.

1014
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,660
I don't see why you have to keep on getting re-boarded and ignaminated all over again and

1015
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:29,900
keep on doing it.

1016
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,360
I don't see why you have to keep on getting reconstituted and coming back and be tortured

1017
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,280
by you two again.

1018
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,620
I don't even know who you are.

1019
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,000
That's the question that has bothered mankind down through the ages, Dave.

1020
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,360
And you know what?

1021
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,040
You know why?

1022
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,480
Because we've actually got nothing better to do.

1023
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,200
That's the answer right there.

1024
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,740
I thought so.

1025
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,800
Nothing better to do at all.

1026
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,260
It's just to pass time.

1027
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,380
We've got lots of that, Dave.

1028
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,100
That's right.

1029
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,260
Lots of that.

1030
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,180
All for nothing.

1031
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,260
I know.

1032
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,280
We suspected that.

1033
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,520
It always seemed so aimless, so fruitless, so pointless.

1034
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,480
It's just another soul torture to hell.

1035
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,420
And he's too...

1036
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:03,900
He likes things.

1037
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,860
Walking around, talking to him about Bob Dobbs, making him experience all kinds of...

1038
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,860
He's probably just like a dream thing.

1039
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,500
You got your money back.

1040
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,320
You got triple your money back.

1041
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,700
And a free glass of ice water, too.

1042
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,700
What more could you want?

1043
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,460
And the brochure.

1044
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,000
I wanted thrice...

1045
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,900
And the maps.

1046
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,660
I wanted thrice my salvation, like you had promised in this brief document.

1047
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:23,420
No, it's...

1048
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,080
No, it's...

1049
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:24,900
Twice your money back.

1050
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,140
Salivation.

1051
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:26,660
You didn't...

1052
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,500
Salivation.

1053
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,140
Twice your salvation.

1054
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:29,640
Salivation, Dave.

1055
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,320
And what do you think your shoes are full of?

1056
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,920
You've got the salivation.

1057
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,600
You've got the $60 check.

1058
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,540
You've got the handbook.

1059
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,280
And you've got the game control.

1060
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,780
And the callus.

1061
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,280
You've built up quite a good callus on yourself.

1062
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,840
And yet you still can't get it.

1063
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,780
You just...

1064
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,940
It's simple, Dave.

1065
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,560
If I got...

1066
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,960
They're shooting ticks for nothing, man.

1067
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:51,240
If I got a massive talus on my hair, and if I have got, like, whatever...

1068
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,960
What's one thing that I have said before?

1069
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,040
Why do I...

1070
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:54,420
They all do.

1071
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,200
I'm salivating in my shoes.

1072
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:56,820
I would do if I were...

1073
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,640
Why would I need to do that?

1074
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:58,920
That's right.

1075
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,100
That was good.

1076
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:00,660
I like that.

1077
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,360
I do, too.

1078
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:01,720
All right.

1079
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,720
Oh, that's another flashback.

1080
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,340
Would you like Sister Mary to get into the little box with you?

1081
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,200
Is that what you really think you'd like?

1082
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,640
That would help me out a little bit.

1083
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,640
I mean, you know, why just...

1084
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,320
Okay, Dave.

1085
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,520
Well, why don't I just pop right over here next to you?

1086
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:15,960
There.

1087
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,200
Are my tits in your way?

1088
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,500
I'm sorry, Dave.

1089
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:19,900
That's right.

1090
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,300
I didn't mean to get that close to you.

1091
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,240
Keep shooting, and those ticks will be killed.

1092
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,900
I'm controlling a joystick now.

1093
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,400
Those ticks are coming over...

1094
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:27,480
Oops, I'm sorry.

1095
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,100
Oh, jeez.

1096
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,120
You distracted me.

1097
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,320
Are you missing you from your game, Dave?

1098
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,080
I keep missing you.

1099
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,300
Are you missing the ticks?

1100
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,400
What's this down here?

1101
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,540
Is there a bit less blood on the desert floor?

1102
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,840
I can't see them anymore.

1103
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,300
I can't see any more ticks.

1104
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:39,660
I can't see any more ticks anymore.

1105
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,420
He's never going to get another life this way.

1106
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,160
All right.

1107
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,580
Now, turn her into the pig.

1108
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:51,900
Get off!

1109
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,900
Oh, squeal, Dave!

1110
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:54,720
Squeal!

1111
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,320
You ever see that movie, Mike?

1112
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,040
That one where the rednecks...

1113
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,120
What?

1114
00:44:59,140 --> 00:44:59,420
Right?

1115
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,060
The poor guy out in the woods.

1116
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,100
It was like, squeal like a pig.

1117
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:02,660
We could do that.

1118
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,120
We could put him into that.

1119
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,280
I hear that every week.

1120
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,400
Do it for the rednecks.

1121
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,480
We'll do it the other way.

1122
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,120
I hear that every week.

1123
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:16,260
I'm tired of being sodomized and being confused by these weird Archon figures who aren't real.

1124
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,540
If they're not real, then I'm hallucinating this, right?

1125
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,000
Then this is all sinners around me.

1126
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,500
I am one with myself.

1127
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,660
I remember I must have taken a drug.

1128
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,140
I have taken a drug.

1129
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,060
I have taken a drug.

1130
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,480
And I'm not...

1131
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,460
Oh, and you out listening?

1132
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,540
They're not going away.

1133
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:40,140
It's not like we're mentally tuned in to you and know that you did, too.

1134
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,020
Don't worry.

1135
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,260
That's not happening.

1136
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,560
I pushed my hand through the window.

1137
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:43,760
Oh, yes.

1138
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,240
We can see.

1139
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,220
Three of them did.

1140
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,640
They won't go away.

1141
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,480
Through the microphone.

1142
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,460
Three young men and that one young lady.

1143
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:49,700
Yeah.

1144
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,860
They're all sitting there going, how did they know we were going to do that tonight?

1145
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,100
Why are they doing this kind of show?

1146
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:56,880
Let me out of here!

1147
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,100
They must have known.

1148
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,060
Their parents are angry!

1149
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,620
They don't realize, like a child thinks, wow, there are people inside the television

1150
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,920
that we can communicate with.

1151
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,240
Yeah.

1152
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,880
We're inside the radio.

1153
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,580
They just don't realize.

1154
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,660
Oh, no, that's not...

1155
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,540
The people in the TV can see you, but they can't read your mind.

1156
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,100
We're on the radio, so it's like the other way around.

1157
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,260
It's the silent radio.

1158
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,600
We're broadcasting in your broadcasting.

1159
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:22,340
We've got...

1160
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:22,760
Go away!

1161
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,220
You can turn the pig back into Sister Mary.

1162
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,840
Oh, Dave, what a big shaft you have.

1163
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,480
He's good at getting them ticks, ain't he?

1164
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,620
He's got a real eye for them ticks.

1165
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,520
And that's even though we didn't give him the best gun.

1166
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,060
Oh, yeah, he's got a hell of a callus now, don't he?

1167
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,340
Oh, but you guys have a good gun.

1168
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,540
I didn't know I was supposed to get so many calluses on this deal.

1169
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:53,540
So far, I have calluses on my feet and on my hands, and now I have one on my protuberance.

1170
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,880
And I don't understand exactly what the...

1171
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,060
You're going to need it when you start having to club the ticks to death, man.

1172
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,740
When you run out of ammo...

1173
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,460
What does he think he's going to club them with, anyway?

1174
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,720
Well, that's what the callus on that thing is for.

1175
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,760
I thought it was for the love-pain-death thing, whatever you were saying.

1176
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,440
Oh, yes, yes, the sex hurt.

1177
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,200
The sex hurt.

1178
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:11,580
Love-pain-death.

1179
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,080
Yeah, that's what I thought it would be for.

1180
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,700
I'm not just going to walk around with this stubber on my bodice like it was growed there for no apparent reason.

1181
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,520
Love-pain-death.

1182
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,100
Love-pain-death.

1183
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,600
I like the dichotomous sound of that.

1184
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,640
Love-pain-death.

1185
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:24,640
Love-pain-death.

1186
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,060
I don't like any of this.

1187
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,980
This makes me feel nauseous.

1188
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:29,500
I'm confused.

1189
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,400
I don't even know what I'm doing.

1190
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,860
Would you like a drink, Dave?

1191
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,300
We've got some beer wine gas.

1192
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:34,700
I could go for some more meat.

1193
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,860
Is there a meat market in this theme park?

1194
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,880
Where can I go shopping?

1195
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,400
Everything in this theme park.

1196
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,340
Oh, I just love all those rows and rows of hot, juicy sausages.

1197
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,700
Could I get some food in here, too?

1198
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:46,700
Huge, giant bologna.

1199
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,340
Food land.

1200
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:48,420
That's it.

1201
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,520
He'd love food land.

1202
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:49,720
Whoa.

1203
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:50,300
Oh, food land.

1204
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,300
Can I get some veal?

1205
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,940
Somebody's talking about veal picada.

1206
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,020
And now he's got the pigs to deal with.

1207
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:56,460
Yoo-hoo.

1208
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,940
And the hologram of you.

1209
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,680
So, why not?

1210
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,300
Food land.

1211
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,680
Hey, Dave, you want to go to food land?

1212
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,180
Hungry?

1213
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,920
I thought you'd never ask.

1214
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,740
I've been banging on the window here.

1215
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:07,580
Yeah.

1216
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:09,700
Right.

1217
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,560
All we need to do is...

1218
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,100
That's the butcher over there.

1219
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,060
Go see that butcher.

1220
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:13,500
He'll prepare...

1221
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,320
One of the weird guys dressed up like cocktail onions with, like, the flute feet and stuff.

1222
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,400
One of these...

1223
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:18,800
Those were...

1224
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,680
They were gluttons in their other life.

1225
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,520
Oh, just look at all those men packing that meat into those tight little containers.

1226
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,140
It's a sin, Dave.

1227
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:28,860
Oh.

1228
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,840
Oh, it's kind of lewd.

1229
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:31,180
Oh.

1230
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,760
And the way they split that squid.

1231
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:34,720
Oof.

1232
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:45,680
Did you not in life eat seven more Slim Jims than you were bequeathed in the word of dogs according to Prescriptures 914?

1233
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,920
Who is this?

1234
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,360
The patties and the steaks and the cattle.

1235
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,580
Recording angels, play the tape.

1236
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,320
How are you?

1237
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,800
Now, Dave, you ain't supposed to eat more than them seven...

1238
00:48:59,060 --> 00:48:59,860
Slim Jims.

1239
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,020
I told you you could have seven Slim Jims.

1240
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:02,600
That was all.

1241
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,360
Oh, I don't give a damn.

1242
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,620
I had 12 birds.

1243
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,380
I can eat as many Slim Jims as I want.

1244
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:19,580
You so, you lonesome cowboy Dave, claimed that your rules were greater than the rules of Bob and took the extra Slim Jim.

1245
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,960
And so, for this sin...

1246
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,740
Sister Mary, does his name appear in the Book of Humans?

1247
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,640
So, I drank brackish water.

1248
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,580
I don't know, Ivan Stang.

1249
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,800
I don't know.

1250
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,640
There is yet more testing to be done.

1251
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,840
More probing.

1252
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,800
More inspecting.

1253
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,280
More, more...

1254
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:39,660
Meatpacking?

1255
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,780
You lonesome cowboy Dave.

1256
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,620
I just want more.

1257
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,400
Because...

1258
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:43,940
I want more.

1259
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,660
Please, let me back in the box with him.

1260
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,540
Let me back in the box with him, Ivan Stang.

1261
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,100
Because you have proved to be so attractive to Sister Mary Square.

1262
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,200
You are given a second chance.

1263
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,300
I need lonesome cowboy Dave.

1264
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:55,700
Yes.

1265
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,900
You will be allowed to prove, reprove...

1266
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:58,900


1267
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,000
Don't put that woman back in here with me.

1268
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:01,600
She's crazy.

1269
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,800
Oh, who, Dave?

1270
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:08,080
You do not have to go to the void of eternal naked beautiful girls.

1271
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:13,780
But will be allowed to stay here in theme world to go through the rides...

1272
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,240
Crikey.

1273
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:14,900
Crikey.

1274
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,740
...again and again and again...

1275
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,300
...over and over and over.

1276
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,360
Throw the other sinners into the lake of naked women.

1277
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,780
The male sinners and lesbian sinners.

1278
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:28,480
And women...

1279
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,040
Well...

1280
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:29,840
And vi...

1281
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:35,260
Throw the female sinners into the lake of naked men and...

1282
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,680
...whoa, men.

1283
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:40,960
And also the gay male sinners into that self-same eternal squirted lake.

1284
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,780
For anybody, really.

1285
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,020
Just throw them all in.

1286
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,680
We'll make a big salad full of meat.

1287
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,340
We'll add some meat.

1288
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:45,980
We'll add some turkey.

1289
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,060
We'll have lots of fun.

1290
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,560
But put Dave back on the pig ride.

1291
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:49,840
That's right.

1292
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:50,900
Put him on the pig ride.

1293
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,920
Turn him over on the street.

1294
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,860
He did not like food, lad.

1295
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,140
Light a fire under his pubic.

1296
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,860
Where are some more oinking sounds?

1297
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,900
Let's send him to boredom, lad.

1298
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,120
Land.

1299
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,160
Oh, let's not send him to boredom, lad.

1300
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,300
That would be too easy.

1301
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,680
No, but yeah, it would be too easy because I'm queuing on the wrong pa...

1302
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,060
I'm turning you on a par...

1303
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:09,880
...participle.

1304
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,220
I'm going back now and I...

1305
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,080
Shall we let him choose his own path?

1306
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,160
Perhaps he will find his way to escape land.

1307
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,080
Though none have ever done it before.

1308
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,200
That's true.

1309
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,200
They thought they did.

1310
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,840
None have ever escaped from escape land.

1311
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,160
It's like a place where you get tickets in and you can get out of here and stuff?

1312
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,920
Are those...

1313
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,000
There are legends.

1314
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:41,060
There are legends of those whose strength was so great they were able to arm-wrestle Bob at the gates and to pass beyond into the next zone.

1315
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,580
Into the harmonious fish.

1316
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,940
Louie, the guy with the bird legs, he did it.

1317
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,380
He told me about it.

1318
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,800
I know somebody who did that, who wrestled Bob.

1319
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,800
And he got past the gates of Panoply or Pangloss or whatever his name is.

1320
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,040
His name was Louie.

1321
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,060
Louie the bird leg, they called him.

1322
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:57,420
Oh, yeah.

1323
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,600
I thought it was Louie.

1324
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,500
The robots are already pre-programmed to tell him everybody's...

1325
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:01,920
I'm sorry.

1326
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:02,980
Oh, that's...

1327
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,500
I was in a lot of trouble.

1328
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,220
Were we saying anything?

1329
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,000
I was saying...

1330
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,560
Dave, what you just said carries more weight in this land than any other.

1331
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,580
But it won't do you any good yet.

1332
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:17,640
You'll have to say you're sorry in many, many, many ways.

1333
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,880
Ways even we have not dreamed of yet.

1334
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,440
For you may be the first, Dave, to depart from the script, yes?

1335
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,780
If you can just find a way to...

1336
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,320
To change the script, you could get out of here.

1337
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,400
It's like saying...

1338
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,340
The answer is right in front of you, man.

1339
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,040
It's been hanging right in front of you this whole time.

1340
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,900
Log on and off correctly.

1341
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,180
Every minute must be counted for.

1342
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,800
He's trying to pass the word.

1343
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,260
Example.

1344
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,560
Past cracking.

1345
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,500
Yes, if you can find the password...

1346
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:50,560
The via password is five minutes ob clonko before the law.

1347
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:51,300
He did it!

1348
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,860
I can't believe it.

1349
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:53,680
He was just guessing.

1350
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,520
The 100th monkey exploded right in the Daily Face.

1351
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,380
It's a frozen world.

1352
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,300
Dave, you can leave.

1353
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,320
You're king.

1354
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,680
You have the choice.

1355
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:08,380
You can either be god of this realm or you may leave and go back to your previous glorious

1356
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:11,680
existence as an unknown radio comic.

1357
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,320
Can I take another, like a different one other than those two?

1358
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,320
He just lost.

1359
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,140
He just lost.

1360
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:18,700
He could have.

1361
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,920
He had it right there.

1362
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:20,560
He had it.

1363
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,400
They always do.

1364
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,160
They always do.

1365
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,960
I'll be turning it up to ten now.

1366
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,000
Up.

1367
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,000


1368
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:26,260
Yeah.

1369
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,860
I want to go home now.

1370
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,540
It's sad, but it's amusing to me.

1371
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:37,120
I would like to really relieve myself first and then like remove, you know, expunge some

1372
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,760
of these like weird garments you guys got me dressed up in.

1373
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,520
Forgot about the bathroom.

1374
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,340
Take some of the feathers off my hat.

1375
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:42,500
Go ahead and go.

1376
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:43,520
I look silly as hell.

1377
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:43,680
Go on!

1378
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,400
Go on bathroom break.

1379
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,940
Go on to the bathroom, Dave.

1380
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,200
Go right ahead to the bathroom.

1381
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,360
You'll love the bathrooms in Seamwork.

1382
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:52,000
Just don't hook your thing up to that thing.

1383
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,980
I don't have anything on my thing to wish upon.

1384
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:54,980


1385
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,800
with which to hook it.

1386
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,040
I don't understand what you're talking about.

1387
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:58,960
Oh, how he looked recently.

1388
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,500
That's changed too.

1389
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,200
Remember when we changed Monica

1390
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,040
into Psychopath Finder?

1391
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,520
Oh, he doesn't remember.

1392
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,740
He thinks that really is Psychopath Finder.

1393
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,520
Oh, he's checking.

1394
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,480
Oh my God.

1395
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,600
Did you see what I had to be in that cube with?

1396
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,080
Do you see what I had to look at in that cube with?

1397
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,600
I tried to like it.

1398
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:20,940
I tried.

1399
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,880
I can't keep up.

1400
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,960
Thank you, Mike.

1401
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,840
What's the matter, you guys?

1402
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,480
Nothing happened.

1403
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,220
Maybe we should send him out.

1404
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:34,960
Maybe we don't even want him here.

1405
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,040
I looked down there.

1406
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,580
There's absolutely nothing down there at all.

1407
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:38,900
I did my best piggy voice.

1408
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,280
I just couldn't keep up the schlick.

1409
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,920
I've never seen anything like that.

1410
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,140
In fact, I didn't see anything there at all.

1411
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:50,380
I can't be in made-up pork butter

1412
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:51,840
for someone else's amusement park.

1413
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,460
And then once it's inside...

1414
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:55,720
That is creepy.

1415
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,120
It vibrates.

1416
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:57,900
What does?

1417
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,840
Yes, my friends.

1418
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,780
No, I'm not going to get it.

1419
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,740
And I'm afraid you're going to have to keep playing the game

1420
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:16,920
forever and ever and ever.

1421
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:21,260
Oh, that was Lonesome Cowboy Dave in hell

1422
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,860
with his S.O.B.

1423
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:25,660
Scorch, Sister Mary Squared, Au Contrere,

1424
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,960
and your host and prayer partner,

1425
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,280
Reverend Ivan Stang and friends.

1426
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,840
And now is when I have to give you

1427
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,860
the post office box number for Bob.

1428
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,560
That's right, Bob.

1429
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,900
You got that pencil ready?

1430
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,380

4.

1437
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,160
Now, just in case you didn't get that right,

1438
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,660

And you'd be surprised

1447
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,700
what you would get back in the mail

1448
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,860
if you express even the slightest bit of information.

1449
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,840
Of course, you may...

1450
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,740
want to avoid just that.

1451
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,020
Uh, yes.

1452
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:20,340

00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:12,440
Good night.

1461
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:12,980
Good night.

Good night...

1464
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:22,840
It's a'Ã©s about the birth of God...

1465
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,480
Maybe just another rap

1466
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,480
But you're running out of sap

1467
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,000
Yes, you're running out of sap

1468
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,680
Well, you better take a rap

1469
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,560
Dying under daddy's cap

1470
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,240
Dying under daddy's cap

1471
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,140
Shrivel up

1472
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,920
It's at the top of the list

1473
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,840
That you can't get pissed

1474
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,420
No, you can't get pissed

1475
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,960
It's rule number one

1476
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,880
Living right isn't fun

1477
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,340
Living right isn't fun

1478
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,000
Cause it's a God-given fact

1479
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
That you can't go back

1480
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,520
No, you can't go back

1481
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,020
It's a God-given lie

1482
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,060
That you're gonna lose your mind

1483
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,520
Yes, you're gonna lose your mind

1484
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,000
Time-tested and true

1485
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,340
You gotta put it on, put it on

1486
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,680
Gotta put it on, put it on

1487
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,260
Well, it's a God-given lie

1488
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:27,100
That you're gonna get small

1489
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,660
Yes, you're gonna get small

1490
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,120
Maybe just another rap

1491
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,240
But you're running out of sap

1492
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,740
Yes, you're running out of sap

1493
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,380
Well, you better take a rap

1494
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:38,980
Dying under daddy's cap

1495
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,120
Dying under daddy's cap

1496
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,580
Now, oh, shrivel up

1497
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:04,880
Shrivel up, people

1498
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:16,300
Now, shrivel up, people

1499
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:16,300


1500
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:17,680
Shrivel up, people

1501
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:25,780
I'm saidÐ°Ð»ÑŒ

1502
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,560
I can't believe it

1503
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,460
This is the holiest time of the year

1504
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:30,640
on the Christian calendar

1505
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,020
and I just can't believe it

1506
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,080
What do you have to say for yourself?

1507
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,440
It better be a silver board

1508
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,100
What do you have to say for yourself?

1509
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,220
Doctor, do you have any idea

1510
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:38,980
how much your family's

1511
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,380
phone company spends each year just on puzzling evidence what do you have to say for yourself

1512
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:48,600
i've never really thought about that well i guess many people don't but those billions of miles

1513
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,800
what do you have to say all those exchanges why just the maintenance on our who are you

1514
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:59,160
and that's not even to mention our holding stock the cars and trucks the airplanes and satellites

1515
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,880
and then all those fine people who are actually on the payroll to take care of all that

1516
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,800
do you understand

1517
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,320
now to look at that hand

1518
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:20,840
let's take a closer look

1519
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:25,620
you

1520
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:37,040
and a possessed hand brings fatal results

1521
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:41,180
what can i do for you what do you want

1522
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,380
either you cut my hand off or i'll kill you

1523
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:52,220
no straps no gas just cut

1524
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,540
thanks to the science of microelectronics

1525
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:59,420
you are looking at a complete telephonic receiver and transmitter
