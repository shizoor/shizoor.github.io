00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Good evening fellow necro-mediacs. I'm glad so many of you could come.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,860
I'm Harvey Mews, ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,020
And could you see our colleague here?

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,820
He's a real creep.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,620
I want to give you a friend of mine.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,740
I'm sorry, good friend of mine.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,600
I think you know who I am, but I don't know.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,480
I don't know who I am.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,520
What was your name, sir?

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:55,880
I don't know who I am.

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:09,680
I don't know who I am.

12
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,320
I don't know who I am.

13
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,840
A desired outcome of the aircraft motion.

14
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,520
Do you fucking understand me, you fucking piece of shit?

15
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,060
I don't know who I am.

16
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,120
I don't know who I am.

17
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,160
I don't know who I am.

18
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,200
I don't know who I am.

19
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,180
But let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this

20
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,220
brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.

21
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,280
Ah yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

22
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,900
Hey, you know those policemen on motorcycles won't let me preach on car hoods downtown

23
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,240
because they think I'm a crazy man or a drunk man.

24
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,120
And there's no reason to arrest me, yet they would, because I'm free, free, free enough

25
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,320
to rant to myself in public because I come against death, taxes, work, and premature

26
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,440
immaculation.

27
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:09,360
For Bob, your mind, friend, your mind has to be certified okay by them, them, them,

28
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,240
and oh we hate them, they and their tools of iniquity.

29
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,780
Not the tools of the preacher, not the tongue nor the other parts, nay, but tools of false

30
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,900
slack dangled forever in front of you like that raise right around the corner or like

31
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,640
that rat.

32
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,060
Swimming in poison cheese.

33
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,420
Let there be slack.

34
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,940
I'm going to Godstown, Godstown, here I come.

35
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,960
I'm going to Godstown, Godstown, here I come.

36
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,400
They got some crazy little Godsheds staring up and gonna get me and I'm gonna get my ass

37
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,400


38
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,320
in the back of their car, I'm gonna get my ass in the back of their car.

39
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,320


40
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,320


41
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,060
Why did you let your daughter dream of going on this mad moon journey?

42
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,980
Because I love her and I wanted to live to the best effect.

43
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,640
Dragging out life to the last possible second is not living to the best effect.

44
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,720
The best of life, passwordly, lies nearest to the edge of death.

45
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,840
Our fathers and our fathers' fathers cleaned up the old order of things because it killed

46
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:37,120
death because it tormented people in vain because it outraced human pride and dignity because it was

47
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,580
an ugly spectacle of waste but that was only a beginning there's nothing wrong in suffering

48
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:52,800
if you suffer for a purpose our revolution didn't abolish danger or death it simply made danger and

49
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,260
death worthwhile we must hold this crowd back at any cost for a time until the gas of peace is

50
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,020
ready i seem to done toilet on your floor

51
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,540
right right right

52
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,800
right

53
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,900
you'll wonder where your teeth went when you brush your teeth with

54
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:53,840
and i think uh i disagree with chairman bob uh i do agree with the chairman bob

55
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,240
the chairman bob can't be working

56
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:09,220
i recall that chairman bob went that route right right i think the thing things are the thing uh

57
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,400
uh

58
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:18,760
and i think i'm some and i think in essence the chairman bob can't be working while they're type

59
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,680
alive to investors

60
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,620
uh we've uh uh uh viewed and so forth but uh

61
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,460
how to close down the law.

62
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,880
But now, one final question, if I could.

63
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,340
Anybody on the panel who'd want to address Chairman Bob?

64
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,640
No.

65
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,800
No.

66
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,120
Okay.

67
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,040
When you're alone and life is making you lonely,

68
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,560
you can always go down.

69
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,280
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry

70
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,460
seems to help go down.

71
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,160
So go down.

72
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,860
Maybe you know some little places to go down.

73
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,620
Forget all your cares, so go down, down, down.

74
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,500
So maybe I'll see you there.

75
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,040
We can go down, down, down.

76
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,400
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

77
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,060
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

78
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,300
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

79
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,160
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

80
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,200
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

81
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,580
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

82
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,600
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

83
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,100
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

84
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,700
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

85
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,880
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

86
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,680
Ah, yes, dear friends,

87
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,540
some wonderful edits and credits

88
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,840
by the great Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

89
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,320
Except for the very last one,

90
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,600
which was from Dr. Mr. Sister

91
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,020
here in Cleveland.

92
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,860
Yes, aside from that, all the rest

93
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,740
was by the great Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

94
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,740
All those cut-ups, anyway.

95
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,120
Our title tune, The Hour of Slack,

96
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,520
is by El Queso All-Stars.

97
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,780
And the very opening was by Heart Ignition.

98
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,560
More from him.

99
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,320
But first, this fantabulous rant

100
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,760
by the old-time Dr. Dr. Dinosaur.

101
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,400
What kind of savior do you want?

102
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,240
You want something exciting in a deified being?

103
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,100
Or do you want a completely predetermined cosmology

104
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,620
with static and stable and sedentary

105
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:21,820
gods and demons?

106
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,020
Or do you want a whole bunch of gods

107
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,620
hanging off of it like apples

108
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,280
still stuck on a tree in January?

109
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,560
Are you looking to get carried away

110
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,820
on that sweet chariot?

111
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,920
Or are you afraid that there won't be

112
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,360
any difference between it and the boxcars

113
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,840
that will unload at the gates

114
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,480
of the eternal concentration camp?

115
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,940
Will you settle for a holy order

116
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,880
that's all order?

117
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,580
Or are you hankering for a chance

118
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,920
to put in a few licks yourself

119
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,140
in the timeless struggle between good and evil?

120
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,660
Unless you're ready to let your soul,

121
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,460
your soul, roll over and die before it's even

122
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,820
had a chance to prove itself on the field of holy battle,

123
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,700
it seems to me that you might want to think

124
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,940
about making a choice.

125
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,080
Are you going to throw in with the likes of Satan

126
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,240
when you know, you know from the book

127
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,840
that he loses in the end?

128
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,320
We may pull the wool over our own eyes,

129
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,500
but that doesn't mean we're stupid.

130
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,460
We may go in for the underdog, but we don't place

131
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,640
no bets after the cards have been shown.

132
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,800
And even though he wins just before the credits roll,

133
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,100
credits with only his name on them, by the way,

134
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,980
are you going to sign up for the Yahweh team

135
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,920
when you know the outcome?

136
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,260
Hell, everybody likes to win,

137
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,760
but only after they get to play the game.

138
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,540
You can turn a buck betting on a sure thing,

139
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,120
but where's the slack in that?

140
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,440
Now we got the fightin' Jesus, but we got the fightin' Jesus.

141
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:51,440


142
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,580
That hardcore three-nailed money changer-ass

143
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,940
kickin' Aramaic rowdy, and that's fun for a while.

144
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,100
But he ends up selling your account to Yahweh,

145
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,780
and you still get shortchanged on the action

146
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,520
and thrills you crave in a belief system.

147
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,300
Well, kids, I think you know what the answer is.

148
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,640
The answer is the ever-widening smoke ring

149
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,640
around J.R. Bob Dobbs.

150
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,820
Yes, only Dobbs, among all the modern mythological

151
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:21,420
people in the world, is the one who's going to win.

152
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:21,620
And the guy who's going to win is the one who's going to die.

153
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:21,620


154
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,920
strong, magical madmen represents the uncertainty,

155
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,940
the dramatic tension, the screaming scary monster

156
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,960
movie mayhem that keeps your heart a-thumpin'

157
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,740
and your blood a-pumpin' while you sit on the edge

158
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,100
of your pew waitin' to find out how this movie turns out.

159
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,320
Where do the big spenders, the high rollers,

160
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,440
make their fortunes?

161
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,580
Do they toss their bankrolls into long-term IRAs

162
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,500
and deposit certificates and play it safe?

163
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,840
Hell no!

164
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,260
they dare to risk it and play the market and that's the kind of Savior Bob is

165
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,680
children Bob is the Wall Street Savior we may know the saucers are coming but

166
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,140
we don't know what the outcome will be we know Bob can cut deals with human

167
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:13,080
governments and overlords and Illuminati and rake in the cash from that but we

168
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,040
don't know yet whether he'll be able to close the deal that will keep the exes

169
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,000
from just plowing us all under as a bad crop we don't know if we'll ride the

170
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,100
saucers as exalted examples of Yeti evolution or as fertilizer for some

171
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:35,940
planet where they intend to try again if you want true adventure in your eternal

172
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:42,020
future if you want a little havoc with your heaven if you can stand a little

173
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,940
mystification in your destiny and there's only one personal

174
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:54,200
Savior that will satisfy your soul's fighting spirit and that is JR Bob Dobbs

175
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:01,940
dr. dinosaur dear friends in a classic old-timey racket now

176
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,660
rift

177
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,920
I

178
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:41,680
I peaked in the Devils secret hell files and found a list with names a mile long

179
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,920
and saw you and you and you and you and even you and me and the whole thing

180
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,420
You! Let me close my eyes!

181
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,960
Please don't make me watch Satan masturbate!

182
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,340
He's a hungry clown and I don't want to see all his dirty deeds!

183
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,900
Oh, why God, oh, why did those assholes at the employment agency

184
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,000
give me this job cleaning up this office?

185
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,700
Oh, why, somebody tell me already!

186
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,700
Was this the best they could do on such short notice?

187
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,600
Am I being punished for overeating and using too many cuss words?

188
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:32,180
Or is it for sounding too much like some pale, cheap imitation of Captain Beatheart?

189
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,520
Or am I too much like Frank Zappa?

190
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,960
Am I being punished for not cutting enough people off on the freeway?

191
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,980
Or for answering my phone messages?

192
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,180
Oh, why, God, oh, why did those assholes at the employment agency

193
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,200
put me here where I don't belong?

194
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,860
When they could have gotten me a job telling the hot dogs

195
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,580
instead of idiots at Disneyland?

196
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,840
Were they afraid I'd put the old laser by erection?

197
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,140
Did they have suspected that I'm a urinate through the cosmos

198
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,640
at the top of Space Mountain?

199
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:13,880
Oh, why, somebody tell me already!

200
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,480
Oh, why, God, oh, why did those assholes at the employment agency

201
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,320
inform me early about the hatred call?

202
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,800
I would have worn my fat man's pajamas

203
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,860
with the air conditioning back in the year.

204
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:34,400
I would have worn my fat man's pajamas with the air conditioning back in the year.

205
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,080
You dress your suits.

206
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,780
What are you doing here?

207
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,760
Who is that?

208
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,760
Who's there?

209
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:54,760


210
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,060
It is I, Zooks Rift.

211
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,500
It is I!

212
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,760
Get a fucking job!

213
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,520
It's you!

214
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,560
It's you!

215
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,980
How the fuck?

216
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,220
Wait a minute.

217
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,240
This can't be what...

218
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,300
You're dead!

219
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,240
Be cool, dude.

220
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,580
That's right.

221
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,940
I'm dead.

222
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,520
I'm dead because you killed me, Zooks Rift.

223
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,080
Because you and your slug musician friends

224
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,740
beat me up and killed me.

225
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,460
You're dead because you killed me.

226
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,760
Oh, man.

227
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,540
Don't I have enough problems?

228
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,400
What is it you want, oh great spirit?

229
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,720
You want to complain to me that you're in hell, I suppose.

230
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,820
That you're dead and have gone straight to fucking hell

231
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,440
for driving like a fucking idiot on the freeway,

232
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,080
giving me the wrong change of jack-in-the-box,

233
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,320
playing that heavy metal shit on your stereo at 3.30 in the morning

234
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,540
when we're all trying to sleep?

235
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,000
Ah!

236
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,420
Ha ha ha ha ha!

237
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,060
Ah ha ha ha ha!

238
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,480
Ah ha ha ha ha!

239
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,520
No, Zooks Rift!

240
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,400
No!

241
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,520
Ha ha ha ha ha!

242
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,020
Sending me junk mail, trying to entice me into wasting my money

243
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,440
on boring, inane magazines,

244
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,620
charging me over a thousand dollars at the Chevron station

245
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,620
for preventive maintenance while all the while

246
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,380
deliberately destroying my car...

247
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:11,560
Ah!

248
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,180
Ha ha ha ha ha!

249
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,560
No way, dude!

250
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,940
Ah ha ha ha ha!

251
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,280
For going through life talking like a blabbering, snobbering idiot,

252
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,460
driving your van to the beach during spring,

253
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,760
bring break with a sign painted on the side that says,

254
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,720
Show us your teeth!

255
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,440
No!

256
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,800
I said, no!

257
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,560
Zooks Rift, they didn't even hold it against me

258
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,340
for being a booker in several Los Angeles rock clubs,

259
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,600
or for getting all the pussy while guys like John Truby

260
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,840
were stuck with their shit jobs at the hardware stores.

261
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,000
Well then, what are you talking about there?

262
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,560
I'm in heaven, Zooks Rift!

263
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,400
That's right, you killed me, and I went to heaven,

264
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,880
glorious, beautiful heaven!

265
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:12,560
But you, Zooks Rift, it's you that are in hell!

266
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,960
Ha ha ha ha ha!

267
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,380
Ha ha ha ha ha!

268
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,160
Ha ha ha ha ha!

269
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,560
You fucked up!

270
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,300
Ha ha ha ha!

271
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,500
Ha ha ha ha ha!

272
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,100
Ha ha ha ha ha!

273
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,100


274
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,100


275
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,520
Ha ha ha ha!

276
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,200
No!

277
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,460
No!

278
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:32,760
No!

279
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,380
Yes!

280
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:34,800
Yes!

281
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,200
You're in hell, and now you'll burn out!

282
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,200
No!

283
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,400
No!

284
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,000
No!

285
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,620
No!

286
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,060
No!

287
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,720
No!

288
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,080
No!

289
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,100
We'll teach you to send back those readers,

290
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,160
digest sweepstakes and trees,

291
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,440
in a no!

292
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,720
Zooks Rift.

293
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,040
Ah, yes.

294
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,860
Ah, friends, and let's change the tone now

295
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,400
and go back to WCSB Cleveland's Thursday night show,

296
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,340
ESO Swamp Radio,

297
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,660
with Professor Chaz Smith,

298
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,980
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

299
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,620
and us.

300
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,080
Me and we!

301
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,220
Me and we!

302
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,620
Mommy, Daddy.

303
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,380
And another sound.

304
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,500
And the attic lock melted.

305
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,280
Mink.

306
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,740
Mink with bright little eyes and tousled hair

307
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,060
peered inside.

308
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,320
And behind her,

309
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,380
tall, wavering eyes.

310
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,240
Frightful.

311
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,100
Darling.

312
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,680
Thanks andHeeky signed this.

313
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,500
To the gallery.

314
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:43,500


315
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,420
reporters 110 times gave the tower the coldest

316
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:44,420


317
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,220
Fang here you are.

318
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:47,820
Let me show my good things

319
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:47,820


320
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:47,840
And my name is Dave,

321
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,320
Raven heads and their one good eye pointed firmly above their master eyes.

322
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,860
They charged forwards.

323
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,920
Some were bleeding on their feet.

324
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,440
Some were bleeding at the ears from the ranting and raving they had been forced to hear.

325
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:09,080
Some's navels were smiling, that austere yet abstruse smile.

326
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,060
Reserved for the few who knew their fate.

327
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,900
My ears are bleeding!

328
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,980
And they just keep trudging.

329
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,040
Looks real good from that shot up in the hills there.

330
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,880
Is that a dolly shot or is that a... what is that?

331
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,080
Just turn around.

332
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,140
Hey man, you're not supposed to show your watches.

333
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,840
It's 1392. People don't wear watches in 1392.

334
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,380
The time is 13-0-13.

335
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,300
Do you know where your smell dawned twice?

336
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,060
It's time.

337
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,080
Can you feel more premium?

338
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,080
It's time.

339
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:54,260
Are your breasts as ripe as the milkmaids dancing through the forest glen?

340
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:02,420
Are you enslaved to time, handcuffed by your wristwatch?

341
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,740
Is your lust for material things insatiable?

342
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:10,820
Do you have a streebly long, funny-looking forefinger?

343
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,680
I'm gonna blow their loads in the last minute before the CD is formatted.

344
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,220
I'm alone!

345
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,660
Two minutes takes forever when you're waiting for it.

346
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,200
I blew it!

347
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,000
I blew it!

348
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,740
My skin.

349
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,640
I once had the skin of a smiling little simian boy like you.

350
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,420
Yes, grand.

351
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,840
I like that new skin you're wearing tonight.

352
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,820
Oh, it is very, very good.

353
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:47,820


354
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,320
Very, very luxurious to be wearing it.

355
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,480
What is that, like about 55-year-old female?

356
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,240
Yes, yes, a kangaroo is the bottom part, and the top part is a female.

357
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,900
Younger than he is.

358
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,820
A Corinthian kangaroo.

359
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,500
It's only a 55-year-old female skin you've got on?

360
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,120
This is very supple still. Feel it.

361
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,580
Touch it. Put your hand.

362
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,220
No wonder you look so young. Ooh, you feel young, too, Dave.

363
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,720
Very supple. She was. She was a beautiful dancer.

364
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,020
She died from an ergot overdose.

365
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:22,140
We transported her to the Middle Ages to enlighten her somehow,

366
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,220
and yet she became involved in the celebrations when she came back.

367
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,400
Where did you download that skin app, mate?

368
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,120
Arr, arr, arrr, arrr.

369
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,900
Arr, arr, arrr, arrr.

370
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Arr, arr, arrr, arrr.

371
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,460
It's gm.com. Skins for all your fancy new internet programs.

372
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,580
Arr, arr, arrr, arrr.

373
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,100
Arr, arr, arrr, arrr.

374
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,720
Just as sure as sugar and sweet.

375
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,300
Just as sure as you walk on your feet.

376
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,820
Just as sure as we'll all be dead.

377
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,160
Something's gonna crumble in your head.

378
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,520
Poop dog will pee and pee dog will poop.

379
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,740
And out of my hose will come horrible goop.

380
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,400
One by one they shall die.

381
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,080
One by one.

382
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,740
Two by two.

383
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,260
Oh false smite.

384
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,400
Two by two.

385
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,120
He did sin.

386
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,980
Lake of fire.

387
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,300
For he used the name J.R.

388
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,080
Behold, the day of Bob is at hand, and he shall come like a salesman in the night.

389
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,200
Yes, he shall come.

390
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,180
Give up hope.

391
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,060
Come and come again.

392
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,080
Bob's no crutch.

393
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,080
Here comes Negi.

394
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,060
Here comes Butch.

395
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,760
Dressed as Bulgarian woman, and look at the fascinating necklace they are wearing.

396
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,320
Oh, there is the flute player.

397
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,560
Sonia, how did you get your...

398
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,300
Sonia, could you step closer to the microphone?

399
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,780
What is the name of the flute you are playing in the Bulgarian Woman Orchestra?

400
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,880
It's called the Jelet Kakakata.

401
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,840
The Jelet Kakakata.

402
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,580
And it looks like you can also shave your legs or any other hairy part of your body.

403
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,020
You're absolutely right.

404
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,880
Yes, it's a very rare instrument.

405
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:14,120
I notice very many of the female singers have very, very hairy moustache, which must be

406
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,780
taken care of on regular basis.

407
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,640
Yes, isn't that a nice coincidence?

408
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,820
So you can whistle through your nose and rip off your flesh in one fell swoop.

409
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,740
I'm glad to be talking about the different orifices of whistling because, you know, that

410
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,380
can get kind of personal.

411
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,960
That's why the girl did the high notes so easy, because she had been shaving her fuzzy

412
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,420
.

413
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,140
Oh, if only I could reach the high minutes.

414
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,580
Of time.

415
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,880
The high hours.

416
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,000
The high days.

417
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,220
The high weeks.

418
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,100
The peaks of time.

419
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:49,140
Why cannot we skip from the peaks of one time to another?

420
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,000
Are there fifths?

421
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,800
Skip over the boring parts.

422
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,880
And the weeks of a day of a week.

423
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,480
Or the painful parts.

424
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,120
Actives indeed.

425
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,960
Monday we will call C.

426
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,360
Time is a waveform, is it not?

427
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,260
The Monday after we will call C.

428
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,260
Can we not skip across the tops of the waves?

429
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,300
Can we not?

430
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,220
By passing the long trip down?

431
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,380
Like luscious milkmaids on surfboards, can't we?

432
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,080
Now what about the fact that in engineering, we have to do the same thing?

433
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,860
In engineering terminology, the element of stress is measured in moments.

434
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,820
Stress is measured in moments?

435
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,520
Stress is measured in moments, yes.

436
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,400
Slack, however, is measured in drummets and dobses.

437
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,540
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

438
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,220
Is time a particle or a wave?

439
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,760
I am familiar with that system.

440
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,480
Maybe time is a particle, not a wave at all.

441
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,740
If that's the case, dude, we are screwed.

442
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,920
Well, do you know how long it takes to...

443
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,980
We might as well just give up.

444
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,800
Can you track the path of an electron?

445
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,960
A proton or a neutron?

446
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,340
If you were to get into quantum physics...

447
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,520
Because that would mean for every atom there is in this universe, there's another universe.

448
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,400
There is.

449
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,060
That's quantum, baby.

450
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,060
There's another universe waiting.

451
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,200
It's the flip side.

452
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,080
It's the B side of every universe has a continuous flip.

453
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,640
Just as big as this one.

454
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,400
Just as valid.

455
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,280
Just as alive.

456
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,420
Oh, some are smaller, though, James.

457
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,280
Don't discount the entropy factor.

458
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,900
Some are much smaller.

459
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,160
Some have sharp teeth.

460
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,540
Hey, I saw an ad in the scene, in the back pages of it.

461
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,000
It said...

462
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,480
This didn't make sense to me.

463
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,540
Doesn't make sense.

464
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,740
Sex-starved escorts.

465
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,500
Looking for pale and elderly women.

466
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,540
This don't make no kind of sense at all.

467
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,900
If an escort is sex-starved, what does she look like?

468
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,520
Gravitas.

469
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,720
I mean, shouldn't an escort be, like, getting sex all the time?

470
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,960
Now, you know, Chaz, I've been reading entertainment weeklies for a long time,

471
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,740
and from what I've learned from those is that there are a lot of beautiful women

472
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,060
who are completely lonely.

473
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,700
I guess all the guys think that they're getting tons of dates, and no one ever calls them.

474
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,240
They're the ones who are waiting for your call right now.

475
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:51,760
That's right.

476
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,700
At 1-900-

477
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,240
Yes.

478
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,400
They're waiting.

479
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,740
At 888-669-2323.

480
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,860
And you can-

481
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:05,340
Actually, there is a beautiful, live, naked woman waiting for your call.

482
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,280
A free call at 888-669-2323.

483
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:16,580
But don't you remember, every time you call her, she hands the phone to a sweaty stevedore

484
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,520
named Bill, and the rest of the evening is pure hell.

485
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,900
You know, the funny thing is I just gave out the number of Jesus, and actually it's Mary

486
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,100
Magdalene is the beautiful, naked woman that we picked up the phone.

487
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:33,440
Well, we know that Our Lord and Mary Magdalene were fond of fuzzing the fur, as they used

488
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,300
to say in Judea in the old age, and I think you might interrupt them at a tragic moment,

489
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,340
if you call that number.

490
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,380
And what is that number again to call them at a tragic moment?

491
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,660
888-669-2323.

492
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,540
You know, they're going to be going, damn, that sang gave her number out over the radio,

493
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,940
and two people called up.

494
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,660
Call it any time.

495
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,300
Woke us up.

496
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,660
Call now.

497
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,040
Operators are waiting to hang up on you.

498
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,020
It's like four in the morning in Bulgaria, where they are, the new foundation headquarters.

499
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,320
Well, we just interviewed one of the whistling women of the Bulgarian chorus, and she actually

500
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,400
played a little Gillette shaver.

501
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,320
And she could shave her mustache to get the hot stuff out of her face.

502
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:09,320


503
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:09,320


504
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,040
And here's a type of her now.

505
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,320
Isn't that, now look at that incredible headdress she's wearing.

506
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,980
You know, it's amazing how Europeans sometimes resemble like tribal cultures, I've seen South

507
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,860
American stuff.

508
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,320
Thank you very much.

509
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:22,840
Thank you.

510
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,320
Are those real feathers, or are those someone else's under...

511
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,880
Well, they're a certain kind of a feather that is a part fur, and then the other part

512
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,400
is feather.

513
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,240
As I look now, I can see that these are actually bark-stained underpants that you have...

514
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,580
Under things.

515
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,300
Under things.

516
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,920
Under things crawling beneath the surface.

517
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,300
How in the world could you have ever seen my under?

518
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,700
My unders are under all of my skirts.

519
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,820
How in the...

520
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,600
Do you have x-rays vision?

521
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,160
Under things.

522
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,220
Under the mind.

523
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,320
Submental.

524
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,580
You look...

525
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,920
Sub genius, in fact.

526
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,940
So you love me tonight.

527
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,900
Sub temporal.

528
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:07,840
And what shall we do with old man time, who keeps dragging us along with his fitful pace?

529
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,280
Take the toilet plunger.

530
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,280


531
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,600
And plunge it in his eyes.

532
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,220
Where is time control?

533
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:16,520
How can we skip away from this poor boring now?

534
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,000
And leap, leap ahead.

535
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,440
Back or back?

536
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,300
Yes, back.

537
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:22,840
Why not?

538
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,360
Yes, it's the 99%, isn't it?

539
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,620
That one little tenth of a thousandth of a millionth of a percent that makes you less

540
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,140
than human.

541
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,620
Isn't that what it is?

542
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,560
And as you climb in the door, there you think you'll be saying goodbye to this earth.

543
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,400
But no, no.

544
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,380
You'll come back again.

545
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,440
You'll come back again.

546
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,280
And it's...

547
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,280


548
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,280


549
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,280


550
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,280


551
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,280


552
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,280


553
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,280


554
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,280


555
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,840
It's not enough to smash your watch.

556
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,280
It's not enough to buy every new clock that will be on the subgenius catalog soon.

557
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,020
No, just to prove your independence from time.

558
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,580
Your rebellion against God Time.

559
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,180
The evil time god.

560
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,340
You know, it's all for the time being, they say.

561
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,400
That cruel taskmaster in the sky.

562
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,260
With a capital T and a capital B.

563
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,440
With a long white beard.

564
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,400
The time being.

565
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,980
Made of time pieces.

566
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,200
Oh, I don't believe he had time.

567
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,920
The great tick.

568
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,420
The human being.

569
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,880
Time being?

570
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,400
The tick.

571
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,580
The great tick.

572
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,140
The time witch tick.

573
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,000
Arr!

574
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,920
The time being!

575
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,840
And we must...

576
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,800
We must bring down the time being!

577
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,580
The time ass pirate.

578
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,260
Ah, for him.

579
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,020
He is not a tick, a parasite.

580
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,360
His blood roots of seconds and precious minutes.

581
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,440
And the acid queen.

582
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:30,860
And the acid queen.

583
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:30,860


584
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,160
A parasite and an ass pirate.

585
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,880
Who is the acid queen now that, uh, uh, princes die?

586
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,180
Is it...

587
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,180


588
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,180


589
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,180


590
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,180


591
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,180


592
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,180


593
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,180


594
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,180


595
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,180


596
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,180


597
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,980
I thought it was Laura Bunchcake.

598
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,840
Did you hear that story?

599
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,680
Did you read about that?

600
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,260
About Laura?

601
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,060
The right hand man told these, uh...

602
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,100
A plutonian man?

603
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,620
We'll all be drinking.

604
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:56,180
Princess Di used to have, uh, men snuck in in the trunk of cars.

605
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,080
And she also used to go out in the middle of the night.

606
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,640
This is true.

607
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,820
She used to go out in the middle of the night and, you know, and drive around and give money

608
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,760
to hookers.

609
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,400
Really?

610
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,360
Yeah, to help them out.

611
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,060
Did they have different...

612
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,120
Tell me.

613
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,180
Did they have different...

614
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,180


615
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,180


616
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,180


617
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,180


618
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,180


619
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,180


620
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,180


621
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:09,180


622
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,640
Did they have different favors to perform for?

623
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,220
No, go home.

624
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:11,540
Just go home.

625
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,600
Go buy some shoes or something.

626
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,460
Go buy a coat.

627
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,520
You don't need this.

628
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,160
A true princess.

629
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,540
It was because they, they were competition.

630
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,140
I love this thing.

631
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,260
My judge sat a week on his corner for like nine hours.

632
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,920
She made a deal with the aliens.

633
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,500
Very, very cold.

634
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,800
And then she didn't pay it off.

635
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,200
She was a great person.

636
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,540
That's not what I mean.

637
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,920
But she didn't pay off her deal with the aliens and they came and got her.

638
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:35,200
She'd come by and maybe rip off a quid or two and I'd be back home with me honey in a very,

639
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,480
very short time.

640
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,300
Look, when you signed that paper with the acid queen...

641
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,000
I love that.

642
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,160
...she was a great person.

643
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,660
She was a great person.

644
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,740
You got to follow through.

645
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,300
...she was queenly.

646
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,260
In her own sick, demented way.

647
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,120
Go ahead man.

648
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,660
Bring it up.

649
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,420
Bring it all the way up.

650
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,140
Bring all of them up on all screens.

651
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:51,680
Go ahead.

652
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,420
I dare you to see what you're looking at.

653
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:53,920
Go ahead.

654
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,720
No, no, don't use that third eye.

655
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,600
Close that third eye.

656
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:56,780
Quick.

657
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,500
...chipsy acid queens.

658
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,080
I'm getting the hell out of here.

659
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,420
...all the masculinity of the...

660
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,100
Spaceman.

661
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,040
Oh, Spaceman.

662
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,200
Come rescue me.

663
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:07,700
Come rescue me.

664
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,040
...the whole world.

665
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,080
Come rescue me.

666
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,140


667
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,140


668
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,140


669
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,140


670
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,140


671
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,360
I'm not going to let you out.

672
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:09,360


673
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,140
...in the whole world.

674
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:15,380
...it's time to become a psychedelic hologram as we blast through the universe wearing no

675
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,380
clothes and funny little puddles of flowers.

676
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,260
Look at our faces we look like frogs.

677
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,300
Now.

678
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,800
Free, free, free again.

679
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,840
I'm surfing with the aliens.

680
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,760
I'm shedding my chromosomes, baby.

681
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,580
I'm getting out of this earthly humanly garb.

682
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,620
This only cost 30 bucks.

683
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,440
What a deal.

684
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:35,960
Ah, ah, ah.

685
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:35,960


686
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:35,960


687
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:35,960


688
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,480
...you want to see what I do.

689
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:38,480


690
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:38,720
...you want to see what I do.

691
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:38,720


692
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:38,720


693
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,500
What a ride, ladies and gentlemen, we're having here in the genealogy room.

694
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,360
As we all look out the open port holes and check on our charts and see where we came from and where we're going to.

695
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,820
I really don't want to know where that character came from.

696
00:33:54,820 --> 00:34:00,060
All right, some of you don't want to know the character, but you're going to have to drop your chromosomes in the other room.

697
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,820
All of time is just soaring so fast.

698
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,900
This room is...

699
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,660
Oh, backwards.

700
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:13,840
Real time, the ball and chain of the chronometer shall no longer anchor us to temporal reality.

701
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:20,460
Iron Man, no ass pirates and no blood sucking parasites like the time being.

702
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:26,320
Read us for $30. It's free for $30.

703
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,320
Hey Dave, do you remember the ass pirate song?

704
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,660
Yar har, yar har, yar har.

705
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,380
We've been sailing.

706
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,900
Oh, so far.

707
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,000
The acid pirates?

708
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm looking for some chunky rump to set me nose on fire.

709
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:47,300
We'll throw the clankers over and drag the bitch aboard.

710
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,440
We'll sniffer and we'll piffer and...

711
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:57,340
Old Peg Leg Dick, they called him Peg Dick Leg.

712
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,380
Do you remember Ruby the Dyke Queen?

713
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,500
You may mean the pervert pirate.

714
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:04,880
I'm a cat.

715
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,980
It's no bigger threat for them having admitted it than for them having admitted it and not

716
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,860
having admitted it.

717
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,920
But I would hope that in context of the recent admission in which they've admitted that they

718
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,200
admitted it, they've admitted it, but they did in fact admit it, it could be an important

719
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,540
lesson by something that's really not very useful.

720
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,640
I'm a cat.

721
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm a cat.

722
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,120
I'm a cat.

723
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:34,520
I'm a cat.

724
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:34,520


725
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:34,520


726
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:34,520


727
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:34,540
I'm a cat.

728
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:49,340
I'm a cat.

733
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,800
Thank you.

734
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,080
Thank you.

735
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,940
Thank you.

736
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,980
Thank you.

737
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,540
Thank you.

738
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,060
Thank you.

739
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,480
Thank you.

740
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,800
Thank you.

741
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:04,620
Thank you.

742
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,440
Thank you.

743
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,380
Thank you.

744
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,980
Thank you.

745
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,600
Thank you.

746
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,920
Thank you.

747
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,700
I think of that!

748
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,180
If I had a particle board, we could surf on it.

749
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,800
Well, let's see what he wins, champions of the Deuteronomy tanks.

750
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,680
Let's take a look over here for numbers flying through 11,

751
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,880
where the atomic particle only moves in five directions at once.

752
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,880
That's the necromancer time.

753
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,660
You're going to come back time and time again and punch your penis in the orifice.

754
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,680
That's right, the neck of the dead person.

755
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,160
And that's not all.

756
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,400
It's like two quantum realities in one.

757
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:05,360
You'll be crossing them in big-time fashion as you cross five different dimensions at one time.

758
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,000
Your ocular vision, your board, board, board.

759
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,700
Because everybody's constantly spinning it, you know.

760
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,300
Somebody's dimensions at once anyway, you know.

761
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,160
So, like, every possibility that's occurring occurs in some universe.

762
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,560
Twice!

763
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,360
And it's because there's so many universes that there are possibilities, man.

764
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,040
Yeah, but then you also have to double that.

765
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,380
And TikTok's there again, like a monster's cross.

766
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:29,960
There's a crocodile waiting for Peter Pan to touch it.

767
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,720
There's a good one and an evil one.

768
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,180
Yep.

769
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,720
Bill, this is easier to understand than income tax.

770
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,540
I'll say that.

771
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,620
You know what I'm saying, Tom?

772
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,660
Yeah, we do.

773
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,020
You know what I'm saying?

774
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,220
Yep, duality.

775
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,380
Is, you know, yeah, what?

776
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,320
I use a program for income tax and for morality.

777
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,280
You use a program?

778
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:53,320
I have a computer program that dictates morality and ethics for me.

779
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,520
As it does your taxes at the same time?

780
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,300
No, they're different.

781
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:57,780
Different.

782
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,380
They are linked, though.

783
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,860
By a fashionable poo-poo stick.

784
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,580
But they are linked, indeed.

785
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,940
They're linked by the thing longer.

786
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:11,660
They are linked by a fascist evolutionary style statement lingering somewhere in your medulla.

787
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:17,300
The thing of my Bob dangles and ever towards the center of the earth.

788
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,300
Cinema Bob?

789
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:23,120
That's how you know where gravity goes, is where Bob's thing is pointing.

790
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,060
Yes, it's one of the best ways of finding out, too.

791
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,820
It's within, like, a fraction of a microcosmic second.

792
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,240
It's been...

793
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,120
It's been determined by Greenwich.

794
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,560
I mean, at least...

795
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,560
It's the plumb bob upon which is hung all gravitational...

796
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,640
The prior, original plumb bob of Wiener Plumbing.

797
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,640
The plumb of my Bob.

798
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,620
The plumb of my Bob.

799
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,180
The shadow from the buttock also...

800
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:46,220
It's a mad Bob.

801
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,640
...incidental time.

802
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,420
Just sit a reel of Greenwich.

803
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,920
That's what I'm talking about, Bob.

804
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,280
From your head, Bob.

805
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,380
Well...

806
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,000
Hair Bob.

807
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,520
Have we said all we can about his abilities?

808
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,760
Well, you know...

809
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,980
It's fairly flexible, I think.

810
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,960
You know where to put the cork.

811
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,940
Yeah, I know where to put the cork.

812
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,040
People doing your yoga lately, haven't you?

813
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,800
Yeah.

814
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,640
They say the days don't move

815
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,660
And that there's no such thing as time

816
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,440
But reflecting on the hours gone by

817
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,660
I know that once you were mine

818
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,940
Then something happened that I just didn't see

819
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,880
That something took you away

820
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,440
I never thought that it would ever come to be

821
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,380
That I'd look back and despair

822
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,020
But now I'm here

823
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,000
And I'm standing alone without you

824
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,100
Wondering where I went wrong

825
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,120
I don't wanna live without you

826
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,680
Seems like it's taken so long

827
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,300
For me to gather up the words I wanna say

828
00:43:59,300 --> 00:43:59,380
For me to gather up the words I wanna say

829
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,360
I need you with me, it's true

830
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,580
There doesn't seem to be any real way

831
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,460
That I can ever come through for you

832
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:42,660
Uh, I've tried to make a career

833
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:42,660


834
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:42,660


835
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:47,000
I don't wanna go, but there's only one way

836
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,600
What's more, it's in a double side

837
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,780
Note that in a real

838
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:50,880
The weakenedhangs

839
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,380
That I've come to believe in

840
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,040
Look me in the eyes and say

841
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,360
guitar solo

842
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,440
guitar solo

843
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,380
Baby, yeah, do it, do it

844
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,880
You're driving me crazy

845
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:15,320
Oh my god, that feels so good

846
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,980
Oh yeah, yeah, oh baby, yeah

847
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,480
Do it

848
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,580
Oh, you're driving me crazy

849
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,380
Oh yeah, yeah, oh baby, yeah

850
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:29,720
Oh

851
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,100
I'm the hottest thing on the wheels, bitch

852
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,140
You're so rad

853
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,760
My father taught me everything I know

854
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,380
No, I've never met a he-man quite like you

855
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:50,680
Like, you know, someone who could take me beyond the confines of my perceived celestial boundaries

856
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,140
Exemplified by the quasi-cataclysmic cacophony

857
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,700
Of one's personal ponderance of existential mortality

858
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,380
Like a man who's been in a coma for a long time

859
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,640
You know what I mean?

860
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,360
I know you mean, bitch

861
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,300
You know what I mean?

862
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,140
The Master 맡y

863
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,460
The Master want you

864
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:15,500
But I'm the only one

865
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,720
That's been watching you

866
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:24,720


867
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,340
Oscars

868
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:29,360
Thanks for watching!

869
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,900
now champion jack

870
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,320
you shall have as much meat as you want

871
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:27,640
what the devil is going on chrissy they're dressed like little girls

872
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,840
you are a sucker and you listen to me and you listen to me good the time has come

873
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:49,620
it is now or never thou shalt not listen to rock and roll music thou shalt not masturbate

874
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,020
thou shalt not fornicate

875
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:06,120
the time has come a reckoning time a time when all the mighty buildings shall be shattered and splintered and split

876
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:12,520
when the world's bellies were broke when america will be put to the fire and tested in the new revelation

877
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,760
this is the end of today's lesson

878
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,700
you know we live in a world where we want to get stuck

879
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:34,780
and there are all kinds of schemes out there

880
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:42,060
and we are desperate we are hungry and we are thirsty for something that they give us what we want

881
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:45,460
it's the process of criminal law

882
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,420
thrown into the fire and burned

883
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,320
i like to think ridiculous and posturing

884
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,460
i can hardly believe that i heard it on the radio

885
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,680
it's a pill

886
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,440
that has test effects

887
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,220
it's a word either weak or weak

888
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:20,700
all other gods besides jehovah and his son jesus christ are strange gods

889
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:28,760
i like how they collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned

890
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,360
i like how they collect the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned

891
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,180
uh

892
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,980
thrown into the fire and burned

893
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,380
in flashbacks

894
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,160
you have already been expl będę

895
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,780
burned by the word i sung to you

896
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,260
wrong

897
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:44,800
exactly

898
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:52,380
enough

899
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,020
all this means is that i gotta get out of here

900
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,960
and you got the gun

901
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,360
getting out

902
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,340
heart ignition

903
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,660
and now back

904
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,600
to WCSB Cleveland

905
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,240
and ESO

906
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,740
radio with this final

907
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,340
message

908
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,340
the message is the message

909
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,940
and when the lord exploded

910
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,060
his messages

911
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:24,300
on the depleted mankind accordion

912
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,480
he found

913
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,100
the message is the message

914
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,200
God is mad

915
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,160
as hell

916
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,920
and he's not gonna take it anymore

917
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,900
I said God

918
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,700
God is mad

919
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,960
as hell

920
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,940
and he is not gonna take it anymore

921
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:43,640
see me

922
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,780
pay me

923
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,980
hear me

924
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,200
thank you doctor

925
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,340
at least it doesn't get his ire up

926
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,660
that's what I'm glad about

927
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,380
if it made him angry

928
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,080
I'd be worried

929
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:57,920
here comes

930
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,000
you know

931
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,940
otherwise I think

932
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:01,780
we're just fine

933
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,200
really

934
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,700
I think we can trust

935
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,880
that everything is just fine

936
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,980
and we're fine

937
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,500
there's no need for

938
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,120
contrasting opinions anymore

939
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:14,940
God is mad

940
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:19,940
he can come over to my house

941
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,440
and fuck my sister

942
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,880
well yes

943
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,980
and I think it's just going to be fine

944
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,720
I really do

945
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,660
I think I'm gonna have to

946
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:30,940
dunk onto the subway now

947
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:31,720
yes

948
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,680
the subway

949
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,660
mad as hell

950
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,080
mad as hell

951
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,800
I'm not gonna take it anymore

952
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,100
no they're not

953
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:38,620
they voted

954
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:40,080
they voted

955
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,160
they're not mad as hell

956
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,060
everything's apparently just fine

957
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,020
everything's just fine

958
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,380
yes we will take it

959
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,420
we are bending over

960
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,600
go ahead and

961
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,960
all I can say is

962
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,460
free

963
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,120
Willie

964
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,900
that's three video

965
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,900
we're gonna take it

966
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,680
we're gonna

967
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,900
oh there he goes

968
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,580
he freed his Willie

969
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:57,900
he freed his Willie

970
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:57,900


971
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,260
he took him away

972
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,860
he's really making it

973
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,540
come back

974
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,260
Willie no

975
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,220
come back

976
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,860
come back Willie

977
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,460
oh it looks so nice

978
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,740
hanging out like that

979
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,880
but not like the plumb bob

980
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,540
let's forget you

981
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:13,900
yeah

982
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,920
well I think it's time for everyone

983
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,040
to go to theater

984
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,080
find me that way

985
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,220
I want to see a nice show

986
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,780
at the industrial tractor factory

987
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,940
number five

988
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,700
plumb bob is plumb

989
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,160
bombed

990
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:27,520
ah

991
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:27,680
ah

992
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:27,900
ah

993
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:27,900


994
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:27,900


995
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:27,900


996
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:27,900


997
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,080
I love these Chechen movies

998
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,460
put your hand down here

999
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,220
it's not a movie

1000
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:36,800
it's a

1001
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,220
stick your hand in my pocket

1002
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:41,580
I think this Chechen terrorist woman

1003
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,320
to my left

1004
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,780
wants me to put my hand on the popcorn

1005
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,500
there's a quarter down there somewhere

1006
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,920
you're not a Chechen woman

1007
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,380
you're a hairy Chechen man

1008
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:52,200
I don't want your

1009
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,260
and then

1010
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,060
she put her hand out

1011
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,640
holding his mighty

1012
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,900
credit card

1013
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,120
and there's the beautiful flotilla of the virgin Larry

1014
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,980
is making its way down the street

1015
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,420
with all the apostolates

1016
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,680
and the other subcrimes

1017
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,000
smoking the

1018
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,960
the apostrophes they've been given by their

1019
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,640
dear dear dear lord

1020
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,400
a fanny man who used to write them

1021
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,700
efficaciously once every summer

1022
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:20,260
as they cramped away off of their wilderness huts

1023
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,640
but now it looks like some of them are actually

1024
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,640
rolling in the dough

1025
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,900
as they begin to make a huge human pie

1026
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:27,420
ah

1027
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,540
out of the shell

1028
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,100
shall we break

1029
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,180
shall we break

1030
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:30,380
shall we break

1031
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,320
that looks messy

1032
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,300
it is

1033
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,400
it's very messy

1034
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,660
you don't want to get your feet too close to the middle

1035
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,680
there's four and twenty blackbirds in there

1036
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,080
oh man

1037
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,340
and there's also a dead saint

1038
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,360
which comes back

1039
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,080
the blood boils every August 22nd

1040
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:46,840
before the feast

1041
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,500
freedom is laid to west

1042
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,240
in the grave of history

1043
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,040
the human gene

1044
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,540
which once stretched across the globe

1045
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,400
and threatened to kill you

1046
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,380
accidentally died

1047
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,140
neutralized

1048
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:16,580
never gets rid of the human

1049
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,800
never gets rid of the human

1050
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,500
just prepare yourself

1051
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:20,500


1052
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:20,500


1053
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:20,500


1054
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,800
goodbye

1055
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,280
give this pub interest

1056
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:23,760
poem

1057
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,940
to sun

1058
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:28,280
ashes to ashes

1059
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,640
dust to dust

1060
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,580
so endeth all things

1061
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,780
would you like a little bite of his

1062
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,520
ankle

1063
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,400
there is much pain

1064
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,420
and gnashing of teeth

1065
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,620
put a little bit of raisin butter

1066
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,380
on the ankle there you could

1067
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,700
oh man

1068
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,720
get out of there

1069
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,320
you've been resurrected

1070
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,000
get out of that coffin

1071
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,700
throw away the stone and get to work

1072
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,320
who's playing the butt trumpet

1073
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,500
well the first thing we're going to be doing

1074
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,500
we're going to be working on building back some of that

1075
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,500
flexibility you've been losing over being

1076
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,160
dead for the last 26 years

1077
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,940
you're all kind of scrunched up

1078
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,540
you're skeletal look at yourself

1079
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,500
you need to do 25 26

1080
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,820
maybe 27 light year pushups

1081
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,640
come on Norton get down the

1082
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,780
neural fives let's see you do them do them

1083
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,100
do them

1084
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:23,320
do them

1085
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:53,320


1086
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,080
one of the 37 percent of

1087
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,920
American registered voters who showed up to

1088
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,580
wave my fist in the occult sky

1089
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:01,760
and smack my

1090
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,120
firmly between the genital areas

1091
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,000
I'm so glad

1092
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I was the first and now I'm

1093
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,240
well you hear the dogs don't you we better get out of here

1094
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,800
oh here they come here they come

1095
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,460
there were only 37 percenters total

1096
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,020
I voted the wrong way man

1097
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:17,800
here they come

1098
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,260
it's those giant crickets

1099
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,640
the tag glows

1100
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,160
they can see the tag man just just keep moving

1101
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,260
cover up your arm

1102
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:27,120
twinkle twinkle little star

1103
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:27,960
till next week

1104
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,220
keep your head on tight

1105
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,680
how I wonder when

1106
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,460
you're back to the wind

1107
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:35,760
and you're sack in the saddle

1108
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,380
Mr. Butch says his mandate

1109
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,280
means lots of fun

1110
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,000
for the people on top of the pie

1111
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,920
I shat

1112
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,020
for those squanderlings laying down near the bottom

1113
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:50,180
there won't be much pie left

1114
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,280
there's only coming

1115
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,220
for the gravy

1116
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,140
I'm so high

1117
00:57:55,140 --> 00:58:00,120
like a diamond in the sky

1118
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:06,300
twinkle twinkle little star

1119
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:12,600
how I wonder what you are

1120
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,220

1121
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:18,640

Don't move.

Just stay still.

1150
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,160
Help!

1151
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,660
They're hanging in there upside down like in a slaughterhouse.

1152
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:34,420
I wish you'd seen it.

1153
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,460
I want to get a picture.

1154
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,000
Well, you better get to bed now, son.

1155
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,060
Have a good sleep.

1156
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,680
In the middle of the night?

1157
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:39,880
Yes.

1158
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,420
So now you listen and you listen good.

1159
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,820
Have a good sleep.
