1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:18,900
To turn on the machine, this is Radio Yerevan, my name is Hans Ivanovich Hagen, and this

2
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,360
is the news.

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,200
Wake up, puppet boy!

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,300
This is Doug Smith, radio operator, I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:31,860
for sure.

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,900
I am Buck Nugget!

7
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:46,060
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of slush!

8
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,640
Slush!

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,260
Slush!

10
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:47,600
Slush!

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,420
Yeah!

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,000
What?

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:50,860
What?

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,420
What?

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:51,820
What?

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,180
What?

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:52,180


18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,520
What?

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,340
What?

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,080
What?

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:54,680
What?

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,220
What?

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:55,640
What?

24
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,080
What?

25
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,280
What?

26
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:56,820
What?

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,000
What?

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,360
What?

29
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:13,600
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind every time you say,

30
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,120
see, hear, or think.

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,040
Yeah!

32
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:30,360
what's your key phrase it will trigger the entire message without you being aware of it

33
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:41,540
repent quit your job driven to the brink of false sanity by the conspiracy's false reality

34
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,500
and the pressure of a crumbling world then this may be for you

35
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:02,780

oh friends welcome to the hour of slack we've got some nasty nasty preaching and some

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,480
horrible rock and roll

46
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,680
you know it's going to be hard to follow that last show that was an incredible

47
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,200
perfect k-n-o-n show and i hope you understand that you're not going to get that kind of thing

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:04,440
on most stations wait a minute it's showtime time for the subgenius hour and a half the show that

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:12,820
dare not even exist join us now as we rocket away out of normal time into showtime with your

50
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:18,240
favorite horrifying horror host mobius rex and you'll hear the voices of puzzling evidence

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,720
while you're watching this podcast it's very often we try to get asmarket of people's

52
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:32,120
in the become honest and to a whole not that we attach a math and a home is an

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,120


54
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:48,360
for link within the reference reviews for we fill we have live online coverage in the

55
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,960
and the mind's grip on what it knows is at its weakest.

56
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,520
The dead hours of the morning between 4.30 and 6 o'clock.

57
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,500
This is the time when ancient superstitions and night fears

58
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,720
have the greatest hold on human thoughts.

59
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,340
The time when those who sleep are deep in their dreams.

60
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,120
And this is the hour when on the church of the subgenius radio show

61
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,240
the doctors of the air operate without warning.

62
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:21,440
We inhabit a twilight world, a world which feels the rising sun.

63
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,700
Long after nightfall, when the witching hour has been dead for three and a half hours,

64
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,740
we rise from our coffins and go forth to stalk our living victims.

65
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,880
You, our beloved audience, good hunting brothers, help!

66
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,340
This is Dr. Howell, wailing in the night,

67
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,800
for that which lived, which is dead, and for that which is dead, was dead, and in fact was never alive.

68
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,640
So we're lonely.

69
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,680
And now for all you early morning listeners who are up with the chickens,

70
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,780
here's the Farm Report.

71
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,340
Brought to you by Bob's Feed and Grain Storage of Dobstown.

72
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,680
So our bean futures continue at the market rate while most animal feeds are up today.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,080
All futures continue to look pretty.

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,060
It is moon, but that's what you should expect if you're a hog.

75
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,300
That's because most farm-dwelling parkers know the end of the line

76
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,400
is food around the corner for somebody else's breakfast table, and maybe even yours.

77
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,340
Because if you have four legs, hooves, or trotters, and you live on a farm,

78
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,400
if it isn't the Grim Reaper, it's the International Harvester.

79
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,240
And now this.

80
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,160
It's the Subgenius Show.

81
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,760
Yes, if you weren't aware of what's been going on,

82
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,560
then you're probably just the sort of person to listen to the Subgenius Show,

83
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:05,500
the indefinitely long, infinitely boring corridor of horrible horticultural and biological facts.

84
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,500
This is the voice of Radio Subgenius,

85
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,760
bringing to the Greater Bay Area the unadulterated, infrapulated,

86
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,060
vocal incarnation of the sub-divine epistemology of subgenialism.

87
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,360
I'm your host, Dr. Howell, and during the next hour and a half,

88
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,040
Mobius Rex and I will chair the open forum of subgenial issues.

89
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,580
Yes, it's so exciting I can hardly stand it.

90
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,560
How about you, Mobius?

91
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,980
I'm gasping with amazement as I fall back asleep.

92
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:41,360
And with pleasure as one views the incredible expanse of subgenial opportunity.

93
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,400
I'm Dr. Howell, and I'll see you next time.

94
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,460
Don't you think it would be a good idea for you to turn the radio on?

95
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,880
Did you hear what he was saying?

96
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,980
Did you hear what he was saying?

97
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,560
What do you gentlemen like to escort Reverend Stang out and lock him out of his place?

98
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,740
In all reality, help me somebody.

99
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,760
She ain't got no legs.

100
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,200
Pull the lever down and go, my legs are on fire.

101
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,040
Oh, yes, dear friends.

102
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,640
Listen to that beautiful music.

103
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,320
Oh, yes.

104
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,620
We're going to try to take phone calls tonight.

105
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,420
We tried last week and had problems figuring out which of the 19 buttons to push

106
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,500
and how to push them right.

107
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,700
But I think we're going to do it this time.

108
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:35,500
So, friends, we're going to start our telephone outreach on the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

109
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:42,200
And if you will call, if you will but only call 823-749-0.

110
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:51,880
Yes, and we'll try to minister to your needs and try to open up your slack gland,

111
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,220
your third nostril, and see if we can either convince you of the truth, Bob,

112
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,260
deliver some slack, or else smite your ears in your confusion.

113
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:08,460
Because, you know, friends, I know that a lot of our listeners think that we're crazy.

114
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,600
And you know what, friends?

115
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,960
I don't care.

116
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,820
Because I've got slack.

117
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,300
And most of you, unbelievers, don't even know what that is.

118
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,980
Oh, yes, I've got Bob in my life.

119
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,460
So I know I'll be safe in the pleasure ships of the sex goddesses from Planet X

120
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:34,700
when the tribulation times come and you unbelievers will fry in a hell of your own making.

121
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,940
Praise Bob.

122
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,580
Praise Bob.

123
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,040
And how do we know this?

124
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,700
How can we be social?

125
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,140
Sure.

126
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,880
Friends, it's because we've got faith.

127
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,900
Faith, friends.

128
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,400
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

129
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,000
Nay, nay.

130
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,280
You've got to let that Bob signal from outer space come through, beamed from space straight

131
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:07,860
into your skull, loud and clear, unfettered by your pathetic human notions of good or

132
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,560
evil or job or free will.

133
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,620
Ha, ha, ha.

134
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,600
No, friends, the word of Bob is a direct word.

135
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,360
It is not written in some roundabout symbolic manner.

136
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,080
You do not put your own interpretation on it.

137
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,920
You do not try to figure out what it means.

138
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,200
You just do what it says.

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,900
Bob said it.

140
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,340
I believe it.

141
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,780
And that settles it.

142
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,880
So there are all you Rudy Pootbee spectacle slabs of wimp meat.

143
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,600
I picked the god Dob's terror of the funky gods out of my nose.

144
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,260
Pardon my language, but ha, ha, yeah, yeah, yeah.

145
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,420
Let the sons of God and man bear witness even.

146
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,520
In the belly of the Thunderbird, I've been casting out the false prophets.

147
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,580
And you probably think we're kidding.

148
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,900
You think it's a joke, a big joke.

149
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,780
Oh, yeah, Church of the Subgenius, a big joke.

150
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,320
I suppose Bob is a joke, too.

151
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,740
I suppose Slack and the conspiracy.

152
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,300
Oh, it must be some fantasy dreamed up in the diseased mind of Reverend Stang and all

153
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,240
his thousands of compatriot buddies.

154
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,700
Well, you go ahead and think that way, friends.

155
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,380
Well, it looks like we can try to take some calls here.

156
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,280
If we can.

157
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,040
We'll continue with the media barrage.

158
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,540
We've got a real hellfire show dreamed up tonight.

159
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,060
And if nothing else, we'll just segue from one thing to another.

160
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,820
Because, friends, this whole show is just one big segue between the American Music Party

161
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,940
show and Norm's show.

162
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,000
We're the masters of segue, which, by the way, for you who aren't into showbiz terminology,

163
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,640
a segue is like a dissolve in a movie.

164
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,660
It goes from one thing to another.

165
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,800
This music is by DK Jones.

166
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,780
Beautiful.

167
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,140
All right, dear friends, it looks like we've got one.

168
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,240
We got several on the line, but we're going to try.

169
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,920
We're going to try to take it in here.

170
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,480
But go ahead and pick it up.

171
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:04,960
Hello.

172
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,060
Hello.

173
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,640
Hello.

174
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,300
Hello.

175
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,080
This is an hour slide.

176
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,560
I'm looking to make a note of it.

177
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,640
Friends, we're desperately struggling to.

178
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,660
Okay, Chris.

179
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,560
Is he on the air?

180
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,180
We're struggling to get someone on the air.

181
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,460
No, he is not on the air yet.

182
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,340
But, friends, pray with us.

183
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,020
You've got to pray.

184
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,180
You've got to get down and pray.

185
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,800
Massage your foot glands, friends.

186
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,900
We're trying to get us.

187
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,320
Somebody on the air.

188
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,300
We're trying to get some salvation on the air.

189
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,420
I hear a rotten buzz every time you do that.

190
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,000
George.

191
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,340
George.

192
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:38,940
There's one here.

193
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,360
Well, dear friends, we're struggling once again with the technology over here.

194
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:05,520
No.

195
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:05,940
No.

196
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,880
I don't know how Norm does it.

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,640
What subgenius is.

198
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,440
I guess they must mean that word subgenius literally.

199
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,860
We tried.

200
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,420
We tried to do the phone.

201
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,820
There's a lot of people calling.

202
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,380
And, God, I pushed all the buttons they told me to last time.

203
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,640
But, friends, we're just going to pretend to continue with the beautiful media barrage tapes here.

204
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,660
Ah, praise Bob.

205
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,320
Oh, by the way, we've been getting a lot of mail here at the Hour of Slack.

206
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,620
We appreciate that.

207
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,440
We're getting mails, tapes, and so forth.

208
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,520
Ah, so we can do everything but put you on the air.

209
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,280
And we're trying very hard to do that.

210
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,000
Thank you.

211
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,100
Did you hear what he was saying?

212
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,500
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

213
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,140
Perhaps in the form of an atomic holocaust?

214
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,460
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand.

215
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,740
The White House will confirm an order to use the atom bomb.

216
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,520
And our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.

217
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,600
Those missiles have all gone off.

218
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,420
They pushed all the buttons.

219
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,300
You know what that means, don't you?

220
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,320
Either we fired first and they're going to try to hit what's left,

221
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,640
or they fired first and we just got our missiles out of the ground in time.

222
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,020
Either way, we're going to get hit.

223
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,940
So what are we still standing around here for?

224
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,820
Where do you want to go?

225
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,480
Well, how about out of here for starters?

226
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,920
I've got to get my wife and my kids.

227
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,140
We're still on alert, Billy.

228
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,480
No one leaves us.

229
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:36,840
This facility.

230
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,780
Oh, come on.

231
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:43,180
Of course, since all human life has been under the surface of Earth for 16 years,

232
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,080
there was no actual loss of life in the sense we know it.

233
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,500
The strange worshippers pull at their faces.

234
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,620
Despite himself, a strangled cry escapes Brent.

235
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,760
As he sees the ghastly heritage of atomic radiation,

236
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,860
the bomb is indeed their maker.

237
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,360
The bomb is indeed their maker.

238
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,360


239
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,080
Hey, Tony, let's have some.

240
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,000
Get out of here.

241
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,280
Get me out of here.

242
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,860
Kill Bob.

243
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,420
Yes, sirree, Bob.

244
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,260
Yes, sirree, Bob.

245
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,760
We're going to get down.

246
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,340
We're going to beat this tongue.

247
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,500
We're going to beat down them tongues of those that use.

248
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,780
If their tongue offendeth thee, rip it out.

249
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,980
That's what I say.

250
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,920
And if thy music offendeth them,

251
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,460
rip their ears off.

252
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,360
And begin to speak to thy tongue.

253
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:38,360


254
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,300
I mean, hell, this turn the other cheek thing can be carried a bit too far, you know.

255
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,540
And begin to speak to thy tongue.

256
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,140
And begin to speak to thy tongue.

257
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,340
Leave.

258
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,540
I believe we're going to be able to do it here.

259
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,200
I keep this down.

260
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,740
I keep this down.

261
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,860
Okay, now, Buddy, Pastor West, hang up the phone.

262
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,140
And I should be able to catch this person on the air.

263
00:14:59,460 --> 00:14:59,900
Phillip.

264
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,560
Yes.

265
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,900
Oh, we hear you, dear friends.

266
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,640
I'm on the air now, huh?

267
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,280
You are indeed.

268
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,460
This is Aura Slash.

269
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:12,520
You are the first person to speak back to us from out there in listener land.

270
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,760
This is a great subgenius of a room.

271
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,460
It has been done.

272
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,560
Now, can we help you?

273
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,880
Can we deliver a healing, a sickening?

274
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,360
I'm really strung out on Reagan Youth Movement here.

275
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,720
Strung out on the Reagan Youth Movement?

276
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,140
That's right.

277
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,100
What?

278
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,900
Why, we're all members of the Reagan Youth.

279
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,340
We've been out killing normals for Reagan.

280
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,600
And what about the Dick Army Corps?

281
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,160
The Dick Army Corps?

282
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:39,800
The Dick Army Corps.

283
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:39,940
Right.

284
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:47,200
Take your fist, your right hand, bolt to a fist, put it on your left tit, and go, Dick.

285
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,380
Now, stretch your arm out.

286
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,080
Army.

287
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,060
Dick.

288
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,200
Army.

289
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,180
Dick.

290
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,160
Army.

291
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,160
Dick.

292
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,200
Army.

293
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:55,980
Dick.

294
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:56,980
Army.

295
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,160
Dick.

296
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,560
Dear friends.

297
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,720
Now, that'll get your blood flowing.

298
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,260
If you're tired of Reagan Youth, if you're worn out on that, just go for the Dick Army

299
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:04,580
Corps.

300
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,200
I feel better already.

301
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:06,680
Oh, man.

302
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,360
That's next.

303
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:07,960
Oh, praise Bob.

304
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,480
What else can we do for you?

305
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,040
Oh, I really don't know.

306
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,000
I...

307
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,160
Let him try that, Stang, and call us back when you're done, okay?

308
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:16,920
Thank you.

309
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,800
And keep massaging that foot gland for us, Bob.

310
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,860
I'll try my best.

311
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,460
Praise Bob.

312
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,720
Praise Bob.

313
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,300
Praise Bob.

314
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:22,980
Praise Bob.

315
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,060
Praise Bob.

316
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

317
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,100
Well, you know, friends, that's a new...

318
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,060
That new...

319
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,720
That chant one is new on me.

320
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,600
Friends, is that another phone call coming in?

321
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,180
I think so.

322
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,200
Same.

323
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,320
Same.

324
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,320


325
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,320


326
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,320


327
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,320


328
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,320


329
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,320


330
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,900
Well, we'll...

331
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,020
Friends, it's beautiful, isn't it?

332
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,400
That's what I'm saying.

333
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,780
I mean, hell, this turn, the other cheek thing could be carried a bit too far, you know?

334
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,280
Hey, neighbor, let me give you some advice.

335
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,120
The Russians are about to pulverize us.

336
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,200
You're not to live tonight.

337
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,740
That is if the crazy Arabs pull the right, don't get us first, and the fire will rain

338
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,000
down.

339
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:05,780
From the skies.

340
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,040
The fire will rain down.

341
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,840
From the skies.

342
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,740
People die.

343
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,840
People die.

344
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,820
People die.

345
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,700
People die.

346
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,040
Remember what's wise.

347
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,500
Time's just not fair.

348
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,460
There's nothing to fear but fear itself.

349
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,760
Tarı Force.

350
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,440
There's nothing to fear about fear itself

351
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,100
I remember how the siren was bursting into my brain

352
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,080
How it sounded as it began to stop

353
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,220
The gurgle of a death rattle

354
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,360
But silence did not follow

355
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,580
The awful he

356
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:52,840
And I couldn't see

357
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,740
I couldn't stand it

358
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,920
The smell

359
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:05,420
The terrible rotten smell of burning flesh

360
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,580
I was so sick

361
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,960
I cried for help

362
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,260
That I wrote the letter

363
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,260


364
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,260


365
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,260


366
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,260


367
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,440
Won't you leave you

368
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:25,740
Be with me

369
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:25,860
Make me cry

370
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,860
You're just cloud

371
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,520
Get a positive

372
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,120
You're fine

373
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,120


374
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,120


375
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,620
Andcen

376
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,520
Just a player

377
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:31,900
Triple

378
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,180
Up

379
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,500
Like

380
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,520
Bird

381
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,620
Hequelehr

382
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,620
Why did we come all this way?

383
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,200
Why did we come all this way?

384
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,880
Why did we come all this way?

385
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,700
Why did we come all this way?

386
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,480
Friends, we got somebody here ready to testify for Bob once again.

387
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,540
Let's give it a try here.

388
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,240
Oh, my.

389
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,140
That was terrible.

390
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,580
We lost him, Stan.

391
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,320
Yeah, we lost him.

392
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,020
Another listener gone by the wayside.

393
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,720
Another soul.

394
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,200
Another soul lost.

395
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,740
It's sad, sad, but that's not much.

396
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,940
We got someone on line three and on line one.

397
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,840
Let's check line one.

398
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,580
Check line one.

399
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,240
Oh, you did it again.

400
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,640
This is KNON.

401
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,380
You're on the air.

402
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:37,800
Yes.

403
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,700
I want to testify for Bob.

404
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,240
Oh, please do, dear friend.

405
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,060
Well, it was amazing.

406
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,260
I was sitting here in my house tonight listening to the show.

407
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,540
I've never heard of Bob before.

408
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:50,940
But.

409
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:59,080
But as I was listening to the music, my little girl, she's only six years old and she's been missing for two years now, I think.

410
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,580
And she came back in.

411
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,360
She walked right in the door of the house.

412
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,060
And I said, well, how did you get here?

413
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,940
You know, and she just said that a man with a big smile on his face had brought her here.

414
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,780
Had led her there.

415
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,280
And then I looked outside and there was a car.

416
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,060
And the man just drove off.

417
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,300
And lit his pot.

418
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,060
And I never saw him again.

419
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,420
That was beautiful.

420
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,820
Thanks for sharing that with us.

421
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,480
Good night.

422
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,520
Thanks for sharing that.

423
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:28,820
Oh.

424
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,780
Praise Bob.

425
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

426
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:36,380
Well, friends, so far we've gotten two calls of witnessing for Bob.

427
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,360
Now, Buck, when you want to get the other one, let's see you hit that.

428
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,620
Friends, we're going to go back to media barrage.

429
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,960
But the trouble is that all this knowledge I've got hold of is useless.

430
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,640
We're going to come back in just a moment.

431
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,000
We're going to have some strong comments.

432
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,620
We're going to talk about this.

433
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,140
And we're going to continue with it.

434
00:20:54,540 --> 00:21:00,140
It's no wonder one group of kids said we're the generation that's been born under the mushroom cloud.

435
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,040
All right.

436
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,360
This is the subject of radio ministry.

437
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,660
Hour of black on K-N-O-N-9-0.9 in the left excess.

438
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,840
Praise Bob.

439
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,900
Hello, dear friend.

440
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,560
Hello.

441
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,920
You're on the air.

442
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,240
Yes, we're on the air.

443
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,860
Is Bob there?

444
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,600
Bob.

445
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,200
Friend, I'm afraid you haven't been up on the.

446
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,840
We're the our guru.

447
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:27,000
Bob Dobbs was shot and killed two years ago in San Francisco.

448
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,440
Well, but victim writes letters to us.

449
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,000
Victim of a cover up.

450
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,600
Yes, he can speak from the beyond life.

451
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,520
The before life.

452
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,400
Yes, he does.

453
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,760
All right.

454
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,560
Well, what's the latest on Bob?

455
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,320
Let's hear it.

456
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,520
The latest on Bob was he's been writing me letters.

457
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,780
He's been writing you letters.

458
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,160
What did they have to say?

459
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,080
It's kind of confidential, but he was a little.

460
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,160
Well, he's still.

461
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,940
You can tell it's Bob because he's basically.

462
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,420
Talk about our ratings and.

463
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:58,480
Yeah, you know, he's very willing to sacrifice any member of his flock, no matter how high up in the church they are.

464
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,640
If if that really was Bob anymore, need not be said.

465
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,480
Oh, I understand.

466
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,080
I understand.

467
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,780
Either that or it's the conspiracy trying to split the church up again.

468
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,720
That would be nothing new, would it?

469
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,240
Well, God knows we don't want to do that.

470
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,280
Heck no.

471
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:11,840
Yeah.

472
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,540
Well, any any question or do you have anything wrong with you?

473
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,620
Need a healing or anything?

474
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,160
Well, nothing really wrong with me.

475
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,240
I'm just really missing Bob.

476
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,460
I was really strung out.

477
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,140
Oh, hey, we'll send more.

478
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,400
Money and we'll be able to buy Bob's way out of hell, my friend.

479
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,080
Are you going to buy Bob's way out of hell?

480
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:33,780
If we don't get enough donations from subgenius ministers, we're going to have to start cashing in the canisters full of compressed souls.

481
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,500
Well, we've got stashed.

482
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,520
I'm already on the third mortgage on my house for y'all, man.

483
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:45,640
Yeah, well, I mean, you can get a house back, but getting those souls back from where we have to sell them to when we need to raise money ain't easy.

484
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,560
Where do you where do you sell the house?

485
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:48,940
Huh?

486
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,100
Where do you sell it?

487
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
We used to get them converted.

488
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:51,980
To rocket fuel.

489
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,420
Well, space bankers.

490
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,300
Are you serious?

491
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,040
That's yeah, that's that's one story.

492
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,060
I don't want to think about we just use them as but we got to go.

493
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,320
Bye bye.

494
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,940
Oh, another line.

495
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,460
Let's see.

496
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,640
Hello, dear friend.

497
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,940
Are you on the air?

498
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,680
Are you on the air?

499
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:13,700
Yes.

500
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,580
What?

501
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,860
Bob, we're going over like Pontchartrain.

502
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,960
You're going over like Pontchartrain?

503
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,160
Yes.

504
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,820
Bob, Bob, eat your apple and go to your room, Bob.

505
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,300
No, Bob.

506
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,220
Bob.

507
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,380
Oh, friends, I believe it's a mystic message in code.

508
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,760
No, Bob.

509
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,800
Bob, we're not going to do that today, Bob.

510
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,020
We're going to need we're going to have to get Bob into the station here.

511
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,340
I can't handle these kind of.

512
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,240
Yeah, I like these kind of calls.

513
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,300
They're called permission calls.

514
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,300
And we'd like a lot more permission calls.

515
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,620
We'd like a lot more of you to call and give us permission.

516
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,240
No, Bob.

517
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,180
No permission.

518
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:55,940
I'm sorry.

519
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,120
No, Bob.

520
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,620
Okay, see you, Mom.

521
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:58,960
Bye.

522
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,280
You mean they ain't going to give Bob slack, friends.

523
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,280
No slack for Bob.

524
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,820
Well, now what about the hate calls?

525
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,540
What about the people out there that hate this church of the subgenius?

526
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,560
What about you who think we're Satanists?

527
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,020
What about people who hate everything?

528
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,400
What about the ones who hate every last little thing?

529
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,080
We've got another call.

530
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,120
We've got a Satan call here.

531
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,120
Oh, well, I hope that's a Satan call.

532
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:18,740
Oh, no.

533
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,200
Oh, that one's gone.

534
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,100
That one's gone.

535
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,600
Oh, no.

536
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,520
What is this?

537
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,180
There's some sort of interference coming in here.

538
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,320
Listen to that.

539
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,760
That's strange.

540
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,200
At least it's in stereo.

541
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,360
Friends, do you consider this a waste of the airwaves?

542
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,720
Well, if you do, then...

543
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,160
No, no.

544
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,340
Look, the TV's talking back.

545
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,420
Something's wrong with my TV.

546
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,280
It's giving me answers.

547
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,320
I think you've made your point.

548
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,280
Your program will combine the powerful effects of subliminal mental suggestions with the

549
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,280


550
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,280


551
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,280


552
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,280


553
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,280


554
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,280


555
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,280


556
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,280


557
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,820
tried-and-proven plan to follow.

558
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,920
I can't say.

559
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,660
Let me show you how it comes together.

560
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,960
I can't.

561
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,920
It's not a joke.

562
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,100
Oh, my God.

563
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,100


564
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,100


565
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,320
I never got to see it.

566
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,380
We didn't have any jokes.

567
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,380
Oh, my God.

568
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,000
We made everyone get up and listen.

569
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,580
And nothing was funny!

570
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,260
Friends, we made everybody get up and listen.

571
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,940
And nothing was funny anymore.

572
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,400
Nothing worked.

573
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,280
I can't.

574
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,280


575
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,280


576
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,280


577
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,280


578
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,280


579
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,280


580
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,280


581
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,280


582
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,280


583
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,280


584
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,280


585
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,280


586
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,000
Hello? You're on the air.

587
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,160
How's it going, guys?

588
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,400
Well, I don't know.

589
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,880
Not bad. Pretty killer, actually.

590
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,060
Man, I hate you.

591
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:29,980
All right.

592
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,040
Yeah, tell us why. We want to know why you...

593
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,520
You want to know why I hate you?

594
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:34,960
Yeah, yeah.

595
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,880
It's because you don't play the crayons.

596
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,920
He wants to hear something he's heard a million times before.

597
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,260
No wonder he hates us.

598
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,520
We only play stuff you've never heard.

599
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,140
I want to hear the crayons.

600
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,300
Well...

601
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,360
I'll hate you until I hear the crayons.

602
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,720
But he's got us there, Stang.

603
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,140
There's no way we can please this guy.

604
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,120
That's right. We can't please you. That's it.

605
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,440
Oh, there they went.

606
00:25:59,420 --> 00:25:59,860
Okay.

607
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,460
Hello? You're on the air, dear friend.

608
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,480
Huh?

609
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,960
She was calling...

610
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,720
Are they calling...

611
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,860
Did I hear Aunt Em calling for Dorothy?

612
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,120
Friends...

613
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,600
I'm gonna have to give a PSA here.

614
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,240
Listen to that beautiful background noise.

615
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,820
The free Joey benefit, folks.

616
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,380
Thursday, February 6th at the Circle A Ranch.

617
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,320
That's also known as the Twilight Room.

618
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,080
Located at 2111 Commerce Street downtown.

619
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:42,040
There will be a merely $4 benefit to help with the defense of war chest tourist Greg Joey Johnson.

620
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:48,860
Who was arrested and convicted for being part of an anti-war, anti-Raygun protest during the Republican...

621
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,420
Convention.

622
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,360
Bans to...

623
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,120
Let's see.

624
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,180
I know all about this.

625
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:54,540
Okay.

626
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,820
You lay out the bans here, Buck.

627
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,100
Okay.

628
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,460
I was gonna nest this paper anyway.

629
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,040
Okay.

630
00:26:59,140 --> 00:26:59,540
It's a...

631
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,160
Two by four.

632
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,640
N-O-Y-B, which means none of your business.

633
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,960
Reverend Buck naked with more drunk cowboys.

634
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,140
The Underground.

635
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,920
Also stand-up comic Anne McKinney from the Ladies Against Women comedy troupe.

636
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,300
And the video of Stoney Does Gallop by Stoney Drip will be featured.

637
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,100
Come on and support the political rights of freedom of protest against government and

638
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,100


639
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,100


640
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,100


641
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,100


642
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:24,040
war and death and pills and budget busting stuff.

643
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:30,840
So if you want to know more, just call 827-3189.

644
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,220
You're on the air.

645
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,400
No, that wasn't it.

646
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,060
That was the wrong number.

647
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,260
Sorry, we gave you the wrong number, folks.

648
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,340
Don't listen to that number.

649
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:36,580
Hello?

650
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,320
I was just wondering if Bob was going to be attending the resident show.

651
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:47,980
Bob Dobbs, in order to attend a show, Bob has to re-corporate into this physical plane.

652
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
I don't know if you all understand that.

653
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,720
that Bob has actually literally been killed.

654
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,820
Now, some say he has resurrected,

655
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,140
some say he has re-erected,

656
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,120
some say that Bob Dobbs can only speak to us

657
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,400
through tape decks and mysterious messages

658
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,320
written on walls in the bodies of cockroaches.

659
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,240
But I'll be at the resident show.

660
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,760
Well, do you think the residents have anything to do

661
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,840
with the appraising of Bob?

662
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,380
I'll tell you...

663
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:13,780
Directly?

664
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,020
No, no, definitely not directly.

665
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,060
They know of Bob.

666
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,280
Just as Bob knows of them.

667
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,180
But Bob knows about everybody.

668
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,100
And he knows when you've been sleeping,

669
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,300
he knows when you're awake.

670
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,540
I'm asleep right now.

671
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,680
Well, he...

672
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,980
I'm sure he...

673
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,680
Uh-oh.

674
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,440
Oh, wait a minute, you guys.

675
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
Who spilled show?

676
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,720
I'm getting show spilled all over my lap.

677
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,540
Okay, anything else we can do for you?

678
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:39,900
Uh...

679
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,160
Death and damnation?

680
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,960
So, damnation, one dollar is available here.

681
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,640
I don't have any money.

682
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,420
Okay.

683
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:47,920
Okay.

684
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,240
Well, then, we can't help you.

685
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:49,800
Bye.

686
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,640
This is a church.

687
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,940
They don't seem to understand.

688
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,280
You're on the air.

689
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,400
Yeah, I saw Bob last night.

690
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,200
That's what they all say.

691
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,760
I swear he was here.

692
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,500
He was right here next to me.

693
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,260
He...

694
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:06,900
Really?

695
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:07,900
I mean...

696
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,580
Now, are you putting us on or...

697
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,380
I swear.

698
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,960
I mean, that's like somebody saying

699
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,760
Jesus appeared to him the other day.

700
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,940
I wouldn't lie to you.

701
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,420
I was just laying here in bed.

702
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,120
Well, what did he do?

703
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,020
I was laying here, and suddenly,

704
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,740
I felt something in the bed next to me.

705
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,860
And then I go,

706
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,640
I go, oh, my God.

707
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,720
And I saw it rolled over, and it's Bob.

708
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,280
And Bob said,

709
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,280
Bob said,

710
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,280
Sting, he said,

711
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,140
there's something I've always wanted you to do.

712
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,500
And I said, what is it, Bob?

713
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,420
And he said, fart in my mouth, please.

714
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,180
Please.

715
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,400
Bob said that?

716
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,440
Bob said that.

717
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,280
That, friend,

718
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,900
you just convinced...

719
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,040
You just convinced me that it was Bob.

720
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,240
I told you it was Bob.

721
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,940
I can't think of anybody else besides Bob

722
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,580
who would do that,

723
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,680
and I don't know why he would,

724
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,020
but it sounds so somehow Bob.

725
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,500
It sounds totally Bob, doesn't it?

726
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,320
Yeah, he's...

727
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:00,880
He's...

728
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,380
You know, Bob works in mysterious ways.

729
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,400
I mean, I couldn't believe it.

730
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,400
It just changed my life.

731
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,260
Well, now, did it...

732
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,160
When he did this...

733
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,360
When he asked you to do this,

734
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,060
did he want you to pyroflatulate

735
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,600
or to flatulate normally?

736
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,900
To flatulate normally.

737
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:14,760
That's weird,

738
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,380
because usually he wants you to light it.

739
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,580
Does he want you to light it?

740
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,520
Well, yes.

741
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,480
As a matter of fact,

742
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,120
it's one of the main rituals of the church.

743
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,480
It's pyroflatulation.

744
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,960
I didn't know he was into pyro.

745
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,700
You bet.

746
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,580
And not only that,

747
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,660
but excremeditation, of course,

748
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,560
is a daily meditative ritual that we do.

749
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,280
Have you ever read our subgenius pamphlet

750
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,920
or the books or any of that stuff?

751
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,420
I haven't read them lately.

752
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,040
Well, you ought to check them out,

753
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,600
because they'll let you know

754
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,080
which of your bodily functions

755
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,540
are more holy than others

756
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,840
and how to get the most slack out of

757
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,460
abusing those bodily functions.

758
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,040
Yeah, yeah.

759
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,520
So, you know,

760
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,160
first send a buck to the station

761
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,460
and then send a buck to Bob.

762
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,480
Okay, well, I've already paid Bob.

763
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,520
Oh, have you?

764
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:55,820
Yeah.

765
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,000
How much did you pay him?

766
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,200
It was $27.50.

767
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,400
Plus the gas that was expelled

768
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,540
when he demanded.

769
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,860
Of course, plus the gas.

770
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,500
I think I heard some of that gas

771
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,420
just a second ago.

772
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,000
Listen to that.

773
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,700
There it is.

774
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,240
That's it.

775
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:08,940
That's it.

776
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,980
The church air.

777
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,100
Oh, yeah.

778
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,500
Smell that church air.

779
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:13,960
Whoa!

780
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,700
Too much church air, friends!

781
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:17,800
That's it.

782
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,440
Too much is always better than not enough.

783
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,580
That's what Bob said.

784
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,380
Praise Bob.

785
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,760
Well, we're going to have to continue

786
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,400
with the media barrages here.

787
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,100
We got some important preaching on tape.

788
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:27,680
All right.

789
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,940
Oh, okay.

790
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,860
One more here.

791
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,220
Okay, just briefly.

792
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,420
The TFL stand.

793
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,440
Table Football League.

794
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,140
Bring Tony in here.

795
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,760
Hold it.

796
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,240
There's a lot of buzzers in the air here.

797
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:41,720
We got it.

798
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,100
Go ahead, Buck.

799
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,860
We had a tournament recently

800
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,980
for the Table Football League.

801
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,580
Oh, no.

802
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,380
The first time a rookie.

803
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,940
No, not the Table Football League.

804
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,620
Go ahead.

805
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,080
The TFL.

806
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,040
And we had a rookie make it all the way to the top,

807
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,180
the Wazonian Doctors.

808
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,680
Next was number two,

809
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,120
the Uptown Beachcombers.

810
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,400
Then the Oaklawn Thingette,

811
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,500
Okie Cronies,

812
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,580
Dallas Assassins.

813
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,600
At number six,

814
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,820
Dibock Killer Worms.

815
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,740
Then the Metro Milkmen,

816
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,460
North Oak Cliff Goon Squad,

817
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
Chaos City Crushers,

818
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,640
Downtown Underground.

819
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,820
At number 11,

820
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,020
Kossie View Kamikazes.

821
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,100
Then at the Eastside and Architects,

822
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,800
number 13,

823
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,580
Midway Thing.

824
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,380
14,

825
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,480
the Mexican Mafia.

826
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,380
15,

827
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,460
Gomer City GIs.

828
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,340
And then following with that

829
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,820
would be the Santa Fe Diplomats

830
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,520
and the Trinidad Pterodactyls.

831
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,640
Come to our next tournament

832
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,760
at the Stonely P,

833
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,760
February 15th,

834
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,300
Saturday night.

835
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,260
It'll be the Stonely P Bowl.

836
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:30,620
That's right,

837
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,240
the Stonely P,

838
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,100
right there at Stonely.

839
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,820
The P Bowl.

840
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,800
Not really at Stonely, maybe,

841
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,020
but right across the Stonely Hotel.

842
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,880
You'll find it.

843
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,320
930 Sharp.

844
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,480
Ah, yes, probably.

845
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,180
That was the Table Football League report.

846
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:42,660
You see,

847
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,600
subgeniuses have to invent their own sports.

848
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,620
Team sports,

849
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,360
you know,

850
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,700
they're somehow,

851
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:49,980
they're fun,

852
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,160
but too normal

853
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,840
if that's all you do.

854
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,260
So subgeniuses have to invent their own games

855
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,940
and Buck has resurrected

856
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,480
the great game of table football,

857
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,140
if you remember that from high school,

858
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,640
with a folded up piece of paper

859
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,700
flicked over bottles of beer.

860
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,600
And the only world championships

861
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,100
in that happened here in Dallas.

862
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,660
Well, friends,

863
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,120
we're going to go,

864
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,880
we're going to avoid,

865
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,060
well, one more call

866
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,880
and then we're going to,

867
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,340
we're going to call it a night

868
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,380
and go back to,

869
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,860
all right,

870
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
let's give this one a try.

871
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,720
You're on the air.

872
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,500
Hello?

873
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,200
Hello?

874
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,800
You're on the air.

875
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,420
Hello?

876
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,160
Yes.

877
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,920
I want to testify for Bob.

878
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,720
All right, testify, testify.

879
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,600
Testify.

880
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,040
Hey, brother.

881
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,440
I was a successful lawyer and a doctor.

882
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,220
He was a lawyer and a doctor.

883
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,420
I hear them all testify.

884
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,900
That's right,

885
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,680
but then I found slack.

886
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
Then he found slack.

887
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,220
Yeah, yeah, hallelujah.

888
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,440
Then I quit both of my jobs.

889
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,540
Praise Bob.

890
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,440
Praise Peter.

891
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,200
Oh, yes.

892
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,380
I grabbed my wife by the diamond ring

893
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,600
and I threw her out of the house.

894
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,960
He grabbed his wife by the ring

895
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,980
and he threw her out of the house.

896
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,180
Oh, yes, friends.

897
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,260
I put my kids in their toy Mercedes

898
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,020
and threw them down the driveway.

899
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,580
He threw them down the driveway

900
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,520
in front of the car.

901
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:02,840
Okay.

902
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

903
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,080
Now I raise digital cat food for a living.

904
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,380
Digital cat food

905
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,780
and he makes a good living on it.

906
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,080
Help me somebody.

907
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:11,680
Oh, yeah.

908
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,420
Here's some sprouting now.

909
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,320
There it was.

910
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:15,680
All right.

911
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,580
Oh, you have digital cat food there, too.

912
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,280
Yes, digital cat food.

913
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,260
It's spreading.

914
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,280
It's made of pluses and nothing.

915
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,140
Ah, yes, friends.

916
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,260
You know what?

917
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,300
If you could listen to this man,

918
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,520
you'd have a spiritual devival at night,

919
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,340
at now,

920
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,740
in your own bed tonight.

921
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,560
Yes, sir.

922
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,700
You can have a revival in your own bed.

923
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,580
A devival.

924
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,660
Or you can have an invival.

925
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,100
You can invert it and get,

926
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,140
oh, friends,

927
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,080
the things you can do.

928
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,320
Sex hurt is real.

929
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:44,960
Oh, my.

930
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,860
And it's not what you're thinking.

931
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,440
Sex hurt.

932
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,800
It ain't tying them up or anything.

933
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,900
It's just love.

934
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,900
It's just love them until it hurts.

935
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,680
Love them until it hurts.

936
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,660
Something hurts so much,

937
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,680
you just can't keep going.

938
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,920
And that's slack, friends.

939
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,340
Oh, yes.

940
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,740
Oh, slack has done everything for me.

941
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,780
Slack is dripping down their legs

942
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,600
in a great torrent of love.

943
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,160
Oh.

944
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,760
It's religious urges

945
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,380
and so it's so wonderful.

946
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,380
Well, is there anything else we can do for you?

947
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,980
Like read our sacred P.O. box

948
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,660
so that you could send for a pamphlet?

949
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,940
Oh, my gosh.

950
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,880
That would be a healing experience.

951
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:19,560
Yes.

952
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:23,200
The very sound of hearing the P.O. box number read.

953
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,080
About to have the wallet healed by Bob.

954
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,900
The wallet will be removed.

955
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,000
Oh, my goodness.

956
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,320
That which has burdened you,

957
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,380
we shall take upon ourselves.

958
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,300
And that's, friends, get a pencil.

959
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,540
Write to Bob.

960
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,980
Ask for our pamphlet.

961
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,360
And a love offering would help.

962
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,140
But remember the station, too.

963
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,260
And that's Bob at P.O. Box 14030.

964
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,880
306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

965
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,980
And we'll read that number again

966
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,840
at the end of the broadcast.

967
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,100
Thanks a lot, dude. Praise Bob.

968
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,920
Praise Bob.

969
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,520
And we're going to go back to media barrages,

970
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,380
I think, right now.

971
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,940
We're going to have to stop the phone calls.

972
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,160
I want a personal message, though,

973
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,600
to all the ladies out there.

974
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,200
Okay. Please do.

975
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,980
By the way, this is KNON Community Radio.

976
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:06,620
Yes.

977
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,680
And we're 90.9 on your FM dial.

978
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,420
And you're listening to us in Grapevine,

979
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,380
Plano, Midlothian, Dallas,

980
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,060
and Fort Worth.

981
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,700
And I'd just like to say...

982
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,240
Say it, Buck. Come on.

983
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,840
Say it.

984
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,880
Say it.

985
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,760
Say it.

986
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,540
Say it.

987
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:32,540


988
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,220
Oh, he's trying to argue.

989
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,920
Don't be asked this about his high end, Tom.

990
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,440
This is the plague show.

991
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,360
The show that plagues you and plagues us.

992
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:44,820
Three.

993
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,300
Three.

994
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,220
The people you want to leave

995
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,800
forces us to get on the effects you're hearing.

996
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,840
That's our problem.

997
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,480
Listen up.

998
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,700
Well, we're watching the station right now.

999
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,620
You hear in the background.

1000
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,780
Is that an antenna in your pocket

1001
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,880
or are you glad to hear it?

1002
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,940
And there was a little spooky sight.

1003
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,380
Is this a real show or is this a fake show?

1004
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,120
It's a tape.

1005
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1006
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1007
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:14,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1008
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1009
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1010
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,640
You broke the show.

1011
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,060
Please help me.

1012
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,400
I'm scared.

1013
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,240
Somebody give that kid a fix.

1014
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:27,740
Don't worry.

1015
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,060
It won't be long now.

1016
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,780
Please help me.

1017
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm sorry.

1018
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,400
We're not going to help you.

1019
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,280
Wow, I'm funny, please.

1020
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,900
Comprez-vous que je dis?

1021
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,000
Well, all the salads, all the...

1022
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,280
Okay, we'll have to roll that back.

1023
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,460
That was fine.

1024
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,020
I think that really worked out well.

1025
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,400
And it's free.

1026
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,180
Just send us a large amount of money.

1027
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,280
Shit or get off the car.

1028
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:51,920
No, come on.

1029
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:52,920
What, what, what?

1030
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,560
What?

1031
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,240
What?

1032
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,040
Oh, there's someone who wants to talk to me.

1033
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,800
Yeah, okay, put him on.

1034
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,340
Hello?

1035
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:00,640
Hello?

1036
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,680
Can you speak?

1037
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,520
Hey, do you guys got degrees in this?

1038
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,940
Hey, do you guys got degrees in this?

1039
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,180
Are you cool with that?

1040
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,100
Yeah, it's hard.

1041
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,500
I'm gonna miss you smaller than you are.

1042
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,160
Can I get a whip, brother?

1043
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,640
Can I get a whip?

1044
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,280
Can you get a high?

1045
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,840
Can I get a whip?

1046
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,860
Can I get a whip?

1047
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,780
Can I get a whip?

1048
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,520
Let me hear it, brother.

1049
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,740
Can I get a whip?

1050
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,340
Can I get a whip?

1051
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,580
Can I get a whip?

1052
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,560
Can't hide if you're broke, Frank.

1053
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,940
If he's more unpronounceable than you are.

1054
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,480
He makes less sense than you do.

1055
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,180
He's more non-existent than you are.

1056
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,160
You cannot hide from your own friends.

1057
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,400
You can't hide from Bob, because he's younger than you.

1058
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,780
His face is in more places than yours is.

1059
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,340
He smokes more prop than you do.

1060
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,220
Help somebody.

1061
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,880
You can't hide from Bob.

1062
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,340
You can't hide from your own friends.

1063
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:15,340


1064
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:15,340


1065
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,060
You can't hide from your own friends.

1066
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,760
Help somebody.

1067
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,340
Can I get a witness?

1068
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,200
Help somebody.

1069
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,940
Can I get a whip?

1070
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,940
You can't hide from your own friends.

1071
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,880
Help somebody.

1072
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,240
You cannot hide from God, but you can try.

1073
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,700
You can run as fast as you want to.

1074
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,520
You can run as far as you want to.

1075
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,720
You can run as far as you want to.

1076
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,960
You cannot run away from the old man.

1077
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,980
You can't start your own chain song without being started with.

1078
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,140
You can't launch a turbine overhead.

1079
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,640
That doesn't make any sense.

1080
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,820
Go help me somebody.

1081
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,300
You're not going to win this, so help me.

1082
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,480
This is KNON 90.90.N FM.

1083
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,300
And I'm Texas.

Copyright 1986 by the Subgenius Foundation and the participants.

1085
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:40,260
I tell you.

1086
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,620
And silence them with the final solution.

1087
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,820
Greatest bugaboo of them all is Static, the unconquered,

1088
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,420
who grinds his crackler in your ears while he laughs in your face.

1089
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,740
The home of the whistlers, squealers, and howlers is to be found in tuning elements

1090
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:04,540
and transformers of poor design in faulty wiring or unskillful operation.

1091
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,700
Other cracklers usually are found hiding in run-down batteries,

1092
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:13,900
poor wiring connections, defective rheostats, shoddy condensers,

1093
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,980
and dust between condenser plates.

1094
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,920
The machine gunners of the crew have their headquarters in the incorrect gridlock

1095
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,860
while the anvil chorus of the blacksmith comes from dust in the condensers and from weak batteries.

1096
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,780
But how can you test your radio for these signals?

1097
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,320
With a sledgehammer, tap your vacuum tube.

1098
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:39,380
If they emit a hollow ping sound, your vacuum tube should be replaced.

1099
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:44,700
If you have a steam-powered radio or television set, exchange it for an interoperable one.

1100
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,880
And if you have a steam-powered radio or television set, exchange it for an interoperable one.

1101
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,520
You'll be glad and you'll be marching on to eternal victory with the Church of the Subgenius

1102
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,160
in sight and color as well as in scintillating sound.

1103
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,420
Help me, please.

1104
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,400
Soon we, the doctors of the air, will have to leave you.

1105
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,180
But now, listen to these words of inspiration and wisdom.

1106
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,680
Inspiration and wisdom, friends. That's right.

1107
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,220
That's what Pastor Naked is ready to give.

1108
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,200
He's gonna play a song for us here in the studio.

1109
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,580
Right, we got the whole band. More drunk...

1110
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,320
More drunk cowboys here.

1111
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,880
And by the way, we're doing two shows this weekend.

1112
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,200
And the first one, we said a little bit about it before.

1113
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,980
The Communist Martyrs Benefit.

1114
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,520
Thursday, February 6th at the Circle A Ranch.

1115
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:31,300
That's the Twilight Room at 2111 Commerce between Central and Pearl.

1116
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,640
And you can hear bands like 2x4,

1117
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,080
N.O.Y.B., which means None of Your Business,

1118
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,100
and Underground, and of course, Reverend Buck with More Drunk Cowboys.

1119
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,680
Also, Saturday night, we're playing with an artist.

1120
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,780
Architects and Grinding Teeth, both bands from Houston.

1121
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,940
Hardcore type bands.

1122
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,020
And you'll hear More Drunk Cowboys again.

1123
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,020
But anyway, right now...

1124
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,260
Buddy, you ready?

1125
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,060
Okay.

1126
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,680
Yeah, Pastor Naked and...

1127
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,520
Reverend West here.

1128
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,940
Yeah, they're gonna go ahead and try to play a song.

1129
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,480
If we can get our equipment together, they're gonna do it live on the air.

1130
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,860
And I guess, yeah, I guess we're gonna put Tony on the...

1131
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,280
Tony's gonna play the organ now.

1132
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,060
Okay, the alien organ. Okay.

1133
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,040
Whenever.

1134
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,340
One, two, three.

1135
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,460
One, Two, Three, Four...

1136
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:25,600
The Exes have landed,

1137
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,760
Earth's UNDER...

1138
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,540
Their control,

1139
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,860
The golf station

1140
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,580
Skys proving

1141
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,680
For cities

1142
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,480
Radio-active,

1143
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:58,220
We don't know what their game is, but their name is unpronounceable.

1144
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:11,340
We don't know what they came for, but what they aim for is impossible.

1145
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,340
They are not human beings.

1146
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:23,220
In the second year before the millennium of the day of God, come Wednesday, as in the

1147
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:29,940
twinkling of night, there will come among the occultism, which are like unto thy great

1148
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,500
white brothers.

1149
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:41,120
They come as men, as graven images, as the whirlwind and as the clouds, and they are

1150
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,320
not human.

1151
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,360
Holy prophets were mingled with me.

1152
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:51,820
And hoplites were people of thee Who have landed their machines to follow

1153
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,300
in our tracks.

1154
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:05,280
God's vision stands proven, a world without slack.

1155
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,700
Oh, that was beautiful.

1156
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,980
Thank you, Pastor.

1157
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,320
Pastor, you rock!

1158
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,160
naked. We're going to try to put

1159
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,300
another one on the air.

1160
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,420
You're on the air.

1161
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,380
Hey. Praise Bob.

1162
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,260
Praise Bob. Praise the word

1163
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,540
of Bob. Or kill me. I heard that.

1164
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,400
I heard that.

1165
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,380
Yes? Yes.

1166
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,700
How can we help you in

1167
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,060
ten words or less? Can you

1168
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,880
just tell me how I can reach Bob?

1169
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,980
You, well, first... You can reach

1170
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,320
Bob through that most holy

1171
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,140
gland, your wallet. That's right.

1172
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,000
And it's right in your back pocket, and you

1173
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,940
can reach Bob by slowly unpeeling

1174
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,400
a few of those green

1175
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,800
pieces of commode paper that you hardly need

1176
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,480
anymore, and you just kind of get rid of

1177
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,900
and sending them to B.O.B.

1178
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,280
To Bob?

1179
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,220
That's right, Bob. Praise Bob.

1180
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,560
Would you like to hear the sacred P.O. box?

1181
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,880
You see, I have sold

1182
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,500
everything I own in

1183
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,080
trying to get in contact with Bob,

1184
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,360
but I still get nothing.

1185
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,420
Well, my friend, you're

1186
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,860
going at it from the wrong direction. Bob doesn't

1187
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,820
want you to be poor. He wants you

1188
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,460
to be rich. Rich

1189
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,700
beyond your wildest dreams without working.

1190
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,700
And if you don't send that money to

1191
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,500
Bob, he'll never get it. He'll never see it.

1192
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,640
He doesn't want all your worldly goods unless you

1193
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,300
have a lot of worldly goods.

1194
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,480
Uh-huh. So, what

1195
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,700
you can't... Tell him the parable

1196
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,800
of the old woman, Stang.

1197
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,480
Uh, Pastor Naked, I'm sorry,

1198
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,300
I forgot. Oh, yeah, okay.

1199
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,680
Now, see, it all depends on

1200
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,500
how much, how much,

1201
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,620
you know, you're given out of

1202
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,460
how much you got. Say a rich guy,

1203
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,140
decides, well,

1204
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,740
I'll give the church of the subgenius

1205
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,620
five dollars. Now, he ain't giving much.

1206
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,540
And then you got this old lady

1207
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,640
who, she ain't got a cent in the world,

1208
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,480
but she sends, all she's got

1209
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,560
is 50 cents. If she sends 25

1210
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,300
cents of that, we'd rather,

1211
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,560
who'd we rather have, that rich guy that sends

1212
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,640
five dollars or the poor little old lady that

1213
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,640
sends everything she has and it's only

1214
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,760
25 cents? Well, heck with

1215
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,440
the old bag. Take the money. That's what I said.

1216
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,820
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1217
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,400
Yeah, we'll go with the rich guy. We'll see you, dude.

1218
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,000
Yeah. Praise Bob.

1219
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,160
We got another one? Yeah.

1220
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,800
Hello. Praise Bob,

1221
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,480
you're on the air. Uh, I

1222
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,440
live in Garland and I deliver

1223
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,600
pizzas. I knew it.

1224
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,500
I knew it. I could tell you're a pizza salesman

1225
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,680
before you even spoke. I was reading your,

1226
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,360
uh, I was whiff reading your

1227
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,720
edge right here on the meter.

1228
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,580
Oh, they said that's

1229
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,480
true, but I never believed it. I could smell

1230
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,660
that, that pizza now steaming

1231
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,400
at me through the microphone. Go ahead, son.

1232
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,060
And I delivered a pizza

1233
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:40,720
to,

1234
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,420
to the ticket said Bob and,

1235
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,480
and it scared me and

1236
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,420
I went to the door and it was

1237
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,620
Bob. It had to have been

1238
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,680
the same Bob. Praise Bob.

1239
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,220
There is only one Bob. Bob is

1240
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,280
never changing yet. He never changes.

1241
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,540
And you know, Stang, you know, we get calls like this, like

1242
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,580
on every show it seems like we get

1243
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,420
another contact with Bob and yet out there

1244
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,280
would you believe there's a, there's a

1245
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,600
world of Dobbs atheists that don't

1246
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,480
even believe in Bob and yet we have all these

1247
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,140
contactees calling us constantly.

1248
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,700
Does Bob live in Garland?

1249
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,320
He lives everywhere. He lives in the heart and mind of all

1250
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,240
free thinking subgenius.

1251
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,900
Come on, Stang. No, he's got suburban homes in a lot of different

1252
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,220
places, a lot of different little families he likes to keep up.

1253
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,340
I think there's one right by South Garland High School.

1254
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,520
Well, we'll keep it in mind and thanks son and praise Bob.

1255
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,300
Thank you.

1256
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:27,840
Yeah, yeah.

1257
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,640
Yeah, I want to go to hell.

1258
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,380
All my friends are down there.

1259
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,120
Yeah.

1260
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:46,560
So goes a certain popular joke.

1261
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,820
Oh, yeah.

1262
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:08,480
He said, yeah, I want to go to hell.

1263
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,800
All my friends are down there.

1264
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:10,800


1265
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:10,800


1266
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:10,800


1267
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,880
All my friends are down there.

1268
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:23,160
So goes a certain popular joke.

1269
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:34,380
When the flame's at your toes, when your eyeballs melting,

1270
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,300
and you realize that this is going to go on forever.

1271
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:48,600
Maybe that's so-called quote popular joke,

1272
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:52,940
unquote only quite so funny.

1273
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,600
Oh, yeah.

1274
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,880
All your friends, their eyes will be melting, too.

1275
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,520
It'll be funny.

1276
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,060
Were the records to stop here, my son, it would indeed be a

1277
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:10,800
wonderful start.

1278
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:10,980
It's a wonderful story.

1279
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,800
But these faithful records are very careful to point out the

1280
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,100
darkest day in your life.

1281
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:22,560
It is stated here that in the year of your Lord, 1973, you

1282
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,760
turned your back upon your God and once more began to walk in

1283
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,560
your own ways.

1284
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,240
But, sir, I've come back.

1285
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,180
I've come back, sir.

1286
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,580
I'm closer now than I've ever been before.

1287
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,660
I've come back, sir.

1288
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,140
My God, I've come back.

1289
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:37,580
Yes.

1290
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,720
The record shows that in the fourth watch of your life,

1291
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,740
you returned to the fold.

1292
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,540
What an awful price you must pay for your foolishness.

1293
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:51,280
Because you turned back, you have lost your reward.

1294
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:55,560
You shall enter heaven as a servant without a single soul to

1295
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,140
your credit.

1296
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,600
You can be the moon this time around.

1297
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,520
Oh, it's unfair.

1298
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,980
It's so unfair.

1299
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,400
I've worked so hard for the king of all these years.

1300
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,860
It's unfair that I should lose all my credits now.

1301
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:06,860
Oh, my.

1302
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,400
You knew all of this before you backslid.

1303
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,800
Show him the way.

1304
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:10,800


1305
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,200
Show him his record.

1306
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:12,840
What?

1307
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,440
No!

1308
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,580
August 21st, 1973.

1309
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,720
You mean you aren't going to church again today?

1310
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,840
Babe, you know, Barney, you know this is my only day off.

1311
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,120
I don't have to live in church to be saved.

1312
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,400
Dana, if you aren't careful, you're going to miss out with

1313
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,160
the Lord completely.

1314
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,440
Come on, Kim.

1315
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:36,520
.

1316
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:40,800

1317
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,020

1318
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,520

1319

1320
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,360

1321
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:55,500
.

1322
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,540
.

1323
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:57,580

1324
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:57,600

1325
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:57,720

1326
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,220

1327
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,940

1328
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:05,980

1329
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:06,820
.

1330
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,340
.

1331
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:08,840
. .

1332
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:14,220

1333

1336

. .

1337
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:18,960


1338
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:38,300
. …

1339
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:38,320
. .

1340
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,320


1341
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,320


1342
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,320


1343
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,320


1344
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,320


1345
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,320


1346
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,320


1347
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,320


1348
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,320


1349
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,320


1350
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,320


1351
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,820
We lost another listener, friends.

1352
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,960
Another soul's damned.

1353
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,540
Oh, they're damned.

1354
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,800
We're not doing our job tonight real good, friends.

1355
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:47,480
Oh, it's sad.

1356
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,820
You know, it can be pretty risky trying to get saved on this show.

1357
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,460
Because you have never accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior,

1358
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,720
you must go to hell.

1359
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,360
Oh, please.

1360
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,720
I don't want to go to hell.

1361
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,760
I'm only 14 years old.

1362
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,900
I'm too young.

1363
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,640
I never even had a chance to be a Christian.

1364
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,300
But I'd like to be saved.

1365
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,480
Couldn't I become a Christian now?

1366
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,120
No, child.

1367
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,740
It is too late.

1368
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:25,220
But you wouldn't send a person to hell who never had a chance, would you?

1369
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:29,740
But you had an opportunity when you were seven years old.

1370
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,720
You could have called the hour of slack.

1371
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,880
Let's play those tapes for this listener and see just what she did wrong.

1372
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:36,060
Second.

1373
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:36,880
Nineteen.

1374
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:37,780
Sixty-eight.

1375
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:45,040
For as long as I've known Christ, I've tried to make him real to you.

1376
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,680
When are you going to accept him and be saved?

1377
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,620
I don't know, Cindy.

1378
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:54,540
I don't want to hurt your feelings, but religion just isn't my thing.

1379
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,380
There's plenty of time.

1380
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:02,240
You are lost and there is no place found for you except the lake of fire,

1381
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,940
prepared for the devil and his angels.

1382
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,160
Prepare.

1383
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:06,460
Prepare.

1384
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:06,980
Take her away.

1385
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,260
For the harvest.

1386
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:08,840
No!

1387
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,820
The harvest.

1388
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:10,280
No!

1389
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,080
The harvest!

1390
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:12,960
I don't want to go!

1391
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,920
You think, oh, it's a popular joke.

1392
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,580
You think it's funny.

1393
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:18,120
No!

1394
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,080
Yeah.

1395
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,120
What have I done?

1396
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:23,500
You can't hide.

1397
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,420
What have I done?

1398
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,160
You can't hide.

1399
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,000
You don't know what hell is.

1400
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,360
You don't know that.

1401
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,440
Oh, you think you know.

1402
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,000
Popular joke.

1403
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:29,580
Yeah.

1404
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,880
You think you know what hell is.

1405
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,300
You don't know what hell is.

1406
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,940
Oh, it's funny.

1407
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:36,440
It's funny.

1408
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:36,440


1409
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:36,440


1410
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:36,440


1411
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,520
There ain't no water down there.

1412
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,660
Ain't no water down there.

1413
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,880
Ain't much air either.

1414
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,340
You're going to be thinking about those days when you had so much church air.

1415
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:53,060
We thought the church air was never going to run out.

1416
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,980
You had a big popular joke.

1417
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,960
I'm spending my children's inheritance on church air.

1418
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,600
I heard that one a lot in the 90s.

1419
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,440
They thought it was funny.

1420
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,000
Funny then.

1421
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,800
It ain't so funny now, is it?

1422
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,120
Well, the conspiracy was a joke, didn't you?

1423
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,260
A joke.

1424
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,080
A joke.

1425
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:15,780
What they thought.

1426
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,300
They thought it was a joke too.

1427
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:17,840
And slack.

1428
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:18,980
Oh, yeah.

1429
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,380
Looks like a funny joke.

1430
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,240
A popular joke.

1431
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:22,760
Yeah.

1432
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:28,740
That flash of nuclear radiation seared the skin off their back.

1433
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,060
They're going, oh, is this Bob?

1434
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,920
Or is this slack?

1435
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,000
Or is this what they mean by the conspiracy?

1436
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:35,920
Is it a conspiracy?

1437
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,220
Huh?

1438
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,380
There's no manner.

1439
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,360
We are the damned.

1440
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:47,280
We switch you to the 16th tee, where we will show you in slow motion,

1441
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,880
Arnold Palmer, U.S. opium champion.

1442
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,600
I began to drive faster and faster.

1443
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:59,620
I was in lunar landscape.

1444
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:02,580
So.

1445
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:04,500
Serene.

1446
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,060
So.

1447
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,560
Calm.

1448
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:08,060
Calm.

1449
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:14,600
I drove through it with the indifference of a fly crawling over the face of the moon.

1450
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,100
Attitude corrected.

1451
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,700
Hold.

1452
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:25,180
Even though we're traveling at 23,000 miles per hour, I feel like we're floating.

1453
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:25,960
It's...

1454
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,180
Bob Meltdown.

1455
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,420
I'm here on the 7th.

1456
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:36,420


1457
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:36,420


1458
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:36,420


1459
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:36,420


1460
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:36,420


1461
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:36,420


1462
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:36,420


1463
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,660
We're on a subgenius death ship.

1464
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,700
We approach San Francisco.

1465
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,500
Our mission, destroy anything.

1466
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:44,940
Somebody help.

1467
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,340
Help me, please.

1468
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Has this ever happened to you?

1469
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,020
Meltdown.

1470
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:54,640
Please remove all humans from container area six.

1471
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,560
Be really...

1472
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,400
Doug, pull over.

1473
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,020
We gotta scrape the collar off the front of the show.

1474
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,060
If we have another collar...

1475
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:05,900
If we get another collar on the front of this show smeared like that last one, we're gonna

1476
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:06,400
be in trouble.

1477
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:06,400


1478
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:06,400


1479
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:06,400


1480
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:06,400


1481
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:06,400


1482
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:06,400


1483
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:06,400


1484
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:06,540
We're gonna be in severe heat damage.

1485
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:08,520
Well, I don't think we should drive the show so fast.

1486
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:09,220
Well, you're right.

1487
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,060
It's just stupid to keep wasting fuel running over listeners like this.

1488
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:14,500
There is no collar.

1489
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,140
There is no collar.

1490
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,520
There never has been a collar.

1491
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,560
You're listening to tape.

1492
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,180
All the collars are gone.

1493
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,540
The show was just a tape, right?

1494
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:21,860
Yes.

1495
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:22,900
Launching a probe...

1496
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,140
This joke has been real.

1497
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:28,340
Well, but they did survive and they're willing to give us their wristwatches and most of

1498
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:28,620
their...

1499
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:28,780
That's what I mean.

1500
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,620
Imagine listening to this show and surviving.

1501
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,280
That's what I mean.

1502
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:31,600
...inferior organs.

1503
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:32,420
Unfortunate.

1504
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,140
Yes, it was.

1505
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,000
We do have some...

1506
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,760
Some doctors were still here.

1507
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,040
Good morning, tiny collar.

1508
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,700
Don't drive any faster.

1509
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,220
Yes, well, it would have been nice to hear your message, but at this hour, we're asking

1510
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,060
all messages.

1511
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:43,920
Just my little...

1512
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,000
Ten minutes left to...

1513
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:45,420
Ten minutes.

1514
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,200
...rotate your message toward the war and off the planet.

1515
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,120
So aim high with us.

1516
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:56,860
Oh, friends, you can aim high, but the show does have to leave the planet.

1517
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,000
We don't even have that 10 minutes puzzling evidence.

1518
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,300
I was just promising you.

1519
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:01,960
I ought to give a little bit of...

1520
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,380
A little bit of...

1521
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,320
Oh, Buck's trying to get it out.

1522
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:07,720
I'm trying to get the...

1523
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,600
Oh, sorry, Buck.

1524
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,240
I'm trying to get the...

1525
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:14,800
He's trying to get it out.

1526
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:14,800


1527
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,260
I can't.

1528
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:15,920
I can't.

1529
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,320
I can't.

1530
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:16,840
I'm too nervous.

1531
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:17,220
Oh, no.

1532
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,220


1533
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,220


1534
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,220


1535
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,220


1536
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,220


1537
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,220


1538
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,220


1539
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,220


1540
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,220


1541
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,220


1542
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,680
All right, friends.

1543
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,720
Well, the California Show guys will say it for you.

1544
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,800
What we've been playing tonight, there's been a lot of media barrage tapes cut by myself

1545
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,320
and Reverend Byron...

1546
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,740
St. Byron Werner in California

1547
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,720
with Douglas Willman

1548
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,420
and Buzzing Evidence.

1549
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,560
You've been hearing a lot of the

1550
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,240
More Than an Hour, Less Than a Show

1551
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,380
show from Berkeley, California

1552
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,220
on KPFA.

1553
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,960
We trade shows quite a bit.

1554
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,460
We rip lines off.

1555
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,140
You were also hearing some of that

1556
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:49,660
good subgenius,

1557
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,700
that popular joke material

1558
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,260
that was the St. Jane or Hyperclates

1559
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,540
who you've heard so much about

1560
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,380
of Doctors for Bob

1561
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,740
playing with Dr. Ray Hay

1562
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:03,540
and some other show regulars

1563
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,860
from a band called

1564
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:05,720
The Swinging Love Corps.

1565
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,560
All subgenius bands get together

1566
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,320
once every equinox

1567
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:12,340
at a festival of life and love

1568
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,460
and death and hate

1569
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,720
called Dockstock.

1570
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,780
Last time we got to watch Bob

1571
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,460
crash and burn from a height

1572
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,120
of three or four miles

1573
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:20,840
like a meteor.

1574
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:22,560
Quite impressive staying

1575
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,420
and I got a little bit of Bob

1576
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:25,120
smeared on me.

1577
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,360
Takes years to watch.

1578
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,320
Wash it off, friends.

1579
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,420
Get that beautiful slack power off

1580
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,680
once you got it on you.

1581
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,420
Well, we're going to do the trade.

1582
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,040
When you finally get it right,

1583
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,460
you do so good in TFL.

1584
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,420
Oh, listen, there's the

1585
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,320
Legs of Fire theme

1586
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,600
by Mark Mothersbaugh.

1587
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,700
And you can listen to that

1588
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:50,740
while we get ready for

1589
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:52,180
the Monday morning show.

1590
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:54,000
Norm's not here.

1591
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,100
By the way, everybody,

1592
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:57,220
this show is invited to take a play.

1593
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:57,600
It's going to be at the

1594
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,180
LA next Saturday morning

1595
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:00,980
and go see Nina Hagen

1596
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,060
and her UFO church.

1597
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,220
That's right.

1598
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,680
Nina Hagen invites all subgeniuses

1599
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,060
to come to her UFO church

1600
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:08,000
in Los Angeles.

1601
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,300
All you got to do is fly out there.

1602
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:12,320
That shouldn't be any big deal

1603
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,160
for most of you.

1604
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,200
Remember, friends,

1605
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,380
there are 10,000 UFOs

1606
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,940
each 20 million miles long

1607
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:20,720
circling the Earth

1608
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,120
at any individual time.

1609
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,700
Let's all get together

1610
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,080
as we sign off

1611
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:25,900
and say boom

1612
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,180
to all our lovely,

1613
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:27,900
space burgers.

1614
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,400
You know,

1615
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,080
the ohm is the laid-back chant

1616
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,160
for those new-age sugar daddies.

1617
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:34,860
What we're into

1618
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,680
is the new squirting universe chant

1619
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,380
of huh, huh, huh, yeah, yeah,

1620
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,380
praise Bob, help me somebody.

1621
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,360
Preacher, my legs are on fire.

1622
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,140
Friends, this is the

1623
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,600
subgenius radio ministry

1624
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,260
hour of slack

1625
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:52,540
preparing to sign off.

1626
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,400
Oh, listen to that.

1627
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,860
Bye, everybody.

1628
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:56,800
Friends,

1629
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,100
and I know that

1630
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,820
you'll want to write to Bob

1631
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:02,960
at P.O. Box

1632
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:06,340
140306

1633
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:07,800
Dallas, Texas

1634
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:10,960
75214.

1635
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,540
You don't have to send any money,

1636
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,620
but you'll get a lot more pages

1637
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:16,840
per penny.

1638
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,680
Let's just put it that way.

1639
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,000
And meanwhile,

1640
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,500
do contribute to KNON.

1641
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,880
I mean, let me put it this way.

1642
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,120
The other big stations in town

1643
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,360
will let you have the time to write.

1644
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:27,740
They'll let you have slack,

1645
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,260
but they'll only let you have

1646
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,380
a minute of slack.

1647
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,920
KNON is the only one

1648
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,640
that will let you have an hour of slack.

1649
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,480
I'd like to tell them

1650
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,160
if they want to see what life would be like

1651
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:36,820
without KNON,

1652
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:37,980
just turn the channel.

1653
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:38,780
That's right.

1654
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,280
Oh, praise Bob, friends.

1655
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,900
It's so nice to be back on the air

1656
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,360
with the whole cast and crew

1657
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,160
of the hideous subgenius scary show.

1658
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,280
Good night forever.

1659
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,760
We'll let the norm creatures

1660
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,140
come in and take over

1661
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,360
and hang in there

1662
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,220
because this is going to be

1663
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:57,420
a...

1664
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,120
Oh.

1665
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,060
Well, they're here.

1666
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,760
Oh, more creatures.

1667
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:04,940
Bob, Bob.

1668
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:06,400
Yeah, yeah.

1669
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:08,620
Oh.

1670
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,000
Bob, Bob.

1671
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:12,820
Bob.

1672
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:15,760
Bob.

1673
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,040
Bob.

1674
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:17,560
Bob.

1675
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:20,720
Bob.

1676
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:21,060
Bob.

1677
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:21,060


1678
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:23,540
Bob.

1679
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:23,540


1680
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:23,540


1681
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:23,540


1682
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:23,540


1683
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:23,540


1684
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:23,540


1685
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:24,100
Bob.

1686
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:30,360
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1687
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,540
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1688
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:44,560
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1689
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,220
As you can tell, Norm is not sitting here.

1690
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,720
If you're watching on your radio, we're the ones on the far left.

1691
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,100
And what we have here tonight, say what?

1692
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:57,020
That's one of our old gags.

1693
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,500
One of your old gags?

1694
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:00,360
One of your radio gags.

1695
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,180
I don't want to get into your kinky sex life.

1696
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:08,500
Anyway, this is Monday morning, and what we're going to talk about this morning, since Norm isn't here,

1697
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,340
is what do you want to be doing in the year 2000?

1698
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:20,380
Now, the way we came across this is a week ago I resigned from a job saying,

1699
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,880
I never want to get back into the certain business again.

1700
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,260
Well, guess what? A week later, I'm just at a different place.

1701
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,640
Same business, different place.

1702
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,080
So what do you want to be doing in now 16 years?

1703
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,980
If you've got a girlfriend already, do you want to be with that person?

1704
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,360
Or if you've got a boyfriend already?
