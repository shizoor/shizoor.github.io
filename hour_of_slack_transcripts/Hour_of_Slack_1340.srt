1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:07,100
The sun is just starting to come up here at Wisteria, the end of Starwood.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:15,640
It's Sunday morning after the big bonfire and various parties in different camps.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:22,420
We actually saw people having sex in public, although they had their clothes on.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,520
That's the first time I've seen that at Starwood in quite a long time.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,780
That built my hopes.

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,100
We're now going down a trail into the Pawpaw Patch.

7
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:49,500
It's a clearing between two hills where they have built a huge fire pit and the pagans and hippies dance wildly.

8
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,320
This is apparently the place to be.

9
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,520
This is where everybody seems to have come from.

10
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,500
The main wild pagans.

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,220
It ain't dancing.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,140
Really, it's a very subdued crowd around the big bonfire.

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,140
Yeah, there's a lot more here than there is anywhere else.

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:04,580
Yeah.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,920
Okay, we have to quit being spies now.

16
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,700
Obviously, even though this is Hour of Slack number 1340 from the Church of the Subgenius,

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,040
we're back at Starwood.

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,420
Part two of our two-part Starwood special.

19
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,480
The second half of my big sermon there will come later,

20
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:38,660
as well as a tiny fraction of the dozens of bands and the hundred workshops and classes.

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,640
Not that we could attempt to do all that justice.

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,180
First, we'll hear more from the podcast Pagans Tonight

23
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,380
with hosts O'Bronzel and Ariel of the Church of All Worlds.

24
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,340
In this case, interviewing one of the folks who kick-started the Starwood Festival,

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,280
in 1980.

26
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,820
All right.

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,820
Well, our next guest is Jeff Rosenbaum.

28
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,700
And Jeff is a founding director of the Association for Consciousness Exploration, ACE,

29
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,260
which is based in northeastern Ohio,

30
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,980
and it produces events, books, and recorded media in the fields of magic, mind sciences,

31
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,860
alternative lifestyles, comparative religion, spirituality, entertainment,

32
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,000
holistic healing, and related subjects.

33
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,500
ACE was founded in 1983 by members of the...

34
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,320
The Chameleon Club, which was founded in 1978.

35
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,340
And their fictional founder, C.C. Rosenkommet,

36
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
we've got all these fictional founders in the university,

37
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,740
on the campus of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.

38
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,720
ACE is best known for hosting the annual Starwood Festival,

39
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,340
a six-day summer camping event held in July,

40
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,860
featuring live entertainment and classes on a variety of subjects,

41
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,140
including paganism, consciousness, holistic health,

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,440
and other topics,

43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,940
and the annual Winter Star Symposium,

44
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,020
usually held in February.

45
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,840
They have also created the Music Star Festival,

46
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,520
opening inner doorways,

47
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,040
and the Thing in the Woods.

48
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,500
Welcome, Jeff.

49
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,380
Nice to be here.

50
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:11,920
All right.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,320
Hi, Jeff.

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,100
So tell us about ACE and the Chameleon Club and Starwood.

53
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,920
This is the 31st Starwood.

54
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,620
That's quite a run.

55
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,020
It's been an amazing run,

56
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,960
and we're having an amazing Starwood right here

57
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,860
at Wisteria Event Campground in Pomeroy, Ohio.

58
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,440
And that's about...

59
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,340
It's about as far south in Ohio as you can get

60
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,060
while still staying in Ohio.

61
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,560
After that, you're in the Mason-Dixon land.

62
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,380
Oh, we're down there.

63
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,960
In a strange way,

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,820
we actually had to go through West Virginia

65
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,140
in order to get from Cleveland to this place.

66
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:43,740
Really?

67
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,840
You can't get there from here.

68
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,620
Your fellow Nehalese folks got here.

69
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:18,620


70
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:18,620


71
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:18,620


72
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:18,620


73
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:18,640
but it's not like awesome

74
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:18,660
But this sayingそんな

75
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:18,660


76
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:18,660


77
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:18,660


78
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:18,660


79
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:18,800
Yeah, you are awesome.

80
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,980
You are super cool.

81
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,940
I discovered anotherjob where I couldn't wish for the best

82
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:21,940


83
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,420
Our six month long trip to New York

84
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,040
that we learned so much about

85
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,780
Open Source Starwood

86
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,180
That was kind of a mistake, we've learned.

87
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,800
I don't want to get into anything terribly personal,

88
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,760
but it does remind me of certain open source that make me a bit butthurt.

89
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,920
And it brings me to this rant by my friend Synthaltimus,

90
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,340
which I'm going to read.

91
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:23,060
He actually dreamed this rant and wrote it down as soon as he woke up.

92
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,660
I wish I could do that.

93
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,740
He said, for me, being a subgenius means I get to pick and choose

94
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,460
what I want to believe in at any given time.

95
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,720
That's why we call Bob a short-duration personal savior, by the way.

96
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,520
If you get to be too much of a clinging, bobby, corny,

97
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,460
pay-bob, praise-bob, dipshit, we will butthurt you.

98
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,340
Our internet forum is a portrait of that.

99
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,960
I could be a born-again Christian one minute and a Muslim the next.

100
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't have to be.

101
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,260
I can be anything, yet I can choose to be all of it.

102
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,580
The difference between being a subgenius and not being one, being pink,

103
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,160
is not in and of itself a choice.

104
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,020
You can't choose to be a subgenius.

105
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,220
You are or you are not.

106
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,780
The $30 is only significant as a ticket purchase.

107
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,160
It is a purchase of a ticket to eternal salvation

108
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,100
or triple your money back and escape from the end of the world

109
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,260
on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses,

110
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,260
but you'll hear more of that later.

111
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,660
Most people will spend more than that just to see the latest pop star fad on stage

112
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,720
for two hours and then poof, it's gone.

113
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,620
I'm talking $30 once for eternal salvation.

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,320
Now watch some other religion come along and offer quadruple your money back.

115
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,680
You can choose not to believe in it,

116
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,840
but the average pink cannot make that choice.

117
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,700
They are forever locked into someone else's way of thinking

118
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,780
and that is what dooms them to hell on earth.

119
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,940
Being a subgenius, well, the church of the subgenius

120
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,980
is kind of like an open source religion.

121
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,020
Then I hear the voice of some smart ass pink boy heckler,

122
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,580
did he say open source religion?

123
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,900
And an outbreak of laughter until I interrupt screaming,

124
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,080
only for you pink boy!

125
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,420
It's like an open source religion where the community contributes

126
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,500
to the development of the whole,

127
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,020
but Bob Dobbs retains the copyrights to the core code found in the Bible.

128
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,020


129
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,240
It's where upgrades and modifications happen at light speed,

130
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,820
where petabytes of doctrine are written, rewritten,

131
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,740
and deleted billions of times per millisecond globally

132
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,820
and then faster than real time.

133
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,060
It's where everything you believe is true,

134
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,360
as long as the community agrees with you at that particular moment.

135
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,180
If you say something that's rejected as heresy,

136
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,840
try again in a few hours.

137
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,640
The end result must be slack!

138
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,020
Another voice appears from the imaginary crowd of people.

139
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,240
How can you possibly expect anyone to believe any of this?

140
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,960
What's your reasoning? What gives you the right?

141
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,960
I don't expect anyone to believe any of this!

142
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,100
But that doesn't mean it isn't true.

143
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,940
My reasons are my own and I have an all inclusive divine excuse

144
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,300
that clearly states I have the right.

145
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,300
Not that I ever needed it, but it's nice to see in print.

146
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,020
And yes, we do attract customers.

147
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Kooks, the church of the subgenius.

148
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,640
Man, I have developed, well, we are kooks.

149
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,040
We wait for the end of the world every year on an annual basis.

150
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,540
No one can out-kook us in that respect.

151
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:48,500
But our news groups, since the internet came along, have turned into really kook flypaper to the point where we had to kill one of them.

152
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:55,720
We had to kill alt.slack and create a members-only thing because it was filling up with trolls, literally.

153
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,200
You couldn't get through.

154
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,920
We put a robot up that always repeated alt.slack is no longer the glorious thing it used to be.

155
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,380
Now you can, if you're a card-carrying subgenius, you can go to Scrub Genius Google group.

156
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,440
I've sent many hundreds of members.

157
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,000
There's Subgenius Foundation Facebook page with 6,000 members.

158
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,640
And there's a Church of the Subgenius page with 13,000 or 14,000 members.

159
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,180
There's nothing to stop you from remaining here.

160
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,380
But unless you like toying with pinks, there's no slack to be had here.

161
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,060
Well, one of the trolls replied,

162
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,880
They are the mark of the beast.

163
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,080
And I said, the Church of the Subgenius is the beast.

164
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,780
And the troll said, using my slave name,

165
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,940
Douglas, you are a Christ-hating degenerate.

166
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,520
Sick.

167
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,080
F you.

168
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,640
And I said, I don't believe in fairy tales like Christ.

169
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,160
How can I hate something that to me doesn't even exist?

170
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,860
I don't even hate Christians.

171
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,520
I hate very few people and only those because they as individuals did me wrong.

172
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,560
The Church of the Subgenius makes fun of every type of superstition, including our own invented ones.

173
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:18,660
Although an educated person would easily see that new agers and pseudoscience are our main targets.

174
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,080
We leave Christian extremists bashing to old-timers like Saturday Night Live,

175
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,720
who started doing that in the 1970s.

176
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,040
I'm not really much of what you call a degenerate either.

177
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:36,460
My version of degenerate partying is to drink full-strength coffee and drink more than a couple of beers.

178
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:43,760
And there's some other bragging in here about how straight I really am, but I think I might skip over that.

179
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,000
I said, actually, I honestly feel real sorry for you and all the millions like you.

180
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,060
The Church of the Subgenius is, among other things, meant to help lift people up.

181
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:01,340
And it's meant to help lift people out of the morass of ignorance, intolerance, loneliness, and sadness they may have gotten stuck in through bad luck.

182
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,600
And we actually do get a lot of heartfelt letters from people who thank us for saving them.

183
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,960
And what you see at a subgenius gathering usually is a room full of people laughing.

184
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,400
And that's also what you see on a news group.

185
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,460
Making fun of foolish extremists or the casting out of false prophets is our bread and butter.

186
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,060
And folks like you provide us with the news.

187
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,060
And you provide excellent practice, which is just what I'm doing now.

188
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,000
Practicing!

189
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,740
Present company excluded, of course.

190
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,060
So, I could...

191
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:42,920
Actually, I gotta be careful about this because I promised to explain the secret origins of the New Age.

192
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,820
And I think I'll skip over this thing about paranoia.

193
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,320
What's the punchline of it?

194
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,880
I'll skip the whole rant.

195
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,780
But the punchline was, gin corrupts and absolute vodka corrupts absolutely.

196
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,800
So I've heard.

197
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,260
We'll have to do the rest of that one on the Hour of Slack.

198
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:13,760
Which can be heard weekly on many actual radio broadcast stations and anytime you want on subgenius.com.

199
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:22,300
In fact, all 1,317 of them are downloadable.

200
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,040
I'm getting kind of tired of doing that.

201
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,960
It's been going on since 1985.

202
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,700
We started in...

203
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,640
Well, the church really...

204
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:40,540
Bob Dobbs started the church when he was immaculated by the evil space alien Jehovah One in 1953.

205
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,460
But there's another cult that's a little older than us.

206
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,560
The Rosicrucians.

207
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,340
Now, this isn't really a secret.

208
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,280
I got this from a book called The Secret Society.

209
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,220
The Secret Society's Bible.

210
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,420
By Firefly.

211
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,120
No, Joel Levy.

212
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,020
And many of you may already be really familiar with this.

213
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,080
I'm going to go through this as fast as I can.

214
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,960
And I really skipped over a lot of stuff.

215
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,040
But it shocked me.

216
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,740
It really, really shocked me.

217
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,820
You know, the Rosicrucians started a long time ago.

218
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:21,280
And were the forerunners and direct ancestors of everything from...

219
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:30,460
Theosophy, down to the O.T.O., down to the latest trendy religion for people all dressed in black.

220
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:41,220
The Rosicrucians are supposedly a hugely influential secret society of Western intellectual elite who've existed since the Middle Ages and played an important part.

221
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,100
Well, you know who they are.

222
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:50,700
The existence of the Rosicrucians was announced to the world in 1614 with the publication in Germany of a document called the...

223
00:13:53,460 --> 00:14:00,120
The following year another document appeared, the Confessio Fraternitas.

224
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:07,160
And in 1616, the Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz was published.

225
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,080
I don't even know if I'm pronouncing that correctly.

226
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,580
I don't watch TV or listen to the radio.

227
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,180
I only read, so I don't know how to pronounce things.

228
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,540
Also, I'm deaf, so I've never actually heard anything any of you ever said.

229
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,460
According to the Manifesto,

230
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:30,360
the Rosicrucian fraternity had been founded by a German nobleman in the early 15th century who had taken the allegorical name of J.R. Bob Dobbs...

231
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,280
No, I mean Christian Rosenkreutz, or Kreutz, or whatever.

232
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,260
Having traveled the East in his youth and acquiring secret knowledge,

233
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,300
he gathered eight disciples to pass on his teachings,

234
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:48,620
which amounted to a wholesale revolution in every field of human endeavor that would usher in a new utopian age.

235
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,020
Well, we can see how that worked.

236
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:55,640
The Manifesto included a rousing call to arms to the weirdos of Europe

237
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,960
who were encouraged to apply for membership in this band of brothers.

238
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,240
The problem was nobody could find it.

239
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,500
It was just these three pamphlets.

240
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,580
Supposedly, Rosenkreutz set up his secret fraternity in 1408

241
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,300
and taught the secrets of nature and so forth.

242
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,260
And in the third series, the third Manifesto,

243
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:23,680
it described the adventures and tests he had supposedly undergone,

244
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,320
but it was clearly intended as a dense allegory,

245
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,200
combining alchemical symbolism with blah blah blah.

246
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,780
Any of this starting to sound familiar to you?

247
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,180
It sure sounds familiar to me.

248
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:44,960
There's a little bit more description of natural magic that they were into.

249
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,060
Science hadn't really been invented as such.

250
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,160
But natural magic was the closest they could come.

251
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,920
So that things that had...

252
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,320
Elements that seemed to have things in common.

253
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,880
For instance, since walnuts resembled the brain,

254
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,840
they could be used to treat brain maladies.

255
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,040
Sort of like the way holistic doctors should bill people.

256
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,980
A penny or less.

257
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,040
The end result would be a utopian vision in which man and society would be reformed,

258
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,980
and the world would become great and wonderful and everything.

259
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,980
Not surprisingly, it aroused hostility from government and church alike.

260
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,800
Well, that's all well and good.

261
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,760
It had a lot of alchemy and Kabbalah mixed in,

262
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,360
and Hermetic scholarship, and John Dee's writings.

263
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,540
But here's where it got scary for me.

264
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,720
Despite the publication of the Manifestos,

265
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,040
the Rosicrucians did not emerge from the shadows,

266
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,060
but remained invisible and incommunicado.

267
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,500
Public and published pleas for memberships

268
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,060
from famous alchemists like Robert Flood produced no response.

269
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,320
Who had written these things, and were they really members of a secret brotherhood?

270
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,520
Well, guess what?

271
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,720
To make a long story short,

272
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,660
it turns out it was based on a bunch of satirical pamphlets

273
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,940
making fun of the occult trends of their day.

274
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,240
This book goes into great detail on

275
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,720
the books that came before that.

276
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,340
The Fama had been based on this German thing,

277
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,500
which was obviously a satire.

278
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,660
A satire on the grand schemes drawn up by the so-called wise men

279
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,600
for the reformation of the world.

280
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,880
The other book, the presence of it, suggested that it was all a satire.

281
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,560
And in fact, the authorship of the first two remain unknown,

282
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,600
but it's accepted that a German named André,

283
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:51,320
admitted writing the third manifesto in 1603

284
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,040
as a quote, youthful literary trifle,

285
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:00,600
as a satire on the contemporary mania for the occult and the esoteric.

286
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,800
The most likely scenario is that the Rosicrucian manifesto

287
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,460
started out as an intellectual game or exercise

288
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,800
for this inner circle of weirdos and intellectuals.

289
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,740
Their intention was probably partly satirical,

290
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,760
partly inflammatory, and partly philosophical.

291
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,360
Whether they ever intended their creation to take on a life of its own

292
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,300
is impossible to say, but this is what happened.

293
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,400
Later in life, André would dismiss the Rosicrucian affair

294
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,200
as a comedy and a folly.

295
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,640
If the manifestos were nothing more than a literary parlor game,

296
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,300
why were they published and disseminated?

297
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,780
It was possibly because they were a bit too much.

298
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,240
They were not just a show of words,

299
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,820
but a way to serve someone's political ends.

300
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,140
I've been accused, by the way,

301
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,040
by various real super scholars of working for the CIA,

302
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,500
and their evidence was because we gather addresses.

303
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,740
And I had to write to the magazine where I saw that published and say,

304
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,440
don't you gather addresses too?

305
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,380
Don't, when you, in your little email program,

306
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,940
don't you gather addresses?

307
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,820
Does that mean you're selling them all to the CIA?

308
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,540
I wish.

309
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,240
I've got 40,000 of them.

310
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,600
I'd sell for a dime each.

311
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,620
Anyway, so much for that.

312
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,180
Back to the Starwood tour guide.

313
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,140
Someone was teaching intermediate advanced dumbfuck.

314
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,200
That's my specialty.

315
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,180
Oh, dumbback. I'm sorry.

316
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm getting, I miss the cave girls,

317
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,820
which I'm really sorry,

318
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,360
because I like cave girls a lot more than those kind they have in the fashion magazines.

319
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,440
They're all too skinny and plastic looking.

320
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,860
I like your stumpy, weird looking cave girls.

321
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,140
I keep encouraging my wife to stumpy up,

322
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,540
but she can't do it.

323
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,640
She's from another planet.

324
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,540
Wasn't broccoli samurai great last night?

325
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,020
Yeah.

326
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,700
I didn't know if that was a band or a martial arts thing or what,

327
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,040
but it's a great title.

328
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,280
And Waking Dream and Fat Mandy were great fun.

329
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,220
What else is in here?

330
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,200
Childbirth in America.

331
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,380
I became a grandfather for the second time recently,

332
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,900
and my new grandson, Elias,

333
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:38,080
was born in the backseat of a car going 80 miles an hour down the LA freeway.

334
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,040
And when,

335
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,280
he's the sweetest, happiest little kid.

336
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,280
He's about a year old now.

337
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,860
He's a real happy kid until you put him in a car.

338
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,500
And then he screams and screams until he's out of the car.

339
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,120
Burning the box, I would suggest spray powder Lotrimon.

340
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,800
And oh, Harvey Wasserman.

341
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,140
By the way, I'm so glad they didn't have Harvey Wasserman programmed against me,

342
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:14,300
because he's one of the people here who's got a lot of educational stuff to say.

343
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,360
He has one coming up, although that was this morning.

344
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,560
Was George Washington a gay pot smoker?

345
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,180
Well, I'm sure he was, as long as he had good pot.

346
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,900
And I heard him do another one just a minute ago,

347
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,420
Solartopian Eco-Revolution,

348
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,820
which I thought must be his science fiction lecture,

349
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,120
but turned out to be actually rather hopeful.

350
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,900
I worry about the future.

351
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,280
I worry about the future myself a lot.

352
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,360
They talk about the singularity when the computers become so smart

353
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,160
that everything gets fixed.

354
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,600
Well, I think they're forgetting the ideogularity.

355
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,640
And it's a race between the singularity and the ideogularity at every moment.

356
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,100
I have my own predictions about that, but I try not to predict too much.

357
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,900
Secrets of true meditation?

358
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,000
Not anymore.

359
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,940
So you just can't do...

360
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,220
Oh, coming up at 8 o'clock tonight,

361
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,420
Michael Murth's magic show.

362
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,900
Now, that's the kind of magic I can believe in.

363
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,900
Just so you all know, I'm the token skeptic.

364
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,840
I'm the token rationalist here.

365
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,980
And people like to make fun of me because of that.

366
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,360
But I actually do believe in magic.

367
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,420
I believe in the magic of true love.

368
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,300
I really do.

369
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,540
I didn't...

370
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,420
For 45 years, I thought it was a myth.

371
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,360
And then I found out there really was real, honest magic.

372
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,160
So if you're thinking of killing yourself, don't.

373
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,800
It might not happen until you're 50 years old,

374
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,520
but sooner or later, something's going to change.

375
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,880
You don't know the future.

376
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,840
Bob teaches us that every year.

377
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,660
Oh, and Wasserman's last lecture tomorrow is,

378
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,940
Is Barack Obama a Hologram?

379
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,920
Now, that led us to a...

380
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,800
I printed this out from the Subgenius Forum.

381
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:17,080
My friend, Dr. Legem, right after Osama bin Laden was killed,

382
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Legem said,

383
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,980
And immediately buried at sea.

384
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,340
No body.

385
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,180
Right.

386
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,120
Conveniently, on the same day Hitler died,

387
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,440
and eight years to the day after, mission accomplished.

388
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,480
If Obama had gone on TV last night,

389
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,180
and announced an invasion of space vampires,

390
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,680
I would have bought it sooner than this crap.

391
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,160
Somebody else then, Reverend Smelly Bacon, said,

392
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,840
It would be easy to disprove.

393
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,920
He and everyone around him would have every reason to disprove it publicly.

394
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,480
I think it's unlikely he's still alive.

395
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,680
It's possible, though, that maybe he died from his liver problem,

396
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,260
or some other random thing,

397
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,940
and they just found out about it,

398
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,100
so they decided to make a nice sound bite out of it.

399
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:08,480
Then there was a typo from our friend Zapanes, who said...

400
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,540
He meant to say,

401
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,040
Osama dies in bed of liver failure,

402
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,320
but he typed,

403
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,920
Obama dies in bed of liver failure isn't going to get people dancing in the street

404
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,420
or pump Obama's approval rating up.

405
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,460
And Legem said,

406
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,480
Not to take advantage of your typo, but as written, I'd have to say,

407
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,420
It might.

408
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,380
And I said,

409
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,980
I've been having the same problem in my speech.

410
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,520
I keep saying Obama when I mean Osama, mixing the two up.

411
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,220
Just as they planned it 30 years ago!

412
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,100
And Reverend Two Beans said,

413
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,220
Uh-oh.

414
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:51,640
We elected the Muslim terrorist foreigner and killed the cool black guy from Hawaii

415
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,660
who was going to give us hope and change.

416
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,040
Oops!

417
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,020
Oh, by the way, friends, if you really want a good laugh,

418
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,300
go to the Subgenius website,

419
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,980
click on the events page,

420
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,540
go to the X Day page,

421
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,960
and find the link to Dr. Legem's video.

422
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,500
He did the video where Osama, in subtitles,

423
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,060
Osama bin Laden promised, he goes,

424
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,740
Now that everyone thinks I am dead,

425
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,480
I am finally free to come to the U.S. and attend X Day.

426
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,900
I've always been a big fan of Reverend Ivan Stang.

427
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,860
That's why I wear my hair and go tea this way.

428
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,340
Um...

429
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,960
And I actually have some, uh...

430
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,360
Well, I guess I will do the political thing.

431
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,900
Somebody said,

432
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,520
I'm running a little late here. Is that alright?

433
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,200
Or, Reverend Zontar, thing from Venus, said,

434
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:53,500
Can Americans ever get enough of belligerent armchair posturing? I fear not.

435
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,360
Obama has cynically stirred the American bloodlust to ensure his own election.

436
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,720
I think that's a little harsh myself, but...

437
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,500
He has proved to be a willing tool of the military-industrial complex that truly rules our land.

438
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,460
Obama himself promised to double the military in pre-election speeches.

439
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,760
I've always considered him too right-wing in a Clinton way for my taste.

440
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:23,340
Now, um, I personally actually am the exact middle of the road, only up about 75 feet, looking in all directions.

441
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,820
But I said, um, I agree.

442
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,300
I think both of...

443
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,320
You know, I don't think Obama and Clinton as moderate Republicans.

444
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:36,980
On the other hand, it may be that such super-compromise is what it takes to inch a country forward.

445
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:44,100
Only God can force intelligence or even knowledge on people, and if He did, they'd resent it mightily.

446
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,580
I can't say as I'd blame them.

447
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:54,640
I've been saying for decades that I have faith that even without X Day, humanity will eventually reach a beautiful balance,

448
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,300
a utopia in which war hunger and environmental devastation have mostly

449
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,980
seized where humans actually do live in harmony with other plants and animal

450
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:09,120
species what few remain by that time. Unfortunately I suspect that such a

451
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,700
world will take 10,000 years to get here and in the meantime as Frank Zappa

452
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:21,040
predicted it won't blow up and disappear it'll just look ugly for a thousand

453
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,500
years and the last several thousand years were truly hideous for both city

454
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,440
and tribal humans and their slave species in general and modern

455
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,540
communications may accelerate that self-same misery by the same token real

456
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,820
knowledge will also spread faster. I personally don't expect to see either

457
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,100
the singularity or the ideogularity in my lifetime.

458
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,260
Praise Dobbs it's an endless back-and-forth struggle that goes with

459
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,420
life evolution the universe and everything.

460
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,020
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.

461
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:55,840
I hope I won't live to see a fundamentalist world order of any kind.

462
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:03,020
I worry slightly that I might. I'm more concerned about my two grandsons than I

463
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:07,720
am about me in that respect. For us computers and the internet are fairly

464
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,780
recent inventions. We both probably remember when our parents got their

465
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:16,600
first color TV set. Kids who grew up with the internet are as different from us as

466
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,180
we are from our parents who saw telephones radio and TV

467
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:25,740
go from novelties to necessities in their lifetime. Death was no doubt a

468
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,160
blessing for our grandparents who lived in a world that was almost entirely real

469
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,920
at one time. I look at death as a blessing for me and that I don't think I

470
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:40,360
want to see the world in the year 2050. I don't want to know when the last wild

471
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,280
mountain gorilla dies. Horribly enough there is a slight

472
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:50,160
possibility that I might. I'll only be 97 in that year. I've had in-laws that live in the same country.

473
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:56,200
I'm not sure if I'll live longer than that. The one I'm thinking of was miserable when she died and she had the best possible care.

474
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,520
But these dreadful thoughts friends are why the Three Stooges and old Warner

475
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,560
Brothers cartoons are so important. And on funnier days the Church of the

476
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,460
Subgenius. We're not being especially funny today and I'm going to skip over

477
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:19,560
this really grim one here and this one here. And one of our kooks

478
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:27,240
we get a lot of criticism from people who I guess you could say they believe

479
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:34,580
all our jokes and get all our lies. And this guy with a straight face said I

480
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:40,740
hate people who think they're better than everybody else. In other words I'm

481
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:47,540
better than all of you. And that kind of sums up the most common kook world view in two

482
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,380
sentences as far as I know.

483
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,280
I have uh oh I had one question for the audience was can somebody deliver the

484
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:00,320
evolution control committee's mic stands to Columbus. But we got an answer to that.

485
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:13,600
And I will cease my preaching with the true words to live by. Repent. Quit your job and

486
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,640
slack off while you still know how. You may have to get a job in order to quit it.

487
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,360
And certainly in order to buy our books but you get the other one said number two rule

488
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:34,820
question authority. There's a subject has been written for scriptures. Why? Good question.

489
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,880
Go Dr. Tim Reverend Timothy Leary used to ask that say that all the time question authority.

490
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,820
Always wondered why I questioned that. And finally friends the most important one of

491
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,940
all. Believe it or not. Bob.

492
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,140
Bob.

493
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,140


494
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,160


495
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:57,740
Is not the answer and praise Bob neither is anything else.

496
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:11,040
And that has been my good lord. But we don't have to do anything else but eat dinner. That's

497
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:17,080
the most important thing. I will be helping light that sacred bonfire down there after

498
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,340
the very last band tonight.

499
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,160
Believe it or not.

500
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:28,500
I'm married into the group that that organized this Starwood. Although I've been coming to

501
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:36,660
these for 20. This is my 21st one. And I love it. I studied the occult for many many years.

502
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:42,820
And what I learned in the end was there sure are a lot of really interesting people around.

503
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:49,000
Now does anybody have any questions I can be smart ass about. Any smart ass questions.

504
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,100
or heckling, you'll have to come up here

505
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,920
because I really

506
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,640
am seriously kind of deaf

507
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,220
and I may even need a translator.

508
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,980
Uh oh, they're all fleeing.

509
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,700
No questions for you.

510
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,580
I can hear

511
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,760
you asking if I could hear

512
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,620
you.

513
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,420
What?

514
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,140
Great.

515
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,220
What would you say

516
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,520
to someone who has difficulty

517
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,920
living in their heart?

518
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,440
Oh, what do we say to people

519
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,340
who can't let Bob into their hearts?

520
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,020
Get a job

521
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,620
and earn 30 bucks and buy that

522
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,140
damn membership pack, man.

523
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,200
You'll have Bob covering

524
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,480
your ass, or half your ass anyway,

525
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,120
you know.

526
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,540
And we do have fresh, those are very fresh

527
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,500
membership packs.

528
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,300
You get a lot for your 30 bucks, actually.

529
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,520
There's the excuse

530
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,000
that covers everything.

531
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,600
The doctorate of forbidden sciences,

532
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:44,920
yes.

533
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,840
If we buy two of them, can it cover

534
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,680
the other cheek?

535
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,940
Yes, if you buy two, that's a very good question.

536
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,100
If you buy two ordainments,

537
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,180
you can put one on either cheek

538
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,220
and you will be saved from

539
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,180
butt hurt on either side.

540
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,420
In fact, I suppose if you

541
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,220
bought, you could cover yourself

542
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,100
with them. It would be invulnerable,

543
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,260
like a ghost shirt.

544
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,960
Wait a minute, those ghost shirts

545
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,600
didn't work very well, did they?

546
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,120
No.

547
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,860
Any other?

548
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,040
Any other?

549
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,040
Yes?

550
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,500
Is it still true that you can take the face

551
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,140
of Bob and heal yourself

552
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,820
of your ailments?

553
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,300
Yeah, Mandy, Fat Mandy

554
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,400
asked, is it still true that you can take

555
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,160
the face of Bob and heal yourself

556
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,220
of your ailments? And it is true.

557
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,040
Say you are butt hurt.

558
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,500
Say you are terminally butt hurt.

559
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,340
What you do is you,

560
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,380
my partner,

561
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,360
Philo Drummond, who was the

562
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,860
other Christian Rosenkrantz,

563
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,660
who was involved here,

564
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,920
you sit on the face of Bob.

565
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,580
You could steal

566
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,760
one off the internet, but they'll come out

567
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,460
real grainy.

568
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,620
You should perhaps buy a t-shirt

569
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,380
or on our website,

570
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,620
I think we even have pillows

571
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,920
that have Bob's face on them.

572
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,840
And if you sit on Bob's

573
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,740
face regularly, your butt hurt

574
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,780
will be healed.

575
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,480
Another thing you can do is hold

576
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,980
his face up against your

577
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:14,780
lap.

578
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,300
And it's okay, boys.

579
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,400
It's not queer if it's Bob.

580
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,900
It's a religious thing.

581
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,440
And even if it was queer, there's nothing wrong

582
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,040
with that. That's perfectly fine too.

583
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,440
In fact, I'll tell you this.

584
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,380
I'm a holy man and that gives me the right

585
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,480
to tell, to say this.

586
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,440
As of this moment, you may now

587
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,440
do anything you want.

588
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,180
I should remind you there's also a thing called

589
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,360
consequences and policemen

590
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,340
have been told the same thing I just said.

591
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,580
So, you know,

592
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,600
you have to use

593
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,820
reason, I guess.

594
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,960
Slack within reason. That's the big question,

595
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,480
isn't it?

596
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:54,860
Damn it.

597
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,120
Yeah, that line about

598
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,740
your new age.

599
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,740
Get all the new age you want, but old age

600
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,360
is going to get you sooner or later.

601
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,120
Remember to exercise,

602
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,760
folks. I suggest walking

603
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,720
in the city park on nice days.

604
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,620
Who else?

605
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,860
There's got to be someone.

606
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,100
Someone must be questioning the wisdom of Bob

607
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,820
at this point.

608
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,260
Are you done yet?

609
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,220
You know what? I could probably

610
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,180
stand here for another hour, although

611
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,720
my feet are starting to hurt.

612
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,400
That would be the only thing

613
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,040
that would really force me to quit.

614
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,160
There's no other workshop coming

615
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,020
on afterwards, you know, and I need

616
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,720
material for my radio show

617
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,020
all the time.

618
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,080
What about

619
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,300
cultures that haven't met

620
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,460
J.R. Bob Knox?

621
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,120
You live somewhere where there is no

622
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,420
internet and there is no

623
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,380
radio to pick up the hour of Slack

624
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,560
and you just haven't gotten the word.

625
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,240
Will they also be

626
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,100
denied the pleasure saucer?

627
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,700
Well, sort of.

628
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,360
Dr. Hall and I had this discussion

629
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,220
during X Day. What if

630
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,440
the innocent pagan,

631
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,140
as the Christians call them,

632
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,320
the child in some foreign

633
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,300
country who never gets to hear about Jesus

634
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,220
or Bob, say

635
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,300
some kid's born in China and it's,

636
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,280
some little village, he never gets to hear about

637
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,220
Bob and yet he lives his life with Slack.

638
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,260
No, he's

639
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,340
going to fry in hell like all the rest of them

640
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,060
if he doesn't send that damn $30.

641
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,320
And I'm sorry. But he does get to go to

642
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,460
a purgatory, subgenius

643
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,260
purgatory, which is a lot

644
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,540
more fun than

645
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,520
Christian purgatory. In fact,

646
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,120
when a subgenius,

647
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,440
okay, if you're a

648
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,040
dues-paid subgenius,

649
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,000
eternal salvation or triple your money back,

650
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,160
you finally, you get to

651
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,980
live forever on your escape vessels

652
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,220
when the exes come next July

653
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,260
5th. And you can live forever,

654
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,220
but eventually, probably

655
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,120
you'll get bored of the pleasures

656
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,240
of that are possible with

657
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,500
a living body.

658
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,240
Then you, you elect to

659
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,120
die and you go to subgenius

660
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,440
hell, which is often confused

661
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,320
by the Christians with their heaven.

662
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,040
It's a lot better than most of their idea

663
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,340
of heaven. It's a little bit more like the Muslim

664
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,460
idea of heaven, only it's not virgins. It's

665
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:14,940
really,

666
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,920
really experienced prostitutes, male and female,

667
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,920
whatever you want. And, and that's just to get

668
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,540
you ready. Just the pleasure of subgenius hell

669
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,980
is merely a sort of vaccination for subgenius

670
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,320
heaven, which is so great it would kill you

671
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,520
if you were unprepared for it by undergoing the

672
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,580
gauntlet of pleasure of subgenius hell.

673
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,300
Anybody else?

674
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,420
Does Bob come to Starwood and will he be at the

675
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:44,800
bond?

676
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,640
Something about the bonfire tonight.

677
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,740
Something about the bonfire.

678
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,120
Will Bob be there?

679
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,480
Will Bob be at the bonfire?

680
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:54,100
You know, Bob, JR Bob Dobbs has mysteriously

681
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,940
appeared in several Starwood bonfires. He's not always here,

682
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,180
and I can't guarantee, in fact,

683
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,680
he showed up at X Day for about a half a minute.

684
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,800
It's funny, Bob's a lot shorter than I always thought he would be.

685
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,680
He's kind of oddly stumpy looking.

686
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:13,700
Uh,

687
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,380
to quote Jack Black, actually.

688
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,000
But he might, he might very well be there.

689
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,080
Keep your eyes open.

690
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:28,160
If he does show up and he's carrying a big golden apple,

691
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,280
please don't get in a big fight over it.

692
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,380
It really belongs to him.

693
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,600
And I think I should just let everybody go.

694
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,660
For one thing, I haven't had dinner.

695
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,720
And, you know, let's face it.

696
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,940
Slack is important.

697
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,560
Sex is important.

698
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,740
Peeing is more important than either of those.

699
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:52,300
And dinner right now is top of my list.

700
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,960
So, uh, good luck, everybody.

701
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,260
I love coming to preaching to the Starwoodians

702
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,240
because I'm not preaching to the safe.

703
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,460
I don't do this at X Day.

704
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,360
We just get up there and talk boringly about dogma and stuff.

705
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,440
I don't really rant or preach or anything.

706
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,400
They wouldn't pay any attention.

707
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,980
They heckle louder than I can talk.

708
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,540
Because they're subgeniuses.

709
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,220
Like her!

710
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,660
So, Praise Bob, thank you.

711
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,560
Starwood, again, thanks Sound Crew.

712
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,240
Thanks Ed Strange for making the pulpit.

713
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,240
You know, you get counting your blessings,

714
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,180
you, it'll just go on forever.

715
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,260
Somebody fade this thing out quick.

716
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,380
Praise Bob!

717
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,140
Praise Bob.

718
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,160
Praise Bob!

719
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,480
Praise Bob!

720
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,060
Iím selling this documentary to samples.

721
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,060
The

722
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,120
A

723
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,100
Thank you.

724
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,040
Tell us about the Saturday night thing.

725
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:28,060
I mean, the centerpiece of Starwood is the legendary, incredible, monstrous bonfire.

726
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,200
Yeah, the Starwood bonfire is pretty incredible.

727
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,920
I hear it's the largest one in the U.S.

728
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,040
It's the culmination of the event,

729
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:43,120
and we've been told by the forest rangers in the area of Starwood

730
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,780
that they can see that the bonfire is big enough to be seen from space.

731
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:48,700
Wow.

732
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,760
Ah, wow.

733
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,920
All right.

734
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,900
Actually, on a strange side note,

735
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,840
if you read the book Tripping by Charles Hayes,

736
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:05,000
it has a description of Terrence McKenna's appearance at the Starwood Festival in, I think it was, 1994.

737
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,520
I remember that, man.

738
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,260
You know, Terrence and I did a little bit of DMT together back then.

739
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,820
A little salvia de menor.

740
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,220
Yeah, we did.

741
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:13,720
It was great.

742
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,360
Well, you know, maybe that's the reason that the Starwood Festival that he described

743
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,100
is a lot more important.

744
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,720
It's more impressive than the one he actually attended.

745
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,340
That's probably.

746
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,100
That would be, it was augmented.

747
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:32,960
The bonfire that he described was 80 feet tall with flames that went 200 feet in the air,

748
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,160
and it's pretty amazing.

749
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,280
Sure it was.

750
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,560
You know, I would never argue with that, you know.

751
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,620
Beautiful.

752
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,300
Beautiful.

753
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:40,900
Beautiful.

754
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,520
Beautiful.

755
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:41,520


756
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,040
Beautiful.

757
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:43,680
Beautiful.

758
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,320
Beautiful.

759
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:44,940
Beautiful.

760
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,300
Beautiful.

761
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,620
Beautiful.

762
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,240
Beautiful.

763
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:47,580


764
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:47,920
Beautiful.

765
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,600
Beautiful.

766
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,040
Beautiful.

767
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,020
never ending is right.

768
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,840
It's gotta end sometime, seriously.

769
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,220
It's not a circle, it's a line.

770
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,260
The main thing about the event to me is that we bring in people from various cultures

771
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:18,680
and we try to bring people from those actual cultures, not just, you know, white boys who

772
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:26,620
read about Santeria and want to do a workshop or people who got into these different things,

773
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,900
Eastern mysticism or something because they thought it was cool, read about it, read some

774
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,280
books, but we try to get people from those cultures and get them to interact with each

775
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:35,580
other.

776
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:43,180
And the serendipitous discoveries that take place when you get two cultures together and

777
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,080
you come up with a third paradigm is really astounding.

778
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,280
But it's not just that.

779
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,680
We think that, you know, part of the hope for the future is not just to have these people

780
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,900
compare notes and talk with each other, but have them celebrate together.

781
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:01,520
You know, we say this is the place where shamans sit with scientists and druids drink with

782
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:01,980
deadheads.

783
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,060
Right, and everybody dances around the bonfire on Saturday night.

784
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,640
Yes, in various states of clothes or unclothed.

785
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,760
And body paint, lots of body paint.

786
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,100
And costumery of all sorts.

787
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,180
And that's it.

788
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:15,180


789
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:15,180


790
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:18,920
That's freedom.

791
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:23,900
Such a good time, await the moment.

792
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:23,900


793
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:30,360
No, leave me!

794
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,040
Oh!

795
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,220
So interesting, huh?

796
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:42,380
I'm pretty minded.

797
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:42,420
Phew!

798
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,360
with no beginning

799
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,440
and never ending

800
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,860
We are a circle

801
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,120
within a circle

802
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,340
with no beginning

803
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,480
and never ending

804
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,020
We are a circle

805
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,980
within a circle

806
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,160
with no beginning

807
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,180
and never ending

808
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,640
We are a circle

809
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,460
within a circle

810
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:17,520
Woo!

811
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,920
Ladies and gentlemen, and everybody in this meeting,

812
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,240
welcome to Puppet Hill!

813
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:45,380
We are all gathered here today at Starwood 31

814
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,460
in Wisteria, Ohio.

815
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,960
And we are currently in the planet's coolest inflatable nightclub.

816
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:00,300
My name is Pat Van D, with me here on the ceiling is my friend,

817
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,640
Matthew Tembo.

818
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:07,500
And on the hoongah is my good friend Miguel Sagay III.

819
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,500
Music

820
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,860
I remember when we used to sit

821
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,260
In the bobblin' yard of Christmas Town

822
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,060
All of the stars in the night

823
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,020
Were as hopeless as they were

824
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:52,180
No one ever knew all the means

825
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,580
The good times we had

826
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,940
And the short nights we've lost

827
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:03,180
Along the way

828
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,600
And despite future youth

829
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,260
And the fun of your past, oh

830
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,980
My heart's beating as I just say

831
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,280
No more long, long time

832
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:24,800
No more long, long time

833
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:31,080
No more long, long time

834
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,820
No more long, long time

835
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:42,820
And I remember when we used to sit

836
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:47,400
In the government guard's entrance now

837
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,860
And they told me we'd make it by a line

838
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:58,340
See what love would burn through the night

839
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,320
Then I would cook good meals for the rich

840
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,780
Oh, the rich would sit with me

841
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:10,000
Music

842
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,800
When my feet on my own can't breathe

843
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,200
When I can't do something true

844
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,920
What a joy

845
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,500
Oh, the rich would sit with me

846
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,740
Oh, the rich would sit with me

847
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,140
Oh, the rich would sit with me

848
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,920
Oh, the rich would sit with me

849
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,040
Oh, the rich would sit with me

850
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,640
And I remember that I could make

851
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:54,580
Well, as I said, now I can

852
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:58,200
I could sing

853
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,580
I could make my friends happy

854
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,780
Oh, the rich would sit with me

855
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,440
And I could convert the world

856
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,760
And take crowns for myself

857
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,020
Oh, the rich would sit with me

858
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:06,120
When ourrocks

859
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:06,120


860
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,620
Thank you.

861
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,860
Thank you.

862
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,120
Thank you.

863
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,200
Thank you so much.

864
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,380
Thank you, James and Dan from the Puffer Dome for helping me make this happen.

865
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:02,640
Thank you to our special guest, Sean, Princess Lee, Colleen, and Bob.

866
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,320
Matthew Tembo, ladies and gentlemen,

867
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:10,300
on the sarimba that he made with his own hands.

868
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:13,320
He carved every piece of this by himself

869
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,540
and flew it over on a plane to Pittsburgh from Zambia.

870
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,220
And I'm so happy he did.

871
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:23,420
Miguel Sague, a Guaracha Latin dance band.

872
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,460
In his full Taino regalia, I have never seen him in a loincloth.

873
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:34,520
And I'm so happy that he did it for us here today on the conga.

874
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:34,840
Thank you.

875
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,060
Thank you.

876
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:35,280
Thank you.

877
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:35,300


878
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:35,300


879
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:35,300


880
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:35,300


881
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:35,300


882
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:35,300


883
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:35,300


884
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:35,400
Thank you.

885
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:35,660
Thank you.

886
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,480
My name is Pat Meredith.

887
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,340
Matthew and I both have CDs for sale.

888
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,400
Please come check them out if you are so interested.

889
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,240
Take a little piece home with you.

890
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,280
Fuck.

891
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:53,920


892
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,120
Thank you.

893
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:53,580
Damn, chem toilets sure are few and far between out here in the distant field area.

894
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:58,560
I feel like I'm about to trip over fences all the time.

895
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:00,780
Tent bars.

896
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,360
There's a pee hole out here somewhere.

897
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,860
I could crawl into the woods, but then the bears would rape me.

898
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,760
I never did get raped by the bears, but I did get bumped into by my fellow torchbearers.

899
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:24,160
For some reason, they let me, the mascot skeptic, have the honor of helping to lead the parade and light the giant bonfire.

900
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,360
Let me give some credits, though.

901
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:34,420
Fat Man D is spelled P-H-A-T-M-A-N-D-E-E.

902
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,760
And she has CDs.

903
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:48,640
The podcast, Pagans Tonight, is on every Wednesday at 9 p.m. Central on Blog Talk Radio, with more information at greeneggzine.com.

904
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:54,360
This is the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius, subgenius.com.

905
00:52:54,580 --> 00:53:04,620
And also you can check out starwoodfestival.com and see various Starwood videos on YouTube, including the channel Revstack.

906
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:17,580
Subgenius.com also has extensive photo essays and just plain essays by Princess Wee and I regarding Starwood in our Devivals of Yorg section.

907
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:25,220
And now, back to St. Stymie de Bergerac, divulging secrets to Oberon Zell.

908
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:31,720
Yeah, we have a torch lighting ceremony that's like a dance with eight people holding torches.

909
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:32,660
And they...

910
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,280
To the sound...

911
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:35,300
To the sound...

912
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:35,300


913
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:35,300


914
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:35,300


915
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:35,300


916
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:39,640
To the sound of dozens and dozens of drummers who are being practiced all during the event.

917
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,380
And when the bonfire is lit, they're...

918
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,460
Actually, I'll tell you a little secret.

919
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:50,560
A bonfire that size can't really be lit by a handheld torch.

920
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:53,340
Not unless you want to sit there for hours.

921
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,160
No, no, I don't want to hear this.

922
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,820
At the same time...

923
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:05,020
At the same time as they put their torches in there, there are electronics.

924
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,540
That light it from the inside.

925
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,000
No, no, I'm so disillusioned.

926
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,940
But it's just, you know, it's an incredible culmination to the event.

927
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,900
And the bonfire dancing goes all night.

928
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,140
The whole thing does.

929
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,880
If you know, you can sleep when you're dead.

930
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:21,940
That's right.

931
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,300
That's the theme.

932
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:27,180
But I've had the chance to see people come together.

933
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:32,360
Like Timothy Leary met Halim Eldad and Jilly Smith from the band Gong at Starwood.

934
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,300
Invited them to visit with him.

935
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,680
At his house in California.

936
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,900
And I got stories back from people there that they were bar hopping and telling Starwood stories.

937
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,180
Made me feel incredible.

938
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,280
I met the woman I married at Starwood.

939
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:46,820
That's true.

940
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,800
Princess Wee Ardo, the queen of all the UFOs.

941
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,840
Here, Ian's going to say something here.

942
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:57,640
Listen, some of you folks out there, I'm sure, are actual pagans.

943
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:04,740
If you wondered what it was like in A200 B.C.

944
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:12,400
To go to a Lusus with a thousand Helene pagans and kick ass at the fire.

945
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,280
We're doing it.

946
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,540
We're doing it.

947
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,700
If you can't come this year, come next year.

948
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,480
If you can't come to Starwood, find a festival in your local area and get out the door.

949
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:32,860
Don't miss the opportunity to do what the ancients did around the fire without your trousers.

950
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,320
I'm not kidding.

951
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:38,700
Before there was radio and television, that's what people mostly did.

952
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,460
No kidding.

953
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,400
I mean, no kidding.

954
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:49,360
You could stay on the couch or you could drop your trousers and come to the nearest festival and worship like the ancients did.

955
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:49,840
That's right.

956
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,020
That's right.

957
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,240
Well, that's good for tonight.

958
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,620
And I really thank you all for being here tonight.

959
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,900
Thank you, Jeff, for this segment.

960
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,100
And also, Ian and Ivan, thank you guys for all being on here.

961
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:04,720
You're welcome.

962
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:05,240
This has been fun.

963
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,000
Thank you for joining us on Pagans Tonight.

964
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:14,780
You can hear us every night at 9 p.m. Central Standard Time right here on Blog Talk Radio.

965
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,360
Thank you.

966
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,900
Thank you.

967
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,860
Thank you.

968
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:17,280
Thank you.

969
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,320
Thank you.

970
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,600
Thank you.

971
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,260
Thank you.

972
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,540
Thank you.

973
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:53,180
Thank you.

974
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,840
Thank you.

975
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:04,500
Thank you.

976
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:05,440
Thank you.

977
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:05,900
Thank you.

978
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:05,900


979
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:05,900


980
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:05,900


981
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:05,900


982
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:05,900


983
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:11,080
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show, and we're even more glad that some listeners

984
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,000
have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

985
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,820
Not just this show.

986
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:20,040
but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

987
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:27,120
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

988
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:34,580
you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages

989
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:37,940
and help out financially as best you can.

990
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:42,300
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty

991
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:45,980
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

992
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,900
But some of you still have jobs.

993
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:55,800
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

994
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:58,200
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

995
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:07,000
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

996
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:12,840
We also take checks and money orders to subgeniusfoundation.

997
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:14,580
P.O. Box.

998
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,960
1-8-0.

999
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,340
1-8-1.

1000
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,220
4-1-7.

1001
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,280
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1002
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,880
4-4-1-1-8.

1003
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:30,180
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1004
