00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,060
Hello, this is me, but on him.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,600
And I, you know, I just want to say when I first became aware and knowledgeable of subgenius literature or the subgenius foundation,

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,780
it seemed like a mixture of science fiction and religion.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,720
You know, like it was like far fetched, a far fetched fantasy.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,500
But now in this time in which the UFOs are appearing in the sky and it's up close and personal,

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,700
that they appear at the right position at the right location in the sky,

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,100
showing that they know that you're here and they're watching.

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:37,740
You know, you know, you reevaluate, you know, those far fetched, you know, of the subgenius belief system.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,260
But now that the UFOs are appearing in the sky and it's personal.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,520
And, you know, I would just want to say that, you know, you should bring back the subgenius foundation radio ministry hour of black in this new period.

11
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,860
I stand here a victim of the influence of Emanuel Bobstein, guilty on all counts.

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:58,980
I'm glad I was caught.

13
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,800
I was mentally deranged.

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,180
Now I am cured.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,560
I ask only for you to accept my love of the subgenius power of.

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,020
Bob's balls melted my garter.

17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,960
Can I get a praise bar?

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,380
Well, that's a good one.

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,540
Raindrops on kidneys.

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,260
I can't.

21
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,060
I can't.

22
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:22,520
R reading is used in real life relativity.

23
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,920
Having enough, one feels the need to pull out his fingers and then slip out.

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:27,920


25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:27,920


26
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:27,920


27
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:27,920


28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:27,920


29
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,040
All begun.

30
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,040


31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,040


32
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,800
oh, it's just Republicans doing this and hurting me in my area.

33
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,740
I think this is good stuff up and down.

34
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,460
It's very exciting.

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,880
What do you do after the party and hurt me in my area?

36
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:43,360
You hear a lot of talk about the ecumenical movement.

37
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:51,300
They say that we should get together and all be one big family.

38
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:59,080
Catholic, Protestant, and Jew, Buddhist, Muslim, and Hindu.

39
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,780
I guess they want the devil too in the ecumenical movement.

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
I am God.

41
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,140
You are God.

42
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,400
We are all God.

43
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:20,940
Repent!

44
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,680
I am God.

45
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,560
You are God.

46
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,720
Nonsenseical!

47
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,700
We are all God.

48
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,960
I am God.

49
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,020
You are God.

50
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,240
We are all God.

51
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,160
How can you rethink the absurd?

52
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,480
I am God.

53
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,420
You are God.

54
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,640
We are all God.

55
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,140
Ditto!

56
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,940
I am God.

57
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,820
You are God.

58
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,040
We are all God.

59
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,920
Nonsensical!

60
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,360
I am God.

61
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,180
You are God.

62
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,320
We are all God.

63
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,620
Our people, we are the twisted emperor.

64
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,580
Our church is a day of full of a bunch of spiritual retards.

65
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,920
With a bunch of brain-clushing preachers.

66
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,460
And they haven't figured out.

67
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,080
This thing is for real.

68
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,760
We are in a war.

69
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,580
I am God.

70
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,340
Oh, you are God.

71
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,560
We are all God.

72
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,620
Free from danger.

73
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,780
I am God.

74
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,600
You are God.

75
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,920
We are all God.

76
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,180
I am God.

77
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,100
Oh, you are God.

78
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,320
We are all God.

79
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,460
I am God.

80
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,400
You are God.

81
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,700
We are all God.

82
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,020
Be free.

83
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,160
Be free.

84
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,340
All beings.

85
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,060
Everywhere.

86
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,800
Everywhere.

87
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,500
And I cry.

88
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,000
Free.

89
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,260
Free from physical slavery.

90
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,960
And I cry.

91
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,180
Free.

92
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,440
Free.

93
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:55,440


94
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,780
Free from physical slavery.

95
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,200
Free from physical slavery.

96
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,680
Be free.

97
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,980
We're all regularly in peace.

98
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,060
Be free.

99
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,700
Be free.

100
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,620
Be free is freedom.

101
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,560
Be free.

102
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:08,580
Be free is peace.

103
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:08,580


104
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:08,580


105
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:08,580


106
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:08,580


107
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,420
I need to get out of here.

108
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,340
The heaven is given you зар College WalkBiden.

109
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,880
Peace and happiness.

110
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,860
This is what 바� bar is called because my racism is tested everywhere.

111
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,620
Whatever you do, 커하 pigeon as X-T Long!

112
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,620
threats as X-血s and prostitutes call K mercilessness.

113
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,520
Is pushes.

114
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,100
And unless we are free of fear, peaceful and happy,

115
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,820
we cannot fully bring another to peace and happiness.

116
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,280
Not just once more with feeling.

117
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,940
If I'm my way, I will be God Almighty and just walk it off the plate.

118
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,980
Because you know as well as I do, black people are a damn, damn nation.

119
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,500
God save us, make it be safe.

120
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,920
God save us.

121
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,480
I am God.

122
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,280
You are God.

123
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,460
We are all God.

124
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,840
I am God.

00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,700
You are God.

126
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,860
We are all God.

127
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,200
I am God.

128
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,080
You are God.

129
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,060
We are all God.

130
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,560
I am God.

131
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,480
You are God.

132
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,780
We are all God.

133
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,000
Be free from the title of slave

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,720
You are God

135
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,940
We are all God

136
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,380
Be free

137
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,580
Be free

138
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,060
Everywhere

139
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,460
God of the Christian Bible

140
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,920
Death is absolutely

141
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,080
Satan

142
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,300
Satan

143
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,180
Satan

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,520

You are God

147
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,100
We are all God

148
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,900
What do you say?

149
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,040
May all beings

150
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,860
Everywhere

151
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,800
Be in need

152
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,980
To carry out their lives

153
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,220
Unless we

154
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,180
Are free of fear

155
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,960
Yes

156
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,060
I am God

157
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,080
You are God

158
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,140
We are all God

159
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,420
I am God

160
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,260
You are God

161
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,080
We are all God

162
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,340
We are all God

163
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,460
No race, power, myth, or monk

164
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,740
I am God

165
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,420
No passion

166
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,640
You are God

167
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,180
No sermon

168
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,580
We are all God

169
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,900
No chance, crime, news, candle, or hymn

170
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,180
I am God

171
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,600
No picnic

172
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,020
You are God

173
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,340
Nobody

174
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,020
We are all God

175
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,340
No dance or bingo

176
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,360
No image benign, bereaved, or crucified

177
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,500
No ordained saint or confirmed miracle

178
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,780
No literature but one book

179
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,300
And no God but us

180
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:54,220
Yes, dear friends, one book and one song there by the 180Gs.

181
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:03,540
Yes, that was indeed the 180Gs covering Negative Land's song called I Am God.

182
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,540
They sure sound different from the Negative Land originals, don't they?

183
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,200
Amazing.

184
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,040
This background music, by the way, this intro tune.

185
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,440
I heard this little music every weekday when I got home from school.

186
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,480
I know the feeling.

187
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,140
The great Icky Twerp there, friends.

188
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:40,660
He used to introduce the Three Stooges and Popeye every weekday when I was a little boy in Fort Worth.

189
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:53,820
It just brings back, it inspires me, brings back memories and inspires me to live up to the model that Icky Twerp was for all of us Twerps.

190
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:04,240
And we have a theme tonight on this hour of Slack, number 1,228, and that is the credits, which I almost forgot to say.

191
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,220
The collage just before the 180Gs from NegativeLand.com.

192
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,820
Was by Norell Preff from NorellPreff.com.

193
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,120
And pretty much everything before that was collaged by the great Fernanda Nendi, Lee Murr.

194
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

195
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,760
Princess Wee is here.

196
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:25,980
Aloha.

197
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,080
And we're going to be talking tonight about the Balloon Boy.

198
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,300
Actually, we'll be talking about the Balloon Boy's dad because we have a scoop.

199
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,640
My son, it turns out, used to work for the Balloon Boy.

200
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,980
He was the Balloon Boy's dad and had a little tale to tell.

201
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,140
We'll be telling that tale.

202
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:52,940
We also have some poetry about the Balloon Boy that was written by alt.slack individuals.

203
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,420
That's our news group.

204
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,820
You can find if you Google alt.slack.

205
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,260
Oh, there's alt.slack in the background.

206
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,300
We are.

207
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,220
It is.

208
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,840
It's that's something that Tater turned us on to.

209
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,940
It's called Leo Cupper Radio.

210
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,300
And it goes on like this for quite a long time.

211
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,040
It's it sounds familiar.

212
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,360
It sure does.

213
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,580
Yeah.

214
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,780
Leo Cupper.

215
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,060
Cupper with a C.

216
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,080
I know how they do that.

217
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,620
We know how they do that.

218
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,480
We know how.

219
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,040
This is a good one for Dave and we because Dave will be calling in.

220
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,220
Anyway.

221
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,420
On my bald hair, he likes this kind of talking too.

222
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,240
The yeah, the Balloon Boy.

223
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,640
That was big news this week, although some of our listeners may it may already be really old news.

224
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:07,220
And of course, now we know that the Balloon Boy sailing through the air was all part of a hoax by a rather nutty family.

225
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,520
And we have a great deal.

226
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,900
Of detail on just how nutty that family is.

227
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,860
Some of it hasn't made the news and some of it is is from the news.

228
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,840
Where's my little script here?

229
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,020
Oh, it's underneath my burning river roller girls catalog.

230
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,940
Yes, we have.

231
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:37,320
My son, as I say, used to work for this nut, Richard Heen and another person who used to work for the night.

232
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,120
Oh, here's the speaking of nuts.

233
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,520
I believe we have.

234
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,300
A lonesome cowboy.

235
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,360
Dave Keane.

236
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,160
Yeah.

237
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,360
Yeah, there's.

238
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,600
There's the day he blends right in with the women.

239
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,560
Can you hear the women, Dave?

240
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,300
Yes, they sound like Balloon Boy.

241
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,880
Well, the Balloon Boy's mom actually is what they they sound like.

242
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,160
Mayumi Heen.

243
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,460
I've learned a lot about this family.

244
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,980
Oh, she is considered to be what they used to call a Yoko-ish character.

245
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,480
I guess so.

246
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,180
Kind of a stern, maternal or Asiatic type woman.

247
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,400
Well, yeah, she's Japanese.

248
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,820
Not so stern, I don't think.

249
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,200
No, and we'll be hearing a recording of her calling the 911.

250
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,460
Actually, first, I'm going to read my son's description.

251
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,460
Then we'll play.

252
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,460
Then we'll read some poetry by the ladies of Alt.

253
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,380
Not Slack, including Tater.

254
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,080
I wouldn't call them ladies.

255
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,660
Well, it depends.

256
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,120
Especially not Tater.

257
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,180
They sound more like discarnate voices, but, you know, it's oblivious to a bat.

258
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:59,860
We do have the recordings of Balloon Mom and Balloon Dad talking to 911.

259
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,300
I was informed by Charleston that they called the local news stations first

260
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,360
about their disaster with their son.

261
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,400
And then called.

262
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,420
Called the emergency people.

263
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,580
Well, any peruser of media hoaxes would, of course.

264
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,580
We all could discover that at the hour of Slack.

265
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:24,560
Our noses were directly on the grindstone immediately with all the distances and proximities

266
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,080
and just the way the whole thing shaped up.

267
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,360
I was so sad to find out that it didn't happen.

268
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,660
You know, I was hoping that there really was a balloon boy soaring overhead.

269
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,300
Actually, Princess Weave, why don't you read?

270
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,940
I believe first.

271
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,880
First, there's a comment.

272
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,840
But Reverend Back It On Up, before we knew it was a hoax,

273
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,960
while we thought that the noble balloon boy was actually, well,

274
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,720
it was after the balloon had fallen to the ground and the boy wasn't in there

275
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,620
and everyone thought he had fallen out.

276
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,860
That was when the subgeniuses wrote their sick poetry,

277
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,500
as seen here by Princess Weave.

278
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,920
Reading of Reverend Back It On Up 13.

279
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,720
Teens poem.

280
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,780
Oof, somebody's gonna have a pretty traumatic time

281
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,400
cleaning the roof gutters this winter.

282
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,060
Hey, balloon boy, I think I'm falling for you.

283
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,740
It's like my head is in the clouds.

284
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,960
You make my heart soar.

285
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,800
Hey, balloon boy, no one takes me higher.

286
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,000
I feel a crash is coming, but I still want moar.

287
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,240
Dear balloon boy,

288
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,060
inflate my heart.

289
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:45,060
I'm plummeting into love, and I may disappear.

290
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,400
Sweet balloon boy, float me to paradise.

291
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,320
Watch out for the eagles.

292
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,580
I can see my house from here.

293
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,340
Certainly an objective view from a fan of the balloon boy.

294
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,540
I noticed many hearts were throbbing out there as that child soared almost into oblivion,

295
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:09,580
but he was stuck in a rude cabinet designed by his erstwhile insane father.

296
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,140
Actually, people are starting to wonder whether there was even a cabinet.

297
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,120
Although, supposedly the police searched.

298
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,520
Anyway, get this.

299
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,440
My son was watching the news.

300
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,540
Actually, he says he was doing his regular skimming of Gizmodo headlines

301
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:35,920
when he came across this crazy story about a kid who floated away in a homemade flying saucer.

302
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,420
And it turns out to be...

303
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,240
Nepotistic.

304
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:39,800
Yeah.

305
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,360
He worked for Richard Heen.

306
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,320
My son did.

307
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,920
My son is now a director in Hollywood of commercials.

308
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,980
But before he got that job, and now I'm going to read his letter.

309
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,180
And after months of searching for a job in 2002 when I first moved to L.A.,

310
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:01,980
I wound up in a desperate position at Mayumi Productions.

311
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,660
That's a nonsensical play on his Japanese wife's name, Mayumi.

312
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,360
He thought it was genius.

313
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,900
He thought he was...

314
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,260
He hired me and two of the dumbest cute girls I've ever met.

315
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:20,840
Blonde jokes don't begin to scratch the surface of the true stories I frequently retell about these bimbos.

316
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,800
He always spoke at the top of his lungs as though the building was on fire.

317
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,940
He had super serious diabetes.

318
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,780
And he slept all day long while his wife and I did the work.

319
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,420
The establishment, by the way, purported to be a post house that cut reels for actors.

320
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,600
But he had big aspirations.

321
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,040
His wife, Mayumi, was pregnant with their second kid when I worked there.

322
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,880
And she barely spoke a lick of English.

323
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,520
She was sweet and competent, but was constantly yelled at and berated by Richard.

324
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,900
And I mean yelled at and berated.

325
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,120
He would accuse her of not working and then proceed to take a nap,

326
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,100
insisting that he was brainstorming multi-million dollar ideas,

327
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,400
like his groundbreaking TV show about what can be made from cardboard boxes.

328
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:18,340
Or his book of hidden camera photography to expose the fact that people pick their noses in traffic.

329
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,620
He once showed me a self-help video for penis enlargement,

330
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:30,620
which involves tying progressively heavier weights to your member and swinging them back and forth.

331
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,080
I saw this video.

332
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:39,920
The office was a sick mess and looked like our messy childhood neighbor's living room.

333
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,520
And I...

334
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,940
Let me put it this way.

335
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,080
It would make my house look like we had a maid.

336
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,980
He had a senescent dog that urinated everywhere it went.

337
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,660
And the smell of the office did little to hide it.

338
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,740
Much of my time was spent vacuuming up his ailing dog's urine.

339
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,820
The paychecks always bounced for the two girls.

340
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,020
Whoever deposited first got paid.

341
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,560
And I always did it on my way home on payday, whereas they waited a week or so.

342
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,780
And of course, they were the ones living paycheck to paycheck.

343
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,840
At least he gave them the single parking space.

344
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,620
At the building.

345
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,820
Useful for when their broken down cars weren't doubling as smoke machines.

346
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,740
I wish I had recordings of this guy's rambling insanity.

347
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,260
But all I have left are the above memories.

348
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,860
At least now I have these fantastic news stories.

349
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,060
And apparently their episode of Wife Swap, if I can track it down.

350
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,740
Now...

351
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,540
I'm now going to play tapes involving these people.

352
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,800
For the first is a guy named Robert Thomas.

353
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,520
Who was a fellow kook of Richard Heen's.

354
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,360
Who worked with Heen.

355
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,180
And he has been tattling to the media all day about how crazy he is.

356
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,500
We have the soundtrack of the actual balloon boy moment of takeoff.

357
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,180
When the family, who are terrible actors.

358
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,540
Knowing that it's a hoax now.

359
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:05,540
Listen to these people as they lose the balloon with the boy on board.

360
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,480
And as they call 911.

361
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,780
And so forth.

362
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,540
And we may also hear from our frequent caller.

363
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,540
Bernard.

364
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,640
So just keep listening.

365
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,380
Dave, yes.

366
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,820
I was just going to say.

367
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,880
I think we could perhaps in a bit we could sum this all up to a historical perspective.

368
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,080
Because remember the old Bob and Ray bit.

369
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,100
Where the guy was building a spaceship.

370
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,400
With twine paper bags.

371
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,120
Cellophane.

372
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,640
And a cardboard box.

373
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,620
Well you don't necessarily have to remember.

374
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,340
Bob and Ray.

375
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,560
I remember that from every X day we've ever had.

376
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,440
What are you talking about?

377
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,900
You forgot the chewing gum.

378
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,400
It's the same old story.

379
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,420
Okay.

380
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,100
Here.

381
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,020
Some.

382
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,700
Listen.

383
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,760
Pay attention Dave.

384
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,460
And you'll learn a lot about the great Dick Richard Heen.

385
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,720
A lot of his intentions were driven by ego and fame.

386
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,320
And you know he had some radical ideas of how to go about doing it.

387
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:07,620
And one of those ideas is you know the concept of creating a fake UFO.

388
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,540
And you know.

389
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:19,020
Utilizing the media attention and you know the shock that it would have on the general population.

390
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,960
You know I kind of went along with it.

391
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:28,240
There was never any mention of you know accidentally leaving his children on board.

392
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,660
He would make light of the whole situation by saying hey.

393
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,820
But the controversy is what made me famous.

394
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,480
And you know I said well what did you mean by that?

395
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:39,680
And he said well you know I'm not saying that.

396
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:39,680


397
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:39,680


398
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,880
The controversy.

399
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,940
And he's like well think about it.

400
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
We were the hundredth episode of Wife Swap.

401
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,460
And why is it that we're the most recognized Wife Swap family in episode?

402
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,100
It's because of the controversy.

403
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,580
He's like I don't care what people you know say about me as a person.

404
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,400
The fact of the matter is they know who I am.

405
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,200
And I did that right.

406
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,800
Then we kind of delved into the area of UFOs.

407
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,480
And while we're talking about it.

408
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,400
You know Richard said.

409
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:15,740
How much do you want to bet we could facilitate some sort of a media stunt.

410
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,340
That would be equally profound as that of Roswell.

411
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,580
And we could do so nothing more than a weather balloon and some controversy.

412
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,780
Oh here's the actual stage disaster.

413
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,080
Ah!

414
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,840
Hold on Brad.

415
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,380
Cut.

416
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,440
Record.

417
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,040
Yeah.

418
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,320
Three.

419
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,240
Two.

420
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:39,700
One.

421
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:39,700


422
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,100
Whoa!

423
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,900
Oh my god.

424
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,500
Are you in?

425
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,080
Heather!

426
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:46,780
What?

427
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,600
Get in!

428
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,520
Put the phone in the house!

429
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:48,880
I did!

430
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,600
I did!

431
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,260
Put him in!

432
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,920
This woman and her husband stating that their six year old son.

433
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,560
They had an experimental flying saucer that they built.

434
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,840
They believe that their six year old son is in it.

435
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,000
And flying around.

436
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,920
They left on him 20 minutes ago.

437
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,640
Okay.

438
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,480
Thank you.

439
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,340
He's on the phone with you now.

440
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:10,600
Okay.

441
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:10,820
Okay.

442
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,140
Thank you.

443
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,440
Ma'am.

444
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,120
Yes.

445
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:13,940
What's your name?

446
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,160
My name is Maya Mahaney.

447
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,100
And so it was an experimental plane?

448
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,100
Yeah.

449
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,340
It's a flying saucer.

450
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,300
It's a flying saucer?

451
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:23,600
Yeah.

452
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,020
And is that, that's gone too, right?

453
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:26,940
Yeah.

454
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,640
Um, about 20 minutes I think.

455
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,040
It's been, they've both been missing for about 20 minutes?

456
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:32,860
Yeah.

457
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,720
Okay.

458
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,360
We gotta, we gotta get my son.

459
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,520
Okay.

460
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:38,620
We're gonna get him.

461
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:38,620


462
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:38,620


463
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:38,620


464
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:38,620


465
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:38,620


466
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:38,620


467
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,100
Okay.

468
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,400
Does he know how to work the flying saucer?

469
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,100
Yes.

470
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,280
I'm sorry?

471
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,940
He's the only, I think, calling somebody.

472
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:47,620
He what?

473
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,360
He's calling somebody.

474
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,980
He's calling somebody?

475
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:51,440
Yeah.

476
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,900
Who's calling somebody?

477
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,920
My husband.

478
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:55,760
Okay.

479
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,960
Let me talk to him.

480
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,800
Okay.

481
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:58,860
Hello?

482
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,920
I'm looking around the house more.

483
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,680
Hello?

484
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,360
Ma'am?

485
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:05,960
Yes.

486
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,220
Did you find him?

487
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:07,860
No.

488
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,560
Okay.

489
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:08,600
Okay.

490
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:08,600


491
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:08,600


492
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:08,600


493
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:08,600


494
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:08,600


495
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:08,600


496
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:08,600


497
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,100
I'm sorry.

498
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,460
I'm not sure.

499
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,560
I'm not sure.

500
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,240
I'm not sure.

501
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm not sure.

502
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,780
Some of the theories that Richard came up with like reptilians and these, I don't know

503
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:23,700
if you're familiar with reptilians but the whole concept is that there's these, these

504
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,740
alien beings that walk among us that are sort of shape shifters, that are reptilian in nature

505
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:35,580
and able to resemble normal human beings yet they run the upper echelon of our government.

506
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,600
You know, his obsession with, with UFOs and the, you know, the world's most mysterious

507
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:47,980
and aliens kind of led to the idea that somehow the secret government has been covering up all of this,

508
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,140
you know, since the United States was established,

509
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:58,700
and that the only real way to get the truth out there is to, you know,

510
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:05,860
basically somehow use the mainstream media to raise him to a status of celebrity

511
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,060
that he was able to communicate to the masses.

512
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:17,020
As the weeks progressed, you know, his theories kind of got more and more extreme and paranoid.

513
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:23,020
A lot of stuff surrounding 2012 and the possibility of there being an apocalyptic moment

514
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:32,260
where Richard liked to talk a lot about the possibility of the sun erupting in a large-scale solar flare

515
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,300
that would basically wipe out the Earth.

516
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:42,340
And it kind of got to the point where, you know, he was, you know, he's really pressing me

517
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,180
and kind of saying, you know, we're running out of time, we're running out of time,

518
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,320
the end of the world is coming, and, you know, we have to take necessary precautions

519
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,500
to make sure that, you know, we aren't, you know, among the majority that is going to be killed.

520
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,120
Yay, praise Bob!

521
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,860
Hello, this is me, Bernard.

522
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,600
Bernard, you know, the Subgenius Foundation,

523
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,900
the ministers, you know, are absolutely right about the conspiracy, you know,

524
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:13,000
especially those of us who have ancestors who fought in the American Civil War

525
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,880
against the federal union, because there exists a conspiratorial union

526
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,660
that I've been dealing with for a long time, since after high school,

527
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,100
even before I knew that a conspiracy of their kind exists.

528
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,260
And tonight, the UFOs are returned in the sky.

529
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,120
You know, I just wonder, wanted to know, wonder, you know, when will X-Day come?

530
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,280
Now UFOs show that they really exist.

531
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,580
They do exist, and they appear in the sky, and it's personal.

532
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,520
I mean, they appear in the sky for me, not for anyone else.

533
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,940
They appear in the sky for me.

534
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,220
Bernard, you know, seeing, you know, that I'm odd, I'm weird, I'm...

535
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,800
No.

536
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,620
Well, that's certainly not true at all.

537
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,120
You remember Bernard, our regular caller.

538
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,120
He's a saint.

539
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,020
Yeah.

540
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,680
He wears a little oak barrel around his neck, and he goes and he helps people with a fallen leaf in the snow.

541
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:11,560
Actually, on some of his calls last week, he revealed that he had been drinking during...

542
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,660
He tends to call on the weekends after 3 a.m.,

543
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,880
and he'll leave like a dozen or two dozen calls that are pretty close to identical

544
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,300
until my message machine runs out of space to record.

545
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,200
But so, it just goes to show, I mean, Richard Heen is not a...

546
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,640
Alone.

547
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,740
Well, yes.

548
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,960
That's what I was just going to say.

549
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:43,180
Heen-y, Beanie-teen-y is not an interesting concept when you view it from the perspective of St. Bernard there,

550
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:48,100
because we know in the Church of the Subgenius that the world already has ended,

551
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,440
unlike this idiot who keeps on predicting it over and over again.

552
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,620
It's already been predicted, and it's already happened.

553
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:00,260
It keeps replaying each year, and stupid events like Balloon Boy keep on happening,

554
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,580
but that's because of the disaffected masses.

555
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,180
It's subconscious...

556
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,300
Subconsciousness.

557
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:11,300
Well, indeed, it is true.

558
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,140
And here's what...

559
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,060
Listen to what Reverend Backiton-Up had to say about the masses' interest in this sort of thing.

560
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,700
She said,

561
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,980
It's kind of weird that people seem so interested in this story.

562
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,940
I only knew about it because somebody at my job went positively berserk when it hit the news

563
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,580
and ran around telling everybody to drop everything

564
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,100
and watch this amazing...

565
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,880
flying boy or whatever.

566
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,500
Something I've noticed about office people,

567
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,080
they seem always poised to get swept up in something.

568
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,920
Maybe it's just a break from the drudgery, I don't know,

569
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,160
but while I didn't give two hoots about Little Falcon and his wonderful balloon machine,

570
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,520
I watched seemingly rational person after seemingly rational person

571
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,420
get transformed into some carried-away child-care-about-her

572
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,140
like a zombie virus was passing through.

573
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,780
Oh my God, I hope he's okay!

574
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,120
Oh, if that was...

575
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,040
If that was my child, I'd be going crazy right now.

576
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,860
Somebody, I'm looking to the parents!

577
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,120
How could they let this happen?

578
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,560
All at once, like a parody of an angry mob.

579
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,120
I imagine it must have been like this in offices across the country

580
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,060
when JonBenet Ramsey got written out of the script.

581
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,380
I mean, tragically murdered.

582
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,380
Balloon Boy is the conspiracy.

583
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,640
All these exciting news stories are part of the conspiracy.

584
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,460
Dancing Baconators on top of towers with rifles,

585
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,100
a chorus line of snicker bars designed to destroy...

586
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,760
...stract me from the one important thing on Earth,

587
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,920
which I will never let myself forget,

588
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,420
Ian Anderson's tights.

589
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,640
I thought it was slack.

590
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,920
Well, and this was the big boss of this area talking,

591
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,280
Reverend Backett on that, and she has her own priorities, I'm sure.

592
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,860
Well, you can imagine, not only in an office setting,

593
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,400
but as you're driving around to different venues like malls and or coffee shops,

594
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,100
to hear these people babbling...

595
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:10,080
...as this subject continued over the airwaves for, you know, this update,

596
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,080
and this update, is the child still in there?

597
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,480
And then the disappointment of the people when the child wasn't in there,

598
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,580
and then the...

599
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,680
Well...

600
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,440
Strange, wasn't it?

601
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,480
Balloon Daddy, Mr. Heen...

602
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,800
Very astute man he is.

603
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,360
He was.

604
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,920
As a matter of fact, here's another thing my son said

605
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,360
after he read the alt.slack poetry.

606
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,460
He said, it's weird that people seem so interested in this story.

607
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,660
As a publicity stunt, the whole thing is eerily similar to a screenplay

608
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:42,500
Richard Heen wrote about a guy who escapes from prison

609
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,960
just to see his son one last time,

610
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,500
and the entire thing is told through the eyes of news cameras,

611
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,340
home video cameras, and security cameras.

612
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,900
It's all about a crazy renegade becoming famous through modern media outlets,

613
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,780
all for the noble love of his son.

614
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,360
Richard, of course, wanted to play the part of the fugitive.

615
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,680
You have to admit that done right, it's not a bad idea at all.

616
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,060
I read the script, and it wasn't half bad, actually.

617
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,440
Well, yes, of course.

618
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,560
We know the references to Charlie Manson and other people like that.

619
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,820
Mickey and Mallory.

620
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,520
And then when you think about Stephen King's inside joke,

621
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,960
all work and no playmate, Jack Adolphe Boyce.

622
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,420
And there you go.

623
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,120
He believed it.

624
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,900
Well, the funny thing is I've worked for a lot of characters sort of like that,

625
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,340
and certainly we encounter...

626
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,380
We encounter them in some genius land.

627
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,400
For instance, all the guys who think they're Bob.

628
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:43,460
I mean, there really are people out there who think they're J.R. Bob Dobbs.

629
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,700
Now, of course, one of them is, and that's the real Bob.

630
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,120
That's the problem, too, is you're pretty sure, I'm totally uncertain,

631
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,120
and I think we might have a better, much vaster grip on this than I do,

632
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:01,580
of which one of this unctuous legion of minions is actually the true Bob.

633
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,340
The actual Bob.

634
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:02,340


635
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,920
The actual slap-a-jawed avatar of Slack, you know, but...

636
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,560
The one you never hear talking.

637
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:14,860
The one that you just bought a whole lot of stuff from and don't even remember.

638
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,460
The silent black leader.

639
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,980
He's definitely not the one who's blibber-blabbering.

640
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,720
He's not me.

641
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,300
He's not you.

642
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:26,000
He's not anybody else you hear jibber-jabbering on podcast.

643
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,780
Nay.

644
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,820
But back to the more important than Bob.

645
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,140
There's Balloon.

646
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:32,620
Balloon Boy.

647
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,940
Actually, that's B-A-B.

648
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:35,740
Bab.

649
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,160
Bab-a-loon boy?

650
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,680
The Balloon Boy.

651
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,280
You could call him Bab for short.

652
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,320
Praise Bab.

653
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,220
Now, when the subgeniuses still thought that it was not a hoax

654
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:53,640
and that the balloon had come down without Balloon Boy in it because he'd fallen out,

655
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,340
our friend Tater, Reverend Tater, wrote this one.

656
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,140
I just want to ride.

657
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,820
I just want to ride in my daddy's big balloon.

658
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,180
Way up in the air in that silvery balloon.

659
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,860
I could float across the plains forever in the sky because I can fly.

660
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,260
I'm going to fly.

661
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,440
Up, up and away in my daddy's big and silvery balloon.

662
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,540
Things are getting tough in my daddy's big balloon.

663
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,880
Didn't know it'd be so tough to control this big balloon.

664
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,020
Okay.

665
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,120
Now I peed my pants.

666
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
And I'm going to cry.

667
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,540
I don't want to fly.

668
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,640
Spiraling towards the ground in this horrible, this damnable balloon.

669
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,420
Falling down head first into a chimney.

670
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,160
They'll search the whole state just to find me.

671
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:54,620
If by some chance you find a piece of me, you'll find the rest inside the fireplace.

672
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,540
You probably won't recognize my face.

673
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,340
Death is waiting there in my daddy's balloon.

674
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:02,840
Big balloon.

675
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,200
Mom pulled out her hair when they found the downed balloon.

676
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:15,020
If you'll call the child services, they'll crucify because I died.

677
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:21,860
Up, up and away in my daddy's big, my daddy's big balloon.

678
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,140
By Tater.

679
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,800
By Reverend Tater Gumfries.

680
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,680
Well, that was quite erudite as well.

681
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,960
Well, he's the editor of...

682
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,520
So many insights.

683
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,600
He's the editor of...

684
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:31,900
What?

685
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,020
What?

686
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,320
What?

687
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,320


688
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,320


689
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,320


690
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,320


691
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,320


692
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,320


693
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,320


694
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,320


695
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,840
The Kearns-Holler Science Journal.

696
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,620
Well, it is a very scientific journal, too.

697
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,180
I suppose there was supposed to be...

698
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:38,780
Oh, no, it is.

699
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,780
...a peer review and little marks at the bottom of the page saying,

700
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,500
See also.

701
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,580
Yes.

702
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,780
The Kuzla's Dictionary of 12 Obscene Signals.

703
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,520
That's right.

704
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:53,860
Paramours of Unctuous Junction by Markalew Hendry and the rest of the whole crew

705
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,340
who believed in Balloon Boy.

706
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,640
And actually, he had a separate career from that of me, Mr. Heen.

707
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:08,060
And he was paid off in silence by another group of people who wanted him to defunct the whole thing.

708
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,680
At least these are some of the insights I'm getting on the psychic connection.

709
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:20,260
I like to try and, like, focus my third nostril in, like, the same kind of direction and just see what images come in.

710
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,720
And that's what I'm getting.

711
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,680
I don't know if it needs to be...

712
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,460
Of course, it's all could be obscene BS.

713
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,120
I'm seeing people in...

714
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:36,980
And, uh, rude panties and strange artifacts dancing around in its 1890 in a heinous balloon, you know.

715
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,460
That sort of thing.

716
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,620
If anyone could psychically sync up, it would be you, Dave.

717
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,980
Hand me the spyglass.

718
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:44,760
It looks down there.

719
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,300
It looks like Stang is doing something obscene in the water down there.

720
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,220
It looks like he's playing with his giant acorns again.

721
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:51,780
Oh!

722
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,900
I only have one giant acorn left.

723
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,140
What do you mean, left?

724
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,800
That's a half-full...

725
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,920
I dress...

726
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,100
The way of looking at hinge balloon.

727
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,140
Hey, I dress to the left, okay?

728
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,860
Now, uh, Reverend Zapanaz wrote a haiku.

729
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,580
This is a very short haiku about Balloon Boy.

730
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,480
Before we knew he didn't fly or die.

731
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:23,400
A hinge balloon sounds like a communications theory on its way to merge right soon anyway, I'm sure.

732
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,200
Well, it rhymes...

733
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,080
It's kind of like...

734
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,780
Which is...

735
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:28,900
It's...

736
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,840
But, uh, let's not get lost in the dogmas.

737
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,780
Zapanaz wrote this haiku.

738
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,220
Wafting through the sky, little boy flies magically down the chimney.

739
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,560
Whoop!

740
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,700
And, uh, Princess Wee, did you have another, uh...

741
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:49,860
Yes.

742
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,040
You had one by Reverend Anna Dynamite, didn't you?

743
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,640
Yes, I do.

744
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,540
This is, uh, Reverend Anna Dynamite, who, by the way, is the long-lost daughter of Dr.

745
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,780
Todd and Legume.

746
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,220
A true story.

747
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,320
Is this also a pandamistric...

748
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,580
Pandameter...

749
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,320
Well, this...

750
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,500
Or rhymes in a double haiku?

751
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,500
No.

752
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,680
This is a real poem.

753
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,500
A poem.

754
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,280
By Anna Dynamite.

755
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,460
Took off one day, went for a flight.

756
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,160
But upon landing, he wasn't in sight.

757
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,120
Where is Balloon Boy?

758
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,460
Where did he go?

759
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,920
Up in the sky, way up high.

760
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,160
No one knows.

761
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,640
Was he in it in the first place?

762
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,540
Or did he...

763
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,160
Fall into outer space?

764
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,080
Where is Balloon Boy?

765
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,160
Where did he go?

766
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,260
Up in the sky, way up high.

767
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,580
No one knows.

768
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,100
Check your chimney.

769
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,340
Check your roof.

770
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,880
He might have fallen with a mighty oof.

771
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,520
Where is Balloon Boy?

772
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,520
Floating in the air.

773
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,840
He's the mystery of the day.

774
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,620
But tomorrow, we won't care.

775
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,700
Well, I think if we actually examine the semantics of what's being proposed here,

776
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,800
there is that the Balloon Boy himself represents a young, spirited figure,

777
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:08,180
still a youth, incapable understanding that he soon will be catapulting towards the Earth

778
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:13,300
at a speed close to the speed of sound and crushing every major organ of his body.

779
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,980
He does not feel, nor does he fear at first.

780
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,920
He's bold.

781
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,660
He wants to conquer the world in his daddy's flatulence.

782
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:26,440
He wants to leave his mark, so to speak, like a giant squirrel across the prairies of North America,

783
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,440
as his...

784
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,120
His butt expands with his knowledge.

785
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,620
Here's a public service message about children.

786
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,360
Children have a lot of questions about sex.

787
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,580
Be on the lookout for children between the ages of six months and six years.

788
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,240
Gross!

789
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,320
Very young children are easy to treat, but above all, they should be ignored.

790
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,720
Call the New York State Integrated Pest Management Program.

791
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,680
I feel better already.

792
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,980
Where was the saucer? Was it in the backyard?

793
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,980
Yeah, here, take that.

794
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,900
Uh, hello?

795
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,120
Yes, is this Richard?

796
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:01,760
Yes, it is.

797
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,960
Okay, how long has the six-year-old been missing?

798
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,380
Um, just a few minutes, um...

799
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,960
Was the flying saucer in the backyard?

800
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:08,600
Yes.

801
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,940
Okay, does it...

802
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,720
It obviously has electronics so that he can know how to work it,

803
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,720
and he gets it up off the air, off the ground?

804
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,000
No, he doesn't know how to operate.

805
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,660
He does not know how to operate.

806
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,180
So, and that's gone, though, too, right?

807
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,820
So we are sure that he's in that.

808
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,780
Yeah, we...

809
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,420
We looked everywhere, and then my son just said,

810
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,320
he said, yeah, he wouldn't try doing it before it went off,

811
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,980
because we had it tethered.

812
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,720
It wasn't supposed to take off.

813
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,400
Okay, and was it running then?

814
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,860
Well, it doesn't run.

815
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,620
It's, look, it's filled with helium,

816
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,080
and it operates off of a million volts

817
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,780
to move left and right horizontal.

818
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:43,740
Okay.

819
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,020
And we were testing it to find out what effects we could get.

820
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,320
Okay.

821
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,720
But every five minutes, it comes on for one minute,

822
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,420
and it emits a million volts,

823
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,400
and it emits a million volts on the outer skin.

824
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,100
Okay.

825
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:04,040
And if he kicks it or touches it, he could get electrocuted.

826
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:04,820
Okay.

827
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,660
Who the hell is calling me?

828
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,480
Oh, here I go.

829
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:09,900
Okay.

830
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,740
So he said it right straight for the Loveland Airport.

831
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,200
I only hope the FAA, you know, was listening to me,

832
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,480
because when an aircraft hits it, I mean, you know...

833
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,360
And is it silver in color, or...?

834
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,260
Yeah, it's...

835
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,460
It's got aluminum foil on it.

836
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,100
Okay.

837
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,640
That's how it gets its heart...

838
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,140
Okay, hang on just a second.

839
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,640
Don't hang up.

840
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,880
Sir, I'm going to go ahead, and we've already contacted the FAA.

841
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,100
They've already been aware of...

842
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:38,740
Made aware of it.

843
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,760
I'm going to go ahead and call the Loveland Airport

844
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,340
and let them know as well, okay?

845
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:44,680
Sir?

846
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,360
Hello?

847
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Hello, this is me.

848
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,980
I just want to say the continuous foundation

849
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,920
is right about the conspiracy of pink.

850
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,280
You know, the pink members,

851
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,440


852
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,440


853
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,640
in the world of society.

854
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,200
You know, I just talked to my mother,

855
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,520
and, you know, I told her...

856
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,320
Tell her that, you know, like the representatives

857
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,580
of the establishment, you know,

858
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,900
if they come to subject me to a tyranny or something like that,

859
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,500
the UFOs start appearing in the sky,

860
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:17,440
and I told her about, you know, someone coming in, you know,

861
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,840
because when something goes wrong,

862
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,580
the UFOs start to appear in the sky.

863
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,620
But every time I talk about the UFOs,

864
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,420
my mother starts to become impatient

865
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,700
and says you've got to do something,

866
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,420
or you can't do anything about it.

867
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:27,420


868
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:27,420


869
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:27,420


870
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,760
or goes into these mood swings, these hot, down mood swings,

871
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,400
whenever I talk about the UFOs.

872
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,200
And I tell her that that's part of our subgenius religion,

873
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,320
that the UFOs are going to come and take us away from here.

874
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,940
And whenever I talk about the UFOs, she does.

875
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,020
He gets cut off every time he talks about the UFOs.

876
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,100
Actually, my message machine shuts off after one minute.

877
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,500
But he always just starts this message all over again.

878
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,320
That was a fairly typical one.

879
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:01,080
I think the lad has too much of mercury oxide just underneath his scalp,

880
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,400
close enough to the implants, so that causes all this oozing to go on.

881
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,880
And then he has to express himself transphonally.

882
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,940
Well, he's a subgenius, what can you say?

883
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,580
He's definitely a dues-paying subgenius.

884
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,720
In fact, I found his application form from the 90s, late 90s,

885
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,120
when I was digging up stuff for my subgenius history class.

886
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,900
He's not a Y man.

887
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,300
He's a Y.

888
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:25,300


889
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,600
He's not a wise man.

890
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,840
He's a wise man.

891
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,680
Wise man.

892
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,160
Oh, never.

893
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,000
I ruined it.

894
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,360
I'm sorry.

895
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:37,380
Now, one of the subgeniuses that some of us may know,

896
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,560
Reverend Teeters LaVerge,

897
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,500
he read my son's account of this particular Hollywood nut, Richard Hearn.

898
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,700
And he said, yeah, LA's full of kooks.

899
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,060
One reason I like it there.

900
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,320
Hell, all of California's full of them.

901
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,300
But this type of guy is all too familiar.

902
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,800
And the funny thing is that they seem a bit strange on the outside,

903
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,740
but one can usually tolerate it in very small doses.

904
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,220
But once you get to know them, they're totally, completely insane.

905
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,340
You can have a conversation with them if you try.

906
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,780
But once they start to get into the swing of it

907
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,760
and forget to hold what little control they have over themselves,

908
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,920
then the insanity comes out.

909
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,820
And they're genuinely surprised when you tell them their art, film, thoughts, ideas, etc.

910
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,060
are not that good.

911
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,760
That is, if you can get a word in edgewise.

912
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,260
These people really live in their own enclosed world.

913
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,320
But they do seem to be able to attract and dominate others.

914
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,220
That is the creepy thing.

915
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,620
I would see this absolutely weirded out guy in Colorado

916
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,540
who thought himself a great genius immortal poet

917
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,400
and his amazingly hot 20-year-old girlfriend.

918
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,380
No problem there.

919
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,960
But once I finally got to talk to the guy and read his, quote, work, unquote,

920
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,780
I almost dishonored my pants.

921
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,200
It was so bad.

922
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,600
That it couldn't even be good bad.

923
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,100
It simply sucked.

924
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,580
And he had this young woman wrapped around his finger

925
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,680
convinced that she was honored, her word,

926
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,900
that he would take her under his wing.

927
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,160
She paid all the bills.

928
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,480
She had all the money.

929
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,240
And he stank.

930
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,040
I mean, he really smelled horrible.

931
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,800
And I don't think he was consciously using her.

932
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:19,380
He just really thought that he was the best poet alive.

933
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,480
Well, most poets stink.

934
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,100
And they don't know they're alive.

935
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,180
And some of them aren't.

936
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,820
I think, you know, we all saw the movie one time when we didn't.

937
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,460
It's real well.

938
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,920
Probably didn't see about dead poets and so forth.

939
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:32,640
No.

940
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,580
So we know that's why they smell.

941
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,560
It's because they've been decomposing for a while.

942
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,360
Well, as Zapanes said, he said,

943
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:47,620
I think people are eager to find somebody who looks like they know what they're doing to follow.

944
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,360
Well, that's the new P.T. Barnum is also like a poet then.

945
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,520
He strides out on the stage with a spurless,

946
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:59,620
two headed monkey behind him and the child with one large foot and so forth.

947
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,560
And he begins to make these grand pronouncements and stuff.

948
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,620
Suddenly, like a UFO appears above his head.

949
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:05,880
Right.

950
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,880
And it's like raining down all this, like subgenius type.

951
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,620
Well, if only.

952
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:11,920
Yeah.

953
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,540
Well, well, that's the idea.

954
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:20,500
See, and then once once we gain control over everybody's minds, we can like march him over cliffs and stuff and do things like that.

955
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,980
As long as someone wields the whip.

956
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,280
Somebody else will want to get whipped.

957
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,640
And somebody will want to watch it, too.

958
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,700
Well, you're right.

959
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,620
Well, that's me.

960
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,180
I'm the one with the video camera.

961
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,200
I'm not the one whipping or being whipped.

962
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,640
No, you're the one showing everyone flagellating.

963
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,920
You're not the selling tickets to it.

964
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:41,300
Yeah.

965
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,820
Well, you know, it's funny.

966
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:49,860
Some of the the most screwed up people I've ever known in my life had followers.

967
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,300
I don't know if I want to name names.

968
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,340
Reverend Buck naked.

969
00:44:54,520 --> 00:45:01,980
But back in Dallas, that guy, I mean, he was really, really difficult to deal with.

970
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:07,300
And yet, just because he had a sort of a an overpowering personality.

971
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,660
In other words, he never shut up.

972
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:20,500
There were these kind of wimpy geeks that would love to go to his weekly club meetings and be in his band.

973
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:23,200
And I mean, they were.

974
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,500
I hate the use.

975
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:26,380
Yeah.

976
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:26,840
Yeah.

977
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,500
That's what it is.

978
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:40,300
And I was just going to say that the church has been indeed inundated with many characters who have believed not only that they are Bob, but that they are just wimpy, deep, you know.

979
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:40,880
Yeah.

980
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,320
And stuff like that.

981
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,440
But we see this in greater life.

982
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:52,520
I remember once as a youth, there was a person who tortured everybody with his skill at the keyboards.

983
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,640
I'm not talking about anybody.

984
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,300
We currently.

985
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,500
We have known and stuff like this way back.

986
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,980
And then he would like, ha ha.

987
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:06,120
I'll never play for and say all these weird things and stuff like and people started a cult around this person.

988
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,460
And he would torment you when you were on drugs and stuff.

989
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,460
Well, are you sure you're not talking about the X-Day and Dr. Legume?

990
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:15,940
Yeah.

991
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,260
Well, not exactly.

992
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,140
He really does.

993
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,080
More like that.

994
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,220
Yeah, actually.

995
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,080
Yeah.

996
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,840
Well, it's it's it's real easy to run that mind control experiment.

997
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:33,500
And sometimes it stops being an experiment.

998
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,900
You know, I guess.

999
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,940
Well, of course, that wouldn't happen to us.

1000
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:44,700
Well, Papa Jim made everybody drink the substance, the Kool-Aid.

1001
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:51,080
I don't hate to say the phrase, but didn't Papa Jim do such a thing and was pulling with the mind?

1002
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,440
Of children while he did it for the national mediums.

1003
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,620
Mm hmm.

1004
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:10,580
And that much the same way that Mr. Science, this new program is allowing his three year old daughter to fly to Zanzibar and a hastily built tin can design tuna fish thing.

1005
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:20,940
We saw a music video today that those that Richard Hearn made out of his home movies starring his three kids.

1006
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:25,360
It's called Pussification or we're not Pussified.

1007
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,340
That's the name of the.

1008
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,900
No more Pussification or something like that.

1009
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:34,520
And it was dumb.

1010
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,300
Dumb.

1011
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:41,320
I mean, I say this as a subgenius, as a as somebody who knows they're a subgenius.

1012
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,800
Even to me, this seemed really dumb.

1013
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,240
Twice as dumb as most dumb people are.

1014
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,500
It struck me as a way to.

1015
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:57,200
Have your kids forever be marked with the dumbness of of you, the dad.

1016
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:06,560
Now, you notice that I haven't been mentioning my son's actual human street name because I don't.

1017
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,100
I haven't.

1018
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:15,780
I dragged my kids into the church of the subgenius by way of old tapes they made when when they were four or five.

1019
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,520
And I used to mind control them like Richard Hearn does.

1020
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,460
And actually, they just.

1021
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,960
I never asked them for anything.

1022
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:22,880
They would volunteer.

1023
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,320
They'd go, hey, hey, let me.

1024
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,760
I've got a little Bob riff.

1025
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,600
And they'd come in and go, if you don't love Bob, he's going to kill you.

1026
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,880
He Bob you out.

1027
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,360
So in my cult, it was like the kids.

1028
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:45,200
It would be would have been the kids idea to actually jump in the flying saucer and fly away and get dad in trouble.

1029
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,540
Or it wouldn't be me.

1030
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:50,360
I'm in the flying saucer going, kids, let me die.

1031
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,740
Oh, if I told my kid to do something like that, he would have said no.

1032
00:48:54,580 --> 00:49:01,240
Oh, and if I said I want you to lie to the media that so that from now on, you'll always be known as the balloon boy.

1033
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,080
And you'll you'll be laughed at whenever you ask anybody out on a date.

1034
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,600
So go, aren't you Falcon Heen?

1035
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,280
The balloon boy.

1036
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,840
Your dad's the dumbest idiot in the world.

1037
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,320
I bet you thought he was great.

1038
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,180
Well, just think of it this way.

1039
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,720
You're the dumb dad who exposed your son is the one who exposed Heen.

1040
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,940
Well, you know, the sad thing is there's some other guy.

1041
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,260
There was another on his resume forever.

1042
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,380
Thanks to you.

1043
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,560
That's what I'm saying.

1044
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:30,040
I haven't mentioned the kid's name.

1045
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:30,800
Have I?

1046
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:31,840
No.

1047
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,060
And he found it next thing.

1048
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,120
Ignat.

1049
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,460
No, no.

1050
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:37,880
Eat.

1051
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:39,700
Eat.

1052
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,860
It does sound like it next.

1053
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,020
It Nats.

1054
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:43,960
It Nats.

1055
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,420
But it's it Nats.

1056
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,120
It Nats.

1057
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:47,340
Yeah.

1058
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,820
Go ahead and look it up on the Internet.

1059
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,340
And see what happens.

1060
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:50,340


1061
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,120
It's got the hard sound after the soft sound.

1062
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,320
Don't care.

1063
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:55,900
So.

1064
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:02,800
But then again, you've had so many offspring from your delusive, absolutely tyrannical

1065
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,520
episodes in what?

1066
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:11,120
Bum, bum, bum, someplace in the Middle East and stuff and Dobbs town with the dalliance.

1067
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:11,480
Yeah.

1068
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,620
And they weren't all my offspring weren't all born of woman.

1069
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,040
And they weren't all born of human.

1070
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,320
No.

1071
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,600
Or of humus either.

1072
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:20,200
Well.

1073
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,560
Well, sometimes that was fun.

1074
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,660
But Princess, we pointed out that we have a couple more molded, you know, into different

1075
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,900
shaped children.

1076
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:28,280
Yeah.

1077
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,060
That's what's staying.

1078
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:33,680
You just you guys just remind me of why didn't they have the old alchemist run out to the

1079
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,520
street and grab the guy that, you know, the crier and stuff, say, Hey, my homunculus just

1080
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,400
got my six.

1081
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,240
My poor little homunculus balloon.

1082
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:44,400
Wait a minute.

1083
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:45,840
Yeah.

1084
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:46,680
Why didn't he?

1085
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,200
Yeah.

1086
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:47,700
Yeah.

1087
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:47,700


1088
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:55,060
Well, here's here's a really artistic poem that back it on up.

1089
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:55,920
I love those.

1090
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,420
Princess, we will we'll now read back it on up other point.

1091
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,080
Read it like Percy Dovetonsils in the old Ernie Kovacs stage.

1092
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:13,280
I'll try two roads diverged in balloon boy's way and sorry, he could take each path.

1093
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:17,100
One involved homework, lunch and play.

1094
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:25,940
The other a deadly balloon crash up in the air where the airplanes go dancing on rainbows,

1095
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:34,880
chasing birds, riding on spaceships, tasting snow in an aircraft invented by amateurs or

1096
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:41,860
going home to cheap cartoons, bullying brothers, household chores, and both that morning equally

1097
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:45,380
lay the options of adventure or endless bores.

1098
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,080
The drudgery of the day.

1099
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:52,200
The sky is begging aolos calls.

1100
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,440
He doubted if he should ever come back.

1101
00:51:55,620 --> 00:52:01,600
Imagine the sites he sees as he falls somewhere miles and miles.

1102
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,160
Hence the earth racing up to him fast as light.

1103
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,900
Thanks for not watching me, mom and dad.

1104
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,280
That has made all the difference.

1105
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,520
In the land.

1106
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,060
Here's the last part here.

1107
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:17,060


1108
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:17,060


1109
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:17,620
Last poem.

1110
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,520
This one's, again, by Reverend Tater Gumfries.

1111
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,060
Le dernier poème.

1112
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,460
This one's fairly short.

1113
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,640
Shall I compare thee to some flattened clay?

1114
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:35,200
This is about the balloon boy after he fell, in theory.

1115
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:35,700
That was it?

1116
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,240
No.

1117
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,920
Shall I compare thee to some flattened clay?

1118
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,220
Thou art more bloody and more grievously bent.

1119
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,120
Rough winds did shake that damned balloon today.

1120
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,740
And parents' good advice to infrequent lent.

1121
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,060
Sometime too hot desires of youth do shine.

1122
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,560
And often are their aspirations dimmed.

1123
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:01,260
When from bright skies their silver orb declines.

1124
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:05,060
By chance or nature's changing downward wind.

1125
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,460
But thy eternal memory shall not fade.

1126
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,140
Not once state's child services are called.

1127
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,840
Nor shall your death be deemed sufficient pay.

1128
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:20,080
When fame is gained by nailing daddy to the wall.

1129
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:25,120
So long as Fox and CNN can make sufficient hay.

1130
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:30,140
So long will your poor family be screwed another day.

1131
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,440
Ain't that sweet?

1132
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,440
Balloon boy.

1133
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,660
Balloon boy.

1134
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,100
It is balloon!

1135
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,520
Balloon boy.

1136
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,000
I think it'd be a great idea for manga.

1137
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,040
Remember golfer boy?

1138
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:54,800
No.

1139
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,060
You remember like that early manga golfer boy?

1140
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,100
And he would like tee up and...

1141
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,800
The humongous golfer boy?

1142
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:01,840
Golfer Soros?

1143
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,380
There was a manga golfer boy.

1144
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,000
I can't remember the actual Japanese name.

1145
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:10,920
But he would tee up and he would hit the golf ball into the bad guy's head.

1146
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:11,960
Or body part.

1147
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,440
Whatever.

1148
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:16,020
He would chase bad guys around with a golf club.

1149
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:16,720
And a ball.

1150
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,140
Them folks was having a ball.

1151
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,020
Yes.

1152
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,060
They was having a ball.

1153
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:25,740
So I was thinking if balloon boy could go around apprehending criminals.

1154
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,700
And same martial arts.

1155
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,260
Sadus or shimpus.

1156
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:32,600
Sekupus.

1157
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,940
Who are gone astray and so forth.

1158
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,800
If he could jump on them and stuff with his baroon.

1159
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:38,620
And you know.

1160
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,400
And stuff like that.

1161
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:40,660
Yeah.

1162
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,160
He'd have like a whole lot of different armaments.

1163
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,880
You know.

1164
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,100
Have like a ball.

1165
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,280
A whole ray of knives across his breast.

1166
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,380
And around his hips.

1167
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,160
He would have like perhaps 12 shotguns and stuff like that.

1168
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,980
And he'd have like a paralyzing nuclear ray.

1169
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,560
That would come like.

1170
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,960
It would appear to come out of his forehead.

1171
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,540
But would really be a secret helmet.

1172
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:03,460
What the hell are you going on about?

1173
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,360
Who?

1174
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,160
Who are you talking to?

1175
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,100
Dave.

1176
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,760
As you heard by the climacting music there.

1177
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,520
That which.

1178
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:15,120
That was witch disco at Starwood.

1179
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:15,960
I'm sorry Dave.

1180
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:16,820
Oh well.

1181
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,620
Was it really really wonderful?

1182
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:19,660
Yeah.

1183
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,460
Well it was in the background.

1184
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,980
But it was witch disco at Starwood.

1185
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,900
And in fact all the background music was noise from Starwood.

1186
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,560
Here's some crazy Starwood noise.

1187
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,740
Yeah we're all puppets.

1188
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,360
Yeah we're like puppets.

1189
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,360
Yeah we're like puppets.

1190
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,180
Oh yeah.

1191
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,100
We're all puppets.

1192
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,300
Yeah we're all puppets.

1193
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,780
Yeah we're like puppets.

1194
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:42,820
Yep.

1195
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:42,860


1196
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:43,100
Yep.

1197
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,120
Yeah we're like puppets.

1198
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:45,840
Oh yeah.

1199
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:49,040
And so Dave we must actually end this show.

1200
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,100
Because it's like four or five minutes till.

1201
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,440
I can hear the mandrills barking.

1202
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,680
And I must till for the tier men.

1203
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:03,920
And make room for synesthesia if they ever get here.

1204
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,720
Don't we need to know if Dave has any parting words of gems to drop?

1205
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,320
Did you just part?

1206
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:16,080
No I was just thinking of a model of the universe that was like a sphincter or a big piece of gems.

1207
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:20,780
I was just thinking of a small skeleton that had different marshmallows in it and each one is positively and negatively charged.

1208
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:26,380
And then at the same time simultaneously although they're like photons could be in the same place.

1209
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,920
They were arguing with each other.

1210
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,920
They were like real fierce and so forth like that.

1211
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:34,560
And then this thing was kind of like Planck's constant or something like that.

1212
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,800
Only it was it was Heen's balloon.

1213
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,520
It's like a whole theory and stuff.

1214
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,140
And it was like a media theory.

1215
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:45,980
And the idea was break the story before it exists and then make up for it afterwards.

1216
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,260
Because publicity is more important than anything.

1217
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,920
As J.R. Bob Dobbs said there's no such thing as no PR.

1218
00:56:54,660 --> 00:57:03,580
And friends you have been listening to the hour of slack number 1228 with Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1219
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,900
What's me jelly bush?

1220
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,700
Princess we are dope.

1221
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,480
Oh yeah.

1222
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,900
And yours truly Reverend Ivan Stang.

1223
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:16,060
You can learn if you want more about the Church of the Subgenius by simply going...

1224
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,900
to subgenius.com.

1225
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,240
Or if you're in a car instead of a computer you can go to P.O. Box 141...

1226
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,060
What is it?

1227
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:31,680
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1228
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:40,580
And now I'm going to play to get us out a little song by Little Theodore.

1229
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:45,860
Actually it's a big song by Little Theodore from his new album Peace is Boring.

1230
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,580
This particular album is called...

1231
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:53,160
I mean the song is The Natural Progression of Life.

1232
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:58,680
And we'll hear it 13 seconds after this Norrell Preff cut.

1233
00:57:58,820 --> 00:57:59,420
Praise Bob.

1234
00:57:59,540 --> 00:57:59,920
Good night.

1235
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,760
Hello I'm Tony Perkins on a diet.

1236
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:02,820
Looking in the mirror.

1237
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,480
It doesn't mount to a hill of beans.

1238
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,680
In other words Tony Perkins cuts.

1239
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,920
An average family gets serious about coffee.

1240
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,680
Soon we're the one fuck bush buck no.

1241
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,560
But it's nothing. Cup of O.R.G.

1242
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:31,020
You won't hear the ringing in your ear.

1243
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:36,400
You won't feel the pain in your knee.

1244
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:41,960
You won't care who's done you wrong.

1245
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,060
You won't worry that you've wasted your time.

1246
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,580
You won't feel that you've wasted all your time.

1247
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:53,060
It's the natural progression of life.

1248
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,540
It's the way it ends up.

1249
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,580
For I thought.

1250
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:04,140
You won't know what shows get cancelled.

1251
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,460
You won't know who wins the big game.

1252
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,940
You won't know who wins the next election.

1253
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:20,400
You won't know who starts the next war.

1254
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:25,920
It's the natural progression of life.

1255
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:32,680
It's one thing we all have in common.

1256
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:36,740
You won't know what they say about you.

1257
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:42,320
You won't know what they say about us.

1258
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:47,720
You won't know who was right, who was wrong.

1259
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,160
You won't know who's dancing on your grave.

1260
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:58,640
It's the natural progression of life.

1261
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:05,340
It's just the way it has got to be.

1262
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,620
It's the natural progression of life.

1263
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:15,100
It's the natural progression of life.

1264
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,760
It's the natural progression of life.

1265
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,400
Nothing will ever matter to you again.

1266
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:26,080
The natural progression of life.

1267
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:29,620
Hmmmmmmm.

1268
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,060
Hmmmmmmm.

1269
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,740
Hmmmmmmm.

1270
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,580
Hmmmmmmm.

1271
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,060
Hmmmmmmm.

1272
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,880
Hmmmmmmm.

1273
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,860
Hmmmmmmm.

1274
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,180
Hmmmmmmm.

1275
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,520
Hmmmmmmm.

1276
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,480
Thank you.

1277
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,300
Hmmmmmmm.

1278
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,160
And you.

1279
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:05,160
