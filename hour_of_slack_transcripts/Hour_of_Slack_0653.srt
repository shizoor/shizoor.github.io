Remember,

18

Remember,

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:48,840
Remember,

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,540
Remember,

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,420
We're sitting together listening to this...

22
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:55,860
Remember,

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,380
Remember,

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:57,900
Remember,

25
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,580
We're sitting together listening to this...

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,520
This was present.

27
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:15,120
Remember, remember, remember, we're sitting together listening to this.

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,540
And this was pleasing to God.

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,180
Oh, yes, dear friends.

30
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,340
Actually, we should start that one from the...

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,940
Let's just listen.

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,460
Ah, yes, dear friends.

33
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,120
And since I'm mixing all by myself, I'll have to...

34
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,180
Oh, no wonder that wasn't working.

35
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,940
I was mixing by myself the wrong mix pots down there.

36
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,400
We'll just bring that down and bring me...

37
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,880
I was never brought up right, you know.

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,960
But now I am upright.

39
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,940
I will be upright with you.

40
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,640
Good audience.

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,020
And this, of course, is in the background.

42
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,500
Frank Zappa's classic Peaches and Regalia.

43
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:40,180
Beautiful, beautiful piece of music that many of us old folks cut our teeth upon.

44
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,100
And, you know, we don't play much Frank Zappa on the Hour of Slack.

45
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,360
And it's because Frank Zappa...

46
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,700
May very well be what led you here if you're over 30.

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,400
And, you know, what we'd like to do for Bob is to lead you on to the next thing.

48
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,300
Help the next poor sucker down the line, as Frank himself said.

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,800
And recently, I was given to hear of a conversation.

50
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,160
Actually, something I picked up off the Internet.

51
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,320
In which someone had been griping on alt-fan Zappa or something.

52
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,040
About how...

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,420
Oh, you know, it's so sad.

54
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,440
Frank's dead.

55
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,520
And Captain Beefheart only does paintings now.

56
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,120
And they...

57
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,480
What is...

58
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,860
What is there left?

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:36,400
And Zug's Rift, our fellow minister and great musician, Zug's Rift, responded that...

60
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:44,140
Well, you know, buddy, it's not like there aren't other musicians floating around there.

61
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,340
I mean, are you just as conservative as that guy that can't...

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,880
Listen to anything but Led Zeppelin now that he's 45 years old?

63
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,700
You know, yep.

64
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,940
Frank's dead as a doornail.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,740
And the captain has gone on to other things.

66
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,000
And he's not going to make any more music.

67
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:07,880
But, friends, have you bothered to seek out that Rudy Schwartz project CD?

68
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,620
Or that Zug's Rift CD?

69
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,620
That Kings of Feedback?

70
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,680
That Silica Gel, Reagan's Pollock?

71
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,780
Uh...

72
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,160
Or even Swinging Love Corpses?

73
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,000
Or Doctors for Bob?

74
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,600
Have you?

75
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,180
Have you?

76
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,960
Well, friends, I was thinking about that.

77
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,520
And this is going to be our nepotistic Friends of Stang music show.

78
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,360
But don't be afraid, because...

79
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,020
Old Reverend Stang has some very talented friends.

80
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,620
Um...

81
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,340
So, it will be a musical show.

82
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,080
A musical show, indeed.

83
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,200
Of just...

84
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,340
You know, people might complain that...

85
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:47,340


86
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:47,340


87
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:47,340


88
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:47,340


89
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:47,340


90
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,140
Well, I sent my tape to Reverend Stang.

91
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,840
And it's true that it was unlistenable.

92
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,740
And I did not put any label on it.

93
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,180
And I did mention in my handwritten note on the napkin that it probably sucked.

94
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,180
But he never played it on his show.

95
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,160
He only plays his friends.

96
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,980
Well, here's why.

97
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,680
Here's why.

98
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,360
Here's why.

99
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,360
Here's why.

100
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:13,520


101
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:13,540
Here's why.

102
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,000
Here's why.

103
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,260


104
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,260


105
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,260


106
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:15,440
Here's why.

107
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:15,440


108
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:15,440


109
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,120
Here's why.

110
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,980
Here's why.

111
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,420
Here's why.

112
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,540
Yeah.

113
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,560
Yeah.

114
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,680
Yeah.

115
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah.

116
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,960
Yeah.

117
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,420
Yeah.

118
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:45,420


119
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:45,420


120
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,360
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, dog!

121
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,520
Pee dog!

122
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,620
Bob is lucky, not smart.

123
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,680
That's for puke from people like you.

124
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,320
Would you F-I-B to the FBI?

125
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,860
Would you tell to them a dirty lie?

126
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,160
Everything was internet alright.

127
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,900
Would you F-I-B to the FBI?

128
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,440
Would you tell to them a dirty lie?

129
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,860
I think I'll have some apple pie.

130
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,920
I think I'll have some apple pie.

131
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,500
I want to be a guy in a machine of high quality.

132
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,660
I'm a genius, I'm a genius, I'm a genius.

133
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,020
I'm a genius, I'm a genius, I'm a genius.

134
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,540
Slowly slipping, going by the waves.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,520
Metaphorically speaking, that is.

136
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,660
Bob is lucky, not smart.

137
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,900
In fact, by the perverted conspiracy standards of intelligence,

138
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,260
he is gifted with incredible stupidity.

139
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,080
He lives in a perpetual state of contracted consciousness.

140
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,640
This enables him to act without thinking,

141
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,480
to surf effortlessly,

142
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
on the luck plane,

143
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,980
to float down the fabled path of least resistance.

144
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,920
In fact, to make a million dollars every time he screws up.

145
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,680
A catatonic stupid

146
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,980
Where do you think you're been?

147
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,620
A catatonic stupid

148
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,120
You know you'll never

149
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:07,560
again

150
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,080
Cole, what are you doing?

151
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,480
Cole, how are you doing?

152
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:14,580
Hey man.

153
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,260
Hey, how's it going?

154
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,180
I brought you some tape.

155
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,480
Oh, you brought me some tapes?

156
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:22,860
Yeah.

157
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:23,920
Oh.

158
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,760
From bearing gifts.

159
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,880
Oh, Jesus comes in bearing gifts.

160
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,160
From St. Andrews.

161
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh, oh.

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,640
Oh, jeez.

163
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,980
What's that noise?

164
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,560
Feedback from my great presence.

165
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,240
I guess either that or my little headphones.

166
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,100
Tray full of lab mice.

167
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,480
Tray full of, now this is what it's like, friends.

168
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,920
We're on the air, by the way.

169
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,440
Uh-oh.

170
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,300
To see, I've been sitting here, I've been playing, this is a show of nepotistic friends of ours music.

171
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,660
Like Joe Newman, Zug's Riff, Negative Land, you know.

172
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,400
No, it's too late.

173
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,460
Oh, now is that my Bryce CD?

174
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:58,840
Oh, Bryce.

175
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,720
Oh, okay, good.

176
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,700
I was worried about that.

177
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,480
Okay, well what is this new CD?

178
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,400
Um, that's a, uh, Numersonic.

179
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,500
Frequencies of the Beast.

180
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,380
Oh, look at the titles on this.

181
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,920
Hippie Freakout.

182
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,860
The Mark of the Beast.

183
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,120
Creature Double Feature.

184
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,520
Martian Girlfriend.

185
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,160
Greetings Earth.

186
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,560
Hey, I wonder if these are X Day.

187
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,240
This some, some, you know what it might be.

188
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,000
Let's see what this letter is.

189
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,540
Tray full of lab mice.

190
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,920
Dear Ivan, I worship you.

191
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,080
I once contributed my little Jesus being crucified on telephone poles collage.

192
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,420
So he's the one who did that.

193
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,760
You must immediately play Numershonik on your show.

194
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,860
Practically the whole album is your cup of tea if you ever steeped a bag.

195
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,540
I also enclose Unbunny, which may not include, uh, appeal to your fine sensibilities.

196
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,320
Okay, here, Numorphonic.

197
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,580
Make Unbunny and Numershonik household names by tomorrow noon.

198
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,440
My telex operators await your instructions as we just hatched our label yesterday.

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,840
I'll make the press kit short.

200
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,620
Unbunny just put out his first album.

201
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,360
He drives a flower delivery truck.

202
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,140
I guess...

203
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,720
It says Goiter Boy is the one to use if I use any of them.

204
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,720
But now the second CD.

205
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,940
Numershonik is the band.

206
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,660
Frequencies of the Beast is the album.

207
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,420
The lead singer is a credit to dementia, having been certified homeless.

208
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,000
Get the, we got another one!

209
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:37,720
We got another, this is like a, um, the ultimate, quote, outsider artist and schizophrenic for the last 20 years.

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,220
Yet he's not just a novelty act.

211
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,940
He improvises wildly funny lyrics and sounds like Elvis with a sore throat.

212
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,200
The opening song, Hippie Freakout, will be the smash hit of the album.

213
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,220
Most of the profits go to Paul's coffee fund.

214
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,020
Well, I was just telling that we only played stuff by our friends.

215
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,960
But now, here's proof that if somebody sends us something wild enough...

216
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:00,980
We don't even know this guy.

217
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,000
We've never even heard this.

218
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,560
Friends, we, we have...

219
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:03,880
I hope it's, I hope it's clean.

220
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,240
You're hearing it for the first time just as we are.

221
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Well, we are on tape, so...

222
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,860
You know, I'm lying, but...

223
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,800
I need to get my ass off too.

224
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,580
Okay.

225
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,520
Uh...

226
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,380
Here it is.

227
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,720
Hippie Freakout.

228
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,140
Thinking about a bunch of hippie in the parking lot.

229
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,220
All set out there ready for a bout.

230
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,680
I says, hey you fellas, you better be careful because someone's gonna holler.

231
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,540
And we're sure gonna start there.

232
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,800
And we're all gonna shout.

233
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,320
And there's no doubt about it.

234
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,020
Someone's gonna call the cops.

235
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,840
One guy said no.

236
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,860
And I said, hey, mind your business, friend.

237
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,180
This is none of yours.

238
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,100
I said, well, I'm aware of that.

239
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,640
But I'm trying to be concerned for you and what's gonna happen if you get caught.

240
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,020
So it doesn't really matter.

241
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,980
One way or another, they didn't seem to care.

242
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,160
I says, hey, listen, you guys.

243
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,700
Don't you realize that we all out here sitting out in the front chair.

244
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,360
So there was a bunch of hippies.

245
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,820
Yeah.

246
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,220
Hippie Freakout.

247
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,820
It's all set to go out there in the parking lot.

248
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:09,820


249
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:09,820


250
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:09,820


251
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:09,820


252
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:09,820


253
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,320
They didn't get ready to do themselves a part.

254
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,500
So there was this young lady.

255
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,840
I took a look at her.

256
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,680
I said, ho, ho, give me a drag or two.

257
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,880
She says, hey, get away from me.

258
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,860
I don't want nothing to do with you.

259
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,460
She took a shot in her arm and I could see.

260
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,260
I says, hey, you're getting rather kind of dizzy.

261
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,580
She says, hey, hey, you can kiss where the sun doesn't shine.

262
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,080
I says, hey, don't tell me that.

263
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,780
Get to work.

264
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:39,780


265
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:39,780


266
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:39,780


267
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:39,780


268
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:39,780


269
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:39,780


270
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:39,800
Get to work.

271
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,220
She says, hey, you can do the things on time.

272
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,480
She just starts shaking.

273
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,240
She starts wiggling, going from side to side.

274
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,500
She says, hey, come on over here.

275
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,100
You want to be my guy.

276
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,240
I says, hey, what makes you think that I'm any different from you?

277
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,300
Because I have a clean hair cut.

278
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,060
Well, friends.

279
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,220
And I just don't seem to know what to do.

280
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,240
She says, hey, man.

281
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,580
I don't know what to do either.

282
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,580
Lift that reefer.

283
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,040
Smoke it strong.

284
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,420
Pump that old needle up your arm.

285
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:09,780
I says, hey, man.

286
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:09,780


287
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:09,780


288
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:09,780


289
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:09,780


290
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:09,780


291
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:09,780


292
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:09,780


293
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:09,780


294
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,840
I says, oh, yeah.

295
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,240
I surely will.

296
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,360
She says, hey, brother, have a drink.

297
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,920
Have another or two.

298
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,920
This is one thing I want you to do.

299
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,440
Well, friends.

300
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,920
We have no idea whether this song goes on for another hour or two or what.

301
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,920
It is definitely a hippie freak out.

302
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,420
Do you believe that your mind, you are confused at this particular time?

303
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,700
Do you believe that you seek guidance, understanding?

304
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,420
Do you think of yourself as being somewhat mentally ill, physically ill?

305
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:39,560
Do you know that you could be a better person?

306
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:39,560


307
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:39,560


308
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:39,560


309
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:39,560


310
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:39,560


311
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,540
Do you think that your drinking problems were really, really the cause of the troubles after all?

312
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,820
Do you really think that your life was...

313
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:52,780
Now...

314
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,960
Yeah, go ahead, Paul.

315
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,620
My outer space machine

316
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:09,900
The woman with the eyes so big and bright

317
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,880
My outer space machine

318
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,060
The woman that has to come through in disguise

319
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:31,360
Is yours, my outer space machine

320
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,420
Oh, friend.

321
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,500
This show, thanks to Jesus, is a strange show.

322
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,840
We got a bit sidetracked there into some hippie freakouts

323
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,200
when Jesus suddenly, right in the middle of being nepotistic,

324
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,040
Jesus showed up with some tapes or CDs from strangers

325
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,460
and I went and played them anyway

326
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,360
just when I was trying not to be democratic.

327
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,980
I was trying to just stick to my buddies

328
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,900
and the graft and grifting of...

329
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,140
Oh.

330
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,520
Price Bob Joe Newman

331
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,300
and the Rudy Schwartz Project.

332
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,440
Oh, yes.

344
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,520
The reason we've come here today is to take a look at your hedges.

345
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,600
I'm going to take a look at your hedges.

346

360
00:21:49,320 --> 00:22:02,600
Everybody's wondering why the president's a dumbass that's talking like he's got a big, skinny, old, fish-flappy, round-in-his-skull-and-defendant-git-call-in-the-part-of-the-brain-that's-supposed-to-make-the-president-know-that-he-ain't-supposed-to-go-to-Japan-and-Bombing.

361
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,820
But at the dinner table, make yourself a damn fool.

Green, yellow, green, gold.

365
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,740
Jack-o'-jack-o', jing-jing.

Green, yellow, green, gold.

00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,360
Jack-o'-jack-o', jing-jing.

368
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,300
Nigga, if we're gonna, help me out.

369
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:54,220
Sing, oh, daddy, oh, daddy, oh, mammy, oh, mammy, oh, peppy, oh, grammy, oh, grammy, oh, grammy, daddy, daddy, mammy, mammy, peppy, peppy, peppy, peppy, peppy.

370
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:13,840
Shimmering, shimmering, whoa-ho, daddy, oh, heart, privately.

371
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,580
alltidи.

372
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,140
mother.

373
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,240
A day affect my soul.

374
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,920
dag religiously.

375
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,560
Apart from the joy we return to it back to place we belong again.

376
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,620
I was alive after my heart lost his mind.

377
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:22,720
The day alighted in my heart

378
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:22,720


379
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,060
Night, night, I'm in anger.

380
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,380
Red India At night, the moon täll пуne,

381
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:32,600


382
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:32,600


383
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:32,600


384
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,800
I'm having a heart attack!

385
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,260
Can't be the same till I get my baby back!

386
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,640
She's gone and left me broken hearted!

387
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,580
Came to stay but now we've parted!

388
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,380
Like a transcontinental island!

389
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,800
Burning, floating across the seven seas!

390
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,520
Causing the crust to form a set of delicate bacteria!

391
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,540
Shoot it in a mustard keg!

392
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,800
Her lemon made a beautiful sunset!

393
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,980
She's gone and left me, what shall I do?

394
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,600
She got back to her residence on Sunset Boulevard!

395
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,100
Where the residue of her lemon shined through!

396
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,980
Like a business stoned by a medfly!

397
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,860
Went thrown up into a baby!

398
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,760
And floated way up in outer space!

399
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,020
Like a Jules Verne hot air balloon!

400
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,320
Jacob Barney to the dollar!

401
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,700
He's bled to tiny town and all his little friends!

402
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,480
Visiting from Starsdale!

403
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,180
That's why I'm having a heart attack!

404
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,660
Can't be the same till I get my baby back!

405
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,560
She's gone and left me broken hearted!

406
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,380
Came to stay but now we've parted!

407
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,260
Like a transcontinental island!

408
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,320
Burning, floating across the seven seas!

409
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,960
Causing the crust to form a set of delicate bacteria!

410
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,020
Shoot it in a mustard keg!

411
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,180
Her lemon made a beautiful sunset!

412
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,240
She's gone and left me, what shall I do?

413
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,920
She got back to her residence on Sunset Boulevard!

414
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,340
Where the residue of her lemon shined through!

415
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,020
Like a business stoned by a medfly!

416
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,540
Went thrown up into a baby!

417
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,120
And floated way up in outer space!

418
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,820
Like a Jules Verne hot air balloon!

419
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,900
Jacob Barney to the dollar!

420
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,840
He's bled to tiny town and all his little friends!

421
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,020
Visiting from Starsdale!

422
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,600
Causing the crust to form a set of delicate bacteria!

423
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:32,600


424
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:32,600


425
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:32,600


426
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:32,600


427
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,360
She's gone and left me, what shall I do?

428
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,620
She's gone and left me, what shall I do?

429
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Don't worry, I'm leaving!

430
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,560
Rockin' out with my b Raisa!

431
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,680
Let her live like a Mars ball but don't let me take him in my body!

432
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,660
She's gone and left me, what shall I do?

433
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,280
Taking my heart from Bud andra!

434
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,600
Ambassador Holler requires a real��자!

435
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:14,220
Dear friends, that heart attack there by the great Zug's Rift and his amazing poo-poo heads is one way to call that man.

436
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,520
And this is also Zug's in the background.

437
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:26,080
I'm about to give the address of Dr. Zug's Rift and also the address for Joe Newman, okay?

438
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:33,100
And so you know who to write to for the uncensored versions of these self-same tapes.

439
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:43,060
Zug's Rift, got that pencil ready, is at P.O. Box 18765.

440
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,260
That's Box 18765, Encino, California.

441
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,660
Encino, California.

442
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,220
9-1-4-1-6.

443
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:07,980
Yes, that's Box 18765, Encino, California.

444
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,480
9-1-4-1-6.

445
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:24,100
And to get information about the CDs and tapes of Joe Newman's Rudy Schwartz Project, that is P.O. Box 4542.

446
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:32,140
P.O. Box 4542 in Austin, Texas.

447
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,000
78765.

448
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:43,160
Yes, friends, it's P.O. Box 4542, Austin, Texas.

449
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,900
78765.

450
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:56,060
For Joe Newman and I, yes, while I'm at it with this great music in the background, I probably ought to also give the background post-award.

451
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,060


452
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,120
Office Box Number 4.

453
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,000
Bob, yes.

454
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,080
And if you haven't memorized it by now, you will.

455
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,220
It's P.O. Box.

456
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:07,860
Box.

457
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,700
1-4-0.

458
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,060
3-0-6.

459
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,420
In Dallas, Texas.

460
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,260
7-5-2-1-4.

461
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,740
Box.

462
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,300
When I say the word start, the test will begin.

463
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,340
Are you ready?

464
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,460
Start.

465
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,960
When was the last time you had your hearing checked?

466
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,460
I would advise him to learn to lip read.

467
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,820
Insert earplugs now.

468
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,700
Watch out!

469
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,040
Watch out!

470
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,540
Watch out!

471
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,900
It's not what I'd like to listen to, but I don't think I should be able to tell the other

472
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,720
people what they can or can't listen to.

473
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,100
Deafness is not only uncool, it's endurable.

474
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,960
I'm short on hearing.

475
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,300
Call now and receive a coupon for a free hearing test.

476
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,260
Guaranteed, you won't hear any of this music on elevator.

477
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,700
It's rock and roll!

478
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
He's got you in love.

479
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,240
You suspect a hearing loss, so I thought nothing could be done about it.

480
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,380
Ask your family doctor.

481
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,720
Feel your ear drums explode!

482
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,120
This concludes this hearing test.

483
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:46,880
Thank you!

484
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,120
Thank you!

485
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,320
I'm not going to be locked for everything they've based their life on for life.

486
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,420
Dodgy, my freaking salvation!

487
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,420
According to your beautiful ideals, I'm supposed to crawl away somewhere and die, so that you

488
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,280
and Bob can be friends.

489
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,180
Ah, there you are.

490
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,560
Bob, we were afraid you wouldn't get here.

491
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,320
Got here as soon as I could.

492
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,320
Oh, Julie?

493
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,540
Say, what is this whole thing all about?

494
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,860
I'm glad you're dealt the other way now, Dodgy.

495
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,280
Yeah.

496
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,620
Now listen to me...

497
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,040
Dodgy!

498
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:45,800
What?

499
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,060
How lucky I am, how lucky I am!

500
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,280
What a wonderful day!

501
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,280


502
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,280


503
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,260
To have someone like you

504
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,240
Someone I know is gonna be my friend

505
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,420
From the beginning right to the end

506
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,820
How lucky, lucky, lucky I am

507
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,700
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, baby

508
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,520
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Robert darling

509
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,640
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby

510
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,660
Angel of the package, the child of love

511
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,900
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby

512
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,080
Saturday night

513
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,400
In the name of the chiefs of the door

514
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,100
No, no, no

515
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,300
No, no, no

516
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,300
Don't talk to me here, don't talk to me here

517
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,280
Fight the real enemy

518
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,160
Don't you wanna be saved?

519
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,860
Don't you wanna be saved?

520
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,880
Fight the real enemy

521
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,960
We're all looking in the same direction

522
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,640
We're not seeing quite the same thing

523
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,380
Get lost!

524
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,960
Look at me and I'm looking at you

525
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,700
But we're all going insane

526
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,820
Don't talk to me!

527
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,040
I'm hiding the gun!

528
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,460
Fight the real enemy

529
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,940
Fight the real enemy

530
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,760
Fight the real enemy

531
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,020
I find it good about hiding

532
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,460
Fight!

533
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,760
Fight the real enemy

534
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,220
Fight the real enemy

535
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,380
We don't want to fight you

536
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,080
preach to people.

537
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,640
Oh, Bob.

538
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:23,980
Oh.

539
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,200
Turn on.

540
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,740
Tune in.

541
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,500
Why do you want to be normal?

542
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,680
The rupture is upon us, dear friends.

543
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,680
That fateful day,

544
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,600
July 5th,

545
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,620
1998.

546
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,440
Next days are coming.

547
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,460
And the peaks are coming.

548
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,100
Next days are coming.

549
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,280
And the peaks are coming.

550
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,420
When we were born

551
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,840
into this life,

552
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,300
we were destined

553
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,340
to make

554
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:18,860
it right.

555
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,580
And it's predetermined.

556
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,980
And this is our fate.

557
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,540
We're singing this song

558
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,500
so you can

559
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:28,800
relate.

560
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,300
We are going to save

561
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,160
the universe.

562
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,700
We are going to save the universe.

563
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,320
We are going to save the universe.

564
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,340
This time.

565
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,120
We are full grown.

566
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,560
We are grown up men.

567
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,480
We are all passionate.

568
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,160
We pay to reason it.

569
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,380
It is our mission.

570
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,960
It is our task.

571
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,000
It's obvious.

572
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,220
It is obvious.

573
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:14,840
Yes, you do that.

574
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,320
We are going to save the universe.

575
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,080
Save the universe.

576
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,460
We are going to save the universe.

577
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,400
We are going to save

578
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,200
the universe.

579
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,460
Yes,, I am.

580
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,540
guitar solo

581
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,900
guitar solo

582
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,060
guitar solo

583
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,120
guitar solo

584
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,100
guitar solo

585
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,100


586
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,100


587
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,100


588
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,780
Don't you worry

589
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,420
Don't have no fears

590
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,840
Don't get outside

591
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,080
We've got the atmosphere

592
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,940
We can let

593
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,180
So can you understand

594
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,880
We're in control

595
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,320
And we don't want to die

596
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,040
And we don't want to die

597
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,400
We are going to save the universe

598
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,080
We are going to save the universe

599
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,740
We are going to save the universe

600
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,760
This time

601
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:11,040
Well, maybe next time

602
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,540
Sure, when the rupture hits

603
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,740
We'll all be in our first class window seats

604
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,240
On the pleasure saucers

605
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,160
Watching the little pink boys fly

606
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,680
Turn on

607
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,280
Turn on

608
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,180
Come on, come on, come on

609
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,900
You certainly don't want to trick these people

610
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,640
Next days are coming

611
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,240
And the pigs are bumming

612
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,140
Ah!

613
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,780
There's a whole bunch of people coming after you

614
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,460
You better stop and try to listen to me

615
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,300
Cause they want to ram a little something up your buns

616
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,400
And they call it the conspiracy

617
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,620
Well, they'll make you think and act just the way they choose

618
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,840
And they'll make you overpay just to sing the blues

619
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,100
And they'll tell you what to say and they'll never go away

620
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,360
Cause they got you in your work and they'll never let you play

621
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,020
Cause they kind of just designed you to be a fool

622
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,920
And they kind of just designed it to work that way

623
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,160
Cause they kind of just designed it to work that way

624
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,460
And because of their design, well, it washes out your mind

625
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,620
And you think you're doing fine, but you're wasting all your time

626
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,600
Being very well behaved for the big machine

627
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,800
Being very well behaved for the big machine

628
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,140
And they'll tell you what to say, but they'll never go away

629
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,420
Cause they got you in your work and they'll never let you play

630
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,080
Here I am

631
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,080
Stuck in the blood by the man

632
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,520
Here I stay

633
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,740
Free will just drifting away

634
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,240
Smile and be happy

635
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,300
Here's the American dream

636
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,640
More noodles for you poodles

637
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,720
Means less coffee for your dream

638
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,980
And if you want to make more money

639
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,140
We'll take more of it for ourselves

640
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,380
With your caddies in the driveway

641
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,660
But nothing on your shelves

642
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,000
Let's wrap the confusion up

643
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,840
A destruction illusion

644
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,500
I get down on my knees and I pray

645
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,620
Cause Bob is my savior

646
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,520
Today

647
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,500
Today

648
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,740
Yes, I am Bob

649
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,740
The one high exalted master of slack

650
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,000
And I'm the one who's got the most money

651
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,240
I am the carburetor of the universe

652
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,360
The rubbery wheels on a child's toy truck

653
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,260
I am the pelvic warmth of intercourse

654
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,160
I am the force behind all foolishness and humor

655
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,420
The laughter of the raving lunatic

656
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,380
The wisdom of ignorance

657
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,320
The death rattle of the infant of seriousness

658
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,120
I am slack

659
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,140
I have come

660
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,320
And my organ still swells

661
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,920
To spread the legs of your mind

662
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,040
And I will thrust my holy rod

663
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,100
Into the boulders of your consciousness

664
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,640
I'll kindly bend over

665
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,220
I'll concede my default to a

666
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,000
To my horn

667
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:58,900
Ohhh

668
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,280
Ohh

669
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,300
Ohhh

670
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,100
I'll count my banging

671
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,100


672
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,100


673
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,100


674
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,100


675
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,260
And the

676
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:04,260


677
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:04,260

Going into the music business is really exciting. I'm really learning a lot about it.

00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:54,200
Thank you.

757
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:54,200


758
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:54,200


759
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:54,200


760
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,540
I don't want anything.

761
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,620
I don't want anything.

762
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,040
I don't want anything in the toilet.

763
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,580
Samples, samples of bacteria.

764
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,640
Just throw 409.

765
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,000
Everywhere?

766
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:04,940
That's correct.

767
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,300
Everywhere?

768
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,460
Do you think that's a dumb thing to do?

769
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,380
No!

770
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,380
Even?

771
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,720
It's not dumb!

772
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:15,620
Samples.

773
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,700
You have sex dirt.

774
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,180
This goes to the bathroom.

775
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:24,180


776
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:24,180


777
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:24,180


778
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:24,840
This is all nonsense.

779
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,700
You know better than that.

780
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,740
Wash your hands.

781
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,400
This is all nonsense.

782
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,020
Wash your hands.

783
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,620
Wash your hands.

784
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,480
To create a continuing communication of erotic stimuli.

785
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,420
Wash your hands.

786
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,240
To create a continuing communication of erotic stimuli.

787
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,140
Wash your hands.

788
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,620
Get Big Butt out of the bathroom.

789
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,420
I may decide to use another device.

790
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,340
And some men are particularly fond of this.

791
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:00,860
The Hoover.

792
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,100
My affectionate name for this.

793
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,280
Inflating.

794
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,020
I don't want anything in the toilet.

795
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,940
Reporting lyrics to my fans on this miss.

796
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,460
Isn't that beautiful?

797
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,680
Play black.

798
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,100
Be black.

799
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,400
Play black.

800
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,800
Be black.

801
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,400
C-Safe.

802
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,340
Immunal.

803
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,620
C-B-Safe.

804
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,320
Conduction.

805
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:39,920
Dirt.

806
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,920
Immunal.

807
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,640
C-B-Safe.

808
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,400
Conduction.

809
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,540
C-B-Safe.

810
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,040
C-B-Safe.

811
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,040


812
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,340
C-B-Safe.

813
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:54,340


814
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,080
C-B-Safe.

815
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:55,080


816
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,360
If I said Chernobyl was so long ago.

817
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,300
Nothing to worry about.

818
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:05,860
And now I hear in the news these dumb guys in the Department of Energy and the Defense Department are gonna start

819
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:09,120
building a bunch of Chernobyls across the United States.

820
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,800
And then I hear on the news that Chernobyl is not really over, no.

821
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,740
All these people are dying.

822
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,160
It's all the pollution is getting into the waters, it's getting into the aquifers.

823
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:19,740
It's getting to the water.

824
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:23,100
Everything below me is all one thing

825
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,700
So if you take a distance between

826
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,260
The end of the thing, I know that we're getting in tune

827
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,500
But you let go

828
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,960
You know, and then I start thinking

829
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,740
How come my movements are getting so

830
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:36,660
Drinking

831
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,000
The iodine, the one three one

832
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,240
Has got my thyroid on the run

833
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,360
And the krypton, the eighty five

834
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,400
Is making it hard just to stay alive

835
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,740
But the iodine, the one three one

836
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:57,900
The iodine, the one three one

837
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,060
No more running through the metal veins

838
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,860
No more better than the mud

839
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,420
Power, powers in the power scenes

840
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:10,120
Shake the bony hand, shake it good

841
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,880
Music

842
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:12,940
Music

843
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,300
Music

844
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,340
Music

845
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:18,340


846
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:18,340


847
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,380
Music

848
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:19,380


849
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,480
A great себяo, there are we

850
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,740

00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,500
I said, then why are you here

854
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:32,820
I'm freaking out

855
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:32,820


856
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:39,180
I said, I'm getting on my nerves

857
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,160
Al hyped her up

858
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:41,220
I cha K

859
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:45,540

apt

862
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:55,460
Evacuate, evacuate, evacuate, evacuate, evacuate

863
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,660
Soap is over 2 million known pollutants

864
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:02,880
That can cause cancer, pancreatitis, diabetes

865
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,200
Tumor, gingivitis, bad breath, acne

866
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,300
What's the use?

867
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,480
The iodine, a 1, 3, 1

868
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,720
Has got my thyroid on the run

869
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,800
And the krypton, a 8, 5

870
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,900
Is making it hard just to stay alive

871
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:27,260
But the iodine, a 1, 3, 1

872
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,520
The iodine, a 1, 3, 1

873
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,600
No more running through the metal lands

874
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,340
No more barefoot in the mud

875
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,920
Shake the bony hand of the poison man

876
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,700
Shake the bony hand of the chicken good

877
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,420
No more running through the metal lands

878
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,700
No more running through the metal lands

879
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:47,700


880
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,100
No more barefoot in the mud

881
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:52,680
Shake the bony hand of the poison man

882
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,620
Shake the bony hand of the chicken good

883
00:54:55,620 --> 00:55:00,060
Shake the bony hand of the chicken good

884
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,700
Shake the bony hand of the poison man

885
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,820
I hope they know you're here

886
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,680
Uh, yes, that was Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

887
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,580
And here is their sacred PO,

888
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,380
Box 14776.

889
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,300

44114.

892
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,240
Negative Land.

893
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,600
And as well, Joe Newman's stuff is distributed by Negative Land.

894
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:46,940
And as is, silica gel are all available from Negative Land mail order.

895
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,360
Actually, it's called Negative Mail Order Land.

896
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,680
109 MINA.

897
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,400
That's M-I-N-N-A.

898
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,080
109 MINA.

899
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,740
Number 391.

900
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,360
San Francisco, California.

902
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,460
94105 for Negative Mail Ordered Land.

903
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,460
And now, Regenspahler.

904
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,840
I get a little horny and I'm a little funky.

905
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,080
Give me something back, I won't make fun of it.

906
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,460
Roll around without a mind.

907
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,760
I try to pretend it won't make any difference.

908
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,240
Make the pleasure face.

909
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,520
Make the kiss the lips that look so real.

910
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,100
No one can tell that you're still thinking.

911
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,260
And when it's all over you, I can roll around in the slipper.

912
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,020
Run, buddy.

913
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,000
Run, buddy.

914
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,280
Run, buddy.

915
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,340
Run, buddy.

916
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,000
Run, buddy.

917
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:49,900
Hello?

918
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:55,140
Come on.

919
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:55,880
Listen.

920
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:56,060


921
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,060
