1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,980
The hour of snuff.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,760
Snuff from the church of the...

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,700
The church of the...

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,880
Jesus.com

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,320
And...

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,600
And...

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,080
Or...

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,520
Dot.com

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,320
The air rays of...

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:29,800
Dobbs.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,660
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,200
Good idea, Dobbs.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,360
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

14
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,300
Good idea, Dobbs.

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:46,440
Good idea, Dobbs.

16
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,280
Good idea, Dobbs.

17
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:45,300
Good idea, Dobbs.

18
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:17,260
Good idea, Dobbs.

19
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,080
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

20
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,600
Good idea, Dobbs.

21
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,780
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

22
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,780
Good idea.

23
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,340
Good idea.

24
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,920
We were just listening to Evolution Control Committee live at 17X Day.

25
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:39,640
In fact, all of tonight's show was recorded by Reverend Suds Pasha or myself or both

26
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,340
on location at the Wisteria Campground in Southern Ohio.

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,380
For instance, this amazing rant by Reverend Baby Bear.

28
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,420
I am a tempest.

29
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,040
I am a swirling mass of chaos and confusion.

30
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,960
I will change my mind on a whim and I will always be in motion.

31
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,220
I am a cloudless, starry night.

32
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,200
A picture of stillness and order.

33
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,220
I am a grace and serenity.

34
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,360
I am a body that you have never known.

35
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,560
I am an uberfem.

36
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,860
I am a melancholy.

37
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,640
A cancerous spreading sadness.

38
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,220
I will crawl inside your heart and rot it from the inside out.

39
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,480
I am a brightness.

40
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,520
A shimmering, radiant joy.

41
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,680
That warms and swells as it passes over you.

42
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,000
I am a rested, contented sigh.

43
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,780
I am an uberfem.

44
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,340
I am a raging bull.

45
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,920
I am a furious, storm-weathered harpy.

46
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,320
I am a seething little ball of hate.

47
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,840
I am a softness.

48
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:22,840
A continuous, flowing curve that rolls off the tongue and swims around in your mind.

49
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,280
I am an uberfem.

50
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:33,640
I don't conform to your petty pink notions about what a woman should or shouldn't be.

51
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,780
Because I'm not one.

52
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,280
I am an uberfem.

53
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,740
I don't need your permission to act or your permission to speak.

54
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:51,660
And I certainly don't need your permission to scream from the rafters and the rooftops.

55
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,300
In pleasure or in anger.

56
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,500
In pain or hate.

57
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,000
Why not both?

58
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,720
It doesn't matter if I am shapely or shapeless.

59
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,160
Inside me is a shape without a name.

60
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,460
A fluid, ambiguous flux that demands reverence or fear.

61
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,720
But always awe.

62
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,060
I'm an uberfem.

63
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,740
I have a sweetness that makes you lick your lips.

64
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:28,440
I have a glowing ball of light that you want to keep you warm.

65
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,240
I have a universe inside me.

66
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,040
And I can see you reaching for it.

67
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,540
I'm an uberfem.

68
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,400
And you want me.

69
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,140
I'm an uberfem.

70
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,620
I am whole and simple.

71
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,840
I can see you with my eyes...

72
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:06,940
I am holy, the whole I know.

73
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,920
Cerys is now is...

74
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,040
Cerys is not spinning.

75
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,460
I'm an errand boy, I can guess and see.

76
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:12,460


77
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:12,460


78
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:12,460


79
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:12,460


80
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,240
abbreviate or clone it.

81
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,480
I just wanted to give you a clap.

82
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,160
When you think of something really special...

83
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,060
a cold, or...

84
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,060


85
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,060


86
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,080
I want the happily ever after.

87
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,240
don't need this stupid impact but maybe put it you know.

88
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:21,900
I want a well built house back in your home,

89
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,660
hope this information was useful to you...

90
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:22,720
and don't even think of the kaÅ¼dy scheduled dreams Yoo!

91
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,980
There will be a day when all the pink boys pay.

92
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,680
They'll scream and burn with nowhere left to run.

93
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,080
But I won't be around, cause I'm headed out of town to outer space.

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,480
And a saucer built for one.

95
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,480
Yeah, my saucer built for one.

96
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,160
Aim that sucker towards the sun.

97
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,940
Light the fuse and then I'm on my way.

98
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,180
And I'll realize my dreams as I hear the pink boys scream.

99
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,040
And agony and terror come next day.

100
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,700
Now a saucer built for one sure sounds like lots of fun.

101
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,840
Till you realize that there's no one there to screw.

102
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,820
And I get bored with my hand, so I ripped up all my plans.

103
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,180
Cause I'm working on a saucer built for two.

104
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,560
Yeah, and my saucer built for two.

105
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,400
You know just what we'll do, each other, as we make our way through space.

106
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,260
And in our rear view mirror we'll see nothing but fear.

107
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,160
As the X's and O's.

108
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,100
As we see this ravaged earth come next day.

109
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,380
Now a saucer built for two got a cozy seat for you.

110
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,960
And another one on this side just for me.

111
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,480
But when I'm between your thighs, I need someone else to drive.

112
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,100
So now I'm working on a saucer built for three.

113
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,440
Yeah, and my saucer built for three.

114
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,780
Yeah, you and her and me.

115
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,120
We'll all take turns and we'll all get to play.

116
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,180
And they'll know it's no joke when the pinks go up in smoke.

117
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,160
And agony and terror come next day.

118
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,260
Now a saucer built for three might seem quite enough for me.

119
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,180
But I for one need just a little more.

120
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,720
So I went back to the shop, I put that fucker up on blocks.

121
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,140
And now I'm working on a saucer built for four.

122
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,440
Yeah, and my saucer built for four.

123
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,700
Oh, no one's getting bored.

124
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,160
There's always someone else for getting laid.

125
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,440
And I thank my lucky stars as we cruise right past Mars.

126
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,060
That we escaped the carnage of extinction.

127
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,700
And I'm just a little bit more than happy today.

128
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,760
Now a saucer built for four.

129
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,640
I shouldn't ask for more.

130
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,660
What the hell, why else am I alive?

131
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,680
Besides I need a break every six hours, give or take.

132
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,440
So now I'm working on a saucer built for five.

133
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,600
Yeah, and my saucer built for five.

134
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,320
From now till we arrive, we'll fucking suck with luck in every way.

135
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,040
Yeah, and my saucer built for five.

136
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,040


137
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,400
And each time we get laid, the memories

138
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,600
will fade of what the Earth was like before x day.

139
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,880
Now a saucer built for five.

140
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,620
Three to shag and one to drive.

141
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,340
But it turns out that the ladies want more dicks.

142
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,380
So I'm getting out of bed, and I'm

143
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,660
getting right back to my shed.

144
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,060
Now I'm working on a saucer built for six.

145
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,800
Yeah, and my saucer built for six might learn me some new tricks

146
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,080
as we go tearing across the Milky Way.

147
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:19,500
Yeah.

148
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:20,620
Yeah.

149
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:20,700


150
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,600
We drink about every single bink that fried right where they stood come x day.

151
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,200
Now a saucer built for six, so much cock and ass and tits.

152
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,960
No one ever got so close to heaven.

153
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,120
But at the risk of sounding rude, we might need one for food.

154
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,820
So now I'm working on a saucer built for seven.

155
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,960
And my saucer built for seven.

156
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,760
We got room for Cat and Kevin and five more Yeti freaks who knew to pay.

157
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,980
30 some odd bucks to buy.

158
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,680
And they finally quit that job.

159
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,940
And that wave of corporate layoffs come x day.

160
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,880
Now a saucer built for seven, it only

161
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,640
takes a second to turn around and find yourself a date.

162
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,020
But the place is going to be a mess.

163
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,580
Need some cleaning help, I guess.

164
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,060
So now I'm working on a saucer built for eight.

165
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,600
And my saucer built for eight, no one has to masturbate.

166
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,740
Little help here is all you got to say.

167
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,960
And then some pretty Yeti mugs.

168
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,720
And my Yeti mouth is happy to go south.

169
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,500
After all, that's what we practiced 4x day.

170
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,480
Now a saucer built for eight, I'm sure that just sounds great.

171
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,440
But I'm starting now to recognize a trend.

172
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,100
I'd build it out for nine, and then I'd change my mind.

173
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,020
So fuck it, I'm skipping right on ahead to 10.

174
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,180
And my saucer built for 10, a mobile pleasure den,

175
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,500
a hedonistic hoedown on its way.

176
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,320
To that sexy slack-filled place, a way up there in space

177
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,060
that they promised would be ready come X day.

178
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,780
Now a saucer built for 10, you might think that that's the end.

179
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,620
But I hate to let down my subgenius brethren.

180
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,980
So I've put an extra door as I put some beanbags on the floor.

181
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,940
Now I'm proud to say my saucers seem to fit.

182
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:20,940


183
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:20,940


184
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:20,940


185
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:29,620
11 in my saucer for 11 hey my saucer for 11 my libido won't be heaven in fact I might become

186
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:35,980
a better lay cuz I learned from the best and I'll practice on the rest as we all make each other

187
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:45,780
come next day how a saucer for 11 oh my this place is getting to be one where it's hard to

188
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:52,420
hear yourself over all the grunts and bones so I installed new headphones that'll be perfect on my

189
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,460
saucer built for 12 and my saucer built for 12 will all escape that hell the earth will become

190
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,800
or so they say half the hands will grab an ass the other half will raise the glass to those

191
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:15,160
liberating excess of x day now saucer built for 12 oh dear above the smell and the furniture all

192
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,760
has a stinkin' smell and the furniture all has a stinkin' smell and the furniture all has a stinkin'

193
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:23,400
sheen but if that ain't quite enough well I hate to say but tough I ain't working on a saucer for 13

194
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:31,420
all right yes my saucer built for 12 will suit us all real well as

195
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:41,180
and saucer built for 12 will suit us all real well with whips and chains and liquor and poker yay

196
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,640
and no one's getting

197
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
off

198
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,940
well everyone's getting off and no we'll never stop

199
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,420
unless we come across that comet hell bop I'd like to have a word of those heavens gate people

200
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:10,960
maybe get me some some sneakers until we reach our new home come next day

201
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,340
23

202
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,440
69

203
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,620
8 o 8

204
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:23,980
59

205
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,740
All right thank you so much I am Andrew the Impaled

206
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,860
and it was indeed Andrew the Impaled from Pittsburgh

207
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:42,600
you can look him up you can google him and friends as you might guess

208
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,720
the internet download version of the

209
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:45,740
Internet Download version of the THOMAS Todos!

210
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,960
this show sounds very, very different.

211
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,260
What with being completely uncensored.

212
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,560
And for our broadcast listeners who don't know this,

213
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,020
you can download pretty much every episode,

214
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:09,660
most of the 1,476 episodes of The Hour of Slack

215
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,820
from subgenius.com.

216
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,740
If you find the radio button near the top of the page.

217
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,100
Although this show won't be on for another week

218
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,960
because we're actually ahead.

219
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,900
Anyway, friends, yes, it was a wonderful 17X day

220
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,240
aside from, well, the obvious.

221
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,180
We're still here.

222
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,480
But we got some great recordings.

223
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,260
We really did.

224
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,300
And they'll last a while.

225
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,540
For now, we'll listen to,

226
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,880
one of many parables written by Reverend Richard Scull

227
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,700
as read by Priestess Pisces.

228
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,020
One day, J.R. Bob Dobbs was walking his sales route

229
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,280
when he came upon an old man building a large ship in his yard.

230
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,880
Say there, fellow, said Bob.

231
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,860
What's all the commotion about?

232
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,660
I'm preparing for the end times, said the old man.

233
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,600
I just read on Flat World News.

234
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,060
I read daily that the evil Jews and liberals

235
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,780
are going to take over the world and put us all in camps.

236
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,700
So I'm going to sit here and put my family in Salem off to safety.

237
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,440
Bob just looked up and stared.

238
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,100
He noticed the old man had a Star of David on his house.

239
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,620
And he said,

240
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,840
Excuse me, I think you're Jewish.

241
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,120
The old man stopped hammering nails and thought to himself for a second.

242
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,480
Say, I am.

243
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,320
Damn.

244
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,240
I'm going to build another boat to escape for myself.

245
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,140
Say, fellow, you're pretty sharp.

246
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,340
My name's Noah.

247
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:46,980
What's yours?

248
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,200
Dobbs.

249
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,160
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

250
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,260
That's my name.

251
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,960
Well, Dobbs, J.R. Bob Dobbs, thanks for pointing out the fact I'm Jewish.

252
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,900
I might have ended up stuck in the middle of an ocean surrounded by a bunch of Jews,

253
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,140
but what am I going to do with this boat?

254
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,320
Bob just looked at Noah.

255
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,820
And in his mind's eye, the old man turned into a giant all-day lollipop

256
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,720
with the word sucker.

257
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
And he said,

258
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,440
Well, on my sails route, there's a dance club where lots of men hang out.

259
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,660
I bet those guys would just love to take an ocean cruise

260
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,020
so they can get away from those prying eyes and relax.

261
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,220
Well, I don't know.

262
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,700
You know, a bunch of old men hanging out together sounds like they can get grumpy

263
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,440
like them local tea party meetings.

264
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,620
Bob just smiled and said,

265
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,700
Don't worry.

266
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,400
They're all gay.

267
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:41,800
And he said,

268
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:41,800


269
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:41,800


270
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:41,800


271
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:41,800


272
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,420
Well, well, if these men are gay, then that must mean they're going to have a swell time

273
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,560
singing and dancing and doing all sorts of gay and happy things.

274
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,300
Good idea, Dobbs, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

275
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,100
Of course it is, said Bob.

276
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,320
And I will sell those very gay men berths on your boat.

277
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,560
There's about 500 men in that club, and at about 50 shekels a man,

278
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,340
that works out to about three shekels for you.

279
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,780
Oh, joy, I'm going to get three shekels and spend a month with 500 men.

280
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,520
500 gay guys.

281
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,100
Wait, I only have 250 bucks on the boat.

282
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,060
Oh, I don't think that'll be a problem, said Bob as he laughed to himself.

283
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,640
And so that's how Noah became the swingiest cat on the seven seas,

284
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,280
and never again were the neighborhood sheeps molested.

285
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,440
The end.

286
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,900
Hey, fat chick, you got it coming to you.

287
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,060
Hey, fat chick, you got it coming to you.

288
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,380
Hey, fat chick, you got it coming to you.

289
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,120
When I was young, I joined the circus.

290
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,920
I came up with freaks, it's true.

291
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,360
But while I saw the nation, I only dreamed of kissing you.

292
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,500
I sang to lovely rubber men and fire-breathing bikes.

293
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,900
We didn't have no Facebook, so you could not count the likes.

294
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,720
I got when I ate them light bulbs, oh, and I bounded that spike

295
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,120
through my tongue and through my heart,

296
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,060
because there's no brakes upon these bikes.

297
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,840
Hey, fat chick, you got it coming to you.

298
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,060
Hey, fat chick, you got it coming to you.

299
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,440
Hey, fat chick, you got it coming to you.

300
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,840
Well, we left from San Francisco all the way to Brooklyn town.

301
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,560
It's amazing how far you travel on the powers of a clown.

302
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,400
Lost some in Minneapolis, gained some more in New Orleans.

303
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,760
But me, I hail from Pittsburgh, each should own it what that means.

304
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,000
We got lots of freaks and drag queens and burlesquers by the score.

305
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,720
But our jazzmen, they are righteous, they helped to fight this war.

306
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,420
They helped to fight this war.

307
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,400
They helped to fight this war.

308
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,920
I idolize function.

309
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,540
You still not Mrs.

310
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,240
Yet?

311
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:02,560
I don't yet?

312
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:02,620
I'm in town and nobody

313
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,400
gives me quid for money.

314
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:07,400


315
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,440
and she's got freaks.

316
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,780
Her poems cut with fierceness

317
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,540
that we ain't seen since the beat.

318
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,800
She's large and she is lovely,

319
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,440
so don't forget to stare.

320
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,920
She's left you all be wondering

321
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,940
if you can find one life for there.

322
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,300
Hey, hey, fat chick,

323
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,080
you had it coming.

324
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,480
Hey, fat chick,

325
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,260
you had it coming.

326
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,600
Hey, fat chick,

327
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,160
you had it coming to you.

328
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
Hey, hey, fat chick,

329
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,540
you had it coming to you.

330
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,180
Hey, hey, fat chick,

331
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,660
you had it coming to you.

332
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,300
Hey, hey, fat chick,

333
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,040
you had it coming to you.

334
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,660
Ooh.

335
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,420
Oh, yes, dear friends.

336
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,460
I told you we got some good recordings.

337
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,420
That was Fat Man D,

338
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,240
Reverend.

339
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,920
And Fat Man D at 17X Day.

340
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,440
Her name is spelled P-H-A-T,

341
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,340
Fat, P-H-A-T,

342
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,480
and Man D is spelled M-A-N-D-E-E

343
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
for your Googling purposes.

344
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,900
In a few minutes,

345
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,820
we'll play another wonderful song,

346
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,360
this one by the Mutant Mountain Boys,

347
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,780
of whom we finally got

348
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,200
a really good recording also.

349
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,380
But first,

350
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,320
this anger rant

351
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,120
from Priestess Pisces.

352
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,560
Y'all thought I was kidding

353
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,460
about Ferdberg, man.

354
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,520
All right.

355
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,220
Now, the whole thing is,

356
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,620
I know I should quit smoking.

357
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,960
I mean, it's unhealthy.

358
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,780
It's expensive.

359
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,360
But I can't

360
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,640
because I'm angry.

361
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,480
Like, always angry.

362
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,560
Like, Hulk angry.

363
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,700
Like, Scorch,

364
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,920
Earth, nuclear annihilation angry.

365
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,700
And when I'm angry,

366
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,680
I have to smoke

367
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,040
to focus my mind,

368
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,940
to channel the anger

369
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,520
into something

370
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,760
that doesn't involve me

371
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,560
going on a fucking rampage

372
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,860
and starting my own

373
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,900
personal X-Day.

374
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,960
But not the fun part.

375
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,320
Not the saucers

376
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,460
and sex goddesses part.

377
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,340
No, no.

378
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,420
The laser beams,

379
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,400
the burning flesh,

380
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,540
the killing everyone

381
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,720
part of X-Day,

382
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,520
which I suppose is fun

383
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,980
until the law gets involved.

384
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,040
So,

385
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,380
I smoke,

386
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,480
because I'm angry,

387
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,520
because I'm always angry.

388
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,140
A fellow Yeti,

389
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,880
a good friend of mine,

390
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,840
suggested that I should

391
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,320
chill out and smoke frop.

392
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
If I was to smoke frop

393
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,020
every time I was angry,

394
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,560
I would be a worthless,

395
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,460
drooling pile of shuddering shit.

396
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,240
So, I smoke cigarettes instead.

397
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,500
I've also been told

398
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,540
that I should, you know,

399
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,200
drink beer to chill out,

400
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,420
but I don't.

401
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,840
If I was to drink enough beer

402
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,960
to even quench the fire

403
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,180
of rage in me,

404
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,840
my liver would jump out

405
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,560
of my abdominal cavity,

406
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,460
screaming,

407
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,320
fuck you,

408
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,900
before it took off

409
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,340
running down the street.

410
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,700
Of course,

411
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,440
there are some folk here

412
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,520
who suggest I should meditate.

413
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,340
They say I need to reconnect

414
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,620
with the universe,

415
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
and that the issue of my anger

416
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,120
is the fact that I've lost

417
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,920
my connection to the cosmos.

418
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,720
You know what, folks?

419
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,720
The last fucking thing

420
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,560
I want to be connected to

421
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,520
is this universe,

422
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,380
because this universe

423
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,320
is full of fucktards and asshats,

424
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,480
and they're the reason

425
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,400
I'm angry in the first place.

426
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,700
Well, let's get some down here, then.

427
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,880
If I wasn't angry all the time, though,

428
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,360
I would probably find myself

429
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,280
downright depressed.

430
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,220
No more than that,

431
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,020
I think I'd despair.

432
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,120
Because I don't know if you've noticed,

433
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,900
this planet's so small,

434
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,000
it sucks.

435
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,420
Have you actually observed

436
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,620
the world we live in?

437
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,220
The sociopaths,

438
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,840
the liars,

439
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,860
the arrogant drunks,

440
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,900
the willfully ignorant,

441
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,840
the stubbornly in denial,

442
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,220
the pill-popping hypochondriacs,

443
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,000
the bigots,

444
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,120
the trigger-happy pigs,

445
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,100
the dividers,

446
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,040
the manipulators,

447
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,900
the insiders,

448
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,780
the privileged whiners,

449
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,440
and the hypocrites?

450
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,700
I'd say, you know,

451
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,720
there's something out there

452
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,040
for just about everybody

453
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,320
to be pissed off about.

454
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,420
Man, I stay pissed off.

455
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:36,880
I'm not.

456
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,980
But I hear you out there,

457
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,360
I hear you say,

458
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,460
but Pisces,

459
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,340
you don't usually seem so angry.

460
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,900
Well, this is true.

461
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,500
Some folks wield their rage

462
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,800
like a baseball bat

463
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,220
with nails hammered through it

464
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,060
and wrapped around it

465
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,900
with barbed wire.

466
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,400
Some folks pop off

467
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,280
like a summer storm in Florida.

468
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,820
Some folks go whole hog,

469
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,540
A-bomb, take no prisoners,

470
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,040
screw the civilians,

471
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,500
burn all the bridges,

472
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,740
and set them alight again

473
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,780
just to be sure.

474
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,360
I'm more of a laser-precise scalpel

475
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,120
seeking out the very cancer

476
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
that angers me

477
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,900
and slowly and methodically

478
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,540
slicing it away bit by bit

479
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,120
until there is nothing left.

480
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,380
And I hear you, I hear you,

481
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,300
oh, Pisces,

482
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,160
you know, with the smoking

483
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,520
and all that anger.

484
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,400
Your blood pressure, Pisces,

485
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,560
your blood pressure, the stress.

486
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,320
Oh, sure, I keep hearing folks

487
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,400
telling me to calm down.

488
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,680
Don't be angry all the time.

489
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,420
But I gotta wonder,

490
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,440
maybe they're really hoping

491
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,120
instead of me being angry,

492
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,160
I'll just roll over

493
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,140
and take their shit.

494
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,260
Because, brothers and sisters,

495
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,520
I'm pretty sure that's just

496
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,580
what the conspiracy wants you to do,

497
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,060
to stay silent

498
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,660
and let them fuck you in the ass

499
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,500
without the courtesy

500
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,360
of a reach around.

501
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,940
So you have every right

502
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,720
to be angry,

503
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,940
and you should be angry

504
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,040
because they're trying to fuck you.

505
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,200
You gotta understand,

506
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,580
my anger keeps me moving.

507
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,700
I'd be dead and gone

508
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,980
if it wasn't for my anger.

509
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,800
Hell, I'm here today

510
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,920
because of my anger.

511
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,200
They told me I was too stupid,

512
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,640
too fat, too ugly.

513
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,480
They told me I was worthless

514
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,040
and horrible

515
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,440
and I should just fucking die.

516
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,040
And I'll admit,

517
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,960
in my darkest hours,

518
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,240
I considered their words.

519
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,080
I considered a premature exit,

520
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,320
but it dawned on me,

521
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,480
they want me to do just that.

522
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,700
They want me gone.

523
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,840
So, I figured,

524
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,500
if I'm so fucking repulsive,

525
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,460
if I make them so uncomfortable,

526
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,260
if I'm so horrible,

527
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,160
well then I'm gonna show up

528
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,780
every time and smile.

529
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,160
Because fuck the conspiracy,

530
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,640
fuck the uppity insiders,

531
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,860
I ain't going out like that.

532
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,700
I'm not going away

533
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,380
until I'm damn good and ready to.

534
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,080
Now I know, brothers and sisters,

535
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,960
some of you have had some bad times.

536
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,460
I know you have felt the stings of loss,

537
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,640
the burning pain of betrayal.

538
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,700
You've been spit on and shit on.

539
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,320
You've been at the bottom

540
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,820
and wondered if you should just stop

541
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,160
before you lose anymore.

542
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,480
I want you to take that pain,

543
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,620
that sting,

544
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,800
I want you to take that pain in your heart,

545
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,940
take that betrayal that you felt

546
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,660
and turn it into anger.

547
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,340
Yes, brothers and sisters,

548
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,280
you need to be angry,

549
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,320
but I need you to direct that anger.

550
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,600
I need you to focus that anger.

551
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,880
I need to let it drive you to create.

552
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,360
Use that anger to make mutant art.

553
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,040
Let that anger flow through your mouth

554
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,100
and lift up your fellow yeti.

555
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,100
Let that anger move you to do things.

556
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,540
Use that anger to be the red hot beam

557
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,240
that cuts and cauterizes the arteries

558
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,580
of the very heart

559
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,480
of the conspiracy.

560
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,100
Use that anger to slice and dice

561
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,540
the very souls of the normals.

562
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Let that anger fuel your war machine

563
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,640
against the con.

564
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,120
Let that anger light a path to the saucers.

565
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,000
Let your anger burn the cash crop,

566
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,080
the pink profit,

567
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,000
so Bob can plant the subgenius seeds of slack

568
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,580
in the ashes of their defeat.

569
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,680
Your anger

570
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,820
is a gift, brothers and sisters.

571
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,560
Focus it and use it

572
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,920
and beat the conspiracy.

573
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,840
Can I get a praise, Bob?

574
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,560
Praise Bob!

575
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:50,500
Thank you very much.

He's a good boy.

625
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:37,880
Yeah, yeah.

626
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,080
Yeah, yeah.

627
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,460
He lives in a village.

628
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:50,940
Oh, Joe, hallelujah, I'm spaceship bound, amen, so did my rack, when he was up, so can he answer me, yes, he answered me.

629
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,900
Oh, Joe, hallelujah, I'm rapture bound, amen, sent to die, I'm a man of our own, set me free.

630
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:09,260
Oh, Joe, hallelujah, I'm spaceship bound, amen, so did my rack, when he was up, so can he answer me, yes, he answered me.

631
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:17,280
Oh, Joe, hallelujah, I'm rapture bound, amen, I sent to die, I'm a man of our own, set me free.

632
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:24,020
I sent to die, I'm a man of our own, set me free.

633
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:53,980
The Mutant Mountain Boys, dear friends, live at X-Day, and I think we may have Dave on the line.

634
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Lovely birds in lovely caves, lovely people.

635
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,860
Dave!

636
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,240
No.

637
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,580
No?

638
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,460
Yeah.

639
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,540
He's the Archduke, the French flood man.

640
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,420
Oh, no, is it World War I all over again?

641
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,460
And I'm the only one that remembered on the show.

642
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,740
I have a friend who claims...

643
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,340
Are you remembered now?

644
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,640
I have a friend who claims his wife once asked, you mean there was a World War I?

645
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,900
I hate to think about that.

646
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,460
World War I all over again, a thousand times over, where I come from right now.

647
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,940
You've been World War I-ing again, Dave?

648
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,500
You've been down in the trenches?

649
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,540
Could you repeat that for me, please?

650
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,960
You've been down in the trenches.

651
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,020
I have a bad connection.

652
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,520
You've been in the trenches all day, Dave?

653
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,620
Yeah.

654
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,500
Wiping the spit off my bayonet, getting my little funny hat all tuned up.

655
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:55,000
It's supposed to be tuned in the key of B-flat, I think, so you have to transpose when you read the music.

656
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:00,820
But when those shells start whipping off your head, then the gas hits and stuff like that.

657
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:07,140
And some idiot tells you to charge, which is what most Americans do anyway.

658
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:07,840
Oh.

659
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:14,040
When the idiot says charge, I guess you better charge, Dave-ster.

660
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,620
Yeah.

661
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,040
I think, yeah.

662
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:35,560
Now, we haven't talked to you at any length in some time because Princess, we and I were in Wisteria even last Sunday night during show, overcoming Starwood or something like that.

663
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,140
Getting over Starwood.

664
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:37,680
Which?

665
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:41,540
Which, by the way, had great weather, if it doesn't bother you that the world didn't end.

666
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,780
Oh, and Dave, I have an anecdote I wanted to tell you about because I thought you might like this.

667
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,620
Oh, I love anecdotes.

668
00:34:51,540 --> 00:35:05,200
Well, you know, on the way to Starwood from coming back from Cleveland, I gave a ride to one of the guests who was Jeff Magnus the Magician McBride.

669
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,660
Who is a real lost man.

670
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,860
He was a Las Vegas magician and he put on a great show, several great shows at Starwood.

671
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:24,580
But, you know, as you may guess, the CIA and magicians, stage magicians, have a lot in common.

672
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:32,380
And the CIA people especially like to know some of those stage tricks and sometimes hire magicians.

673
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,640
Well, our magician friend Jeff McBride told us that...

674
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:48,160
He and some other guys got to have a special time with former CIA head John McLaughlin.

675
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,920
I didn't know he had a head. I thought it was more like a giant foreskin coming out of his forehead.

676
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:01,420
Well, of course, there are many heads of the Hydra, but this guy used to be head of the CIA, John McLaughlin.

677
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,520
And he's also...

678
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,100
There are titular heads and titular heads.

679
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,640
He's also an amateur magician.

680
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:07,640


681
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:07,640


682
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,620
And so, that's how he...

683
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,760
You mean like a Crowleyian magician with a small K and a capital Z?

684
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,380
No, these are stage magicians, Dave.

685
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,960
Yes, yes, a sleight of hand.

686
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,120
Stage magicians, okay.

687
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:32,640
Now, the CIA head, in return for being taught some tricks, said that he would answer a secret question honestly for these magicians.

688
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,620
And not Jeff McBride, but I think his friend came up with a question.

689
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:37,620


690
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,260
And he was the one who answered the question that the head of the CIA had to answer.

691
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,200
Now, here's...

692
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,040
You mean he was that...

693
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,580
He was that...

694
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,480
You know that guy?

695
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,460
Whatever.

696
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:53,160
Here's the question that the magician was... decided to ask the former head of the CIA.

697
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,280
The question was, are there ancient astronauts?

698
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:04,760
And the CIA head, John McLaughlin, answered, not anymore.

699
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,220
.

700
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,580
Which kind of points up how dumb the question was.

701
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:18,460
By definition, if they're ancient astronauts, whether they were around or not, not anymore is a truthful answer.

702
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,060
What a clever fellow.

703
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah, I guess you don't get to be...

704
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,760
I wish I was as swift on my feet.

705
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,260
You don't get to be the...

706
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:28,320
That was a delightful answer for any rhetorician to try and unravel.

707
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,100
Who, who? That's what I said.

708
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:36,040
Well, you don't get to be head of the CIA unless you have something on the ball.

709
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,100
Or something on the president and all members of Congress.

710
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,820
For instance, George Herbert Walker Bush was the head of the CIA.

711
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,020
And look what jobs he and his kids got after that.

712
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:48,380
Yeah.

713
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:55,840
You know, so if you have... if you have a lot on the ball and on the other important guys, yeah, I guess you can get a lot done.

714
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,800
So anyway, that's the answer to the question, are there ancient astronauts?

715
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,000
Not anymore.

716
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,320
.

717
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,940
That's too bad.

718
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,480
That is brilliant.

719
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,700
I'd like to get a sample of that man's synapses so I could lick them with pleasure.

720
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:15,280
Well, but then you might not be a subgenius anymore if you caught some of that genius-ly disease.

721
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,640
No, same.

722
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:23,380
Well, frankly, Dudley, I don't prefer that kind of sanctimonious thank you and hello and goodbye.

723
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:30,600
You know, the people who are running the show, like a dog in heat, are penumbrant.

724
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,860
They're, you know, they're...

725
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,320
You know, all that other stuff.

726
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,820
And then...

727
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,160
And never mind.

728
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,220
What did you say about a dog in hate?

729
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,920
Yeah.

730
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,760
Dogs do...

731
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,180
A hateful dog.

732
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,220
As opposed to a dog in love.

733
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,800
I could blame my troubles on hateful dogs.

734
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,360
Dogs in love are dogs in heat, but not dogs in hate.

735
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,920
I guess we got that figured out.

736
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,380
Well, see, that's why Mexican people like draw more.

737
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,180
It's like, .

738
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,920
You know, like it's a draw type thing.

739
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,220
It's not syntax.

740
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,260
It's cadence, man.

741
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,140
That's what it's all about.

742
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,440
It's not about dogs or furniture or anything.

743
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,240
These things are all replaced by a higher understanding.

744
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,500
This is really ridiculous, man.

745
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,920
This planet's screwed up.

746
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,740
Oh, now you're blaming it on the planet.

747
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,120
Well, I didn't say it was the planet's fault.

748
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:30,120
I was saying the inhabitants have created a system that not only is not good, but it doesn't work.

749
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,880
Blame it on the ancient astronauts.

750
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,020
That's what I said.

751
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,100
Well, at least they don't exist anymore.

752
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,800
Not anymore.

753
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,640
Not that I know of.

754
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:48,180
Yeah, obviously the better question would have been, are there aliens working on Earth

755
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:48,680
today?

756
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,220
Today.

757
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,760
To which he didn't, you know...

758
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,740
Or how about, did ancient astronauts once exist?

759
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,420
He would have to answer that, and yes or no, and you could pin it in his testicles while

760
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,560
you danced on the desk and scream with the laying in the back with the secretary of the

761
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:01,560


762
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:01,560


763
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:01,560


764
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:01,860
of the government.

765
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:31,740
When the

766
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,660
gets you through the day. I think I'm quoting

767
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,760
the cigarette man from X-Files.

768
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,960
The only episode of X-Files

769
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,220
that I ever saw

770
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,440
had that notable line.

771
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,400
Some sweet loveburger

772
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,540
hippie was going, but I mean, people are

773
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,500
basically nice, right? They're basically okay,

774
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,600
right? And the cigarette man

775
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,920
goes, whatever gets you through the day,

776
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,480
I guess.

777
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,520
They're basically evil.

778
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,220
Well,

779
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,820
I don't know.

780
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,060
I have hope in my heart.

781
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,300
Somewhere in me

782
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,180
there's hope. Maybe not my heart.

783
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,160
Certainly not in my brain, but there's hope

784
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,840
somewhere. Is it springing eternal?

785
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,400
Well, that's why I have to...

786
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,060
If your hope

787
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,940
springs eternal for more than three hours,

788
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,960
consult a physician.

789
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,360
Use this tiny

790
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,520
clamp and see what Grandma has to say.

791
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,520
Can I have some of those

792
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,260
pills that make my hope spring eternal?

793
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,700
Doctor.

794
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,880
She uses

795
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,200
her actual cause of regional

796
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,720
perinatal...

797
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,240
and why these

798
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,460
different various ways

799
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,400
of operating swamps...

800
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,740
Hey, Dave, I got to be a rock star

801
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,760
at Starwood.

802
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,800
On account of the lead singer of this band

803
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,640
called Tawakadaya.

804
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,480
Tawakadaya.

805
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,440
Tawakadaya.

806
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,280
They were impatiently waiting

807
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,600
while I finished my rant, my sermon

808
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,460
at Starwood on Saturday night.

809
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,100
The guy apparently liked it

810
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,560
because as they were climaxing,

811
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,560
their show with this outrageous

812
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,940
version of

813
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,200
We Will, We Will Rock You.

814
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,000
They had me

815
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
and some other

816
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,640
non-notables come up on stage

817
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,680
and I got to sing

818
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,100
along with We Will, We Will Rock You

819
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,620
in my

820
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,080
voice.

821
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,280
We will, we will.

822
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,200
Something like that.

823
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,080
Yeah, something like that.

824
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,020
It was sort of like that.

825
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,920
He did it rhythmically and it was wonderful.

826
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,720
Yeah, it was my one chance to be a rock star.

827
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,320
And I took it.

828
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,160
And nothing happened.

829
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,460
Nothing came of it afterwards.

830
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,040
Oh, well.

831
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,640
Now, I thought I remembered the lead singer

832
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,680
coming up to you after your rant

833
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,800
and saying that that was the coolest thing

834
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,180
he had ever heard in his life.

835
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,040
No, he said it was the most amazing thing

836
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,880
he'd ever heard.

837
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,620
But that's, you know how musicians are.

838
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,360
Now me thinks the poor lad is a bit delusional.

839
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,220
Well, he had simply never heard

840
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,780
any subgenius preacher.

841
00:42:59,160 --> 00:42:59,460
Right.

842
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,280
If he'd heard, say, Pope David

843
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,920
and Meyer back in the 80s,

844
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,520
that would have been the most amazing thing.

845
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,220
Or if he'd heard Priestess Pisces

846
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,560
doing that anger rant

847
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,700
that we just heard a minute ago.

848
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,140
That was the most amazing thing.

849
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,840
This guy only happened to see

850
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,520
a Starwood sermon.

851
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,260
And I actually turn it down

852
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,560
for those people, you know.

853
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,500
Yeah, you have to because the Wiccans

854
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,340
and the people with third eyes

855
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,260
instead of third nostrils and stuff

856
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,120
to be very, very feisty.

857
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,720
Like when it's around six o'clock in the morning

858
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,060
and the sun is just starting to come up

859
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,260
over the old campgrounds.

860
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,720
They're like doing the malicious tricks.

861
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,600
Well, they can do magic tricks.

862
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,320
They can make the milk go sour.

863
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,140
They can make the crops stop growing.

864
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,380
You know, witches, they can do all kinds of stuff.

865
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,300
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

866
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,900
Like speaking of goats and stuff,

867
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,440
if they're all the milk in the milking goats

868
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,460
and things like that, like it's some sort of pastoral scene

869
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,520
out in the wilderness that they want to create you

870
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,500
so they can send letters.

871
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,440
Emails back to whatever kind of concubine living quarters

872
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,680
they have back in Manhattan.

873
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,180
Well, what people blame on chemtrails

874
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,040
used to be blamed on witches.

875
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:12,840
Same difference.

876
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,260
Witches didn't need jet planes to foul the crops.

877
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,620
Yeah, they'd get on a broom and they'd fart their way into...

878
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,200
No, no, no.

879
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,140
They would put a spell on the oxen

880
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,440
and the oxen would...

881
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,020
Would control the weather.

882
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:26,880
Yeah, right.

883
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,280
Yeah, well, that's what we were trying to do here

884
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,100
in the day of tax.

885
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,960
The cow didn't want to cooperate.

886
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:37,400
No, I don't have much experience in animal husbandry,

887
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,020
but I was sure he had a third nostril

888
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,100
and I could not find it.

889
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,560
Dave, we're going to play an angry rant

890
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,940
that's not by a Wiccan,

891
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,000
but it's by a subgenius.

892
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,380
It's about five minutes long

893
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,640
and it's got a lot of cussing in it,

894
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,560
which only the internet listeners will hear.

895
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,940
It's got a lot of cussed words.

896
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,300
Yeah, cussed words.

897
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,980
This is coming up is Andrew the Impaled.

898
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,240
I'm going to pot you down

899
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,180
so that you can't breathe over it,

900
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,620
but I hope you'll be able to hear it

901
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,600
for five minutes.

902
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,060
Oh, and Reverend Baby Bear is playing bass

903
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,820
on this particular piece.

904
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,180
If I'm on the line,

905
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,400
I will be able to hear it, right?

906
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,580
Right, I think so.

907
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,140
Okay.

908
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,320
So just try not to cough.

909
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,460
You know, I have an awl in my ear

910
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,820
all the way to my eardrum.

911
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,100
Right, exactly.

912
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,100
So just try not to cough.

913
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:00,260
Okay.

914
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,600
Now there's a problem.

915
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,260
There's a problem

916
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:24,400
with the way some subgenius

917
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,700
be talking to themselves.

918
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,400
Now this problem

919
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,500
is one of accuracy.

920
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,880
There's a lot of

921
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,640
a lot of bullshit

922
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,420
that you be saying

923
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,300
to yourself.

924
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,860
It's one of the ways

925
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,720
the conspiracy keeps you down.

926
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,600
They encourage you

927
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,780
to bullshit yourself.

928
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,340
They train you

929
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,160
and retrain you.

930
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,540
When you leave these walls,

931
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,580
you go back

932
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,580
to be retrained

933
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,800
to bullshit yourself

934
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,560
with lies

935
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,580
like,

936
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,660
I can't!

937
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,960
Lies like,

938
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,120
I am.

939
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,320
See, when you talk about yourself

940
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,400
in the present tense,

941
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,620
you're insinuating not only the past

942
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,400
and the present, but also the future.

943
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,580
You are casting a meta

944
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,740
over yourself.

945
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,660
Now, you can't tell me shit about the future

946
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,560
other than one of these fucking days,

947
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,020
these fucking signs are going to show up.

948
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,520
We interrupt our program to bring you

949
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,760
this important message.

950
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,620
Now back to our show.

951
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,620
So when you say,

952
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,060
I am.

953
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,860
When you say,

954
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,460
I can't.

955
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,620
You're fucking full of shit.

956
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,460
Don't bullshit yourself.

957
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,180
Don't let them,

958
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,460
don't let them take your own boot

959
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,860
and put it on your own neck

960
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,060
with your own bullshit.

961
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,020
Say, I have.

962
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:24,560
I have.

963
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,560
I have been

964
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,600
late to work.

965
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:29,600


966
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:29,600


967
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:29,600


968
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:29,600


969
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:29,600


970
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,360
Every fucking day this week.

971
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,640
Okay, that can be true.

972
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:35,740
You can't say,

973
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,620
I'm always late to work

974
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,840
because that's bullshit.

975
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:42,980
You can say,

976
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,000
I haven't yet found my keys.

977
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,020
Because when you say,

978
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,520
I can't find my keys,

979
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,280
you're full of shit

980
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,040
and you shut off the part of your brain

981
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,980
that lets you know

982
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,040
what your keys are.

983
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,660
The parts of your brain

984
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,680
that knows what your keys look like

985
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,580
and can help you see things clearly.

986
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,900
When you shut those parts down

987
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,880
with your bullshit,

988
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,680
they don't work for you.

989
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,640
And so you're standing there and saying,

990
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,760
oh, we gotta go.

991
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,120
Well, I can't go.

992
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,020
Why can't we go?

993
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,440
Because I can't find my keys.

994
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,700
Are these your keys?

995
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,080
Oh!

996
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:20,600
Oh!

997
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,800
Because you're fucking bullshitting yourself.

998
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,800
So don't,

999
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:29,800
don't bullshit yourself.

1000
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,640
Say, I have.

1001
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,620
I have been.

1002
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,780
I have done.

1003
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,220
This is my past.

1004
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,680
Because that leaves the future open

1005
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,660
to possibility

1006
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,660
that could be different.

1007
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,780
It probably won't.

1008
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,600
I mean, you're probably still gonna fucking go late to work

1009
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,040
because you're a fucking slack-ass motherfucker.

1010
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:53,820
But,

1011
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,800
the possibility

1012
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,480
will be open.

1013
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,240
I will.

1014
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,880
Thank you, baby bear,

1015
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,620
for encouraging me to come up here and rant.

1016
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,200
Yes, yes, yes.

1017
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,800
Reverend Andrew the Impaled Bear.

1018
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,000
That was pretty slick, huh?

1019
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,720
Yeah, that was really truly inspiring.

1020
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,500
I think you should get, like, one of those

1021
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,220
um, polymer wigs and stuff

1022
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,760
and grease it up real good

1023
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,760
and, like, have a baboon suit

1024
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,360
and a pair of earrings

1025
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,900
and come out and say that every day

1026
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,400
until you make a million bucks.

1027
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,880
You know, I have to admit,

1028
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,500
that never would have occurred to me.

1029
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,480
Mm.

1030
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,100
Any of those ideas that you just advanced.

1031
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:45,940
Nor I.

1032
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,680
No, no, no, no, uh,

1033
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,200
income based on the positive thinking aspect of it.

1034
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,460
Listen to,

1035
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,340
listen to it over and over again

1036
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,640
and you'll see what he's selling.

1037
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,100
He's selling you a system

1038
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,520
that he's gonna try and make money off of you.

1039
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:02,520
What?

1040
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,780
No, no, no.

1041
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,240
No, I was making money off of him.

1042
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,400
Yeah.

1043
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,380
Technically, I think.

1044
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,960
But not you.

1045
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,000
No, I meant, uh, one...

1046
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,680
Well, the foundation.

1047
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,980
The mighty, uh, subgenius foundation.

1048
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,020
Incorporated.

1049
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,740
Yeah, that's a way of explaining that platform.

1050
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:19,640
Yeah.

1051
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:20,560
Yeah.

1052
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,400
Right.

1053
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:21,960
It works.

1054
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,080
It works.

1055
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,660
That's, that's our, uh, agenda.

1056
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,140
Right.

1057
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:24,860
That's the word.

1058
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,400
Agenda.

1059
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,940
That's our current agenda.

1060
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:32,420
I have, I was, I did, I have done, I have.

1061
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,940
You know what we, what we didn't have, though, at X Day?

1062
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,200
We didn't have Lone Cow Dave.

1063
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:38,840
No.

1064
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,820
Or fossilized pizza that's used to wear on your neck like an earring.

1065
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:46,020
That's, well, we did have that, but we, we didn't,

1066
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,660
we didn't have Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1067
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,500
We did have, uh, bands, both good and bad.

1068
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:56,420
Uh, we've heard, tonight we heard Evolution Control Committee, Andrew the Impaled, Fat

1069
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:04,820
Man D, Mutant Mountain Boys, 17 Fisted Tales of Bob, uh, well, actually it was just mostly

1070
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,640
Baby Bear on bass there, I think.

1071
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,680
But there was also another band.

1072
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,080
She's a, she's a bassist?

1073
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:16,860
There was, there was a band there, Dave, that was, they were there the year before, and

1074
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:21,240
I told Pisces, man, that band, Arm, Arm Neji Front.

1075
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,540
It was terrible.

1076
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,740
And, uh, she goes, well, um, they're gonna play again this year.

1077
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,420
I went, what?

1078
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:34,820
Yeah, they're gonna play again this year, but you'll see, the subgeniuses will like that.

1079
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,980
I was going, no, no, no, that can't be.

1080
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:43,760
No one can, this is the, really, truly, this is like pretty much the worst band you could ever imagine.

1081
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,900
They were local, uh, guys.

1082
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,460
Reverend Absent was one of them.

1083
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,320
They all lived in, uh, Athens.

1084
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,820
That's a good name for a band which cannot, okay.

1085
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,620
Well, the name of the band was Arm Neji Front.

1086
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:08,440
They gave me a CD package, not that I wanted it exactly, but it came with a rotten corn cob and a CD and a bunch of little toys.

1087
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:09,200
The toys were good.

1088
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,500
And your heart was sold, yes.

1089
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,700
Groovy little toys.

1090
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:16,600
But that bribe didn't, didn't really work for me because they remained.

1091
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,300
Well, what's the worst part?

1092
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,820
The worst band you can think of, Dave.

1093
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,780
I mean, uh, uh, present company excluded.

1094
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,960
Um, well, I was gonna say myself, actually.

1095
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:36,360
I was gonna say, uh, a performance in Columbus about 30 years ago where we, we couldn't figure out what we were doing up there somehow.

1096
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:41,300
Well, that was my favorite, that was my favorite Einstein Secret Orchestra concert.

1097
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,840
We, we actually spent valuable time.

1098
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:50,200
We could have been entertaining somehow and moved objects, absurd objects from room to room like in that old S Play Wilson.

1099
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,860
No, no.

1100
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,180
We actually retuned pianos that couldn't be tuned.

1101
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,960
We, uh, people booed.

1102
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:01,760
Was that at a Subgenius show or was that something else?

1103
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,220
It was a proto-Subgenius show.

1104
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,780
Yeah, that's what, they put the sub in Subgenius.

1105
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:08,700
Yeah.

1106
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:14,920
Okay, well, I'm gonna play a short segment here and you'll thank me for it.

1107
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:15,660
Not Arm Neji Front.

1108
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,480
You're gonna actually play them?

1109
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,020
I'm gonna actually play a little bit of Arm Neji Front.

1110
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:20,180
Oh, no.

1111
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,600
You can see that I wasn't kidding.

1112
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,960
Oh, I thought the moral of the story was that they practiced and they were great this year.

1113
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,340
Oh, well, you, here, I'm gonna just...

1114
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,300
You just have to hear it, Dave.

1115
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,220
...be quiet for two minutes and just listen to this.

1116
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,140
Yucka yucka!

1117
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,060
That sucks!

1118
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,520
That's fucking horrible!

1119
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,520
Sucks!

1120
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,220
Yucka yucka!

1121
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,880
Yucka yucka!

1122
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,940
Yucka yucka!

1123
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:02,860
Thank you.

1124
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,760
Thank you.

1125
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,700
Yucka yucka!

1126
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,520
That's the worst band that's ever possibly existed.

1127
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:17,240
My biggest fear is the subgeniuses will love this band more than any other.

1128
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,180
It hurts to hear that.

1129
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1130
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1131
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1132
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1133
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1134
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1135
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1136
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1137
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1138
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1139
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1140
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1141
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1142
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1143
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1144
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1145
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,180


1146
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:23,180
In first my ears, everything about it is wrong.

1147
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,900
Just tell it to y'all you're sorry.

1148
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,280
Yucca, Yucca!

1149
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,420
Hey, we already played that.

1150
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,080
Free Bird!

1151
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,880
You guys suck!

1152
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:39,320
I can't believe how bad that is!

1153
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,980
Chances are...

1154
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,740
Scandalous.

1155
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:45,620
Ready?

1156
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,440
All right, this is everybody's FM classic.

1157
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,400
One, two, three, four, go!

1158
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:19,280
Yup.

1159
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,740
They could have been worse.

1160
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,780
No, I don't know if it could have been worse.

1161
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,560
I think they could have been worse because they were trying to do something interesting.

1162
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,760
And doing it very badly.

1163
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,600
But what if they were trying to do, like, sucky music and doing it badly?

1164
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,200
Yeah, that's what we sounded like.

1165
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:42,800
It was like people were actually stopping and starting in the middle of these elaborate parts that they had worked out really hard to sound really great.

1166
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:48,280
But trying and failing to make good music, interesting music, is better than trying and failing to make...

1167
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,080
...crummy music.

1168
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,860
Well, I think it's some great stuff, but...

1169
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,680
I don't know that I'm the worst kind.

1170
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:59,500
Well, the funny thing was that band got the peep...got all the subgeniuses onto their feet.

1171
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,680
Well, the ones who had feet.

1172
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:03,160
I'd rather listen to that band than, uh, say, no effects.

1173
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,760
Those that were ambulatory actually stood up on whatever those things are.

1174
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:13,400
You know, their performance trick is that they drop trowel about a third of the way through the show.

1175
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,440
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that.

1176
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:14,920
Yeah.

1177
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,420
We have a photograph of one of the musicians who was wearing a mask.

1178
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,600
A monster mask and almost nothing else.

1179
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:29,760
Uh, taking a...a...a...a...a...a...a dump in the pulpit.

1180
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,220
Inside the pulpit.

1181
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,220
You could crouch...my pulpit is really huge.

1182
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,280
It's a bull...pulp...bully pulpit.

1183
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:40,240
And you can...there is room for a large guy to crouch in there.

1184
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,120
Or usually it's a large woman when I'm preaching, but we...

1185
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,760
It's pretty good that we have a door marked WC on the...yeah.

1186
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,320
Yeah, there's a photograph of the...the...

1187
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:50,360
Oh, and, uh, Reverend...

1188
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,200
Well, not the first time someone's taking a dump in your pulpit.

1189
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:56,560
There were people there who were so upset by this band.

1190
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,660
Now, some of them loved it.

1191
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,700
Reverend Susie Flusie just went crazy.

1192
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,440
They were covering some of her favorite band songs.

1193
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,020
Yes.

1194
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:07,420
But, uh, Reverend Heathen finally got absolutely incensed.

1195
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:12,140
And he went up there with a sledgehammer and beat the organ.

1196
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,080
I mean, he literally sledgehammered the organ.

1197
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,500
It was a baseball bat.

1198
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,720
Oh, it was a baseball bat.

1199
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,120
Yeah, it wasn't a sledgehammer.

1200
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:27,580
It's the first time I've seen a keyboard instrument utterly destroyed in a concert since Dockstock No. 1.

1201
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:28,380
What kind of organ is this?

1202
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,200
Well, this sounds like a fib because...

1203
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,540
An old-fashioned, not a...

1204
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:31,780
A liability.

1205
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,860
A vintage...musical instrument.

1206
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,320
A vintage, great, big, huge...

1207
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,540
Was destroyed.

1208
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,100
Yes.

1209
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,560
A vintage, large organ. There's pictures of it.

1210
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,820
They don't make them like that anymore.

1211
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:46,720
The videos did not come out very well, but there's some photographs of this great, big organ.

1212
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:54,720
And then I think Reverend Cyclohexane picked up the now-detached keyboard and pretended to be rocking out with it.

1213
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:54,940
Yes.

1214
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,660
We do have a photograph of that.

1215
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:03,080
Well, I think for such a noble effort, I think that's not very nice of a thing to do to somebody's antique instrument.

1216
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,600
And who's going to pay for it?

1217
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,840
Because I'm seriously incensed now about that.

1218
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:15,120
Well, you know, at Subgenius X days, it's really kind of hard to know when something was planned to look unplanned...

1219
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:22,860
Or planned to be bad, or planned to look like an accident, or whether it really was an accident or bad.

1220
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:26,800
Well, that would be it then. That would be the ultimate punchline then, of course.

1221
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,880
This is so bad that I'm coming up there and beating the blank out of the...yeah, that's it.

1222
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:43,580
And if anyone wants to know more about what's going on with X Day, Church of the Subgenius, Starwood Festival, any of that, you can look at subgenius.com on the internet.

1223
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,100
And, well, you know...

1224
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,900
I'm going to read you a revisionist organ.

1225
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:59,920
We have to go now, because it's about a minute and a half left, and there's one offensive parable by Reverend Scull left to play.

1226
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,180
Although this was actually read by Reverend Scull.

1227
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,060
So, Dave, I'm going to have to kiss you goodbye.

1228
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,100
Don't, don't, don't kiss me there.

1229
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,580
Sorry, Dave. Okay, we'll be back next week with Dave.

1230
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:14,320
And...

1231
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,600
And now, Reverend Scull. Praise God.

1232
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,940
I forgot, I didn't print this one out, but here's another story of Bob.

1233
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,300
One day, Bob was walking his sales route.

1234
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:32,620
And as he came down the street, he saw this little girl sitting on the curb, crying.

1235
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:36,040
Bob says, well, what's wrong, little girl?

1236
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:40,060
The girl goes, my mom's always passed out from the drink.

1237
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:44,200
She never makes me food. I am so barely hungry.

1238
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,060
Bob goes, hmm, where's your mom now?

1239
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,760
Oh, she's passed out on the sofa.

1240
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,620
So Bob says, oh, on the sofa, huh?

1241
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:59,120
He runs into the house, rips off his clothes, and then violates the girl's mother every way she can.

1242
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,280
No poor orifice was saved from Bob's violation.

1243
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:12,980
And then after hours, the girl walks in to see Bob putting on his pants, and her mother dripping and oozing from every poor orifice on her body.

1244
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,220
Is that you?

1245
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,360
The little girl asks Bob.

1246
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,560
Oh, mister, is my mother here?

1247
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:22,160
And Bob says, what, what? Oh, sure, kid, whatever.

1248
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,040
Praise Robert's soul!

1249
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,000
Oh, cheers!

1250
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,340
That explains a lot to my life. Thank you.

1251
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:47,240
Bob says, good idea, Dobbs. J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1252
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,860
Oh, sire, there is no more money.

1253
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,320
We gotta get some money!

1254
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:58,840
That dirty, perky, shark-a-pack, flat and warton, fill-a-bunker, burton, perkaluma, burton, dirt and bush tonight!

1255
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,300
Beep, beep.

1256
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:10,360
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show, and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1257
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,200
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other channels.

1258
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,480
And all the other archive sites.

1259
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,960
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1260
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:33,340
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you, you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages, and help out financially as best you can.

1261
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:41,320
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty, and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1262
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,260
But some of you still have jobs.

1263
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:51,180
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1264
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,540
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1265
01:02:55,080 --> 01:03:02,060
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs if you don't pay dogs.

1266
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:08,820
We also take checks and money orders to subgeniusfoundation.com.

1267
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,000
P-O-box.

1268
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,300
One-eighth-fifth.

1269
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:11,300


1270
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:11,540
Eight-one.

1271
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,720
Four-one-seven.

1272
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,660
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1273
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,680
Four-four.

1274
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:20,380
One-one-eight.

1275
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:25,560
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1276
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:45,120
We're going to do it again next year.

1277
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,040
Thank you.

1278
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:47,760
Thanks.

1279
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:48,420
Thanks.

1280
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:48,840
Thanks.

1281
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,060
Thanks.

1282
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,800
Thanks.

1283
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:55,840
Thanks.

1284
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:56,020


1285
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:56,660
Thanks.

1286
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,300
Thanks.

1287
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:03,740
That's money, Bob!

1288
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:04,500
Kill me!

1289
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,500
That's money, Bob!
