12
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,840
threaten the citizens and the values for which we stand.

13
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,720
Today, the United States is operating within our borders, waiting to strike again.

14
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,740
Every year, the United States welcomes 35 million prompt and effective transfers to our country.

15
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,100
Prompt and effective businessmen seek also to penetrate our students.

16
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,340
More than 700,000 of these come from countries in which Al has been active.

17
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,740
As a result, we have tightened our citizens.

18
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,540
In June, we announced the National Citizen Registration System.

19
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,620
This system reflects a fundamental fact of the war on citizens.

20
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,260
The fact is that terrorism is the best friend and most valuable resource of law enforcement.

21
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,100
The National Citizen Registration System will track two citizens in the first year,

22
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,280
stopping citizens while they are in the country.

23
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,320
For 10 months, we have been working with the United States to ensure that the citizens

24
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,320


25
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,860
For 10 months, we have conducted a campaign to identify, disrupt, and dismantle the Justice Department

26
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,140
for spitting on the sidewalk in the fight against organized citizens.

27
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,280
Well, in the war on justice, we have conducted the largest citizens investigation in history.

28
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,920
129 million individuals have been charged.

29
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,460
86 million have been found guilty.

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,620
Hundreds more in connection with the investigation.

31
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,380
We have been successful in protecting our arsenal.

32
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,160
But we are not illusions.

33
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,120
There remain sleepers in the United States who have action against them.

34
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,300
And as we limit the access of U.S. citizens to our country,

35
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,400
we recognize that the permanent residents carry out their attacks.

36
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,040
Individuals now being detained by the Department of Defense

37
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,940
as a plan to explode a dirty citizen on soil.

38
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,980
I thank you for your leadership and this opportunity to testify.

39
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,120
Thank you.

40
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,260
Thank you.

41
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,020
The stick.

42
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,180
The question.

43
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,440
The question.

44
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:43,760
The question.

45
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,380
The question.

46
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,740
The question.

47
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,600
The question.

48
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,620
The question.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,540
The question.

50
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:54,640
The question.

51
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,480
The question.

52
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,200
The question.

53
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,380
The question.

54
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,740
The question.

55
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,900
The question.

56
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,580
Who is not afraid to sing and write about the poor?

57
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,060
Bob!

58
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,780
Who is not afraid to sing and write against the war?

59
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,160
Bob!

60
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,800
Who's not afraid to sing the problems that we have?

61
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,400
Who's not afraid to sing about the good and bad?

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,820
Who's not afraid to sing for us to understand?

63
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,500
Who's not afraid of being just another man?

64
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,180
Who is not afraid?

65
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,660
Who's not afraid, not afraid of?

66
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,080
I'm not afraid, not afraid of

67
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,640
Bob!

68
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,640
Bob!

69
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,520
Bob!

70
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,300
Bob!

71
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:04,780
Bob!

72
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,960
Who gave folk and rock music its name?

73
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:11,840
Official name?

74
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,320
Bob!

75
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,520
Who did what he got me?

76
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,120
How did fluence as a friend?

77
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,500
Bob!

78
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,340
Bob!

79
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,180
Who is coming back again, fighting for his sons?

80
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,540
Who's not afraid to sing of people and politics?

81
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,360
Who's not afraid to write and sing of people's trips?

82
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,000
Who's not afraid?

83
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,540
Who's not afraid, not afraid of?

84
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,060
I'm not afraid, not afraid of.

85
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,820
Bob!

86
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,160
Bob!

87
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:50,720
Bob!

88
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:51,660


89
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,120
That's who saved your butt, my friend.

90
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,100
Bob saved your butt.

91
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,520
The Ballad of Bob by David Peel

92
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,620
and the Lower East Side

93
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,820
tagged by...

94
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,520
MediaSapiens at Freaker.net.

95
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,960
Friends, I am swamped with new material for this show.

96
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,900
There are some incredibly creative mutants out there.

97
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,000
In fact, there was so much to choose from that I started breaking it down into categories.

98
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:36,380
And those categories then form the themes of future shows.

99
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,740
For instance, the next show will be on drugs and drunks.

100
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,860
And after that, love.

101
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,180
This show's theme is the war thing.

102
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,440
And, you know, there's some killer recent material on that subject,

103
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,400
but not by very many subgenii.

104
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,560
In fact, after I was done culling it all down about the only new war

105
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,800
and questioning the government type stuff on alt-binary,

106
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,360
slash,

107
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:11,520
were a series of absolutely astounding collages

108
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,000
that had variously been done by Fernanda Nandeli-Moore,

109
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,560
Champion Jack Codini,

110
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,680
and a newish fellow named DJ Epoch.

111
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,860
Go figure, friends.

112
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,380
I thought they all were patriots, psychotic, and narco-materialists

113
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,720
who had tuned out and dropped out.

114
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,080
Like me.

115
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,360
But it turned out we were all a bunch of pro-tits.

116
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,240
Testers, after all.

117
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,120
Also, of course,

118
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,880
lots of Cowboy Dave and Chaz Smith

119
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,440
on ESO Radio at WCSB Cleveland,

120
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,440
greatest college station in America.

121
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,860
And friends,

122
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,940
this coming up right now is from Champion Jack Codini.

123
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,220
Thank you, and praise Bob.

124
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,140
Thank you.

125
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,140


126
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,000
I have a lot to be thankful for tonight.

127
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,000
I was not elected.

128
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,800
Thank you very much.

129
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,380
Of course, I should reach Jet Prop 1

130
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,040
and launch my missiles in 28 hours.

131
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,200
Would you like to see some projected kill ratios?

132
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,900
I believe things happen for a reason.

133
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,620
Republicans want fear and cruelty.

134
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,280
I'm optimistic this can happen,

135
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,940
and I will give it my all.

136
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,180
And it will be a foundation of my administration.

137
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,640
Thank you.

138
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,680
Thank you.

139
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,620
Thank you.

140
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,340
Thank you.

141
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,620
Thank you.

142
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:09,620


143
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:09,620


144
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:09,620


145
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,600
I appreciate so very much the members of Congress

146
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,720
who have joined me in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts,

147
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,520
and will be open for business.

148
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,160
By destroying our way of life,

149
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,100
our first priority is to sustain comprehensive and relentless business.

150
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,160
Thank you very much.

151
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,320
Thank you.

152
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,500
Thank you.

153
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,340
Thank you.

154
00:09:36,360 --> 00:10:03,320
Oh, my God.

155
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,580
Now we're on.

156
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,360
So what's up?

157
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:22,240
Well, I normally don't worry about that war stuff,

158
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,780
but I've been getting letters from kids that were worried about that war stuff.

159
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,540
Yeah.

160
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,280
I think they should be.

161
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,000
Well, I got a very plaintive letter from somebody I figure

162
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,260
is probably a young man.

163
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,300
I think of him as the naive, idealistic young man.

164
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,600
And he was saying,

165
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:51,440
it seems like people are just letting the conspiracy

166
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,660
just walk all over them and destroy the Constitution,

167
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,360
and this time nobody's even getting upset.

168
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,780
They're just acting like, oh, that's perfectly normal.

169
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,300
Oh, you can't fight.

170
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,660
What's happened is anybody who defies the government

171
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,620
now perceived to be some kind of stupid, wimpy hippie?

172
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,220
And we must do something.

173
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,200
What can we do?

174
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,820
Legalizing pot isn't enough, he said.

175
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,680
There must be some.

176
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,080
And all I could tell the kid was,

177
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,340
if you want to weaken them, strengthen yourself.

178
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,320
You can't change.

179
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,000
You can't force anybody to change.

180
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,340
Uh-uh.

181
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,400
You can.

182
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,620
You can change where you're at.

183
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,080
Uh-huh.

184
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,560
You can, you can, uh...

185
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,380
Well, you gotta get your money and you gotta get your pay.

186
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,820
That's the drawback to all that, you know, fancy talk.

187
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,380
Yeah, well, what can you do?

188
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,640
What should...

189
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,460
What should kids do out there?

190
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,360
What direction should they go?

191
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,300
That's, that's, uh, up to each individual kid.

192
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,700
They're all gonna have...

193
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,880
Only each kid knows what it does best.

194
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,800
It.

195
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,700
You know, it, the kid.

196
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,720
Not to be sexist.

197
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,840
I could say he or she, but that's kind of clumsy.

198
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,000
I just prefer it since I think of them as half-formed creatures.

199
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,760
I think of them as children, really.

200
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,520
I see why they'd be really concerned.

201
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,520
They've never had...

202
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:52,100
They've never seen this, this drum beating and war stuff in their lifetimes yet, big time.

203
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,980
It's like the Cold War again, sort of, you know?

204
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,660
Big, giant threats hanging over your head all the time.

205
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,320
I grew up thinking it was gonna be like Planet of the Apes.

206
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,780
And then I thought...

207
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,260
We must...

208
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,900
Protest.

209
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,000
And...

210
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,800
And I, I, I got, I tried to make artwork that would change the world.

211
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,160
Art.

212
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,100
Little movies.

213
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,440
Things like that.

214
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,580
Underground films that would, that would change the world.

215
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,620
But all they did was make all the hippies really depressed.

216
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,260
And mad at me.

217
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:35,540
And...

218
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,500
Thank God for Bob, though.

219
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,180
Bob came along and saved me.

220
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,380
I was the first Bobby.

221
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,140
Yep.

222
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,240
I don't, I don't mind admitting it.

223
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,080
People put down the Bobbies.

224
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,260
Like, like Moonies.

225
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,860
It's a derogatory term.

226
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,120
But I don't call people Bob.

227
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,060
Not specific people Bobbies.

228
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,680
Because...

229
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,160
Because I'm the, the original Bobby.

230
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,140
I was the first one that worked for Bob without knowing him personally.

231
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,380
And without pay.

232
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,140
That's a pretty Bobby-ish, stupid, religious nut thing to do.

233
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:12,760
Yeah.

234
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:13,820
But...

235
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:14,680
And now...

236
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,620
That's the way it goes.

237
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:16,960
Now...

238
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,940
Well, now I get to sit at home listening to music as loud as I want.

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,240
Doing anything I want to do.

240
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,040
And just watching the money roll in.

241
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,660
Just rolling in.

242
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,540
A wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow.

243
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,260
Brought in by those Zombobs.

244
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,020
Zombobs.

245
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,860
The little employees, they get like 50 cents an hour.

246
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,080
Sort of a token pay.

247
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,600
Slack pay, we call it.

248
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,560
Are you listening, sheeple?

249
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:04,940
Zombobs.

250
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,280
, Zombobs.

251
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,400
Skull yeah, we don't pay no back, from full great�

252
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,200
zombobs.

253
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,140
Zombobs are the daft.

254
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,440


255
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,440


256
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,560
Hidretats.

257
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,740
I flew me a voodoo set for a day.

258
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,580
This could go a bit pickled.

259
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:25,580


260
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:25,580


261
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:25,940
Who do you talk to?

262
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,080


263
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,620
I asked our male� 9-B.

264
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,820
Yes, he said hello.

265
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,980
She asked if I meet hooks.

266
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:37,060
pose a threat. Understandably, children are now rotating even as they continue to play

267
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:42,660
elsewhere in the world. Meanwhile, Turkey, Kabul, Kabul, Kabul, has increased its Afghan

268
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:47,460
presence sending some children to Kabul to assume leadership of the International Security

269
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:53,880
Assistance Force. Already 500,000 children have offered weapons for this humanitarian

270
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,220
catastrophe. The U.S. and coalition partners have delivered some 28 needy children since

271
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:05,040
the start of the war, enough to feed the U.S. and coalition partners. Russia has cleared

272
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,300
out the north, including children. Thanks to those efforts, the grim predictions of

273
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:16,340
starvation came to pass. Demining teams have helped hundreds of thousands of landmines

274
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,400
in that country. U.S. civil affairs team built a hospital that has now treated more than

275
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:26,380
six patients, including children. They're being interrogated. They are yielding information

276
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,500
that is helping to prevent further children.

277
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,520
But perhaps the most important measure of progress is the flow of violence and bloodshed,

278
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:39,140
together with some children. They're coming back in Afghanistan. Our operations today

279
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:44,640
consist mainly of smaller children, cave-by-cave children, small pockets of children. Norway,

280
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,180
Denmark, and the Netherlands for air operations over children. Romania is deploying an infantry

281
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,400
battalion to Afghanistan and has offered an infant mountain company, a nuclear, biological,

282
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,900
and chemical response company, and four children.

283
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:08,120
People working in ethnography, meet up with their families and Thirty children will be

284
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,440
feelings of victory to be sent back to complete success.

285
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,160
I feel strong pride in д essentials, six families that have been

286
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,260
dispatched from their countries. They all tend to proorfäh ordered on America's

287
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,260


288
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,260


289
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,000
Terrorist security!

290
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,560
If we объясne Protest, that's the major goal system in the United States.

291
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:25,560


292
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:25,560


293
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,380
something they couldn't afford before.

294
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:26,380


295
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,680
They were good opponents in, and were really Täshiplines patients for it. But today's show is more usual.

296
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,040
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

297
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,200
It's just two fries. It's like we're the same.

298
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,520
We're just two fries.

299
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,540
Or he's 30 years old.

300
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,700
Recipe for showing off.

301
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,080
So where do you get so many that will be willing to shoot people?

302
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,620
Kind of recruit all year long.

303
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,300
Hey, would you like to go shoot people?

304
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,220
And of those who do, there's a real esprit de...

305
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,920
But we have the equivalent of about 100,000 Hiroshima bombs.

306
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,440
The target.

307
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,800
A loved one who is awake.

308
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,740
Four, three, two, one.

309
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,280
This little boy.

310
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,280
Nuclear force is a cheat.

311
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,440
It costs $35 a year to maintain.

312
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

313
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,760
You know, business picks up

314
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,800
in a funny kind of...

315
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
hideous way.

316
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,000
You know, Chaz, I was standing there looking...

317
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,320
You know, the conspiracy is going full steam now.

318
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,360
They've gotten off their asses.

319
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,680
They're busting their asses.

320
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,520
They're getting others to bust their ass for them.

321
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,540
Are you talking about the Republican conspiracy specifically?

322
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,780
The whole machine.

323
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,240
Because the whole machine has been doing that for thousands of years.

324
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,800
But they've really picked it up now.

325
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,780
I mean, it's really like in some kind of a...

326
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,520
Hyper mode.

327
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,440
They're high tech.

328
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,760
They probably have perfected the science of psychohistory.

329
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,480
They know how to make their future come true.

330
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:07,980
Yeah.

331
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,660
But the thing that makes me think that they won't ultimately succeed

332
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,700
is that they don't seem to be washing their ass.

333
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,600
Well, they're certainly not washing their ass.

334
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,000
No, they're not washing their ass.

335
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,020
But we're the ones suffering for it, see?

336
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:22,980
That's right.

337
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,760
Well, I was telling the idea...

338
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:25,780
Well, I was telling the idea...

339
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:25,780


340
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:25,780


341
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,080
Realistic kid, you know, all we can do...

342
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,960
This monster is so gigantic and so old

343
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,900
that all the weirdos in the world aren't enough to fight it

344
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,400
because it's made of all the normals in the world.

345
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,720
Therefore, about all we can do is hide in the chinks of its hide

346
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,660
until one of us is smart enough to come up with a way

347
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,820
to tie its shoelaces together and cause it to topple over

348
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,540
and crush itself of its own weight.

349
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,600
Which might just happen automatically.

350
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,740
As it did to the mighty dinosaur.

351
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,780
Is the conspiracy a mighty dinosaur soon to go under

352
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:14,260
and weave the little shrews destined to evolve into the next conspiracy?

353
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,320
Bob!

354
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,840
Now we must learn to work together if we are to understand your mental illness.

355
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,640
Bob!

356
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,340
How can I get you to accept your condition if you won't cooperate?

357
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,540
Bob!

358
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,620
All right.

359
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,980
Bob!

360
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,980
Fine.

361
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:38,540
Bob!

362
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,260
Bob!

363
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,480
Very good.

364
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,900
Bob!

365
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,660
Bob!

366
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,020
Mothra is not the answer.

367
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,720
To numb the area while separating blood from fat.

368
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,560
Mothra is not the answer.

369
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,840
Mothra is not the answer.

370
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,940
And neither is anything else, dear friends.

371
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,360
Or whatever he said.

372
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,860
That fine cut-up.

373
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,320
And in fact, pretty much all the other cut-ups and collages on this particular show

374
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,460
are part of a massive gout of spewage of sound editing

375
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:24,120
done recently by Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

376
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,920
Mothra!

377
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:34,820
That water-scattering bltrapping.

378
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,740
That sabotage of the

00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,940
weird thing that we don't know yet because there's never been one this big

419
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,660
that was this full of arch criminals like you

420
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,760
a convoy out in the sea there are one two three four five six seven german dive bombers

421
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,380
there's one going down on his target now no missed the ships he hasn't hit a single

422
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,400
ship there are about 10 ships in the convoy but he hasn't hit a single one

423
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:03,900
and

424
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,240
you

425
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,880
but let's leave things of this world behind

426
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,940
and walk now down the path of bob for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius

427
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:32,600
the devil owes you money friend but bob dobs is the bank where you can cash it in we gotta burn

428
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,960
out the banks of the devil we gotta root him out burn out the hate burn out the radiation

429
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,640
burn out the hate burn out the debt burn out the debt burn out the debt burn out the high

430
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:38,640

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:38,640


432
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,580
out the fire. These words may be harsh. They may not go down well on the polished ears of the

433
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:49,540
rationalist, the modernist, those who wish to see proof of Bob, but I don't care what they say.

434
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:56,240
I'll keep preaching. If you go down, pull them with you. Praise Bob. Help me, somebody. Let there be slack.

435
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:04,060
How did you know? Because Bob is nothing short of a damn coward and he's plainly crazy.

436
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:11,860
Bob Bob? Bob must!

437
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,140
Chapter 94

438
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:23,120
Bob spoke to Moses saying, command the children of Bob and tell them.

439
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:32,920
The main purpose of this project is the nuclear Bob Bob production. All Bob wires and

440
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,840
Bob.

441
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:40,600
Bob must! Set up their facilities. Bob must! Come back and do it. No charge. Bob!

442
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,080
We interrupt our program to bring you a special broadcast.

443
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,720
The National Company intends to continue throughout the rest of this night.

444
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,720
This is our official notification that we will continue throughout the remainder of these

445
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,600
nighttime hours. This is the National Company.

446
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,800
Bob must! Show me a series of tricks he taught his invisible monsters.

447
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,320
Bob walks free never to be tried again.

448
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:21,400
Bob spoke to Bob saying, Bob shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones.

449
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:33,980
Ex-ex-ex-free-all-of-body Bob Bob's Bob Bob's Bob Bob's must wed reformed gun mall because he has given of his seed to Bob to defile Bob and to profane my holy name.

450
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,220
Bob!

451
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:45,060
The world, crippled by these events, waited for the first sign of an invasion from Bob.

452
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,120
Bob! Bob! Bob!

453
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,460
Bob!

454
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,400
Bob Bob? Bob Bob?

455
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,560
Bob!

456
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,160
Ex-ex-ex-free-all-of-body.

457
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,920
Bob called to give Enron a break.

458
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,040
Bob! Bob called to give Enron a break.

459
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,680
We know that Bob called to do that.

460
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,080
No.

461
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,320
No.

462
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,080
Did anybody call Bob?

463
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:16,660
No.

464
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,560
No.

465
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,880
One final question, if I could.

466
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,800
No.

467
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:24,780
Okay.

468
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,080
Did Bob call you to give Enron a break?

469
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:36,680
Well, we, I mean, of when we, and I've testified that we was high.

470
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,520
I'm sorry.

471
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,160
You said no?

472
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,740
No.

473
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,580
Okay.

474
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,080
No.

475
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:52,180
And you were having calls from Bob asking you to hold off on your downgrading of Bob at that time?

476
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,900
We were.

477
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,060
Okay.

478
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,380
I'm going to downgrade.

479
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,660
No.

480
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,680
Thank you.

481
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,180
Do you think Bob made a mistake?

482
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,480
No.

483
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:07,860
No.

484
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,180
No.

485
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,640
To that extent, I do agree with Chairman Bob.

486
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:26,840
I got these dream recollections that a couple of the babes of the church posted to all.slack.

487
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,780
Somebody's pushing.

488
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,960
I'm going to go to the doorbell, like, really frantically.

489
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,040
The listeners can hear that little squeal.

490
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,780
Of course, you know what that's got to be.

491
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,480
Reverend Magdalene said,

492
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:43,560
I've just had a bad dream detailing what it would be like to be hit with a bioweapon epidemic.

493
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,680
First, only a few will get sick.

494
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:55,800
Soon, every illness reported will cause police and ambulances to swiftly and silently move in and remove the sick person.

495
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,060
Then someone will overhear.

496
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:03,560
The EMTs whispering among themselves and the word will be shouted on the street.

497
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,680
Epidemic.

498
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,720
Those who are well will not touch those who are sick.

499
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,000
Some will not be able to resist touching those they love, and they will become sick, too.

500
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,560
The sick will hold one another.

501
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,120
Even strangers and the fever will make them cheerful as they wait for the end.

502
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,120
They will talk about love.

503
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,400
They will dream about peace.

504
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,580
They will play.

505
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,680
As they flee, the rich will open their houses to the poor.

506
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,300
Medicine will be free and compulsory.

507
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:42,540
Eventually, the doctors will find medicine that will stop it, and even some of the sick will live.

508
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:51,900
Some will be no more than vegetables, like this man seen here on screen two.

509
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,080
He's festering already.

510
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,720
Look at all that.

511
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,500
Oh, the boils are amazingly large.

512
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,520
They're almost psychedelic.

513
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,940
They're bigger than the rest of his body.

514
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,940
We're going to get a picture of him before we put him out of his misery.

515
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,480
Can't we lance this one postule before we go?

516
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,140
I've enjoyed this so much.

517
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:08,720
Wait, wait, wait.

518
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,640
Let me get a snap of this.

519
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:10,740
Snap?

520
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,240
How about a pop?

521
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,260
Let's just squeeze it a little bit.

522
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,780
Well, yeah, yeah.

523
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,920
Hey, let's film that popping in slow motion.

524
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,160
Oh, my God.

525
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,940
Look, his brain is festering, too.

526
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,200
His entire brain is mounting.

527
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,500
Hey, his living will does say it's okay to do this, right?

528
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,560
He's living.

529
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,360
Ah, who cares?

530
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,520
It's the end of the world.

531
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,480
It's the plague.

532
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,000
The fever is catching on.

533
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:42,440
People wearing dark shoes will be led to the end of the building where they will be shot by transparent transvestites.

534
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,920
It's for your own good.

535
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:52,220
The perks of the doctors without front tears or front rears will far outweigh the rest of the civilian populace.

536
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:52,900
Far out.

537
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,660
No smoking in the gas chambers.

538
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,860
New foods will be eaten.

539
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,560
By those who can no longer digest their own stomachs.

540
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,040
This music will be heard in every corporate office building.

541
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,100
Every corporate office building will be a coffin.

542
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,940
They will be in prison.

543
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,820
A tomb.

544
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,240
Imprisoned.

545
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,880
But the fever will make you cheerful.

546
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,700
What good is it to live when life is nothing?

547
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,960
What good is it to live in a gymnasium?

548
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,440
It gets the mausoleum that took...

549
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,700
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

550
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,040
And cover yourself with the sheet.

551
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,360
The shroud.

552
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,640
And just lay there.

553
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,820
Until the shroud takes an imprint of you.

554
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:53,500
Maybe someday it will be worshipped as the imprint of a savior.

555
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,560
A true artifact of our Lord.

556
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,040
A master book.

557
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,560
A blaster.

558
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,040
Check the neck on that one, baby.

559
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:15,300
I for one would like to know what we're going to do with the efficacious bodies we have stored here in this stone's plunder.

560
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,660
And look, the mausoleums are all packed.

561
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,120
There's nothing we can do but shake our hands and ring our feet.

562
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,620
We're done ringing bells.

563
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,760
Not enough prisons.

564
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,020
Not enough mausoleums.

565
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,520
Not enough funeral parlors.

566
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,020
Not enough gravesites.

567
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,720
Not enough show cakes for all the stiffies.

568
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:42,860
The Grand Canyon couldn't hold the full population of the dead.

569
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,140
So we had to dig a new Grand Canyon.

570
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,620
A mass grave.

571
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,260
For the disbelievers and the believers.

572
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,400
And those who will believe anything.

573
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,840
The watches sure are cheaper.

574
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,000
The watches sure are cheaper.

575
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,280
The graves.

576
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,460
Yeah, you can get a good watch.

577
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,500
Well, you can get a good watch for nothing.

578
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,140
All stopped at the same time.

579
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,000
The graves.

580
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:13,680
The graves.

581
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,520
The graves.

582
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:15,580


583
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:16,880
The graves.

584
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:16,900


585
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,460
The graves.

586
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,460
The graves.

587
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,500
The graves.

588
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,880
The graves.

589
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:33,140
Are you the shaft of Bob's pipe, so to speak?

590
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,660
That through which others are sucked?

591
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,820
Have you been braced with the cleaning fluids of Bob?

592
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,800
Ha ha ha.

593
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,900
Ah, the pity.

594
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,620
Fated to drift forever through the void is gravity's plaything.

595
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,420
Oh, cruel fate.

596
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,040
To be thusly boned?

597
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,660
Ask not for whom the bone bones.

598
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,520
It bones for thee.

599
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:12,320
The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art.

600
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:13,980
Ah.

601
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,600
Ah, damn you!

602
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,580
Ah!

603
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,300
Ah!

604
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,280
Ah!

605
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,940
Ah!

606
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,400
TheлавVOGUE

607
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:56,400


608
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:56,400


609
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:56,400


610
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:56,400


611
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,640
The priest shall burn the head on the altar for a burnt lord.

612
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,240
It is a burnt head and it's made by sweet fire.

613
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,480
This is new. All new.

614
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,700
And medical science offers you proof positive.

615
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,700
You'll see the number 903 on the government stamp.

616
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:21,160
It is not a nice movie, people.

617
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,100
There will be no smoking in the death halls.

618
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,960
Throw it out. Window.

619
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,240
Dispose of all smoking materials in the morgues.

620
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,280
Watch out for that.

621
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,880
There are authorities here.

622
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,860
There are authorities here tonight.

623
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,500
And we do not want to piss off the gods and goddesses.

624
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,140
Where are you going to go?

625
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,980
Where are you going?

626
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,420
Hide when the man dressed in blue is on the inside.

627
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:03,260
When cannibalism is rampant and people stare at your feet on the bus waiting for a bite.

628
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,000
They haven't eaten in days.

629
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,260
They look at you like a snack.

630
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,860
The authorities are here, man.

631
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,120
They're here. They're inside your head, dude.

632
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,080
And they're hungry, too.

633
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,840
The authorities in your mind are hungry.

634
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,060
They want to consume the rest of the body culture.

635
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:20,620
Yeah.

636
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,160
They don't like what you did, man.

637
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,000
They're like the worm or obelisk that eats its own snake.

638
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,120
You're in big trouble with the authorities inside your head, dude.

639
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,240
Oh, you got problems, Barney.

640
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,220
The devil.

641
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,340
The devil is living inside your head.

642
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,420
The devil of the conspiracy is right there.

643
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,860
And he's ready to sign that check using your hand.

644
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,320
What you going to do about it, huh?

645
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,260
You just going to let him do it?

646
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,600
You going to let him do it?

647
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,740
The devil use you.

648
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,500
When you press that voting switch.

649
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,180
When you punch that little vote dot.

650
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,280
Are you going to let the devil use you when you pay that tax?

651
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,040
Are you going to let the devil use you when you put that rubber on?

652
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,940
Are you going to let the devil use you when you go in that chem can portable toilet?

653
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,520
I want you to ask yourself that, my friend.

654
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,240
You lay down in front of the smoke screen.

655
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,360
You let the devil into your body.

656
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,280
You let the devil in your body.

657
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,300
You let the devil in your body.

658
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,540
Well, he's in your spinal fluids now.

659
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,000
And let's begin the contest.

660
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,080
These are good spinal fluids you got from that listener, Dave.

661
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,940
I notice my perception is so much clearer and brighter and crisper.

662
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,920
It's as if I can see through the walls.

663
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,760
My own hands are pulsing like those light bulbs.

664
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,440
Cool, man.

665
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,220
I love the way you can do that.

666
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,260
Just by sapping the attention.

667
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,480
span off of those listeners

668
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,660
while they listen.

669
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,400
Yes, it's a digital delay.

670
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,640
You merely place your thumb in one hole

671
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,520
and put your hand in the other one

672
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,980
and the brain is completely under your control.

673
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,580
Cool.

674
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,920
Why must we talk constantly

675
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,740
of the conservation of these

676
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,120
millions and billions of dead bodies here?

677
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,700
The necrophilia has become rampant.

678
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,200
A dead man's vote.

679
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,520
That's your vote, friend.

680
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,380
Your vote is a dead man's vote.

681
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,040
Dead man's voting.

682
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,980
You put your shoes on this morning.

683
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,860
Somebody else should be putting them on tomorrow.

684
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,320
When they flip that flip-top box.

685
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,220
You were a dead man the minute you were born.

686
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,340
The minute you walked out of your ma's

687
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,520
or a yay-yay hole.

688
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,000
You were dead.

689
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,480
You were on your way to the grave.

690
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,560
It's a long trek.

691
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,220
Hey, buddy, my mom ain't got no yay-yay hole.

692
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,120
Now, why don't you take that right home?

693
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,460
We're all going to the same place, bub.

694
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,540
Yes, the great womb is spewing forth

695
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,260
stillborn bodies.

696
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,040
Wow, look at those little water heads popping out.

697
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,140
They're like little zygos that can't make it up the river.

698
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,320
Look, they're just pooping.

699
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:20,860
They're just pooping right out.

700
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:25,980
Some of them are screaming to Ishtar and the other old ones.

701
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,840
I don't think it will make much difference, do you?

702
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,380
Oh, that's what's so wonderful about nature.

703
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,080
Death allows new life to come.

704
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,820
And as those bodies float down the river,

705
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,020
why, new little babies are being born

706
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,000
all up and down the riverside.

707
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,160
Look at those screaming women giving birth.

708
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,400
Thousands and thousands, as far as the eye can see.

709
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,120
Are they going to make some great sandwiches?

710
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,560
Or are the seagulls going to be happy tonight?

711
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,280
Billions of potential copper tops.

712
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,180
Buildings full of potential copper tops.

713
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:01,840
Ishtar.

714
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,100
Yeah.

715
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,260
Traveling by small boat and pack horse,

716
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,360
conservationists have come to this remote spot

717
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,720
to tear off strips of decaying meat.

718
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,960
First to arrive at a dead sheep,

719
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,320
conservationists take advantage of landfills,

720
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:20,320


721
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,740
and then they turn to larger size to evict smaller birds.

722
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,960
A feeding hierarchy minimizes conflicts

723
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,600
over insect larvae infesting the carcass,

724
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,780
but doesn't entirely eliminate them.

725
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,020
The general rule is all males, except for the youngest,

726
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,560
eat before females,

727
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,800
and older conservationists eat before younger.

728
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,080
Sated for now,

729
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,340
the conservationists may return over several days

730
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,520
to finish the carcass.

731
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,660
Come morning,

732
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,660
conservationists expose themselves

733
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,580
by slowly unfolding on the bare rock floor.

734
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,260
They install cameras

735
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,880
to observe the chick on the dead sheep.

736
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,580
One after another, they step off the cliffs.

737
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,920
A dimension in another dimension.

738
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,760
The sure sign of dying on the ground.

739
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,360
That means you get all this absolutely free.

740
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,300
A whopping.

741
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,080
One hundred dollar value.

742
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,900
All absolutely free.

743
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,380
But you gotta call now.

744
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,820
Here's how to order.

745
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,940
Call 1-800-338-311-911-338-319-99-3119

746
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:31,500
or send it.

747
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,160
One hundred dollar.

748
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,100
Check or money order to Bob.

749
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,360
Well, how shall we resurrect the body politic?

750
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,920
We put this question to the Reverend Ivory Smiles

751
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,340
of the Church of the Sub-Hanio

752
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,080
in Australia.

753
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,060
In Australia, I think it's...

754
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,900
Oh, well, they're already doing it.

755
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,180
They've got strings that like,

756
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,540
and they're operating the body politic like a puppet.

757
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,080
They're moving the corpse around like a marionette

758
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,040
using their strings of control.

759
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,080
Ah, the psychic tampons,

760
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,020
which make the children dance

761
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,460
when there is no music.

762
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,860
Our favorite song.

763
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,060
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

764
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,640
I don't know, Dave.

765
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,280
I don't know, it was a shower.

766
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,840
I keep wanting to be involved

767
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,240
and do something about society

768
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,380
and the world and the war

769
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,220
and the problems.

770
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,480
Oh, hi, Cynthia.

771
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,920
When did you float in here?

772
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,640
But, but I just, I don't even,

773
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,300
you know, I've just lost all interest completely.

774
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,800
It's like, it's all so distant and so...

775
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,480
They're going to use buses on us, Dane.

776
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,900
They're not going to use those like, you know,

777
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,420
railway cars like they did in the 40s.

778
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,560
Oh, well, then it'll get personal.

779
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,420
Then I'll be concerned.

780
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,140
When they come for me

781
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:56,200
and move me into that railroad car

782
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,400
and take me off to the camp,

783
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,980
then I'll be all worried about the politics.

784
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,140
Oh, word is, no railroad car for you.

785
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,520
You get your own white SUV

786
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,780
with your own numbers on the side.

787
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,460
Is there going to be a war?

788
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,880
Are we going to be hauled off to concentration camps?

789
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,920
Or is it all just going to be, you know,

790
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,580
threats and worries and wars and rumors of wars

791
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,900
and gnashing of teeth and flailing of hair?

792
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,200
Well, that is part of the pogrom,

793
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,480
is to keep the...

794
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,520
keep the mind asunder

795
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,620
while plundering these difficult delights.

796
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,980
It's obvious that some sort of crash is being...

797
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:25,980
is on its way,

798
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,380
and we're trying to minimize it

799
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,260
with our own subcutaneous thoughts.

800
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,760
We don't have the cheese.

801
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,960
We don't have the correct armature

802
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,040
to blow these notes.

803
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,180
Who's not afraid to write and sing

804
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,600
the way he likes, Bob?

805
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,840
Who's not afraid to sing

806
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,740
when people were uptight, Bob?

807
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,380
Who's talking like people who get his music star?

808
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:54,040
Who's on the change of music stream for all of us?

809
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,600
Who'll help us with the answers when he sings the songs?

810
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,080
Who's controversial when it seems to get the wrong?

811
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,700
Who's not afraid?

812
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,500
Who's not afraid, not afraid?

813
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,980
And not afraid, not afraid?

814
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,340
Bob!

815
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:15,880
Bob!

816
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:19,740
Bob!

817
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:20,180


818
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,040
After an attack is over

819
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,160
and the all clear has been sounded,

820
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,920
arrangements will be made as soon as possible

821
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,800
to treat any people who are ill or injured.

822
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,880
Listen to your radio.

823
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,920
Details will be given about what to do,

824
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,240
when to do it,

825
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:39,160
and how.

826
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,020
If anyone dies

827
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,720
while you are kept in your...

828
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:52,140
fallout room move the body to another room in the house label the body with name and address

829

939
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:46,760
clean.

940
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:05,240
See www.subgenius.com

941
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,860
That's right, and 19 years later, it's still subgenius.com.

942
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:26,100
This Hour of Slack episode number 1853 was a rerun of number 853 from the year of 2002 titled Wars and Lemurs of War.

943
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:38,320
And I must say, when I listened back to it while mindlessly assembling subgenius membership packs, I was stricken by how insanely timely it seems today.

944
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,060
Almost 20 years ago.

945
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,700
It's that old.

946
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:52,420
I mean, but just us joshing around was so uncannily prescient that it sounds like it was ripped from tomorrow's headlines.

947
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:57,960
We never mention which epidemic, but it might as well be this epidemic.

948
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:03,840
And we never mention which war, but it could be the current Cold Civil War.

949
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,240
Chilling.

950
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,700
The only detail out of place is the name Bush.

951
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,720
Penn Jillette was.

952
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:13,220
Right in that movie about us.

953
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,320
We are good at this.

954
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:20,100
19 years later, you can still reach me at stang at subgenius.com.

955
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:28,560
But the church mailing address is now P.O. Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

956
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:35,460
We'll do new shows again as soon as my physical therapy exercises start to pay off.

957
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,940
They did before and they will again.

958
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,020
As Nenslow told me,

959
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:44,440
Don't stop your meds just because you feel better.

960
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,540
And with that advice, I shall take my leave.

961
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,720
Praise Bob and let there be slack.
