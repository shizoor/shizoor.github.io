00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
This is KNON 90.9 FM, Dallas.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,740
I'm Robert Wisdom, you've been listening to the American Music Party.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,160
Praise the wisdom of Bob!

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,840
The boss told me to do it this way.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,440
Ah, yes, dear friends.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:29,620
It's time to open your heart, unzip your pants, close your mind, and bend over.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,220
Because you're about to receive the word of Bob!

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,320
Ah, yes, friends.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,560
In answer to your second question, can Bob give you a job?

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:50,740
First, come, a big gibs a golly goshin', better puke your peat on full throttle potentate.

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,040
Elsewise, your wants will be wagging down on mammy's hind nanny.

12
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,980
Why can't your peaser pop a squeezer when the gushers are going all north?

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,520
You know, you're a normal like.

14
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,500
Got your old geisha sense in your sneezin' chamber, boy?

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,420
Heistin' an empty platter in your bean bag?

16
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,020
Where's your roller balls, eh?

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,940
I can't grok me no love-grow on this loo-joo moo-joo band.

18
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,300
You're gonna have to spreach English, Jake.

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,680
Get right with your muscle snake, snunk monkey.

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,120
Quit spritzin' your plizzerer lessen its snowin' white lute juice, baby.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,540
Elsewise, your pleatin' bleeder's blowin' hot water.

22
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,900
You go blind or please your neither tryin' not to.

23
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:44,160
Either way, you're gettin' up on the wrong orbit for this kinda free-needin' bleedin' side trade, eh?

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,380
Well, aren't you gonna just stand there like a dammy nickel slug, or you gonna plus your plimper in righteous hargany, P-boy?

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,260
You got weeny rivers and your fluter tubes, don't you?

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,980
Join gumption's with the true and the see-through.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,560
Be brave and pee for Bob, man, and send your jeans.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:11,020
Buy out the gland owners with what you earned with your skinny peelin' face of paint.

29
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,040
This has been your enunciator.

30
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,100
Thank me.

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,820
These words were not to you, but already on the computer beater.

32
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,660
Ovenia's a wonderful life.

33
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,120
Ovenia's a wonderful life.

34
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,940
Ovenia's a wonderful life.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,600
No trouble.

36
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,220
Just get set and get goin'.

37
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,660
Amen.

38
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,260
Recording.

39
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,540
Everything's goin' fine.

40
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,420
No trouble.

41
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,980
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,900
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

43
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,520
I am Bob Lundin!

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,040
Bob?

45
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,380
Bob?

46
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,200
This is K&O and 90.9 FM, Dallas, Texas.

47
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,260
I'm Bob singing.

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,940
We're gonna have fun, kids.

49
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,980
Yeah!

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
We're gonna have fun!

51
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,820
Yeah!

52
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,960
Daddy, say your name!

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,100
This is Reverend Arvin Stang!

54
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,440
Yeah!

55
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,660
Okay.

56
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,120
That's just thunder, kids.

57
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,520
Don't be scared.

58
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,280
Yay!

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,280
My thunder!

60
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,100
Okay.

61
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,640
Now, we're gonna sing some K&O-ing songs.

62
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,920
Bob days are Bob days.

63
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,000
K&O in the Bob days.

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,060
The Bob days add K-A-N-O-N.

65
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,920
The Bob days add K-A-N-O-N.

66
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,440
The Bob days add K-A-N-O-N.

67
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:12,600
Today!

68
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,820
Today!

69
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
Ba ba ba.

70
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,740
Ba bah bah bah b of a' acknowledgement for the 2025

71
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:20,860
annual June 30z Infrastructure and quakeавать

72
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,560
program at KYAC.

73
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,420
K。

74
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:24,760
Today!

75
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,900
Daddy, we're acknowledented!

76
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,060
Hope you can sing!

77
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,480
Oh, yes, dear friends.

78
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,200
This is the hour of slack.

79
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,120
Once again, this is our...

80
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,380
Let me bring Dr. Mother's Ball out for a second here.

81
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:59,660
This is the hour of slack, back to school and overwork special, kids.

82
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,280
Bob Coutures.

83
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,260
I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death which brings me...

84
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,360
And, oh, tonight's the beginning of our 11 to midnight time slot,

85
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,500
which means many of you may not be listening now.

86
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,400
But it also would probably mean a lot less technical problems for us here at the station, friends,

87
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,360
at the hour of slack.

88
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:31,380
Since only the 11.30 to 12.30 time slot is haunted by the old dead radio evangelist.

89
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,200
So, we'll only have to deal with the poltergeist then during the last half of the show.

90
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,060
Praise Bob.

91
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,300
Help me, somebody.

92
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,460
And the new show, now, Monday morning will not be on tonight.

93
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,640
That has moved, Norm Ward, Monday morning, without Johnny Horton, unfortunately,

94
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,680
has moved to 8 o'clock Friday mornings.

95
00:05:53,380 --> 00:06:01,600
And at midnight tonight, you'll be getting Soul Oldies, a new show from Ron Lindsey.

96
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,980
And that Soul Oldies, that sounds like a good follow-up to the hour of slack,

97
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,540
because you're guaranteed to get some slack off of that, dear friends.

98
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,740
Now, last week, this all wasn't true.

99
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,720
Those of you, friends, who heard the hour of slack last week

100
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,360
must have been either on drugs or on drugs.

101
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,360


102
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,360


103
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,360


104
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,620
Or hearing a false satanic imitation.

105
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,920
Because, yes, KNON went totally off the air last Sunday, just before our show.

106
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,620
Mm-hmm.

107
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,640
Because someone cut the transmission line.

108
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,000
Someone deliberately, friends, denied you your due slack.

109
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,460
The original slack you were born with.

110
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,060
And you dare to say that the conspiracy is just a metaphor?

111
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:48,720
Oh, yeah.

112
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,480
Ask Sterno if the conspiracy is a metaphor.

113
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,120
Ask Jane-er.

114
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,720
Ask the Conspiracyism Metaphor.

115
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,340
Ask me!

116
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,640
Ask yourself!

117
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,520
Ask the network censors.

118
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,600
Ask Ronald Reagan.

119
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,320
Go ahead.

120
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,840
Call him up.

121
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,620
Why not, dear friends?

122
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,620
Bye-bye.

123
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,260
Bye-bye.

124
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,160
Bye-bye.

125
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,600
Bye-bye.

126
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,640
Bye-bye.

127
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,100
Bye-bye.

128
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,560
Bye-bye.

129
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,100
Bye-bye.

130
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,200
Bye-bye.

131
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,420
Bye-bye.

132
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:14,980
Bye-bye.

133
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,040
Bob!

134
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:38,980
It's a Bob world after all It's a Bob world after all

135
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:47,500
It's a Bob world after all It's a Bob, K-N-O-N

136
00:07:47,500 --> 00:08:01,740
It's a KNO, it's a KNO, it's a KNO, it's a KNO, it's a KNO.

137
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,300
That's just a crybaby. I'm just a crybaby.

138
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:18,420
This is a dog. Now, we're gonna have fun here.

139
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,860
Who cares what it's about, as long as the kids go.

140
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,720
As long as the kids go. So I'm not gonna tell you, you gotta get on me.

141
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,680
There's only one thing we can say. How do I know I'm here?

142
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,280
Not in some very good way.

143
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,280
Not in some very lonely place.

144
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,180
How do I know I'm not on a star spinning in outer space?

145
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,640
It's free and you can answer it.

146
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,340
I'm not gonna tell you.

147
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,600
Break out of that glass box.

148
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,440
And join the Church of the Subgenius.

149
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:34,640
In a country where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution, anything is likely to develop.

150
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,380
Enter the Church of the Subgenius, billing itself as the weirdest cult on Earth.

151
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,780
What do they believe in? Everything.

152
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,780
Who do they believe in? A mysterious character named Bob.

153
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,120
If he's typical of the monsters around here, we have nothing to worry about.

154
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,620
It's the gelatinous giant.

155
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,080
And what have we here?

156
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,460
Ah, I see, breakfast.

157
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,760
Wait, I have a better idea.

158
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,580
An idea?

159
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,700
If there's one thing I can't swallow, it's an idea.

160
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,560
Well, it just so happens that I have a bag full of all the ideas in the world right here.

161
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:30,100
No. No, no, no. Don't open it. Leave one of them alone.

162
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,800
Don't take chances. Keep things as they are.

163
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,920
Ah, changes are so frightening.

164
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,280
No new ideas.

165
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,000
Praise Bob.

166
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,520
Praise Bob, dear friends.

167
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:06,780
And if you don't want to open the bag of new ideas, then don't listen to K-N-O-N on Sunday.

168
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:06,780


169
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,540
We're going to be doing Sunday Sundays with the all-new Sunday schedule.

170
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:17,960
And it's true, the time slots have been shifted around a bit, but they'll probably be almost semi-permanent.

171
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,300
Believe it or not, this station's been on the air for, what was it, three years?

172
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,900
Yes, yes.

173
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:32,140
Well, anyway, get your pen and pencils ready, friends, for this lesson in biblical K-N-O-N scheduling.

174
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,380
Uh, at noon on...

175
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,500
Now, this is the Sunday schedule, folks.

176
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:44,800
Next Sunday at noon, tune in beyond bows and arrows for American Indian information and music.

177
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:51,100
And that... I'm going to. I really will, and I have reasons for that.

178
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,860
Uh, then from 1 to 2, listen to Lambda Weekly with news and music of concern to the gay community.

179
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:06,360
Varied Voices, K-N-O-N's program of music interviews of, by, and for women, will now be airing from 2 to 4.

180
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,340
I don't sound like I'm reading this, do I?

181
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,660
Followed by Eduardo Young from 4 to 6 with Latin American music from many different countries.

182
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,760
And even more countries on K-N-O-N's Celtic music program, Celtic Crossroads, from 6 to 7.

183
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,020
From 7 to 9, don't miss Leo Perron's Cajun Music Hour.

184
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,880
And then, of course, Robert Wisdom at 9, followed by us at 11.

185
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,700
From now on, us, us, friends.

186
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,340
Do you dare to think you're watching?

187
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,760
Every one of us.

188
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,920
And then, soul oldies at midnight tonight.

189
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,600
So, stay tuned.

190
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,460
Praise, praise, praise Bob.

191
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,880
Praise Bob.

192
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,320
Praise, praise, praise Bob.

193
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,360
Praise Bob.

194
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:01,060
Bob is the culmination of that to which man has aspired throughout his long and slackless history.

195
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,820
Bob is what will bring slack to planet Earth.

196
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,220
This is a church that does not play games.

197
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,800
The other churches talk about love and think hate.

198
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,460
The other churches do not talk about money.

199
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,120
They take your money.

200
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,700
You don't see the gold-plated temples in the church of Bob.

201
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,220
You don't see Cadillac convertibles in the church of Bob.

202
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,240
You don't see Jensen Interceptors in the parking lot of Bob.

203
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:34,420
You see slack-filled smiling faces in the tabernacle of the Bob.

204
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,420
Bob founded the church mainly to help unmask the conspiracists.

205
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,420
We're talking about the conspiracists.

206
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,760
What next?

207
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,620
Just believe in the power of the dogs.

208
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,480
I believe.

209
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,300
Believe in Bob.

210
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:48,680
I believe.

211
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,180
Reach out for him.

212
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,260
I believe.

213
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,240
Feel the healing power.

214
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,620
I think you killed him.

215
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,100
See, there you go.

216
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,980
See, now, do you remember anything?

217
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,480
Does it hurt?

218
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:58,680
No.

219
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,540
See, no problem.

220
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,340
No problem with Bob, right?

221
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,320
Yeah!

222
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,380
Yeah!

223
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,020
Are you sure you're having a fun time all with the kids?

224
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:07,620
Yeah!

225
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,300
Now, what we're going to do is say K-N-O-N.

226
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,580
When I say to say K-N-O-N.

227
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,940
You are listening to the Hour of Slack on K-N-O-N.

228
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,040
Praise Bob!

229
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,800
Yeah!

230
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,940
Praise Bob!

231
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,440
Praise Bob!

232
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,420
Praise Bob!

233
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,080
Praise Bob!

234
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,300
Praise Bob!

235
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:44,780
Praise Bob!

236
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:44,800
Yeah!

237
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:45,920
Right!

238
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,580
Basically, two factions out there right now is us and them.

239
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,480
Friend, have you ever heard the expression, there's no slack in this world?

240
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,040
A lot of people have to ask me what slack is.

241
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,080
And that's sad, mister.

242
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,180
They were born with slack.

243
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,460
Oh yeah, you were born with slack.

244
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,620
But the conspiracy took it away.

245
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,980
The conspiracy made you want to be normal.

246
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,800
That's what the conspiracy is all about.

247
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:19,280
The conspiracy is a patchwork of different things.

248
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:27,900
Some are nations, some are products, some are hypnotic television shows, some are bad pills.

249
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,340
You'll find this if you find Bob!

250
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,440
And you better find Bob right now!

251
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,300
Now, Bob!

252
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:40,120
About wave purpose.

253
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,460
Now, the

254
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,840
sufficiently

255
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,380
And eventually,

256
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,140
you started talking.

257
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,180
What it's talking about?

258
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,420
Did it give you any ideas?

259
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:02,420


260
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:02,420


261
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:10,320
Your mental and physical health are suffering!

262
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,340
Is there any escape?

263
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,160
Is there any escape?

264
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,960
Is there any escape?

265
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,840
The most beautiful things of all to me,

266
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,520
I long ago decided,

267
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,780
Cannot be seen,

268
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,980
They only can be heard.

269
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,160


270
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,300
Rack!

271
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,180
Rack!

272
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,100
Wham!

273
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,840
Boom!

274
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,980
Noise!

275
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,760
Noise!

276
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,600
Beautiful noise!

277
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,400
Wonderful deafening ear splitting noise!

278
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,360
Whistles and squeaks!

279
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,080
Screeches galore!

280
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,400
Jingles and jangles!

281
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,060
Oh, how I adore all that noise!

282
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:12,820
Noise!

283
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,720
Marvelous noise!

284
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,820
Horrible hideous!

285
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,500
Awful insidious!

286
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,140
Noise!

287
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,540
Noise!

288
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,460
Noise!

289
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,920
Noise!

290
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,380
You don't look well, my boy.

291
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,260
Here, let's have a look at you.

292
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,800
Just as I suspected,

293
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,140
You are suffering from a severe lack of noise.

294
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,060
Now, this will fix you right up.

295
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,920
Honking horns, screeching trains,

296
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,360
Bells, shouts, shrieks, gurgling horns,

297
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:54,160
And all the rest of those wonderfully unpleasant sounds we use so much of today.

298
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,700
Now, here, take this and you'll never have to hear a pleasant sound again.

299
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,740
No.

300
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,620
No, thank you.

301
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,340
I don't want to be cured of pleasant sounds.

302
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,040
Well, now, that's very unusual.

303
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,960
However, nothing odd.

304
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,120
I'll just give it to the awful dint.

305
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,620
The awful dint?

306
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,460
The awful dint.

307
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,560
The awful dint.

308
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,780
The awful dint.

309
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,400
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

310
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,240
Ah, that was good, master.

311
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,200
This is my assistant, the awful din.

312
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,280
Gee, I don't think I've ever met an awful din before.

313
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:54,980
What?

314
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,500
Never met an awful din before?

315
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,580
Oh, you must be mistaken.

316
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,820
When you're playing in your room and making a lot of noise,

317
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,760
what do they tell you to stop?

318
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,420
Why, the awful din.

319
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:15,480
And when the street is being repaired with about 50 jackhammers going all day,

320
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,720
what does everybody complain of?

321
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,240
The awful din.

322
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,860
Right.

323
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,220
And now my valued assistant will show you various examples

324
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,260
from my collection of rare, exotic, and seldom heard noises.

325
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,220
Din?

326
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,740
Din?

327
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,100
Did you ever hear another fantastic?

328
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,620
Dance on a tin roof late at night?

329
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,880
That's noise.

330
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,020
Beautiful noise.

331
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,340
Did you ever hear a centipede crying when his shoes don't fit it right?

332
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,800
That's noise.

333
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,860
Beautiful noise.

334
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,360
Did you ever hear a hungry dinosaur hiccup on a windy day?

335
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,280
Did you ever hear a nervous butterfly nibble on a cheese souffle?

336
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,460
That's noise.

337
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,400
Ah, yes.

338
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,280
Noise is very fashionable today.

339
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,480
Why, I can hardly fill the orders for noise pills, racket lotion,

340
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,560
clamber salve, and hubbub tonic.

341
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,800
Years ago, why, everyone wanted pleasant sounds.

342
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,540
But today, all they want is...

343
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,560
Bop, boop, boop, boop.

344
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,100
Bop, boop, boop, boop.

345
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,260
Bop, boop, boop, boop.

346
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,040


347
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,400
Bop, boop, boop, boop.

348
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:38,400


349
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:38,400


350
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:38,400


351
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,740
This is Doctors for Bob, dear friends.

352
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,360
The most amazing of all church bands out of Little Rock, Arkansas.

353
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,320
Look for them soon to reform and once again play Dallas.

354
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:05,240
This one is called Dobbs Approved, and this song is approved by Dobbs.

355
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,300
Dobbs Approved

356
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:36,020
Approved by Dobbs

357
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,220
Approved by Dobbs

358
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,400

388

And no one has ever met Bob, the leader of our church, no one has ever met

389
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,380
Because as you know, all cults, their leaders are usually pretty hard to find

390
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,120
And Bob is no exception

391
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,240
Bob will help you

392
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,780
Dig your own...

393
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,320
No weirdness

394
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,320
I was getting messages in the back of my brain

395
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,840
And I just kept hearing the word Bob, Bob, Bob

396
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,360
They said your mind is in this jar

397
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,040
And then they poured it down the sink

398
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,360
Subgeniuses are the class of people who can't be classified

399
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,660
Bob has taken winos on the street and turned them into millionaires overnight

400
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,780
By the same token, he has taken...

401
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,420
This isномonet viewer

402
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,380
Am Excuse me

403
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,400
This isorg

404
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,500
He is not the one

405
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,900
Which means the word, L

406
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,000
The former

407
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,240
I think the world needs a new haffод

408
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,380
And I would not claim to believe

409
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,460
Thatata

410
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:22,940
love

411
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,220
This show all killed

412
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:24,220


413
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:24,620
So there

414
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:24,620


415
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:42,200
the saint of sails. It's actually a mystic sails ability. Bob was given powers and has

416
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:50,900
been given messages all along by alien entities, intelligences in outer space or maybe all

417
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:58,940
around us that are literally fingers of the stark fist of Jehovah One, alien space god

418
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,880
from some thin galaxy.

419
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,660
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me.

420
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,680
Doctors from Bob's stallion are trying to get to the stage now to sue the crowds.

421
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,000
Bob can save me but will he?

422
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,920
Word 10.

423
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:26,800
Bob Dobbs came to town to set you free! He came to town to set you free! You got no business

424
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,860
being sick. You got no business being in bondage. You got no business being in bondage.

425
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,380
business living out of sin. You got no business living without sight.

426
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,860
Fortunately, this is the one true church. Bob protects me from

427
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,640
demons, and I got a lot of them. Bob will protect you.

428
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,340
Bob is protecting the genetic

429
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,700
future. Let him. Let him into your life. Let Bob protect you.

430
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,740
He wants to protect you. He must protect you. Don't forget that Bob

431
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,660
has prophecy at the end of the world, July 5th, 1998.

432
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,600
Yeah, start smoking, start drinking, and live it up.

433
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,540
Start fornicating as if your very life depended on it.

434
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,420
Bob is saying if we must be lied to and cheated for reasons,

435
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,300
let us do it to ourselves for our own reasons.

436
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,360
Let us realize where the real deceit lies.

437
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,380
Let us have a choice in how we're being screwed. Some ways

438
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,540
are fun. But Bob, and doctors for Bob

439
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,420
let you keep the entire...

440
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,440
mind all the way down to the base of the spinal cord. Now, sure

441
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,720
they might want a couple of these little links in your spinal cord, but they...

442
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,880
...to turn to the subgenius

443
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,100
with a concept of slack. You can do what you want!

444
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,500
He makes the subgenius into a wild, wild thing

445
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,140
that cannot be comprehended. There are thousands of

446
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:58,540
paying dues, paying subgenius members, but the three of us are traveling around,

447
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,160
working on the book of the subgenius.

448
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,200
This book can make drunkards sober, and prostitutes pure,

449
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,920
and harlots holy, and rich men poor, and...

450
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,660
It's, uh...

451
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,280
The Book of the Subgenius. From McGraw-Hill.

452
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,940
Before it's too late.

453
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:36,680
It's a Bob world after all. It's a KNO after all.

454
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,860
Now it is time to have fun.

455
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:49,420
I hope you had fun fun. I hope you had fun fun.

456
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,980
I hope you have fun fun.

457
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,000
Mouse. Bob. Clowder. Tears.

458
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,240
Look! Bob and Spider-Man are coming back.

459
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,080
Here, let's open the shields and let them in.

460
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,840
Real quick. As soon as the fire stops.

461
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,380
There. Here he comes.

462
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,380
Okay. He's in.

463
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,100
Bob, what can you tell us?

464
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,860
Bob! Bob!

465
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,080
Bob, come back!

466
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,420
Come back!

467
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,220
He was in a big hurry. He ran off. Look! The aliens left!

468
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,120
They're taking off! That's incredible!

469
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,580
God, they're gone!

470
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,100
Where'd Bob...

471
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,260
I don't get it. He went into the men's room and the aliens left.

472
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,680
What now, Captain?

473
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,900
We should dick.

474
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,240
We should what?

475
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,400
Dick their tail.

476
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,940
And fix them that up.

477
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,600
Fix the tail. I mean...

478
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,400
Fix it.

479
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,020
You wanna go to Echo Town?

480
00:28:59,360 --> 00:28:59,840
Mm-hmm.

481
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,040
Oh, no, you don't?

482
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,460
That's a bad town.

483
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,360
That's a bad town?

484
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:05,980
Mm-hmm.

485
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,720
Echo Town.

486
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,020
Echo Town is a bad town.

487
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,320
Echo Town.

488
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,340
We didn't wanna go to Echo Town.

489
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,780
Echo Town was a weird, weird place.

490
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,960
Echo Town was a weird, weird place.

491
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,280
Everything was sort of slanted wrong.

492
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,200
Sometimes buildings are all leaning from...

493
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,960
And it was full of mean ones.

494
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,100
Yeah, it was full of mean ones. Great big mean ones.

495
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,140
I see Bob over there.

496
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,240
Up on there.

497
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,440
Is there Bob? Is that Bob over there?

498
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,760
Up on there.

499
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,600
Up there.

500
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,220
Look, Bob!

501
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:55,600
Bob!

502
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,480
Bob!

503
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,840
Bob, come on down. Help us.

504
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,340
We don't like it here in Echo Town.

505
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,340
Bob?

506
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,260
Look, he just turned away.

507
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,160
I wonder what he's doing.

508
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,080
Is he gonna help us?

509
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,560
Look, he's back.

510
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,220
But there's another Bob.

511
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,020
And there's another one.

512
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,960
And another one.

513
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,760
And another one.

514
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,380
There's hundreds of Bobs.

515
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,640
They're all just standing there.

516
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,800
What should we do now?

517
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,260
We should pull them.

518
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,940
One off, and then two off, and then one more.

519
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,700
You want to push them off?

520
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,680
Uh-huh.

521
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,000
Push them off that mountain?

522
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,860
Uh-huh.

523
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,280
One Bob at a time.

524
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,580
Should we leave one Bob left, or should we push them all off?

525
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,500
What is your verdict?

526
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,420
We should throw all the Bobs.

527
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,280
We should destroy all the Bobs.

528
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:09,440
And then some more to destroy us, to call some aliens to help.

529
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,880
We'll call aliens to help against Bobs?

530
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,320
Uh-huh.

531
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,440
Do you mean the Bobs in Echo Town aren't good Bobs?

532
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,320
Uh-huh.

533
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,340
We can separate the good Bob from the bad Bob.

534
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,240
It didn't help.

535
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,380
There's still hundreds of them up there.

536
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,360
Well, should we start pushing?

537
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,540
Uh-huh.

538
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,560
Let's go.

539
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,720
Oh, yes, dear friends.

540
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,340
I was trying to get this cartridge up here to play.

541
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,460
Ain't getting nary and nothing out of that thing.

542
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,280
Well, yes, dear friends.

543
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:09,360
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, and this is the Hour of Slack Doctors for Bob Back to School Special.

544
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,820
And for those of you who just tuned in, yes, it's true.

545
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:19,700
Your hour, your single hour of Slack this week is already half over.

546
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,380
That's right.

547
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,700
Last Friday, I was in.

548
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:28,200
I was informed that we would henceforth be starting the show at 11 o'clock rather than 1130.

549
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,460
So, that's right.

550
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,460
Hour of Slack is now 11 o'clock to 12 o'clock.

551
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,260
And Monday morning is moved to Friday morning at 8 o'clock.

552
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:48,780
And at midnight tonight, we have Soul Oldies, the brand-new show from Ron Lindsey, whose promo will not seem to play because the Poltergeist just clocked in.

553
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,080
Friends, that's right.

554
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,780
We were free of him the first part of the show.

555
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:00,120
Now, many of you have been wondering, I think, where Pastor Buck Neket is.

556
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,720
Yes, the mighty Buck.

557
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:11,500
He is back from Malaysia where he was taught, apparently taught, a completely new technique for mystic soul travel.

558
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,700
And Buck is here in the station.

559
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,140
He's about to try and experiment.

560
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:32,100
Whereby rather than actually talking or inflicting his voice on us, he is going to attempt to actually broadcast his physical self across the ether waves and into your radio and heart.

561
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,660
Or full force against the backside of your britches.

562
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,460
Dear friend, so take it away, Buck.

563
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:44,120
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

564
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,920
Say it.

565
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,940
Hi, girls.

566
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,000
This is Pastor Buck Neket.

567
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,380
I'm with Dr. Chaos.

568
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,140
Yeah.

569
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:57,780
And right now we've got me strapped down on this big cot at K&ON Studios.

570
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,140
I'm speaking to you just before the show began tonight.

571
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:10,800
And what you're hearing right now is Dr. Chaos is shaving the soles of my feet, huh, Doc?

572
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,440
Actually, I'm shaving the sole of your foot.

573
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,540
I'm shaving his sole.

574
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:18,660
Hmm.

575
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,660
Well, that's a...

576
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,320
We didn't want to save it.

577
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,700
We wanted to shave it.

578
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,280
Right.

579
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:31,220
Well, anyway, what the point of this is is that I'm going to be on the radio with you,

580
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,900
and yet you won't be able to hear me.

581
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,420
But you'll be able to feel me.

582
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,020
Because tonight I'm going to be out there with all the little particles, the little

583
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,440
Bob-eons, and...

584
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,040
Hey, what's that?

585
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:41,940
What's that?

586
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,420
Well, I figured I'd take care of this callous.

587
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:45,420


588
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:45,420


589
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:45,420


590
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,320
I'll just push the button while I'm at it.

591
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:49,900
Ow.

592
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,440
All right.

593
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,560
Really, what I go...

594
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,960
That sander always works good.

595
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,460
What I go through to be on this show, folks, you would not believe.

596
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,080
Anyway, we're going to...

597
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:07,240
We've already put a little terminal in my head for the antenna, and now we've got to

598
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:15,400
loop some wire around and plug in my mystic sole gland in my foot to get the whole thing

599
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,720
rigged up so that I'm pole to pole.

600
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:26,960
And I'm going to be actually in the air with the signal coming out, and I will be yet connected

601
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,760
to that in my head so that I will be listening to all of you and...

602
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,140
Praise Bob!

603
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,940
Praise Bob!

604
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,620
Yeah.

605
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:42,800
Yeah.

606
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,760
Yeah.

607
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,140


608
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,400
Yeah.

609
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,400


610
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,400


611
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,400


612
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,400


613
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,400


614
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,400


615
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,580
Okay.

616
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:13,480
I wonder where I am.

617
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,120
Huh.

618
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:14,880
Huh.

619
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,400
I wonder where I am.

620
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:15,400


621
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:15,400


622
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:15,400


623
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:15,400


624
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,400
The... Encore!

625
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,400
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!

626
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:45,400


627
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,100
We are the Lethargians.

628
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,600
I'm very pleased to meet you.

629
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,700
Could you help me, please?

630
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,840
I think I'm lost.

631
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,600
Think?

632
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,560
Don't say that.

633
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:10,520
It's against the law to think in the doldrums.

634
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,440
That's ridiculous.

635
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,000
Ridiculous.

636
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,560
Everybody thinks.

637
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,440
We don't.

638
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,480
And most of the time, you don't.

639
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,280
And that's why you're here.

640
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,740
You weren't thinking.

641
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,900
And you weren't paying attention either.

642
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:38,700
The people who don't pay attention often get stuck in the doldrums.

643
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,940
That's silly.

644
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,420
Stop that at once.

645
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,160
Laughing is against the law.

646
00:37:53,020 --> 00:38:00,420
And smiling is permitted only on alternate Thursdays.

647
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:07,100
But if you can't laugh or think, what can you do in the doldrums?

648
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,860
Do what?

649
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,820
You can do anything.

650
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,860
As long as it's nothing.

651
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,540
Everything.

652
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,480
As long as it isn't anything.

653
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:37,660
So don't say there's nothing to do in the doldrums.

654
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,300
Don't say we do it.

655
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,280
Days.

656
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,380
We don't.

657
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:44,560
No.

658
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,740
We don't a little bit.

659
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,520
And then.

660
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,000
Yeah, and then we.

661
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,200
We lie for a while.

662
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,720
And then we get.

663
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:04,120
We gather our strength to start anew.

664
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,960
And all of the lawful around you.

665
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,980
We still love you.

666
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:12,940
We love you.

667
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:13,720
Yeah.

668
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,700
Ah.

669
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:23,400
So, don't say there's nothing to do in the doldrums.

670
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,420
It's just not true.

671
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:35,540
Oh, I can see you need a rich and productive life.

672
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:43,420
Don't say there's nothing to do in the doldrums.

673
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:43,420


674
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:43,420


675
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:43,420


676
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:43,420


677
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:50,380
I'm ready to dig away the changes I am

678
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,540
It's the terrible watchdog

679
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,620
Run, run everybody, hide

680
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,860
Oh, the terrible watchdog

681
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,220
Terrible watchdog

682
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,060
Terrible watchdog

683
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,460
Terrible

684
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,960
Watchdog

685
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:26,140
Here, watch this

686
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,100
What are you doing here?

687
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:28,680
Oh

688
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,080
Just killing time

689
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,620
Killing time?

690
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,880
Look, son

691
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,240
It's bad enough wasting time

692
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,580
Without killing it

693
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,540
Come on, get a hold of yourself

694
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,860
You can't spend the rest of your life

695
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,500
In the doldrums

696
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,640
How did you get here anyway?

697
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,020
Oh, it was easy

698
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,960
I guess I just wasn't thinking

699
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,500
Precisely

700
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,760
You got here, boy, not thinking

701
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,120
And now you've got to think your way

702
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:08,720
Out

703
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,240
Go away

704
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,380
I want to sleep

705
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,740
Besides

706
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,520
It's just a lot of thing

707
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,660
There's something inside your head

708
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,100
There's something inside your head

709
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:31,140
There's something inside your head

710
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,220
There's something inside your head

711
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,580
There's something inside your head

712
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:43,580


713
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:43,580


714
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,600
They say you lost the ability

715
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,000
To the one thing

716
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,360
That your tiny little brain

717
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,160
Moves down the kitchen sink

718
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,860
They say that you bought anything

719
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,920
That they turned away

720
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,000
That you're missing the everything

721
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,300
That's right beside the plate

722
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,300
There's something inside you

723
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:05,920
CIalls

724
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:07,560
electricity

725
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,440
I got a hardball

726
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:35,240
I think you like it

727
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,840
Like it

728
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,880
To be called

729
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,720
One, two, three

730
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,600
Ain't that true?

731
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:49,980
I

732
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,060
Think you're better

733
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,820
Better

734
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,100
Better

735
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:00,920
Or

736
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,920
Stuck on this

737
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,840
Without your head

738
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,320
Yeah

739
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,400
Yeah

740
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:06,480
Yeah

741
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


742
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


743
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


744
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


745
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


746
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


747
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


748
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


749
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


750
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


751
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


752
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


753
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


754
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


755
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


756
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:07,820


757
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,360
They say you're stupid

758
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,980
That you're too young to worry

759
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:22,480
They say you're the son of anything and everything

760
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,040
Shut down your world

761
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,000
And they say

762
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,980
You're doing it

763
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:27,560
They say

764
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,640
Right now

765
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,540
You're doing it

766
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,380
They say

767
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,220
Sit around

768
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,120
You're doing it

769
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:32,880
They say

770
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,840
Hit the ground

771
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,740
You're doing it

772
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,380
They say

773
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,560
Like a big wheelie

774
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,300
You're doing it

775
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:37,780
They say

776
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,960
What is that doing?

777
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,000
You're doing it

778
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,600
They say

779
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,520
That it's over baby

780
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,520
You're doing it

781
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:42,940
They say

782
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:43,760
Take a look

783
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,920
There's something inside your head

784
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,100
There's something inside your head

785
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,240
There's something inside your head

786
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,720
There's something inside your head

787
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,700
It didn't matter

788
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,760
It didn't matter

789
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,260
Ohhh

790
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:12,740
It didn't matter

791
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,960
We matter

792
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,300
It didn't matter

793
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,540
It didn't matter

794
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,620
It didn't matter

795
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,460
Ohhhh

796
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:20,780
Ohhhhh

797
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,020
We didn't matter

798
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,300
It didn't matter

799
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:24,320
It didn't matter

800
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:24,740
It didn't matter

801
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:24,740


802
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:24,740


803
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:25,680
Ohhhhh

804
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,320
Ohhhhh

805
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:27,640
Ohhh

806
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:27,720
Ohhh

807
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,780
You didn't matter

808
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,720
You didn't matter

809
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:37,720


810
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,320
Oh, oh, oh

811
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,440
They matter

812
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,420
Oh, oh, oh

813
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,260
They matter, they matter

814
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,320
They matter, they matter

815
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,380
Oh, oh, oh

816
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:12,440
They matter, they matter

817
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,320
This is K-Land 90.9 FM

818
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,760
Thank you, Tevis.

819
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,660
That was Oingo Boingo.

820
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,620
I don't know what's going on now.

821
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,680
We're getting out of this.

822
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,240
This is a lot of fun.

823
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,340
The board here is just running through all these other radio stations.

824
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,020
I just don't get it.

825
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,140
This is nuts.

826
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,140
It's that Poulter guy. Sorry.

827
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,240
Smarter business move today.

828
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,420
My heart's broken.

829
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,800
Oh, oh, oh

830
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,000
Don't let the system fool you

831
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,760
All it wants to do is to rule you

832
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,460
Pay attention

833
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,700
What's up?

834
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:22,860
Thank you, Bob.

835
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:23,580
I know

836
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:26,200
Thank you, Bob.

837
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,260
I know

838
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,260
Thank you, Bob.

839
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,740
Thank you.

840
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,720
Thank you.

841
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,080
Say no

842
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,160
Let the fish fry proceed.

843
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,560
They're not that guy.

844
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,560
That's an obvious common trick, Mr. President.

845
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,660
We're wasting valuable time.

846
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,940
Look at this water.

847
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,500
We're getting ready to clobber.

848
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,280
Is money more important than people's lives?

849
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,760
And in their pursuit for private interests,

850
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,720
a lot of chemical companies will not accept legal or even moral responsibility

851
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,100
for the results of chemical waste pollution.

852
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:08,800
until absolute proof shows that a specific chemical from a specific plant caused a specific disease.

853
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,980
The treatment you receive when you do business with these industry giants,

854
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,780
it's frequently frustrating, and to make matters worse, they don't seem to care.

855
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,140
You won't find this attitude at Bill King's Breco.

856
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,720
Well, I'll tell you what, everything I take here is a hazard.

857
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,620
It progresses as the years go on, and eventually we'll never be able to control it.

858
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:34,120
If you take a look at those maps that show concentrations of various forms of cancer,

859
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,200
you can pick out the industrialized areas of America.

860
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,460
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

861
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,200
Oh, oh, there, got it.

862
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,040
Finally got control of the show again here, friends.

863
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,000
Oh, it's great to be back in school, ain't it, kids?

864
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,100
Yes, friends, this is the Doctors for Raw Back to School special.

865
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:58,600
Finally!

866
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,900
Find out as much as you can about what's going on in the world.

867
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:09,020
Let Pacifica News fill in the blanks left by the rest of your news, the blanks in your cranium.

868
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:16,120
That's Pacifica News every weekday from 4.30 to 5 p.m. only on The Voice of the People,

869
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,000
KNON Community Radio, 90.9 FM.

870
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,080
Right, Buck?

871
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,300
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

872
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

873
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,300
Yeah.

874
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,160
Hello.

875
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,980
This is me again.

876
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,080
You know me, don't you?

877
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,880
I hope you do.

878
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,760
Well, I'm going to tell you a story.

879
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,080
This is about Bob.

880
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:55,280
Bob.

881
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,280
And the said geniuses.

882
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:01,940
When you hear this sound like this.

883
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,680
You turn the page.

884
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:09,900
Okay?

885
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:13,700
Um, this is a true story.

886
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,900
It happened a long, long time ago.

887
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,940
There was a little tiny hut.

888
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,280
And there was a little tiny hut.

889
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,520
And there were five other big buildings.

890
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:36,600
And these buildings had little people inside.

891
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:43,580
And everybody who lived in the hut didn't know anything about them.

892
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,020
They called them the subgeniuses.

893
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:50,160
They were very, very weird and strange and funny.

894
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:55,260
They could play songs and sing songs.

895
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,120
They made, they made up a legend.

896
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,720
There's a legend about Bob.

897
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,100
And some of their music would sound like this.

898
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,940
Now to talk to the subgeniuses.

899
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,560
As sounded by

900
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,940
And sounded by

901
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:24,980
Now I know that music sounds pretty funny.

902
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:31,700
Well, it might, maybe not, but that's what kind of music they would play.

903
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:35,220
Their music was very, very funny.

904
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:42,020
Whenever they came out, out of their big weird buildings,

905
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,460
they would knock on the door of the little hut,

906
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,760
and all the people would come out and say,

907
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,780
Hey, you, you guys, you guys are terrible.

908
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,640
I hate you. Get out of my house.

909
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:03,740
They thought that those subgeniuses were really mean and weird,

910
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:09,960
but they never knew that they were the most fanciest people in the whole world.

911
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,720
And they had these little vehicles that were like,

912
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,360
they were like little cars, and they could,

913
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,660
and they had a whole bunch of buttons on them,

914
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:26,980
and some of the buttons would make hands come out and reach for you, like this.

915
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:34,640
And some of them would just sweep or do things like that.

916
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,260
Um, there were books.

917
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,740
They had these weird books called the Book of Subgenius.

918
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:46,080
It was all about subgenius things.

919
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,700
And what?

920
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:56,080
One time, the legend of Bob became true.

921
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:00,760
And some people looked up and said,

922
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,220
It's the Book of Subgenius flying.

923
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:10,740
No, maybe it's, maybe it's a date of 1832,

924
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:13,880
when the legend was made.

925
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,320
That's what all the villagers said.

926
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,400
And then they said,

927
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,540
It's Bob!

928
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,640
And then they all started to say,

929
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,940
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

930
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,940
Why did you do that?

931
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,940
Because it's real sick.

932
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,420
But I have to do that because you realize, boys and girls,

933
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,140
that the universe is entropy.

934
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,080
And can you say entropy?

935
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,060
Entropy.

936
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,380
Nice try.

937
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,720
You're listening to people who didn't compare all state rates

938
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,620
before buying car insurance from somebody else.

939
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,460
Penguin.

940
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:02,540
utches might be affiamo cInce you are

941
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,340
in law and cycle,

942
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:08,620
you know you took a card from a card.

943
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,320
Absolutely wrong.

944
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,400
If you didn't igenrate,

945
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,480
it would mean you lose.

946
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,740
If you didn't explain it.

947
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:24,920
Bye!

948
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:25,460


949
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:30,960
Bye!

950
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:32,360
Kid!

951
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,200
Bye, bye, bye, bye.

952
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,420
Stupid kids.

953
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,820
Hello, B.W. Playhouse, B.W. speaking.

954
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,260
Hello, is Mr. Knucklehead there?

955
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,180
Mr. Knucklehead, hold on, I'll ring for you.

956
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,160
I'm sorry, there doesn't seem to be any answer.

957
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,280
I know you are, but what am I?

958
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:55,720
I know you are, but what am I?

959
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,780
I know you are, but what am I?

960
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:03,100
I know you are, but what am I?

961
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,100
Well, I know for a fact that I'm a really neat guy.

962
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,300
I'm more hip to forgive than take an eye for an eye.

963
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:14,320
But I'm not so swell that I'll take any lip.

964
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,320
I'll put some giant turkey on an eagle trip.

965
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,720
And any mean mamma-jamma gives me...

966
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:22,140
Any gum in my own playhouse can just get out.

967
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,400
Hello?

968
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,360
Hey, I forgot to ask, is your refrigerator ready?

969
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:27,640
Oh, I think so.

970
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,100
Well, you better go get it then.

971
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,420
It's so funny, I almost forgot to laugh.

972
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,160
Yeah, well, you're just a big-ass kid.

973
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,220
I know you are, but what am I?

974
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,540
I know you are, but what am I?

975
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,480
I know you are, but what am I?

976
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,880
This is my playhouse, everything in it's mine.

977
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,980
Stop that straight, we'll get along just fine.

978
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,060
There's no names you can call me that'll make me cry.

979
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,120
Cause I know I'm cool, I wear a Red Bull tie.

980
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:02,120
Besides, I'll just say, I know you are, but what am I?

981
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,400
Girl Scout cookies!

982
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,140
Can't you read? No girls allowed!

983
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,660
Now get your stupid cooties out of here!

984
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,240
Pee-wee Herman, I think you're a rat fink.

985
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,300
What do you think about that?

986
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,460
Baby, I'm the rubber.

987
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,900
I know you are.

988
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:19,580
I know you are.

989
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:19,720


990
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:19,720


991
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:19,720


992
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:19,720


993
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:19,720


994
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:19,720


995
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:19,720


996
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:19,720


997
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:19,720


998
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:19,720


999
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:19,720


1000
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,120
I know you are.

1001
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:22,840
I know you are.

1002
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,740
Everything you say to me, bounces off and sticks to you.

1003
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,480
But what am I?

1004
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,840
Look up.

1005
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,760
But what am I?

1006
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:32,600
Look down.

1007
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,180
But what am I?

1008
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,280
You see my thumb?

1009
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,040
But what am I?

1010
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,660
Gee, you're dumb.

1011
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,120
I know you are.

1012
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,700
But what am I?

1013
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,260
I know you are.

1014
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,980
But what am I?

1015
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,700
I know you are.

1016
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:06,120
But what am I?

1017
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,340
Well, I think so far it's been a very swell day.

1018
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,360
And I've just decided to go outside and play.

1019
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,680
I won't even pick up my toys.

1020
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,720
And if my crabby old mom gives me a ride,

1021
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:19,720


1022
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,540
I'll just ignore her and just go do what I want.

1023
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,100
Hi, Pee-wee!

1024
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,100
Hi, Abby.

1025
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,400
Hey, Pee-wee.

1026
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,040
Where are you going?

1027
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,380
Crazy, what a cub.

1028
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,440
Yeah, you're a heck of a guy.

1029
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,520
I know you are.

1030
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,280
But what am I?

1031
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,480
I'm Chris Pee-wee!

1032
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,980
Get away from me!

1033
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:43,140
You're ugly, and your mom addresses you funny.

1034
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,600
I know you are.

1035
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,380
But what am I?

1036
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:46,980
I know you are.

1037
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:47,000
But what am I?

1038
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,300
I'm Pee-wee.

1039
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,720
Yeah, Lester, get out of my sight.

1040
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:49,720


1041
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:49,720


1042
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:49,720


1043
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:49,720


1044
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:49,720


1045
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:49,720


1046
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:49,720


1047
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:49,720


1048
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,160
I know you are, but what am I?

1049
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,940
You're a nerd.

1050
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,400
I know you are, but what am I?

1051
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:06,020
You're a fan.

1052
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,560
I know you are, but what am I?

1053
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,040
I know you are, but what am I?

1054
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,540
I know you are, but what am I?

1055
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,440
I'm not.

1056
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,780
I had to do it!

1057
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,780
No! No!

1058
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,980
Stop it! Stop it!

1059
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:38,660
Stop it!

1060
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,000
Stop it!

1061
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,160
Stop! Stop!

1062
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:42,680


1063
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:44,740


1064
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:46,160
I told you I was wrong!

1065
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,840
I told you I was wrong!

1066
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,500
I told you I was wrong!

1067
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,060
I told you I was wrong!

1068
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,300
Oh, ha ha, ha ha, dear friends.

1069
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:06,880
Yes, stay tuned to the next four minutes for Soul Oldies,

1070
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,420
who will indeed be coming up.

1071
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:13,760
Now, oh, I should mention that Pee Wee Herman song.

1072
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,240
I just played there.

1073
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,440
Now, I got to credit Jay Condom,

1074
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,360
who will be a future co-host on the Hour of Slack, by the way.

1075
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,040
He's out of town this week.

1076
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:28,660
Jay Condom did that music for Pee Wee's early TV show.

1077
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:34,080
And I mention this because many subgeniuses hate Pee Wee Herman

1078
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,320
because he's such a total nerd.

1079
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,340
And I was the same way until I saw his movie,

1080
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:41,600
which I thought was just hilarious.

1081
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:43,080
He's one of those comedians

1082
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:43,680
who's lying,

1083
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,120
but his lives become their character.

1084
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,380
They embody the sacred juvenility of childhood, friends,

1085
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,980
and refuse to abandon the same.

1086
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,960
Many would-be subgenii are actually nerds,

1087
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,900
but, friends, nerdship can be transcended,

1088
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,520
and you can achieve the state of nerd triumph.

1089
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,540
But other subgenii, of course, are never nerds,

1090
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,760
but are so inherently superior in their subgeniusness

1091
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,800
that none of this matters in the slightest.

1092
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,660
Now, well, I didn't get to,

1093
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,980
get to the other Doctors for Bob tape I was gonna...

1094
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:20,680
And it's the song about the squirting universe.

1095
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:21,940
Huh, the pretty song.

1096
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,120
We'll be playing that next week, I guess.

1097
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,280
Uh...

1098
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:26,960
Oh!

1099
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,020
I'll see.

1100
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,500
We're, we're, uh, for those of you who are wondering

1101
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,760
where your stark fist of removal newsletter from the church is,

1102
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:35,900
well, we've been a bit overworked at headquarters

1103
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:42,040
answering your requests for more info spurred by the Prairie Squid Show we did a while back.

1104
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,740
Hey, you be getting some good news.

1105
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,800
Prairie Squid, I know it.

1106
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,960
Doing mail all day, sending out video and audio tapes

1107
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,180
and sacred brochures and such like.

1108
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,520
Uh, oh, one of the things we got in the mail was, uh,

1109
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,600
Bob Larson requesting, uh, subgenius representatives

1110
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,360
to come be guests on his conservative talk show.

1111
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,840
So, which is a national thing. We'll see about that.

1112
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:06,460
Um...

1113
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:11,020
Oh, my gosh. There went Onan Canobites' mighty song.

1114
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:13,600
Just, just petering out there at the end.

1115
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:17,080
So, get set next week for the pledge drive, dear friends.

1116
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:21,120
Uh, we're gonna need, uh, some volunteers, like three or four volunteers

1117
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:24,740
to show up about five minutes till 11 exactly to take calls.

1118
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,300
But it can only be people that I know.

1119
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:32,960
So, now the way I can figure that out is if you know my telephone number

1120
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,800
of Reverend Ivan Stang, and you can't find it in the book,

1121
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,880
call up tomorrow or sometime during the week and volunteer.

1122
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:43,400
And if, if you know me but don't have my phone number, send a postcard by Wednesday,

1123
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,080
and I'll get it by Saturday, because we need you to answer, um, the,

1124
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,660
not next week, but September 22nd, the pledge drive starts.

1125
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:54,660
And we'll need you to address envelopes, the sacred pamphlets,

1126
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,940
which we'll use as envelopes after the show and to take calls.

1127
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:04,200
Special thanks, uh, this week to our, our extra special co-hosts,

1128
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:10,960
Zandy and Tevis and Idnax and Sivit, the, those young subgenius prophets

1129
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:13,300
who, uh, who, uh,

1130
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,700
who spent, who took time, played hooky from school and came in to do the show.

1131
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,460
Remember, next week, Hour of Slack is on at 11 o'clock from now on, dear friends.

1132
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:26,360
And, uh, coming up, oh, well, next week, I believe we're gonna do,

1133
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,460
you'll love this one, the anti-drug show.

1134
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,260
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1135
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,480
And, hey!

1136
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:35,220
Rawr!

1137
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,540
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1138
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,400
Things kept going from bad to worse, but we all put our shoulders to the wheel,

1139
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,520
and it wasn't long before I was flat on my back again.

1140
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,860
Any questions? Any answers?

1141
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,060
Any rags? Any bones? Any bottles?

1142
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,360
Today, any rags?

1143
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,140
The meltdown.

1144
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,320
The meltdown.

1145
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:55,240
The meltdown.

1146
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:56,480
The meltdown.

1147
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,480
Hear equal parts of music,

1148
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:02,140
subliminal guideposts,

1149
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,840
and dirty talk.

1150
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,860
This week in the story...

1151
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,660
The story of the...

1152
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:10,400
The story of the...
