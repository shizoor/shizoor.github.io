This announcement from the producers of this record contains important information for radio program directors and is not for broadcast.
Home users of this record may disregard this announcement.
The following cut has been cross-format focused for airplay.
As you well know, a record must break on radio in order to actually provide a living for the artists involved.
Up until now, you've had to make these record-breaking decisions on your own, relying only on the perplexing intangibilities of taste and intuition.
But now, there's a better way.
The cut that follows is the product of newly developed compositional techniques based on state-of-the-art market analysis technology.
This cut has been analytically designed.
The cut is designed to break on radio.
And it will.
Sooner or later.
For the station that breaks it first, the benefits are obvious.
And no matter what share of the market you do business in, no other release is going to be quite so suitable for your corporation's current idea of good radio.
On this cut, we're working together on the same wavelength.
In scientific harmony.
But remember, this cut is constructed for multi-market breaking now.
Don't waste valuable research with needless delay.
We've done the hard work of ensuring your success.
The final step is up to you.
Special Designer Song follows in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

Just a minute
Just a minute
Just a minute
I can't hear a thing
Quiet please
Is there any escape?
Oh, there's so much noise
I can't hear the music
Is there any escape?
The noise
One orchestra in this
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh







Oh

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

Oh



Praise Bob!
Help me somebody.
What a work of strange it is.
That was Negative Land.
What used to be their unreleased album that I've been playing, Escape from Noise.
And actually it turns out why it's not unreleased anymore.
Oh shoot, this tape deck here is acting funny.
There we go.
Ah, some lovely intro music.
You are now listening to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.
That wacky subgenius show here on KNO and 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.
And yeah, as I was saying, that song there,
Escape from Noise.
Escape from Noise is from the Negative Land album, Escape from Noise,
which is now available on SST Records.
For you punksters and pinksters out there, you may know about SST Records.
Smooth.
Negative Land's previous three albums are also available on Ralph now.
Ralph Records.
And get this, friends.
One of the Negative Land guys, I talked to him last week,
and he said that he gave the people,
Ralph, a copy of the Hour of Slack.
And they asked him, the next week,
they called him up and asked him about the song Half-Assed Drunk by Doctors for Bob.
So we may end up finally, Doctors for Bob, finally.
It's about time, man.
It's about time.
So I hope, I hope that happens.
But tonight on the Hour of Slack,
it's going to be a, it's going to be a musical kind of show
because frankly, I'm, I'm just, I'm, I'm burned is what I am.
I've been burned every, the last four shows, I know.
And I'll tell you, I'll finally, now, now that I've almost finished the job,
I'll tell you what the horrible job has been that I've been working on.
And that was the, well, I'm writing another book.
It's not exactly like Book of the Subgenius,
which will be re-released pretty quick here.
Whoa, that's a scary one, dude.
But, uh, uh, this new one is a book of,
of books.
It's called, um, Cosmic Awareness, Ultimate Hipness,
and Utter Strangeness by Mail Cheap.
And it won't be available for, uh, quite a,
well, probably till near the end of the year.
But for the last month, just before coming into the Hour,
from Hour of Slack to Hour of Slack,
without any sleep in between,
I've been sitting wrapped around a computer.
And when I laid down, then the Will of Dobbs would come in
and type stuff on the computer.
And, um, and I've been wading through kook literature.
Uh, you know, hollow earth societies and flat earth societies and so forth.
And, um, speaking of kook literature, uh,
the Will of Dobbs just handed me the paper here.
It says that a Florida man's gift meets Robert,
Oral Roberts' goal.
On the eve of Evangel, uh, Evangelist Oral Roberts' scheduled fast for contributions.
I thought he was gonna die for it.
I thought he was gonna die for contributions.
This guy comes along, a dog track owner,
donated 1.3 million to meet Robert's 8 million dollar goal.
And, uh, I mean, I had to die last week and, and, and get open heart surgery right here in the station
just to get a few pennies out of you cheapskates.
It's disgusting.
So anyway, um, this is, you won't be hearing,
you won't have Reverend Stanley.
You're not getting to kick around anymore.
I'm gonna quit talking on this show.
It's gonna be all music.
Or, not all music.
Some of it is gonna be some-
There'll be some yacking and rapping.
But we got some nifty sub-genius music and, uh,
God, listen to that disco, Darth Vader theme.
Yeah!
Whoo!
Yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
And this coming up here is Onan Canobite.
You ought to recognize this song.
Onan Canobite.
I'm strange but not a stranger.
I'm an ordinary guy.
Burning down the house.
Hold tight.
Wait till the party's over.
Hold tight.
We're in for nasty weather.
There has got to be a way.
Burning down the house.
Here's your ticket.
Pack your bags.
Time for jumping overboard.
Transportation is here.
Close enough but not too far.
Maybe you know where you are.
Fighting fire with fire.
Ah!
All wet.
Hey, you might need a raincoat.
Shake down.
You ain't walking in broad daylight.
Three hundred sixty-five degrees.
Burning down the house.
Well it was once upon a place.
Sometimes I listen to myself.
Gonna come in this place.
There are people on their way to work.
And baby what did you expect?
What a burden.

But the
productive garden.
What about seeds?
Avos?"
Just another good thing.
I'm missing my pet peeve.
The fire.
That's right, don't wanna hurt nobody
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
But it's down the house
There's no reasonable means of support
And you have not seen nothing yet
Everything's stuck together
And I don't know what you expect
Staring into the TV set
Fighting fire with fire
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh, yeah, well thank you. That was Reverend Onan Canabite.
For a young feller, he's been a subgenius for a long time.
He's from Knoxville with a band called Occupant.
And you can only get that through being a member of the Church of the Subgenius,
which I can't advertise too much in here,
because I'm not a member.
Because this is a public radio station.
I'm not paying for the ad.
But keep those recorders on,
because this thing coming up here,
this is some more subgenius music
from Reverend Gord Don Truby,
once of the Dancing Cigarettes,
only he's not singing on it.
Just, this is an incredible piece of tape editing,
is what it is.
So hang in there here.
Listen to this.
Listen to this.
Listen to this.
Listen to this.

What I'm going to tell you now may shock some of you,
but it's the truth.
I was in the rock music scene.
I was a part of it for years.
I was a musician.
I was a singer.
Singing about what the kids want to hear.
Speed and pop.
Sex outside of marriage.
Said old masochistic sexual techniques involving
leathers, razors, and spiked heels.
Money.
Stink and the stench and the filth and the rot
and the bondage and the darkness.
Sports.
Listen to this.
One of the greatest days of my life.
This particular night I was there with crowd control.
The museum was packed with capacity with tens of thousands of people.
Thousands, thousands, thousands, thousands, thousands there that night.
The air was heavily made with marijuana.
Marijuana smokes are thick.
You could get high by just being in the place.
You could get high walking through it.
And the scene was straight out of Danny's Inferno.
It was like animals.
It was like dogs.
Sponsoring this huge.
Travaganza will be.
Some of the mightiest corporations in the United States of America.
Forgive my body to this truth until it was black and blue.
I mean it.
I'd get down on my hands and knees.
I'd give them anything they wanted.
They're like God.
They're even better than God.
Listen to this.
To be blunt.
You will, after the show is over, you'll go backstage and let these animals do about anything they want to do to you.
So what?
It would be worth it to me.
Listen to this.
Listen to this.
Listen to this.
I awaited on the couch to the flaring reverberation of a monstrous,
I awaited on the couch to the flaring reverberation of a monstrous,
stereo that had played all night long.
I lit a stale cigarette set up to attempt to focus on my immediate surroundings.
Garbage, cigarette butts, dope trays, needles and albums were strung about with clothes ankle deep on the floor.
I reached forward to begin consuming one of the leftover untouched drinks when I noticed the television set was on.
I almost turned it off.
But something said watch it.
I looked at my life.
It means nothing anymore.
Do you hear me?
It means nothing anymore.
I sat there crammed in thick, battling with myself and the devil.
Whether to make an altar right there in front of that TV set.
Finally I declared to myself that I couldn't make it on my own.
I had to turn to somebody bigger than me.
My previous dope dealer.
Listen to this.
Listen to this.
Listen to this.
God has told me that your parents or anyone else who tells you what to do is the devil and you ought to shout right back at them.
No I'm not a Christian.
I'm not a Christian.
No.
I had anything to do with that.
I'm not a Christian.
I want to say it so plain that a two year old child will understand me.
Be vocal.
Be loud.
Be concise.
And be clear.
I don't care who you are.
I don't care who you are.
I don't care how you speak.



It's a coverup.
It's a sham.
It's a facade.
There is no God.
Man is God.
Yes I know.
Yes I know.
There is no God.
Man is God.
Yes I know.
Yes I know.
Yes I know.
No I'm not a Christian.
I'm not a Christian.
Nope.
Christian.
A Christian.
A Christian.
Held up to the American public as that which is good and noble.
when in reality it is dirty and preventing filthiness.
You better take a strong look, mister, at where you're going to church.
Man!
Oh, that was so fun.
That was Reverend Gordon Truby.
And that's a tape that just came in.
Let me yank that booger out.
Called Post-Hyp-gnosis.
Um, and I wish I knew where to tell you to buy that, but you can't!
If you didn't have that tape deck,
you're just going to have to tune in to Swaggart more often.
He's the greatest, man.
Swaggart, he's the Jimmy, he's the Mick Jagger of evangelists.
He really is.
I love the man.
I...
I want to talk like him.
I want to talk like Jimmy Swaggart.
And I did, I used to, till I ripped off all his best lines.
And now I'm preaching the word of Bob.
We must protect our vanishing numbers.
Friends, human hunters have number skinners.
I mean, these numbers come along, they get their little lines stuck in a trap.
They'll chew the edge of their selves off and lose a whole...
They don't mean...
They don't mean anything after that.
We get a whole bunch of them together.
Eventually, we could get a whole year.
Hold on.
He still has to pay us three dollars.
What the...
Yeah, Mr. Stang?
I want to...
Stang?
I want to tell you how much I appreciate you coming down here,
all the way out here from Texas,
trying to straighten these boys out.
They made a mess of this show.
They need some help.
Help me.
Yeah, it's beyond help.
It's beyond help.
I...
I think you're right.
I think you're right.
I thought for four, five...
Four, five years that they were praising Bob like good subgeniuses.
I come down here and they celebrate his death like it was some kind of a happy event.
Oh, we're free.
Ding dong.
The Dobbs is dead.
It's a subgenius rip-off.
They're using Bob.
That got seven of gunfire.
Just imagine those bullets passing into a Dobbs course.
People have lost their sense of joy in your life.
Most of those guys are just...
It brings so much joy.
I hope you can make these guys see the light and do right by Bob.
They're making a mess.
They're making a mess out of Bob.
We always see light when we press our fingers against our eyelids.
Turtle darkness.
Yes, that turtle darkness is so slow moving.
I don't know why I listen to it anymore.
Well, I can't tell you if you can't tell me.
We don't know why we do it.
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to Mr. Smith.
Smith.
Smith.
Wait a minute.
Mr. Smith?
Mr. Smith.
What do you guys do?
Take him off the air?
No, no.
Include his own history.
He left.
You're mixed.
This old man started the subgenius movement.
Oh, yeah.
He's our boss.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Bob Dobbs started the Church of the Subgenius in 1953.
Let's not drag the pathetic humans in.
They don't tell us the truth.
Fine.
You see this fine fellow is more interested in producing the honest doctors of the air
than in listening to Ivan Stang himself.
Thank you for your concern.
Vote.
Vote.
Vote.

You guys don't know how to raise money.
Vote.
Well, let's hold this discussion for a moment and go from yet our other little flashing
hunger greets.
We know how to kill Bob.
We know how to kill people.
We wish we didn't kill Bob.
Bob's death has made you more crazy than Bob ever was.
How are you?
You on air?
Is it time for the ceremonial killing of Bob?
Oh, you missed it by about two years.
Oh, my goodness.
Sorry.
Hey, I'm sorry.
I know something.
There'll be a head-launching in 20 minutes, though, in a mile.
You know, there's a scandal going on.
People are saying that Shakespeare was actually bombed.
The barrage is getting closer, Lieutenant.
Do you think we ought to move from this position?
No, I think we ought to crawl a little closer.
We have to.
One, two, three, hop!
K-M-O-N-19.9-L-M stereo, the home of alternative rock and roll.
If you didn't hear it here, it is where?
The home of alternative rock and roll.
Y'all hear about somebody?
This is Devo, new Devo.
You can't get it in a store.
You can only get it from Bob, dear friends.
Only from Bob.
And who am I?
A son of all the people who wasted lots of time.
Pulling him out the future, forever asking why.
Some people go on living while others die before their time.
There has never been a reason, whatever is his right.
It's only just because it's much too big a fight.
Like a sailor who is way ahead, but we're still far behind.
You won't be quite yourself out when you start swinging slides.
These are things to have in that side.
These are things to have in that side.
These are things to have in that side.
These are the things we could rather not be dead.
These are things that could rather not be dead.
These are the things to have in that side.
These are things you have to have.
You've got parallelimate
In the Interviewer receptors.
In the Interviewer receptors.

Why try to remain silent?
Why try to remain silent?
We're instantly observed.


The simple people even some don't turn inside out
Shaking each dimension, we're so sure about
The creeds get so frustrated, the fancy's turned bright
A simple box of common sense, just money in the bank
These are the things to understand
These are the things to understand
These are the things that keep you better out than dead
These are the things to understand
These are the things to understand
These are the things to understand
These are the things to understand
These are the things to understand
These are the things that keep you better out than dead
These are the things to understand
These are the things that keep you better out than dead
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, we gotta quit talking dirty now, Will.
Uh, well, so much for them spud boys, so to speak, for a little while.
What's... wait a minute.
That wasn't what I wanted to put on there.
Uh, friends, you can call and, uh, and talk to the Will of Dobbs
and, um, you know, get your two bits worth in, what that's worth.
Not much, in your case.
Heathens, sinners, not a one of you listening is a subgenius member.
Well, there's probably five or six subgenius ministers listening.
The rest of y'all are a bunch of damn riffraff.
But, um...
Uh, you can call the Will of Dobbs here at 823-7490 or 828-9500.
That's 823-7490 or 8... uh, what is it?
828-9500.
See, you know, I haven't had any sleep in a couple of days.
That, that doesn't impress you, I know.
But, see, I gotta finish playing this tape of me on the San Francisco radio show
because I'm gonna be on the radio.
I'm gonna be on the San Francisco radio show next Saturday morning.
What?
L-O-U on air.
Just like this.
Not again.
See, I told you.
We get those calls in Dallas.
Okay, now look, I'm not going out this time.
One of you guys go...
I went out two times and nobody else did it the last time.
Somebody else can go out and pick that thing up.
Call the animal control board.
I mean, I normally eat road kills, but I don't know about a smashed dog.
We'll have to send one of those...
Uh, animal control trucks over.
It's no good.
It's destroyed, man.
It's destroyed.
Fifty cars ran over it before anybody would stop.
Well, you know, but the cells can still...
One cell carries all the code information to create a new Dobbs.
You cook that thing just like you cook abalone.
You peel that dog's corpse right off the road.
You dip it in egg and a little bit of flour.
Eggs.
And cook it in olive oil.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
What was the last time you had you a big old bowl of fried dead body of Dobbs, dear friend?
Yes.
We call it Bob's Birmingham.
Bob's Birmingham.
That's right.
It's the most delicious of all road kills.
Much better than skunks, squirrels, or kitty.
Or squished ferrets and weasels.
But Bob's spirit lives on.
You can talk about these Bob corpses, like I said, but he lives because he's more than just a dead body with a grin on its face and a broken pipe in its mouth.
He represents something, dear friends.
He represents...
And all of the checks.
He represents...
And all of the checks.

P.O. Box 140306.
Dallas, Texas 75214.
Remember that address, folks, because later on during this program we're going to have a special bonus.
So, Sonia, the scene...
Oh, they don't like to shut their damn game out of the house.
They're saying, shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.








Shut up.
Shut up.








So, call in and talk to the Will of Dogs at 828-9500 or 823-7490.
In the meantime, here's some more Reverend Gordon trivia.
How lucky that you dropped in.
I remember a will that sees...
Isn't it hell?
Just about six years ago.
It was 4 a.m. in a Holiday Inn, Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Shots on my bots, scotch on the rocks, and what else I just don't know.
I was trying to get back and buy me some slack, but I needed some money to show me the way.
I searched the world for my personal savior.
I found him nowhere.
I should have looked there first.
Most never, just 나나 이렇게 일이 말씀드�ético


This Know Thacks!!!
RAIN Diese 악기가 또icted pins Insider, hört,


I don't know what we're doingцию
My stream streaming is just this, but I'm going to do something else.

then just turn on prime time.

Through the rain and the snow I looked high and low for personal soul salvation
From the Trash Life Club, Cathedral and Pub to communes and bowel irrigation
A lot of luck then it dawned on me but New York was my destination
From the shower mobs I met this guy Dobbs on the shuttle to Grand Central Station
He said follow me and I'll set you free for only a small donation
I said use our wheel just send me the bill last hope is better than none
Yes sir, I searched the book of my personal savior
I found it nowhere I should have looked there first
I found it nowhere I should have looked there first

I call this little opus The Dark.
It's the sort of horror that was most effective on radio after midnight
to make you wish, as you pull the bed covers over your head that night,
that the author had been strangled while very young.
But he wasn't.
So, try this on for size.
Hey, where are you turning?
The alarm said Pine Street, didn't it, Doc?
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
So why this siren? The only traffic out here is on horseback.
Yeah, you can say that again, Doc. It's from nothing to nowhere.
Okay, let's go.
Yeah, right with you, Doc, right with you.
Said somebody was hurt?
That's what the switchboard said.
What a dump.
Don't seem to be a bell.
Oh, there must be. There's a light in there.
Try the door.
It's open.
Well, let's go.
All right.
Hello in there.
Hello.
This is another false alarm.
Anybody here? I'm a doctor.
Doctor.
Hey, look.
In the corner.
This I gotta see.
Lady, I'm a doctor from General Hospital.
Now, what's the matter?
She is screwy all right, ain't she?
Frightened.
Come on, Doc.
Come on, I should get her out of here.
Or the straitjacket.
Should I get the straitjacket?
No, Doc, wait.
Where are you going?
Can't get it open.
Huh?
What's the matter?
What do you want to go in there for?
Can't get this open.
Okay.
Whoever is hurt.
Must be in there.
Blasted door.
Come on, let's break it down.
But the woman.
Forget the woman.
Come on, put your shoulder to it.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah, all right.
It's dark.
Yeah.
Can't see a thing.
Go on back in the other room and get that kerosene lamp.
Well, I get it, I say.
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Here, Doc.
The lamp.
Okay.
Hold it high.
Yeah.
What?
Oh, mother in heaven.
What?
On the floor.
What is it?
It's a man.
Oh, no.
It can't be.
Yes, I tell you, yes.
It's a man.
A man.
A man.











And he's been turned inside out.
Inside out?
Yes.
See for yourself.
It's a man.
But the skin is the inside.
The raw flesh is the outside.
Organs hanging out.
It's a miracle.
A man turned inside out.
They can turn a glove inside out.


It's alive. It's alive.
It's alive.
It's trying to get up.
Trying to get up.
Trying to move.
Sam, the red light.
Look at it rolling over.
Trying to get up.
Trying to get up on its knees.
Stop. Make it stop.
Kill it. Do something.
Stop. Stop.
Hysterical old woman.
That's what you are.
Now you stand there and shut up.
Listen to him.
Listen to him.
Come on.
Let's get out of here, Doc.
Please.
Don't be a fool.
We'll get to find out.
What?
What?
Look.
There's another door.
Yeah.
Open.
The answer might be in there.
Doc, don't.
We got to...
The lantern.
Bring it.
Gee, Doc.
Why can't we just go?
Hold it high.
Doc, what...
Don't move.
There's...
There's no floor in there.
I...
I don't see nothing.
Nothing but dark.
Well, look.
Look.
The dark sort of spills over on the edges.
Huh?
Well, look, I tell you.
It's a deeper dark than dark.
Something moving in there.
Doc?
Close the door.
No.
No, wait.
Then I'll close it.
Oh, you fool.
Open that door.
I've got to see what...
He's coming in here.
Come on, Doc.
Let's get out of here.
No, Sam.
I'm going to find out what this is all about.
All my life,
things have been what they've been.
And I'm going to know all about this.
Please, Doc.
Please, let's get out of here.
Woman, if you know anything, tell me.
What was it we saw back of that door
where the floor should have been?
Do you know?
She...
She's going to the door.
She's going to open it.
Yes.
Oh, Doc, will you listen to me?
Let's get out of here.
No.
Now, wait.
She's just standing there.
Looking in at the dark.
Yeah.
Dark?
What's that coming up out of the hole in the floor?
The dark.
It's like...
Like black smoke.
Listen to it.
It's reaching up to her.
Yes.
What is it?
Smoke?
Smoke?
Black?
What?
Crawling up around her.
It's covering her.
No.
Inside out.
It turned her.
Inside out.
Inside out.

Ah...
Sam.
Sam, get up.
Sam, open your eyes.
The shadows, they're crawling along the floor toward us.
Come on, Sam.
Come on.
Sam, you're...
Oh, you're too heavy.
I can't lift you.
Sam, you've got to hear me.
The shadows, they're crawling toward me along the floor.
I can't leave you.
You saw what they did to her.
Look at her.
Inside out.
A woman inside out.
Oh.
Oh, Sam, I'll drag you out of here.
Oh, you're so heavy.
They're coming faster and faster, like long black fingers.
Ah, my legs!
Let go of me!
Sam, I can't help you to holding me back.
The black, it's covering you!
Sam!
Sam!
Sam!
No!
No, you thing whatever you are, get off me!
Stop covering me!
I've got to get out of here. I've got to tell them all about you.
I've got to tell everyone there's something like you loose in the world.
Got to warn everybody.
Get off me!
Cold.
Slimy.
How can shadows be slimy?
So cold.
Covering me over.
My head.
My face.
My face.
My mouth.
Let go.
Let go of me.
Let go of me.
No!
No!
No!
No!








No!



No!
No, not Suitable To Everybody,









What? What strange land is this?
What am I doing here?
How did this happen?
Why am I asking you?
I've been giving a suspect foul play
Late at night when I am sleeping
You smiting momos come up screaming
Sucking me into your world of horror
Can this be the world of tomorrow?
Wait a minute, just a second
I know who you are
Yes, it's true, you're the citizens of the neighborhood
What the hell is it that you're trying to do to me?
Help me, help me, I gotta get out of here
You're making me brain damaged
All these people hanging around my head
It's the hour of the living, it's the hour of the living
Perhaps I just need a slight cranial adjustment
Like the dentist pulling my gums inside out
And pulling my brain out through my gum cavity
As my head implodes and is yanked out by some damn Yankee Garber
Perhaps I'm a beauty queen
The target of a thousand flying jackasses
Praying and mocking the violence
That's stultified, stupefied defamation on my whole TV
Perhaps I'm already worth ten million dollars
With the mofo geeks chasing me through the woods
Trying to rip off my crutches
And use me for a game of hide and seek


Like a human weenie roast in front of the campfire girls' glee club
Perhaps nothing is what I think it is
Maybe you're all just a bunch of nice guys
And you aren't really trying to suck every last semen out of my pocket
And give me absolutely nothing in return
Wait a minute, I know who you are
You're the citizens of the neighborhood
What the hell are you trying to do to me?
You're making me pray, damn it's always been lying around my head
It's the island of the living
Perhaps I need just a slight cranial adjustment
Perhaps I'm a beauty queen
Perhaps I'm already worth ten million dollars
With the mofo geeks chasing me through the woods
The mofo geeks chasing me through the woods
There's nobody there who's gonna go an hour

Never nope to the Nazis
They'll yell and swear what kind of a idea it was
Or tell the secret conhece
You know who you are
You know everything that god knows
Not on air.
See, they gave up because we didn't respond properly, and who knows?
Oh, there it is again.
Search air.
One soul.
Her breath.
Hello.
Hello, caller.
Hello?
Listen.
Hello?
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, I've been having a lot of trouble trying to decide how to kill these small fur animals
because what I find is that if you use a large gun, then you can't get the fur real good.
That's really nice.
You've got a big problem there.
See, the problem with these furry animals is that they're like leeches.
They're large, and they attach themselves to your body right below your navel.
Now, what you've got to do is just take a gun and blow that thing right off of your belly.
We recommend a 35-millimeter howitzer.
Oh, that long.
What is that?
This thing.
Oh, you know what?
The thing is, sometimes I hit them, and it looks like it's okay,
but you can't be sure if you hit them or if they got away.
Just brush the hairs and seal in the green of the animal's natural coat any puncture, wounds, or exit wounds.
If you pet the thing, you'll become friends with it.
If you become friends with it, you'll be unable to kill it.
And if you're unable to kill it, then you're unable to sell it.
And you're certainly unable to eat it.
And if you can't sell it, why own it?
And if you can't eat it, why own it or sell it?
See, if you really believe it's all powerful, then you're willing to kill it, see?
And they're, let's see.
See?
There it is.
Bob is not dead, dear friends.
Bob is going to be back.
I mean, he, as far as I'm concerned, he never died.
Or if he did, they killed him twice.
They had to keep killing him.
But, oh, they can't keep him down.
He's in the in-between place between heaven and earth, bobbing in the neoplasm.
But he's still watching, friends.
He's got a special etheric TV.
He's making a list and checking it twice.
He's going to find out who's naughty or nice.
He'll know who believes.
And who don't.
And who believes too much.
Remember, there's a free plastic dinosaur in every package.
False slack.
Get your false slack right here.
Suggested from a church audiences only.
Church air, one soul per breath.
Friends, you think you got all the church air in the world right now, don't you?
Some make rules, some obey.
But the rules are for the fools, is what I say.
One of these days, that church air is going to run out.
What you going to be saying then, huh?
You going to be saying, oh, Bob.
Maybe I should not have sucked all that church air.
Maybe I should have done what you said.
Quit sucking on the finger and go where it points.
Put that thing away.
That's right.
Don't hurt yourself here, Ivan.
It's, it's, the show's almost over.
And I mean, I'd feel terrible if you hurt yourself.
Get him to throw a towel over it.
Get him to throw a tantrum.
See, friends, I get in the spirit.
It ain't easy being in the spirit 16, 18 hours a day.
But you, you know, you get fired up.
You get all bobbed.
You get all bobbed up.
And you got to preach.
You got to get up on top of it.
This is true, my dear friends.
They can talk about me all over Dallas County.
They can talk about me all over Dallas.
I don't care.
I'm going to say that I believe in Bob.
I don't believe that Bob's dead.
And if he is, so what?
Do you think I'm going to stop Bob?
Yes, it's more like trying to stop a hurricane or a mighty force of nature.
Why do you think they, why do you think they call it Hurricane Bob?
Listen, dear friends.
Donnie Mills.

The 10th day of the human totem pole.
The morning was December gray of the 10th and 10th day of the human totem pole.
The man at the bottom was smiling.
He had just finished his breakfast smiling.
It hadn't rained or manured for over two hours.
The man at the top was starving.
The pole was a horrible looking thing with all of those eyes and ears and waving hands for balance.
There was no way to get a copter in close.
So everybody was starving together.
The man at the top had long ago given up but didn't have nerve enough to climb down.
At night the pole would talk to itself.
And the chatter wasn't too good.
Obviously the pole didn't like itself.
It wanted to walk.
It was the summer and it was hot.
And balance wouldn't permit a skinning to undergarments.
It was an integrated pole.
It was taking on a reddish brown cast.
Exercise on the pole was isometric.
Kind of a flex.
And then back to the pole.
Balance.
Then the eyes would roll together.
The ears wiggle.
Hands balance.
There was a gurgling and googling herd.
A tenth of the way up the pole.
Approaching was a small child with Statue of Liberty doll.
Plus all sons and daughters before much as three.
Unfortunately no sign of her.
Not all.
Well bosh all three were out there.
This was pretty nice.
Shame on me if we found her.
Empathies are fear in the eyes of death.
They wouldn't let us see her.
We knew these vagabonds didn't know if she would be in the house.
We figured we chewy as auum.
Oh, yeah.
Praise Captain Beefheart.
That's Captain Beefheart and his magic band.
The tale of the human totem pole.
And it is a human totem pole, friend.
The Willa Dobbs just got him a call from a punk boy.
Now, I got nothing against your hardcore music and such like.
If it really was.
If it was really hardcore, it wouldn't tend to...
All those bands wouldn't tend to all look alike and sound alike.
And if the punk boy was really a punk boy, he wouldn't try to look like all the bands.
And I just...
One wonders how far...
How far it can evolve from, you know, a legitimate gripe on the part of working class kids in England in 1976 to 1987.
Middle class America.
How much did you spend on your uniform, punk boy?
How much did you spend to look like an individual, huh?
So that you'd have the same individual neck brace that your favorite band...
Your hero.
Your god.
And yet, he had the nerve to get on and go...
Yeah, I noticed.
All you guys talk about is Bob, man.
I question Ramones, man.
Question Ramones, man.
It's hard.
Man, I thought the Ramones were a great band, you know?
At one time.
I used to dance around with my kid on my back to the Ramones.
But then that time, I had to rape and kill all the members of all the...


All the bands...
That you ever liked.
That changed my opinion.
Because they didn't fight back very hard.
It was almost like they wanted it.
They wanted...
They wanted to be taken...
From behind.
Children, in light, or should I say dimness, of the 17th anniversary of Woodstock, which just passed...
I'd like to speak to you tonight about the 60s.
60s.
Some people have confronted me after they've encountered the philosophies of the Church of the Subgenius
by saying that they've heard it all before.
The concepts of slack and subgenius are rehashed, refried ideas left over from the 60s.
A do-your-own-thing, man.
Love, peace, anarchy, down with the fascist, imperialist, war-monging, capitalist establishment, pig-dogs.
Hey, man, we closed down the New York State Thruway type mentality.
And they go on to point out that the hippies all sold out and currently have networking parties.
They're all at slick New York nightclubs, as if to say that that is the path of the Church of the Subgenius.
Nay!
The problem with the hippies was that they played right into the hands of the conspiracy.
A real organization, I must remind you.
They played right into their hands by losing their collective sense of humor,
being low in ignorance and high in expectations.
They took themselves too seriously, and thus they solidified, paralyzed in pools of rhetoric.
Now, the Church of the Subgenius is an ongoing extraction process that culls the slack-filled concepts from the religions and philosophies of the past and so on.
J.R. Bob Dobbs has always said, do your own thing.
But just don't end up like the pinks and normals and glorps who believe that they're doing their own thing when, in fact, they pay to know what they really think.
Oh, thank you, Sister Chris.
Oh, that was lovely.
Incredible how these rants from other towns seem to sync up with each other.
Well, Ron Lindsey made it here.
Friends, this is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.
And, uh, there we go.
It's the Down Memory Lane show.
You are kissing goodbye to the mighty hour of slack.
Praise God!
Praise Ron!
I stumbled on this photograph
It kinda made me laugh
It took me way back
Back down memory lane
I see the happiness
I see the pain
Where am I?
Back down memory lane
Back down memory lane
Back down memory lane

I see her standing there
Such a happy, happy pair
Love beyond compare
Look at there, look at there
Do you do the way you held me?
No one could tell me
That love would die
Oh, why?
Do you do the way you held me?
Did I have to find this photograph?
I thought I had forgot the past
Now I'm slipping fast
Oh, back down memory lane
I feel the happiness
I feel the pain
Here am I
Back down memory lane
