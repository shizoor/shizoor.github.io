1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
From PR News in Washington, I'm king of at least six people, most of them security guards.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,080
I'm farting from upstate New York to Maine.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,400
And the mayor of Boston staggers home.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,000
Heavy wet farts.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,160
That's been a benefit.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:13,980
Farts today.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,680
On Wall Street at this hour, 152.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,020
The White House says that this is PR News from Washington.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,380
The popular social networking internet website PR News has reached agreement with more than

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,620
145 sexual predators to protect $20 billion worth of weapons.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,980
An Israeli official is supposed to fly within 125 miles of PR News in Washington.

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,560
PR comes from low-income women's and children's and families.org.

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:50,500
In a few generations, their legs will grow slim, their bodies thin, their tusks longer.

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,560
Goodbye.

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,560
The baby!

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,520
The baby!

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,500
Finish.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,280
Title two, directions four, inward filthy lusts.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,220
Direction one, drink wine or strong drink.

20
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,960
It is better for you than beer.

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,220
Direction two, think of tempting filthy objects.

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,800
Number three, eat windy meats.

23
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,940
Number four, copiously evacuate.

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,860
And if you do not, you perish.

25
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,260
Bite.

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,640
Number five, eat maggots.

27
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,380
Direction six, prepare to sodomize for their filthy lusts.

28
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,380
Direction seven, be corrupted with money nor perverted by flattery.

29
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,820
Direction eight, cause that pernicious deliriation in the brain.

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,700
Direction nine, produce temptations to lust.

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,860
Direction ten, let your apparel be suited to your disease.

32
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,360
Direction eleven, don't drink.

33
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,440
Don't think what your admired carcass will be when it is laying a few days in the grave.

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,200
Direction twelve, go back when you see the bait.

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,560
Beaver.

36
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,020
Starring, starring Barbara Beaver.

37
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,540
Beaver.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:15,900
Beaver.

39
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,780
But dad.

40
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,440
You know, Beaver, your mother and I were very...

41
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,360
Ah, that you deliberately...

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,540
Nah.

43
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,580
Nah.

44
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,800
Yes, sir.

45
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,120
Well, Wally, I, uh...

46
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,140
I had a clop you won.

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,740
Ah, Wally, I don't think...

48
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,920
I thought I told you to shut up.

49
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,860
Yeah, well, uh, I'll just...

50
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:36,620
I don't know.

51
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,160
Okay.

52
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,160
Winnie the Pooh finds tail.

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,800
And then he put his head down and looked between his front legs.

54
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,840
I, Winnie the Pooh, will find tail food.

55
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,960
So Winnie the Pooh went off to find tail.

56
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,640
To the hundred acre wood.

57
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,120
L-O-L.

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,920
L-O-L.

59
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,160
Pooh looked at the knocker and...

60
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,800
Large somethings.

61
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,820
Pulled the knockers.

62
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,540
Ow!

63
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,440
The knockers.

64
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,600
Pooh looked at the bush.

65
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,400
Nailed it.

66
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,160
Nailed it.

67
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,940
Nailed it.

68
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,420
Nailed it.

69
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,260
So happily.

70
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:15,800
Ow!

71
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,780
Winnie the Pooh came over all funny.

72
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,280
Pooh found tail.

73
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,700
I said Pooh.

74
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,860
I found tail.

75
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:38,080
I want scarlet sin and the moral leper.

76
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:46,680
People think of full and complete sexual intercourse and every form of sexual deed

77
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,740
and think of fornication between a man and a broad or not.

78
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,620
Thou shalt fornicate in...

79
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,320
Body and behavior.

80
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,520
Or better, thou shalt engage in any sexual activity whatsoever.

81
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:13,660
And of course, let each wife sexually submit to very shameful, awkward, perverted, irremediable,

82
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,920
extended, intense sexual activity.

83
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:25,100
Utilizing the sexual parts in a sexual manner in total permanent sexual subjection to,

84
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,240
all forms of perverted sexual urges in our minds.

85
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,920
And of course, engage in perverted sexual perversions.

86
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:44,260
But, what one has to do is to plead with God to give one that gift of total sexual action.

87
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,820
Because otherwise, we need to get pornography to look at the strange woman and be seen her underwear.

88
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,820
As far as I'm concerned...

89
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,680
You can go too.

90
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,280
Go back to Tony's and that woman you were mooning.

91
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,880
Oh, knock it off, will you?

92
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,680
Now, you pulled a boner tonight and you know it.

93
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,500
Why?

94
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,820
My husband.

95
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:08,860
Huh.

96
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,640
drauf och steht?

97
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,300
Ba Wat?

98
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,360
Evening, by lessons on snapchat and iso, you Create stories as meweird.

99
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,360


100
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,160
Can I look at meun ellas si mi moon airporta al?

101
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,760
BVE UGRA's Zери pah?!

102
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,160
Thank you.

103
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,940
Thank you.

104
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,480
Thank you.

105
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,880
Thank you.

106
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,400
Thank you.

107
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,000
Thank you.

108
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,380
Thank you.

109
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,080
Thank you.

110
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,120
Thank you.

111
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,680
Thank you.

112
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,820
Thank you.

113
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,560
Thank you.

114
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,900
Thank you.

115
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,960
Thank you so much.

116
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Have you traveled far?

117
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,860
That's Paul Atkins.

118
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,740
Rural war room.

119
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,740
Dr. Stang calling Dr. Putris.

120
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,960
Your brain's been invaded.

121
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,120
Actually, I think you can go to myspace.com rural war room records.

122
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,120
Blue and purple alert.

123
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,940
Oh, hi.

124
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,760
I'm sorry.

125
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:50,420
I would just like to mention the fact that I have had my pancreas, as you mentioned before, changed into a sexual organ.

126
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,320
Really?

127
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,420
Since we as subgeniuses have our choice and may either reproduce with our own organs as we will.

128
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,640
Well, all things bright and mutable.

129
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,380
So that would be like getting to fifth base if someone were to palpate your pancreas.

130
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,360
If you have more than one sexual organ, you can imagine.

131
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,000
That's like going all the way, but then some.

132
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,360
I know what first base is, second base, third base.

133
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,960
In theory, I know what these things are.

134
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,720
And a home run.

135
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,580
Well, theoretically.

136
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,780
But pancreas.

137
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,620
Pancreatic palpation would be fifth base, I guess.

138
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,140
Beyond all the way and through to the other side.

139
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,640
Break on through, man.

140
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,640
See, I knew you were going to get it, but think about your liver and your spleen.

141
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,900
And the myopic fun you can have reacting in such a way.

142
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,420
I mean, if you had one.

143
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,940
You don't have much spleen, except I noticed when you bit my leg on the way here.

144
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,060
But outside of that, you see, not a spleenless man.

145
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,500
Not spleenless, but not heavily spleen.

146
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,720
Yeah, heavily spleen.

147
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,000
We could say.

148
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,600
I've known a lot of people, I just call them heavenly.

149
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,220
Heavenly, hell no.

150
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,560
Heavily spleen.

151
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,660
So visceral.

152
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,620
Now, friends, while I'm still thinking about the news of the cult.

153
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,120
You know, X Day is coming up, the end of the world.

154
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:13,960
Once again.

155
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,040
On July 5th, the planet will be destroyed at 7 a.m.

156
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,560
How many times is it going to end?

157
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,580
And if not, we'll have more.

158
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,380
Or get more practice for that moment.

159
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,760
Because as the lesson is, you don't know what day X Day.

160
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,160
The rupture could be any day.

161
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,320
Any second now.

162
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,180
Are you ready?

163
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,160
Lesson one?

164
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,400
There is no lesson.

165
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,400
Anyway, you can.

166
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,100
So we're getting ready.

167
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:44,360
We're getting all geared up for our X Day drill in Sherman, New York, later on in the summer.

168
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,940
And I got so excited about it because I put up a pictorial.

169
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,300
On the Subgenius website, which you can look at if you're interested in for free.

170
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,100
It's also a Vips page.

171
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,900
Then scroll down to the X Day part and you can't miss it.

172
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,240
It says the X Days of your pictorial adults only.

173
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:16,940
And it is, in fact, the naked adults only pictures of our grandparents at X Days in the past.

174
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,520
Quite indeed.

175
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:17,920
It's there.

176
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,340
Really.

177
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,560
It's pictures from X Days of the 30th.

178
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:20,560


179
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,940
The 20s even.

180
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,480
The 30s and 40s.

181
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,700
So it's kind of old-fashioned.

182
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,020
But it's sexy.

183
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:32,340
Because even the subgeniuses of yore, well, if they hadn't been sexy, we wouldn't be here now, would we?

184
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,900
I like the funny writing on the back of it.

185
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,460
Dearest Mom and Dad, I bet you thought you'd never see me this way.

186
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,180
Signed, your daughter Erna.

187
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,860
Was it Erstweil?

188
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,060
No, that was the guy.

189
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,320
Anyway, I love when they write off these little diaphragms to each other in Uniclaw language.

190
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,560
And they can't.

191
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,540
They have before.

192
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,880
Well, you can't see those on these website pictures.

193
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,580
Because you can't flip the picture over and look at the handwriting on the back of the snapshot.

194
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,860
But I scanned all those old photos that your folks took at X Days.

195
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,920
And Prince of Everybody's, you know.

196
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,480
There's some.

197
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,180
And it's a lot of.

198
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,220
My great-grandpa looked great in like a hat and a pipe and nothing else.

199
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,640
That's right.

200
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,420
I couldn't believe that an old guy that I look at as a very old guy could actually be strutting around there like.

201
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,520
People wear more.

202
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,740
More clothes there now.

203
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,660
Hardly anybody goes completely nude at X Day.

204
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,240
Well, that's the nature of the world.

205
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,700
Everyone wears more clothes at all times because clothes are.

206
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,380
It's not the nature of naturists.

207
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,960
No, certainly not.

208
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,540
But who follows their followings?

209
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,380
Those are droppings.

210
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,160
You know what I'm saying?

211
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,760
That's how you find Bob.

212
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,000
You follow the droppings.

213
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,960
Follow the droppings.

214
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,360
And the cotter pins.

215
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:42,920
Yeah.

216
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,640
And the jello.

217
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,100
People forget.

218
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,840
You said before they were hand grenade cotter pins, not jello.

219
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,360
What else have we got coming up that I can announce?

220
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,100
Because I'm not getting paid for it.

221
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,640
Hamburg Devival.

222
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,700
We're not going to be there.

223
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:01,300
But if you friends happen to be in Hamburg, Germany on May 3rd, just follow the look for the smoke and the flames.

224
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:11,600
And that's where the big Devival will be with all the Euro subs, which includes several American subs who can't go home to America.

225
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,760
Can you imagine?

226
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:18,300
We've stooped so low that our droppings won't even allow our alien friends to return to their homelands.

227
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,480
It makes you want to seep and crawl.

228
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,440
My droppings aren't stopping anybody from doing anything.

229
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,460
Oh, I didn't mean in the sub-natural, I meant in the over-gross.

230
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,920
Or the uber-gross, I guess you would call it.

231
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,240
The uber-grossian-mentioner.

232
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,860
Speaking of uber-gross, what else?

233
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:45,940
Actually, people who are interested in uber-gross sub-genius events may want to just look at subgenius.com and look at the news page.

234
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,380
Because there are things coming up that we can't tell you about.

235
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,420
You understand?

236
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:50,860
You understand?

237
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,000
That's how good they are.

238
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,620
We're not allowed to...

239
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:59,540
Will we allow you to tell about the Princess We Are Do's band singing at the Hessler Street Fair this year?

240
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,460
That's for free, yes.

241
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,760
Revel will be at May 17th, the Hester Street Fair.

242
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,760
Hessler, even.

243
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,300
Because we can't tell you anything that does us any good.

244
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,460
That's the law.

245
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,600
But we're going to...

246
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,020
It's not a sub-genius law, that's the human law.

247
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,240
No sub-genius can do anything it wants.

248
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,920
That's the law.

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,560
That's the law.

250
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,920
It's written in the books now.

251
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,980
And the Bible and the Holy Constitution.

252
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:33,200
And yet, the 14th Amendment says that anything that more than one sub-genius businessman does is therefore legal.

253
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,260
It becomes legal at that point.

254
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,200
Yet so she all be done to by thyself.

255
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,460
So if you're doing it by yourself, it might still be illegal.

256
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,120
But if two of us are doing it, then it's okay.

257
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,360
And what yet two businessmen do, only they do...

258
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,540
That law was written, it said businessmen.

259
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,740
It did not say businessperson.

260
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:50,820
It was written by businesspersons.

261
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,900
There it is.

262
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,440
So, you know, it's that old double standard.

263
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:53,900
We have to take...

264
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,680
We can't take that at face value unless we're like a pack of two-faced liars.

265
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,260
We have to assume that that meant business...

266
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,900
You know how women used to have to call themselves men when they went to work?

267
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,640
And then they had to call themselves men in the afternoon?

268
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,420
And by the way, I'd just like to mention the fact that you forgot to plug my little thing

269
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,740
that I'm doing at the Communist Party meeting of the Communist Party of the United States

270
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,340
of America.

271
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,400
I didn't know that.

272
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,740
I didn't know that either.

273
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,520
Sure you didn't like it.

274
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,340
I knew you were a commie, but I didn't know that.

275
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,780
I've been creating you guys all week.

276
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,320
I'm going to be speaking at the Grand Function with the frat fairies and sores of my comrades,

277
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,620
my tovarishes.

278
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,920
Well, it's not really Russian.

279
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,060
We just call ourselves comrades.

280
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,940
We're going to be having the fish dinner, well, the fish luncheon afterwards.

281
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,900
And we're going to be having POC beer that's been in the basement for 40 years.

282
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,120
What's POC mean?

283
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,540
PP on Cleveland.

284
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,480
Or it used to mean Pfeiffer of Cleveland, but...

285
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,220
Pride of Cleveland.

286
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,740
Right.

287
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,260
That's what they say.

288
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,840
I said pride of Cleveland, but it really means PP on Cleveland or poop on Cleveland.

289
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,700
Oh, that's just a vernacularism.

290
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,560
When we were childs we used to say that.

291
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,920
But I'm going to be speaking about the movement itself and also the fact that I think the

292
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,420
subgenius, as many of them should join me...

293
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,340
The commies?

294
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,580
...should become communist like me.

295
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,680
That's like the opposite of Bob's.

296
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,860
Bob's like the ultimate god of capitalism.

297
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,180
Well then don't you see the irony in the perfect six things?

298
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,900
Making money at the expense of the sucker.

299
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,240
Don't you see that's the...

300
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,240
That's the succinctly perfect statement for the irony of the ironic thing?

301
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,120
Customer is the sucker of the world.

302
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,140
It is the sucker of the world, but as long...

303
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,000
So why should we be interested in a bunch of commies?

304
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,180
Because we're all suckers.

305
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,780
Yeah, but some suckers are more equal than others, Dave.

306
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,280
And I'm one of those more equal ones.

307
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,320
So that means if I was going to be a commie, I'd be the commissar.

308
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,800
You would be dressed up in the pig suit.

309
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:49,540
I'd be the equal guy in the pig suit that got driven by a human chauffeur to the big

310
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900
barnyard in the Kremlin.

311
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,800
Well, I'm going to be wearing Lenin's...

312
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,480
I'm going to be wearing Lenin's overcoat, man.

313
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,920
I'm going to be talking to the mass...

314
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,760
I'm wearing Lenin's underwear right now.

315
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,220
Are you really?

316
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:58,920
My Lenin's.

317
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,320
I call them.

318
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,340
Your Lenin's.

319
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,920
How long did it take you to get those things?

320
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,800
I guess they were real expensive on eBay or something, right?

321
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,820
Oh, they're so intimate.

322
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,800
The right state...

323
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,000
What's this noise in the background?

324
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,000
That's the rural war room.

325
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,600
It's the rural war room thing.

326
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,340
It's the rural war room machine.

327
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,160
It's coming as smart as...

328
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,520
It's the...

329
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:19,520


330
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:19,520


331
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:19,520


332
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:19,520


333
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:19,520


334
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:19,520


335
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,020
Oh, he's on and on and on.

336
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,520
Now, listen, nickel crow.

337
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,740
You remove the crow with your thumb.

338
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,960
Your prehensile thumb that Bob...

339
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,340
No.

340
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,540
No, not Bob.

341
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,500
That...

342
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,860
God, no.

343
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,960
That nature...

344
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,700
Hey, Spira.

345
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,000
That nature.

346
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,220
Remove your thumb from your eye.

347
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,140
Now, stand near the door.

348
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,700
Move out of the door.

349
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,940
Move out the window.

350
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,760
Now, flap your arms.

351
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,140
Flap your wings.

352
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,120
You can fly!

353
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,100
Yup.

354
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,520
You can fly.

355
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:49,520


356
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:49,520


357
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:49,520


358
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:49,520


359
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:49,520


360
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:49,520


361
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:49,520


362
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
You can fly, baby.

363
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,640
Just get with Bob and grow your wings.

364
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,640
I'm flying!

365
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,180
Grow the wings in your mind, man.

366
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,860
I'm sorry.

367
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,780
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,720
I'm sorry.

369
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,800
I'm sorry.

370
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,420
I'm sorry.

371
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,040
I'm sorry.

372
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,340
Bob is like a pink, glarp, normal.

373
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,040
He supports the conspiracy, supports class division.

374
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,020
He ought to be killed, but...

375
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,520
Yeah.

376
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,520


377
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,520


378
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,520


379
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,520


380
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,520


381
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,520


382
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,520


383
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,520


384
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,520


385
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,520


386
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,520


387
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:19,520


388
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,400
He's a pretty nice guy for a personal savior.

389
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,700
I know he is.

390
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,320
I mean...

391
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:23,920
To quote...

392
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,840
What do you mean?

393
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,240
What do you mean?

394
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,380
Drelloid mutant.

395
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,280
Get off my flight!

396
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,080
All right.

397
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,220
The late Drelloid mutant.

398
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,340
The late, late Drelloid mutant.

399
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,180
Oh, we're going to be playing a song by the...

400
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:43,060
Later on in the show, we're going to be playing an ancient song that somebody found in a pile

401
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:49,360
of 78s that appears to be a Church of the Subgenius Hillbilly gospel song from like the 30s or

402
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,520
the...

403
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:49,520


404
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:49,520


405
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:49,520


406
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:49,520


407
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:49,520


408
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:49,520


409
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:49,520


410
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:49,520


411
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,820
20s or something.

412
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,640
It was on a wax record, but we'll get to that.

413
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,300
We can't figure out if it's an oaky or if it's actually like, you know, from West Virginia

414
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:56,780
or something.

415
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,280
I mean, it's way up here.

416
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,580
We're trying to figure out the label.

417
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,260
I guess it was on the Sugarfest radio show.

418
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:03,640
Yes.

419
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,720
We can't tell if it's an oaky or a pudding.

420
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,160
But I can't play that because it doesn't...

421
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,280
It may be a pudding.

422
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:08,760
I think it's a pudding.

423
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,900
It doesn't come up yet.

424
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,800
Like a pudding.

425
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,000
However...

426
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,400
Is it?

427
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,680
However, let's just see what happens if I...

428
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:18,920
Yeah.

429
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:19,780
Let's see.

430
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,160
Hold it.

431
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,360
Love That Bob.

432
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,020
Starring Bob Cumming.

433
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,220
You're gonna look sensational in a bathing suit.

434
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,740
I know that.

435
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,680
We're swinging.

436
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,420
Bob didn't take this.

437
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,620
Bob can take better pictures.

438
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,140
Take it.

439
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,640
Take it.

440
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,840
Rock and roll rears its ugly head.

441
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,460
Bob.

442
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:40,680
Bob.

443
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,360
Rock and roll.

444
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,040
Rock and roll.

445
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,880
You're big.

446
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,080
Hold it, baby.

447
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,580
Oh, I'd love to.

448
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,240
I'm gonna...

449
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,740
More.

450
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,220
More.

451
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:49,500
More.

452
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:49,500


453
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:49,500


454
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:49,500


455
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,280
Oh, oh, oh.

456
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:50,660
Oh.

457
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,420
Peckers.

458
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,360
Peckers.

459
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,160
Peckers.

460
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,620
Well.

461
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,020
Bob, I just found a way to get the guitar, Bob.

462
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,300
Hey.

463
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:58,860
Swell.

464
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,520
Swell.

465
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,040
Who could he be?

466
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,440
Who could he be?

467
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,020
Crazy.

468
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,680
Where can I get that kind of sausage?

469
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,880
Bob's Rock and Roll.

470
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,240
So Bob.

471
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,520
Bob.

472
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,180
No, no.

473
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,060
Please, please don't ask me to show it to you.

474
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,400
Guitar wizardry.

475
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:10,940
Virtuoso.

476
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,600
You'll never get a girl with rock and roll.

477
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,920
Bob, the girl's flip.

478
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,220
That's so true, John.

479
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:16,960
That's so true.

480
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
That's so true, John.

481
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,140
That's so true, John.

482
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,420
Really?

483
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:19,960
Really?

484
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,420
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-focus, focus, focus, focus.

485
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,220
The Center for Strong Homosexual Issues.

486
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,060
Internet pornography.

487
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,580
Pornography.

488
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,160
practices for women towards men.

489
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160
Let me wallow in my state of ignorance.

490
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,380
Let me wallow in my way of anxiety.

491
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:33,460
Let me wallow in mypable, vindictive, enlightenment back in last week.

492
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,000
Anxiety.

493
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,520
Anxiety.

494
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:34,980
I need help.

495
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,580
Help.

496
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:36,580


497
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:36,960
You know.

498
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,580
We do hair. We do hair. It goes both ways.

499
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,000
But it's all paid for with public money.

500
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,680
So there, so there, so there.

501
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,200
It's been fun. It's been fun.

502
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,440
It's hep, hep, hep. Fun, fun. It's hep, hep, hep.

503
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,420
All of that and more really covers most of the S.

504
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,980
Burnout. Burnout. Burnout.

505
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,060
The letter A. The letter A.

506
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,400
Prince will do us. Prince will do us. Do us. Do us.

507
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,580
Let me wallow in ignorance.

508
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,840
She's sold over 25 books.

509
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,160
She's one of the most successful tattooed mother with mental health problems

510
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,740
this country has ever produced.

511
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,120
Tough. Adult. Unicorns. Thumped. Very stiff. Really too big. Why?

512
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,900
It works for me. Totally. Different head. It's very wreck. Wreck.

513
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,860
Can't. Can't. Can't. Spectacular.

514
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,480
But meanwhile, I feel cheap.

515
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,120
Do you plan? Maybe.

516
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:34,740
Goodbye.

517
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,860
San Francisco.

518
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,740
San Francisco.

519
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:48,740


520
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,020
Sam Morrow shares his experience with you.

521
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,480
Get the feeling.

522
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,380
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

523
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,920
Look out!

524
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,460
What did you do?

525
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,680
No. Yes.

526
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,000
San Francisco.

527
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,420
It makes good sense when you smoke.

528
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,860
It makes good sense when you smoke.

529
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,800
When you smoke.

530
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,260
San Francisco. San Francisco. Ho-ho. Very.

531
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,920
The rest is rat version. Rat version. Rat version.

532
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,280
Hyah!

533
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,860
I don't like it.

534
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,860
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

535
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,740
No extra work.

536
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
You're in check.

537
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,560
What are you trying to pull, mister?

538
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
You don't think I'm telling the truth?

539
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,880
Don't be too long.

540
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,600
It gives me pleasure to...

541
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,660
San Francisco. I...

542
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,200
Ho-ho. Big story in papers.

543
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,820
Toy. Big trouble.

544
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,300
Hey, boy.

545
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,020
I've been very concerned with you these past days, Victor.

546
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,860
What kind of dealings do you have with the director of the morgue?

547
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,760
Are you interested in corpses?

548
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,360
Hm.

549
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,420
Godfleet.

550
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:55,080
I shall really have to tell you the story of the inquisitive commandant.

551
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,640
The one at Belsam, remember?

552
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,700
They might believe that you want that atomic element to supply electric power.

553
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,480
But I...

554
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,640
What are you trying to say?

555
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,760
I don't know.

556
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,920
I don't know?

557
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,420
I have no idea.

558
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,080
I don't know.

559
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,640
Could I repeat what I just said?

560
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,040
I don't know.

561
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,400
I don't know.

562
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,400


563
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,400


564
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,400


565
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,400


566
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,400


567
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,400


568
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,400


569
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,400


570
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,220
Unless, of course, you could repeat it for me.

571
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,220
No, no, no, Pee-pee-hay.

572
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,380
Ah, do svitanya.

573
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,560
Shtovany.

574
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,500
I don't know.

575
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,600
It's a...

576
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,060
It's a Russian hotel.

577
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,460
It's a big hotel.

578
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,660
I don't know.

579
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,560
I would like to smell my shoe.

580
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,780
Repeat.

581
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,440
I don't know.

582
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,720
I don't know.

583
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,240


584
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Ah, if I'm correct, it's groundhog day.

585
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:51,500
I don't know.

586
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:51,500


587
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:51,500


588
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:57,180
Ah, I would like to smell the shoe, that's why I've got a little bit of time.

589
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,200
I don't know, ah, if I'm right, that's why...

590
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,200


591
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,200


592
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,200


593
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,200


594
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,200


595
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,200


596
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,200


597
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,200


598
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,200


599
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,200


600
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,200


601
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,200


602
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,200


603
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,060
Repeat in English.

604
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,080
I would like to smell your shoe.

605
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,900
I am the shoe smeller.

606
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,520
That's the language of God.

607
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,460
The pure language of the angels.

608
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,760
Unaffected by three rows of teeth,

609
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,780
the animals who speak the language of God

610
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,860
are known for miles and miles in the Amazon basin

611
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,180
for releasing loud, unctuous quantities

612
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,500
of good old Mother Nature's food.

613
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,380
And as long as they worship

614
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,480
at the foot of the statue of the piped head,

615
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,080
they are all as well in the kingdom of sweat and vigor.

616
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,040
My shoes smell funny to you.

617
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,500
Repeat in Hintekorash.

618
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,440
The shoe is angry with me.

619
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,780
Oh, God.

620
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,600
Repeat.

621
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,980
Bob is the shoe.

622
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,200
Mekipalobobo Bob.

623
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,620
The shoe.

624
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,580
Mekipalobobo Connie.

625
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,660
Connie.

626
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:05,880
Connie Mekipalobo.

627
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,600
Mekipalobo Mekipalobo.

628
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,360
Connie is the high heeled pihatcha.

629
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,640
Repeat in Urdu.

630
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,920
Mekipalobo Mekipalobo.

631
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,480
Connie.

632
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,720
Now in Panglossian.

633
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,740
Uh-oh.

634
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,420
Uh-oh.

635
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,720
Time to turn the background music up.

636
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,540
I don't know what to say.

637
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,700
Oh, look, Dave, you have to go let somebody in.

638
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,520
You have to go open the door.

639
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,340
Friends, it's just you and me

640
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,640
listening while Dave runs to,

641
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,800
hopefully, let in,

642
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,520
Princess Wiardo

643
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,580
after having run her

644
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,500
synesthesian errand

645
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,960
in preparation for the

646
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,740
upcoming programs on this

647
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,260
fine radio station,

648
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,620
which you have tuned into

649
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,580
just today.

650
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,480
The barbarian woman has returned.

651
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:51,880
Ah.

652
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,980
Well, okay, then I guess

653
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,840
we can move on.

654
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
Barvarian, you meant?

655
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,700
Did you mean barbarian?

656
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,680
I meant Bavarian.

657
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,520
Barvarian, he has said.

658
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,820
No, I'm speaking of...

659
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,220
Shazzi.

660
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,120
My little pearl.

661
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,860
I know that you are wearing

662
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,420
lederhosen on your ears.

663
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,780
You're not supposed to notice

664
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,860
or speak of the lederhosen.

665
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,560
Lederhosen are the personal part

666
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,040
of women's attire.

667
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,460
And they're meant to be smelled by

668
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,620
men with big, big hair.

669
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,960
And big noses.

670
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,760
And you know what a big nose means.

671
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,520
Yes.

672
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,640
Big nose hair clippers.

673
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,640
Reference tank does not want any other

674
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,480
man to smell the lederhosen.

675
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,360
Would you like to languish

676
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,020
in the aquarium with me

677
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,120
for a short duration?

678
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,060
Does that line ever work?

679
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,480
Sometimes.

680
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,540
Yeah.

681
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,720
In Parfait, it is said,

682
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,080
nashcap in handy,

683
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,400
ratatal.

684
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,380
I knew a guy who would go into a bar

685
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,400
and walk up to every single woman

686
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,280
and say that to her,

687
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,140
and he would get slapped

688
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,100
30 times, but...

689
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,560
Sooner or later, he'd find one who'd go,

690
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,640
yeah, baby, your place or mine.

691
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,700
Your friend went for the slaps only.

692
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,580
That's possible.

693
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,460
Highly likely in this case.

694
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:16,900
I don't know.

695
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,920
It was the only way he could score.

696
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,460
Wasn't he the one you called

697
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,240
the two-tongued rabbit of Bob?

698
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,900
No, you're thinking of someone else.

699
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,980
That was the other guy.

700
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,740
He was working the percentages, man.

701
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,800
Now, let's...

702
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,180
We got this piece, this old record.

703
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,640
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

704
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,400
Actually, she didn't send the record.

705
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,140
She sent an MP3 that she had copied

706
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,880
from this record.

707
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,040
Our friend, Reverend Samantha,

708
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:47,880
who all the regular devotional goers

709
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,480
would know Reverend Samantha.

710
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,940
She used to be the only girl

711
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,980
at the Devo shows,

712
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,620
and that's changed,

713
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,340
but she was the first.

714
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,420
Anyway, she sent this song

715
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,380
and a letter.

716
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,980
I'm going to read the letter.

717
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,380
Reverend Samantha said,

718
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,360
this little musical gem,

719
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,160
which I found lying in a pile

720
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,900
of old dusty 78s in the attic.

721
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,920
Kids, that means old CDs

722
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,860
only before CDs were invented.

723
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,320
They were big wax discs.

724
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,180
It appears to be a Depression-era

725
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,440
Church of the Subgenius

726
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,200
hillbilly gospel song.

727
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,960
Can it be?

728
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,860
There's no reason why it couldn't be,

729
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,820
although it's rare to find something

730
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,140
from that part of the country.

731
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,820
Anyway, she says,

732
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,800
I could just barely make out

733
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,460
the words on the record label.

734
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,940
It seemed to say something like,

735
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,400
look away from the pinks

736
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,480
to the billowing pipe.

737
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,520
That's the title of the song

738
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,320
by the Mutant Mountain Boys.

739
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,800
Interesting how they got away

740
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,380
with such politically incorrect names

741
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,220
back then.

742
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,460
I think it's interesting

743
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,120
how pristine it almost is.

744
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,100
I mean, when you look at it,

745
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,500
it looked like it was just cut yesterday,

746
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,640
and yet it is one of those

747
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,720
like old OK Bluebird type of,

748
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,960
you know, renderings there

749
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,640
on a 78 RPM.

750
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,040
Well, we're going to play this.

751
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,720
She figured out the words to it,

752
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,240
I think, because they're really hard

753
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,540
to hear on this old record.

754
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,000
And kindly printed them for us

755
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,880
to be able to look at these.

756
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,200
Yes.

757
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,000
Who's kindly?

758
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,140
Let's see.

759
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,640
Is that another person involved?

760
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,480
No, that's me.

761
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,180
I'm kindly.

762
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,280
Kindly, all right.

763
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,320
She said, you know,

764
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,520
this just might be

765
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,860
the only existing copy in the world,

766
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,620
so here's...

767
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,800
Here I am now

768
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,640
spreading it like a virus.

769
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,660
I'm going to play it now,

770
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,660
and the singers will sing along.

771
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,060
Look away from the paints

772
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,220
to the bellowing pie

773
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,600
From your life of work and toil

774
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,560
Look away

775
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,240
There's a hole in your soul

776
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,580
That's burning you alive

777
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,820
Where slackdom will never decay

778
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,260
Look away

779
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,920
Send your chariot

780
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,820
Look away

781
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,000
For eternal sleep

782
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,560
From the paints to the bellowing pie

783
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,740
Bellowing pie

784
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,000
Look away

785
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,120
Look away

786
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,460
For the morning past

787
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,960
From the paints to the bellowing pie

788
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,080
Bellowing pie

789
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,720
I saw a vision above

790
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,460
and I can walk again

791
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,360
Of course, there's nothing really wrong

792
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,140
with my legs

793
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,060
and a good old ten-ton crusher wouldn't cure them.

794
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,420
I need my body to be ripped off

795
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,020
but still it's a funny life.

796
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,420
You have responsibilities

797
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,680
getting out of you to bear

798
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,880
and you're blind

799
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,020
walk the life so severe

800
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,680
There's a hypnotic man

801
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,980
who is beckoning from

802
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,480
with his disembodied head

803
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,660
always there

804
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,740
Look away

805
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,220
Send your chariot

806
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,320
Look away

807
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,440
For eternal sleep

808
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,900
From the paints to the bellowing pie

809
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,140
Bellowing pie

810
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,360
Look away

811
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,420
Send your chariot

812
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,560
Look away

813
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,880
For eternal sleep

814
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,440
From the paints to the bellowing pie

815
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,560
Lyrics, music, and music by Tyler.

816
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,200
I can almost see again

817
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,640
I can almost walk again

818
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,520
I can almost see again

819
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,260
I can almost hear again

820
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:42,580
If your conflicts with normals bring struggles and strife,

821
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,620
live onward, your rantings ensue.

822
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:51,440
Look away from the pinks to the billowing pipe

823
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,120
that's waiting in dives down for you.

824
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:04,260
Look away from the pinks to the billowing pipe.

825
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:14,860
Look away from the pinks to the billowing pipe.

826
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,340
It's a beautiful, beautiful...

827
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,980
Thank you, Reverend Samantha, for finding that.

828
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,900
And all the voracious loving, I must say, I've never met you,

829
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,000
but it seems to me if your knees were as knobby as your head,

830
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,060
I'd be in love once again.

831
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,720
Her knees are as knobby as her head, if I remember correctly.

832
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,680
They are not. Her knees are perfectly sleek and beautiful.

833
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,060
Well, how about all these polygamists lately?

834
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,940
Back in Stane County, Texas, they've been running the polygamists.

835
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,440
They're hydrocephalic down there, and there's more than one of them,

836
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,240
I'm guessing. They're all married to each other.

837
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,960
And the smallest one is only five years old.

838
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,300
That's right.

839
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,700
And Grandpappy is pushing 109, but believe me,

840
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,880
he can still be an indirect old thumb on it.

841
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,260
You're not kidding.

842
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,100
I'm not. I'm trying not to be anyway.

843
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,900
Texas is a great place for cults.

844
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,060
You know, even the Mormons had to move down to Texas

845
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,640
to do their really cultish stuff.

846
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,480
Had to move out of Ohio and New York.

847
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,100
Well, now, I've heard...

848
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,920
I've heard there's been food riots in the news all over the world

849
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,780
because there's been an 83% price rise over the last three years

850
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,820
in foodstuffs in general for the entire planet.

851
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,860
Yeah, I thought it was 40, and I guess it was 40 in one year.

852
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,760
I thought it was 40% over three years.

853
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,380
That's right.

854
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,060
And that even includes us Merkins paying more.

855
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,640
And pretty soon, everybody's going to be dead.

856
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,560
You mean you've been eating your Merkins?

857
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,400
You're so hungry, you're eating a Merkin?

858
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,100


859
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,780
We've been driven to that.

860
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,500
There were times when we were so wroth.

861
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,700
I remember Mom and Dad were so...

862
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,780
They not only took in laundry and other children's ducks and stuff like that,

863
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,940
they also played with others' behavior models

864
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,100
just to survive, to get by the next day.

865
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,900
They ate chest Merkins, man.

866
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,180
Chest Merkin.

867
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,580
We had it on Thursday night with lasagna, man.

868
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,400
Chest Merkin, you know?

869
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,860
Well, they're literally friends.

870
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,000
There have been food riots all over the world lately.

871
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,080
Haiti, the Philippines, Egypt, Columbus, Dayton.

872
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,040
La Vie.

873
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,420
And you know every place is Dayton Place.

874
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,280
Yeah.

875
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,480
I say that because nobody would understand Payton Place.

876
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,840
The only old people know where Payton Place is.

877
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:44,220
Well, Dayton Place is where the three original alien sky choppers were regulated.

878
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,640
It was where they first crashed.

879
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,660
Yeah, they took them from Roswell, too.

880
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:54,720
And they used Roswell as a cover-up for the Dayton Place UFO crashes, saucer crashes.

881
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,480
Yeah, there was...

882
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,860
At Wright-Patterson, remember?

883
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,240
Right, yes.

884
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,460
You said you inspected the bodies, and they argued with you about it.

885
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,640
I mean, the bodies were...

886
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,460
Yes, it was all quite foul and disgusting.

887
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,040
It's weird when a corpse becomes animated right while you're arguing with it.

888
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,560
And yet charming somehow at the same time.

889
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,660
Well, you know, dead people do have a certain charm about them.

890
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,520
They're kind of distant.

891
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,200
There's been a debate lately about who do you like best,

892
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,180
the running, fast-moving zombies,

893
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,080
or the shot-and-run zombies.

894
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,080


895
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,080


896
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,160
Shuffling, lurching, stumbling zombies.

897
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,980
I like...

898
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,560
I'm not a big fan of the stiff zombies,

899
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,460
but I think it would just be too scary to have, you know,

900
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,540
a long-legged, like, gazelle-type zombie just chasing you down.

901
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,020
And there's the hooker zombies.

902
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,900
That lure you in.

903
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,560
And the sails zombies.

904
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,980
Man, the speed zombies are the scary ones to me, man.

905
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,800
The speed zombies?

906
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,220
Speed zombies are the scariest of all.

907
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:48,860
Meth zombies.

908
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,440
Yeah.

909
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,920
Cochasa zombies were a big deal in Brazil when I was down there.

910
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:53,960
Yeah, I can see that.

911
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:54,900
Cochasa zombies.

912
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,280
The local drink is this cochasa stuff.

913
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,580
Cochasa?

914
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,320
Is it like, to you, it's a sped-up beer that a native lady spit it up?

915
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,860
No, no, that's a different beer.

916
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,760
It's made from spit.

917
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,340
Different beer, they call it.

918
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,020
Cochasa is sort of like tequila, but it's...

919
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,600
Yeah, it's their local...

920
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,040
Liquid fluid thing that makes your brain...

921
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,140
Yeah, it's made from potash or something.

922
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:15,860
I forget what.

923
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,420
Wow.

924
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,400
That is really, really hard to believe.

925
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,140
But there are zombies.

926
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,160
I can believe that part.

927
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,540
You know...

928
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,200
Cochasa zombies.

929
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,560
Those who have thoroughly...

930
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,120
I don't think I'm pronouncing that right.

931
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,500
...deadened their brains with cochasa.

932
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,800
I had one too many myself.

933
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,040
One too many zombies?

934
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,380
I came close to being...

935
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,540
I have had a zombie, yeah.

936
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,860
What the hell is that?

937
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,380
When I was younger, when I was a young man.

938
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,160
Oh, you carnal, you little...

939
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,300
You have to cut their hands off because otherwise they'll scratch you,

940
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,840
claw your eyes out and stuff.

941
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,400
Yeah, they have no idea of their strengths.

942
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,620
And, of course, they have to be muzzled.

943
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,540
They're just on temporal motor slabbling.

944
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,220
Yeah.

945
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:54,780
You have to muzzle.

946
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,620
Yeah, because they want to eat your brain while you're nibbling at their ear.

947
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:57,960
They're going to...

948
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,780
And you...

949
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:58,900
Yeah.

950
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,140
You know, the smell is not great.

951
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,400
And you don't want to do any, like, weird numbers.

952
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,660
And the bits fall off.

953
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,160
Oh, yeah.

954
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,120
The bits falling off is not cool.

955
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,620
Yeah, call me when you guys are done with this conversation.

956
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,820
But can you imagine doing one of those, like, old sexual numbers?

957
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,760
You know, you give them numbers and stuff like that.

958
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,600
Number 72.

959
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,520
Number 72.

960
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,560
Can you imagine doing 72 with a zombie?

961
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,400
What do you mean, imagine?

962
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,120
Yeah, I can.

963
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,440
That's what I was getting at.

964
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:22,740
Yeah.

965
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,980
I'm from Texas, man.

966
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,280
Man, that's not that big of a deal down there.

967
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,080
So, Ed Geins...

968
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,360
I've noticed people are kind of...

969
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,060
Here's some Texas, too, right?

970
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,420
Kind of weak stomach up here.

971
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,360
They're kind of hickey.

972
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:39,260
They are a body, visceral race of murderers and biters and biters.

973
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,660
That's us.

974
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,820
Ed Geins, Geins.

975
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,820
Praise Bob.

976
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,540
Praise Bob.

977
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,100
Praise Bob.

978
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,040
He led us in the way of the Texas businessman.

979
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,160
I thought you were going to say he led you into the desert instead of out.

980
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,540
And the zombie bordellos.

981
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,400
The zombie bordellos, man.

982
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,300
Way out there and out near Alpine where those lights are, you know.

983
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:05,500
Have you ever heard of the Alpine lights, the dependable UFOs?

984
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,500
Have you ever heard of those, Dave?

985
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,840
The Alpine lights?

986
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,320
I'm sorry.

987
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,320
I was being your background music.

988
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:11,920
Of course.

989
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,360
An Alpine lodge for vampires?

990
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,200
No, no.

991
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,160
For UFOs.

992
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:20,500
There's a town in the deserts of Texas, way out in the boonies in the southern western

993
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,020
Like a truck stop for UFOs?

994
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,860
It's kind of like one of those...

995
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,200
Kind of, yeah.

996
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:23,960
...that sprang up around the desert.

997
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:23,960


998
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:23,960


999
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:23,960


1000
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:23,960


1001
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:23,960


1002
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,080
Yeah.

1003
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:24,740
A truck stop, yeah.

1004
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:30,040
Now, it so happens that if you put a video camera on the mysterious lights and another

1005
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:36,760
video camera at a highway about 10 miles away across the desert, the car lights seem to

1006
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,200
dictate how the UFO lights move.

1007
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,240
And there's kind of...

1008
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,040
Some people say that it's merely a mirage situation that's always in place so that what

1009
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:53,280
appears to be mysterious lights flying around in the desert are really just headlights from

1010
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,660
several miles away on the desert, bounced by atmospheric freak.

1011
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:01,940
But that's as supernatural as the damn UFOs to begin with.

1012
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,200
Yeah, right.

1013
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,780
So it's like, whatcha gonna do?

1014
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,220
Yeah.

1015
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,540
What are you gonna do?

1016
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,860
There's no fractal fissuring to create an illusion of a thermoscopy.

1017
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,240
There's no way that you can get around the...

1018
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,840
Like it's flaming fire and you still can't see it.

1019
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,160
I'm sorry, I'm frothing at the neck.

1020
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,980
It's getting messy.

1021
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,260
And it's not just a bird.

1022
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:23,260


1023
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:23,260


1024
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:23,260


1025
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:28,920
You know, they all remember, it wasn't the first time the little lady from Brazil had

1026
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,840
her story to tell.

1027
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:30,320
Ah!

1028
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,180
I'm sorry!

1029
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,120


1030
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,660
I'm sorry!

1031
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:36,200
I'm sorry!

1032
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:36,440
I'm sorry!

1033
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:36,740
I'm sorry!

1034
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,800
Things were bad everywhere.

1035
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,840
We took her back to Sao Paulo where she hoped to meet her father, Rex Rumroy.

1036
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,580
He was a rum runner all right.

1037
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:49,800
He brought the last big bottle of booze up from Franquas and landed in Boston last week.

1038
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,260
Yeah.

1039
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,780
But don't ask me about it.

1040
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,200
Ask this little lady.

1041
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:53,660
This little lady right here.

1042
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,120
The one with the exposed skull.

1043
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,800
I think you're still sick.

1044
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,780
I cannot speak.

1045
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,860
My voice...

1046
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:05,200
vocal cords have been removed by lonesome cowboy Dave.

1047
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,020
I cannot speak no more.

1048
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,020
You're still sick.

1049
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,400
That's it.

1050
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,740
Good girl.

1051
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,040
That's it.

1052
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,340
Good girl.

1053
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,800
Did it hurt?

1054
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,980
I'm being paid.

1055
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:17,740
I'm getting paid.

1056
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,180
Find yourself again.

1057
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,000
I'm not lost.

1058
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,100
You're working yourself up into a full-sized nervous breakdown.

1059
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:23,180
I'm not lost.

1060
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:23,180


1061
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:23,180


1062
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:23,180


1063
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,320
I'm not lost.

1064
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:23,320


1065
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,700
Serene, clear-eyed.

1066
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,200
Let me take your photograph, will you?

1067
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,180
Let me take your photograph, will you?

1068
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,880
You're still sick.

1069
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,220
Okay, I'm sick.

1070
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,060
The symbolism.

1071
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:38,860
No.

1072
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,340
No.

1073
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,740
Look, this whole thing is nothing but a hallucination.

1074
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,000
Let me come with you.

1075
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:46,220
No.

1076
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,980
That's the end of the shaft.

1077
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,040
No, I'd better phone the scientists.

1078
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,560
I'll be in charge.

1079
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,180
Petrified historic man?

1080
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,180


1081
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,180


1082
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,180


1083
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,180


1084
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,180


1085
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,180


1086
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,180


1087
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,180


1088
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,180


1089
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,180


1090
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,180


1091
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,180


1092
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,740
But everybody will see her in her nakedness.

1093
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:56,620
Nakedness?

1094
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,400
What is time but a conception of man?

1095
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,040
She's not an object of vivisection.

1096
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,660
I will be in charge.

1097
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,560
Well, we were all somewhat excited, I would say, and we still are.

1098
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,780
How would you like to rap, rap, rap, rap, rap?

1099
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,100
Oh.

1100
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,420
Six, maybe seven.

1101
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,780
This is quite common, John.

1102
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,420
You have a fear of the future.

1103
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,860
Is that why I scream?

1104
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,060
You want it, yet you fear it.

1105
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,280
Five.

1106
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,400
Might be a winner.

1107
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,540
I want him now.

1108
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:22,760
Now?

1109
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,640
Do you understand?

1110
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:24,460
Get him!

1111
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,840
Enlightenment comes more easily in the dark.

1112
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,880
Oh, yes.

1113
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,060
It smells funny.

1114
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,420
Then drink your tea.

1115
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,240
What are you doing?

1116
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:32,660
Nothing.

1117
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,280
Look.

1118
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,000
Why all the games?

1119
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,420
Can't you just get on with it?

1120
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,260
What do you want us to do?

1121
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,880
We want you to praise Bob.

1122
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,380
My friends, that's all we ask.

1123
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,480
Well, it's actually not.

1124
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,240
That's far from all we ask.

1125
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:50,220
But that's the first thing we ask is that you praise Bob.

1126
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,520
What are you two mumbling?

1127
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,480
You're just blottering about over there.

1128
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,780
How are you cutting out the tablets?

1129
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,740
We're just having a little discussion about folks with brain injuries

1130
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,500
returning to the job as full-grown zombies.

1131
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,960
You know, and at where we work,

1132
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,820
zombies come back every day and have to be rehabilitated.

1133
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,900
And it costs the boss lots of money.

1134
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,420
Indeed.

1135
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,280
And that's why we think Dobbs is our answer.

1136
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,480
Because Dobbs is not only going to get rid of those pesky monkeys,

1137
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,820
but he's also going to kill the administration of the company as well.

1138
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,100
In fact, no one's going to be left alive,

1139
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:22,560
but me.

1140
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,640
Maybe that's not Bob.

1141
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,340
Maybe that's just my own.

1142
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,520
You know what I'm saying?

1143
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:33,960
How often do we ascribe to Bob feelings that are really just our own?

1144
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,540
You know how it is.

1145
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:41,540
You go, well, I feel like having a hamburger or ice cream cones.

1146
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,360
I'm sure Bob would feel the same way.

1147
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,960
He'd feel like it was okay for me to have that ice cream cone.

1148
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,520
I'm sure he would.

1149
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,460
And you know he was.

1150
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,320
Yes, he would.

1151
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,480
He's like the Lord baby Jesus.

1152
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,540
At least that way.

1153
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,040
Too much is always better than not enough, Bob said.

1154
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,020
He was lying, but it sounds great.

1155
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,240
And that's all that matters in your proper religion, modern religion.

1156
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,780
Yes, you left off the antecedent found years later.

1157
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,160
That's the only thing that's important is the antecedent.

1158
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:10,660
Is that what...

1159
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,860
Maybe that's what we ran over on the way here.

1160
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,420
Bob's antecedent?

1161
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:14,680
Yes.

1162
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,660
Remember that thing we smushed on the way that squealed?

1163
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,700
It was before the pipe, so it might have been actually alive.

1164
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,440
It could have been physically in corpus coelombo.

1165
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,700
Well, I hope...

1166
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,880
Too much is always better than not enough, but it's almost as bad.

1167
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,980
It's much worse.

1168
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,860
Believe you me.

1169
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,020
Look down here.

1170
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,660
Ew, I don't want to look down there.

1171
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,900
Oh, look, there's plenty of skulls being opened.

1172
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,920
And they're putting little Bob implants in each one.

1173
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,560
Look at those biological urges down there.

1174
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,860
Yes, you can see them flashing on the rhythmosphat and the displays.

1175
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,520
And of course, if you jump over here and make a little bunny wrap,

1176
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,200
you'll be electrocuted.

1177
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,400
But jump over, or else you'll be electrocuted.

1178
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,000
No, no, jump over.

1179
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,260
That's not a bunny rabbit.

1180
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,500
That's an ugly baby.

1181
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,820
That's an ugly baby.

1182
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,500
That's all.

1183
00:46:59,040 --> 00:46:59,840
That's all it was.

1184
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,600
Yeah, we wouldn't do that to a rabbit.

1185
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:03,640
Of course not.

1186
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,540
But a red-headed stepchild, anything goes.

1187
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,080
Is subject to immediate electrocution.

1188
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,680
Or is it elocution?

1189
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,760
I am your favorite red-haired stepchild.

1190
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:20,120
And I'd just like to say, in my perfect English,

1191
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:25,880
that Bob has saved my career, whatever the hell that might mean.

1192
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,100
Your electrifying elocution?

1193
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,460
If only we could remember what your career was that he saved.

1194
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,740
And who it was.

1195
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,960
You could finally make some money off of it.

1196
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,840
In fact, we can't find that.

1197
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,220
He'll save your career, but he won't tell you what it is.

1198
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,820
That's Bob for you, man.

1199
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,500
He's a mystery god.

1200
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,320
He's a little bit of a...

1201
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,080
He's a conundrum wrapped in a mystery.

1202
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,460
A little bit of a cocopele child.

1203
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,780
The blanket of...

1204
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,180
Cloudy weirdness around it.

1205
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,780
They say Bob plays in mysterious ways.

1206
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,560
They say Bob sits around in mysterious waters.

1207
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,760
They say Bob plays with himself in strange places.

1208
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,740
They say Bob is a strange place.

1209
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:09,380
He has unusual choices of where he's gonna expose himself.

1210
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,900
And they say Bob smells worse than stewed poons.

1211
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,520
Well, that's because he smokes that pipe.

1212
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,460
Subject or the object.

1213
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,760
And he's got the real farts.

1214
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:19,960
He doesn't have a frap.

1215
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,140
He doesn't have some street marijuana or wog hemp.

1216
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,820
He's doing the real thing.

1217
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,120
Have a frap, zip your locks.

1218
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:31,520
Marifazalupina.

1219
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,420
That's where that smile comes from?

1220
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:33,840
For short.

1221
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,860
Can I ask you a question?

1222
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,080
That's what Bob's smoking.

1223
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,100
And that's what you smell when Bob laughs by.

1224
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,780
Where did it come from?

1225
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,680
I mean, the frap and the zip your locks.

1226
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,740
Can I ask you that one question?

1227
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,360
Oh, it comes from Tibet.

1228
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:48,420
What?

1229
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:56,200
If it grows in Tibet on the graves and droppings of dead Tibetan holy men or yetis, full blood yetis.

1230
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,400
Under the light of a full moon.

1231
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:07,580
If it would grow on the droppings of a half-breed yeti, then we'd be up to our necks in real frap.

1232
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,280
Up to our ears.

1233
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,480
But we ain't.

1234
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,920
We're not up to even our toenails in real frap.

1235
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,100
It's hard to get, friends.

1236
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,820
Maybe that's for the best.

1237
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,300
I don't know.

1238
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,800
The Chinese post-war...

1239
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,560
They're not going to have frap and zip your locks?

1240
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,120
Isn't that what they want, Tibet?

1241
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,540
Is that what you're saying?

1242
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:24,340
Derek!

1243
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,220
Yo ho!

1244
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,240
Is this what...

1245
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:27,620
I think...

1246
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:28,980
I feel like I'm on something.

1247
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,520
This is one of those shows that's messing with my head.

1248
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,640
It may be this rural war room background that's...

1249
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,420
I...

1250
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,460
I can see the Fuhrer in my mind.

1251
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,140
He's standing up there by the great map.

1252
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,120
That's Groucho Marx, isn't it?

1253
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,820
Oh, that's Captain Spalding!

1254
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,340
That's not Hitler.

1255
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,460
No, that's not Captain Spalding.

1256
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,320
That's the Rufus T. Firefly.

1257
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,340
That was Charlie Chaplin.

1258
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,200
Oh, that was, uh, Germaine Greer.

1259
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,460
Whatever is Germaine to me.

1260
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,060
Countess St. Germaine!

1261
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,980
It was the scientific segue.

1262
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,820
It was the easy way.

1263
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,280
Ouch!

1264
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,080
Ouch!

1265
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:03,880
Ouch!

1266
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:08,140
I thought it was the occultist segue that pinched its own.

1267
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,820
Well, some of us are made of real DNA,

1268
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,840
and others are made of constructed materials,

1269
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:15,960
if you know what I mean.

1270
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:16,320
Heavens!

1271
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:16,840
Oh, of course!

1272
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,820
We're not all cranked out to be over here

1273
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,700
trying to help you with your show,

1274
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,860
and you don't seem to pay much attention to us.

1275
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,820
And what show is this?

1276
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,920
Why, friends, this is hour of slack number 1149.

1277
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,640
Where days seem like minutes.

1278
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,100
Number nine?

1279
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:39,980
One of the most official voiceboxes of the Church of the Subgenius.

1280
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:40,880
1149?

1281
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,700
Located in the intranets at...

1282
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:44,840
WW...

1283
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,320
.subgenius.

1284
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,840
Subgenius.com.

1285
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,240
Subgenius spelled sub-genius.

1286
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,660
And there is not an O anywhere in there except the .com.

1287
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,000
There's an O in the dot and an O in the com,

1288
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,660
although you don't write out the dot.

1289
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,600
I suppose you could try that.

1290
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,260
Speaking of dots, we pulled out our magnifying glass recently

1291
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,880
and started searching for animalcules again.

1292
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,240
That's one of our hobbies.

1293
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:20,200
We like to look at hideous, crawling, writhing, abhorrent, formless things

1294
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,360
that live in everybody's backyard.

1295
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,440
Every square inch of dirt has hideous monsters.

1296
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,700
Right under your toes.

1297
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,460
The air you breathe.

1298
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,560
And under your nose.

1299
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:33,200
In between your eyelashes, there are horrible, ugly worms

1300
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:38,020
chewing their way through your ducts, your tear ducts.

1301
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,280
They live in there.

1302
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,920
There's these spiral gyro looking things

1303
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,220
with all kinds of horny things.

1304
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:43,940
Sticking out of them.

1305
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,060
They live in your lungs.

1306
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:46,080
Can you imagine?

1307
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,460
We scraped the newt cage last night.

1308
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,320
Princess Wee and I did.

1309
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,300
We went up to the...

1310
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,960
We have only one slave pet that we keep.

1311
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,000
A newt.

1312
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,000
They're very low maintenance.

1313
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,560
Fig is its name.

1314
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,920
He's about as big as your little finger.

1315
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,740
Yeah, he's not very big, but he's very, very old.

1316
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,340
Princess Wee acquired this newt 28 years ago

1317
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:12,020
and for all we know, it was 1,000 years old then.

1318
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:12,700
Anyway...

1319
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,220
I see.

1320
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,080
I think it's a spirit creature by now.

1321
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,140
Yeah, well, no.

1322
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,260
He's still really there.

1323
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:18,960
Yes, he is.

1324
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:19,940
He eats on a daily basis.

1325
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,900
There's not much meat on him.

1326
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,700
I know he's well and all that.

1327
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,700
I mean, I think he's one of the old ones from before.

1328
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,140
Well, we wanted to see if maybe he was living with those

1329
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,100
and what else was in the murky water

1330
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,540
before we cleaned his tank.

1331
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,000
So we scraped some crud off the side of the tank

1332
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,100
and put some of that on our slide

1333
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,240
and took a look at it.

1334
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,240
And guess what, Dave?

1335
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,080
There was a horrible, transparent nematode

1336
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,300
worm writhing frantically

1337
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,780
because its water was drying up almost as you watched.

1338
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,760
He was all speckly and 3DE looking.

1339
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,180
You could see right through him.

1340
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,120
Writhing in pain.

1341
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,600
A tiny wee tubular life

1342
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,780
that you can't see with the nude eye.

1343
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,100
But that little newt was no doubt

1344
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,860
kind of covered with him, I suppose.

1345
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,240
I would imagine so.

1346
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,980
We could scrape him, I suppose.

1347
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,220
And take a look.

1348
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,420
Probably subsists on them partially.

1349
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,700
You think?

1350
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,080
You think he eats them nematodes?

1351
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,140
I would imagine so.

1352
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,960
What if there's a secret parasite

1353
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,640
that's going to get on you now, too?

1354
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,460
And he's going to eat on your head

1355
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,000
and all the different parts of your body.

1356
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,880
That's the wonderful thing about

1357
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,800
looking through your own $30 kid's microscope.

1358
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,020
Because it's just theoretical in your mind

1359
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,440
that there are microorganisms everywhere.

1360
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:40,900
Organisms.

1361
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,120
Organisms.

1362
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,220
Creeping through.

1363
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,460
Through your nostrils

1364
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:47,600
and coming in and out with your air.

1365
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,580
You're breathing tiny insect skeletons.

1366
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,560
Did you ever scrape a breech baby

1367
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,100
for any such hematodes?

1368
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,460
That's next week.

1369
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,160
But we have...

1370
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,380
A project-to-project kind of thing.

1371
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,220
When you actually look at those things,

1372
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,560
you get a concrete knowledge

1373
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,840
of the fact that...

1374
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:07,100
Actually, I think Nenslow figured this out.

1375
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,160
This is what it all boils down to.

1376
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,780
All life, the universe, and everything

1377
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,940
boils down to this.

1378
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,720
Dirt is mostly poo.

1379
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,500
And poo is mostly corpses.

1380
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,600
So, friends, it's the circle of life.

1381
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:28,120
It's not necessarily that poo is our corpses.

1382
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,340
You see, it's mostly poo and corpses.

1383
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,280
This is the detritus of the human condition.

1384
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:32,880
No, poo is corpses.

1385
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,040
It comes out of you while you're living.

1386
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,180
And dirt is mostly poo.

1387
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,400
And it is left behind.

1388
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,720
So, the whole world, really, if you think about it...

1389
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,520
Is defecation.

1390
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,000
There's more of that than there is.

1391
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:43,220
There's more of that than there is.

1392
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,080
There's more crap than there is

1393
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,440
living, breathing non-crap.

1394
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,060
This is like the poopiest conversation I've heard.

1395
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,060
Well, it's natural.

1396
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,160
It's a naturistical thing.

1397
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,140
It's something you don't tend to think about.

1398
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,660
But the biomass of those tiny creatures

1399
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,100
far outweighs

1400
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,860
the biomass of animals that you can see.

1401
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,460
But it's literal hoo-ha.

1402
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,200
I personally like to crawl around on them.

1403
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,520
I mean, just think of these

1404
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,960
thousands and thousands of generations

1405
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,180
living on a mound of decay.

1406
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,100
And that it's making it

1407
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,100
itself. We're self-perpetuating

1408
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,540
and self-engendering.

1409
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,640
Think of it, Sting! We'll live forever

1410
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,820
on our own feces!

1411
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,860
Well, they're living in my hair.

1412
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,100
They're living in my bowels.

1413
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,000
They're living

1414
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,100
between my toes.

1415
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,140
Things. Things, things, things.

1416
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,300
And yours too, friend.

1417
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,000
Listener, I want you, as you go to bed tonight,

1418
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,820
I want you to think about all those little

1419
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,520
monsters that live

1420
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,240
in between the creases

1421
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,000
of your body. If you didn't take them,

1422
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,020
you wouldn't be able to shower in the last

1423
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,080
15 or 20 minutes.

1424
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,180
Oh, well, of course.

1425
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,640
And even then, you wouldn't get most of them.

1426
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,260
I mean, a lot of them would still

1427
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,340
cling on.

1428
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,640
Like, miniature cling-ons.

1429
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,500
The little cities in your ear canal.

1430
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,940
Best little tiny

1431
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,580
universes and malls

1432
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,960
and original theater

1433
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,900
in the crack of your behind.

1434
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,020
Think of it, man.

1435
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,160
You're a city of

1436
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:12,600
little

1437
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,440
little turkeys.

1438
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,580
Little turkeys.

1439
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,100
Did you know I was doing okay until you mentioned

1440
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,340
the crack of the behind crack?

1441
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,520
That one crack.

1442
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,480
I was fine with everything

1443
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,980
until you said that. Now I'm

1444
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,200
disgustipated. I'm sick.

1445
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,340
Sickened.

1446
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,500
Where would you live if you were such a creature?

1447
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,420
I'd live in 1998, friends.

1448
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,580
That's where I'd be forever.

1449
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,980
And that's where we have to go now because the show

1450
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,160
is now coming to an end. We have to make room

1451
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:41,980
for show next.

1452
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,600
And so,

1453
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,680
say goodbye.

1454
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:47,840
Goodbye.

1455
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,700
Oh, dear listeners, it's parting is such

1456
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,040
sweet sorrow.

1457
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,760
And we thank Norrell Preff

1458
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,200
for the collagiastical

1459
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,720
upcomings and also

1460
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,480
John Hell from

1461
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,040
A Season in Hell. Thank you.

1462
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:03,940
Shell dividing.

1463
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,480
Thick intelligence. Thick urges.

1464
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,940
Biological weapons.

1465
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,480
Biological weapons.

1466
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,160
Use logical agents.

1467
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,460
Let me take you inside.

1468
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,620
And share with you

1469
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,520
thick urges.

1470
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:14,920
Urges.

1471
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,540
We have.

1472
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:15,840
We have.

1473
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,420
We have.

1474
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:16,880
We have.

1475
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:17,240
We have.

1476
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,200
Logical weapons factories on wheels

1477
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,180
and on rails.

1478
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:20,980
I.

1479
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:21,280
I.

1480
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:21,740
I.

1481
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,920
I.

1482
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,280
We have vague hints.

1483
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:23,880
Program.

1484
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:24,900
Logical poison.

1485
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:25,560
Poison.

1486
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,480
Logical.

1487
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,180
Logical poison.

1488
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:27,820
Poison.

1489
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,000
Logical poison.

1490
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,280
Logical.

1491
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:30,820
Logical.

1492
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:31,300
Poison.

1493
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,560
Logical.

1494
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,060
Logical.

1495
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:33,520
Program.

1496
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,240
Program.

1497
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:34,740
Program.

1498
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,280
Program.

1499
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:35,800
I.

1500
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,340
Aim later.

1501
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:37,520
In the year 2000.

1502
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,180
Poison.

1503
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,120
Soup.

1504
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:39,680
Soup.

1505
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:39,960
Soup.

1506
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,980
An accident occurred

1507
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,280
in 1998.

1508
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,380
Let me take you inside

1509
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,540
and share with you

1510
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,500
biological urges.

1511
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,080
We did the

1512
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,880
Bodine family reunion

1513
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,760
about what was that

1514
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,540
about 10 years ago?

1515
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:51,140
Yes.

1516
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,420
And it was

1517
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:53,160
we're all dressed

1518
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:53,760
in our

1519
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,020
our fine

1520
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:55,420
fabulous

1521
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,440
thick regalia

1522
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,400
drinking up a storm

1523
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,720
and enjoying our

1524
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:00,840
enjoying our

1525
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,620
yes exactly

1526
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,040
a with a lot

1527
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:03,420
by the way

1528
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,160
there were a whole bunch

1529
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,580
of weddings going on

1530
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,000
right there

1531
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,020
during the barbecue

1532
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:07,420
that day.

1533
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,200
Numerous

1534
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,760
a number of the brides

1535
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,360
were all pregnant

1536
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,360
which was quite interesting

1537
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,100
in their dresses.

1538
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:12,920
And then

1539
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:13,580
the thing is

1540
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,280
right down the street

1541
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,760
like there's a

1542
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,680
there's the

1543
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,060
the house is at the end

1544
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:19,800
sort of a street

1545
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,820
and then it just turns

1546
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:21,180
to the left

1547
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:21,740
and dead ends

1548
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:22,460
at a church

1549
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,740
just maybe about

1550
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:24,480
a hundred yards

1551
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:24,940
not even that

1552
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,760
50 yards away

1553
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,600
and so all of a sudden

1554
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,640
during our fabulous

1555
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,240
family reunion

1556
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,680
a real wedding

1557
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,400
began to take place

1558
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,060
at the church

1559
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,380
so all of the brides

1560
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,640
ran out

1561
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,220
about

1562
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:38,660
we're talking

1563
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:39,240
about maybe

1564
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:39,740
half dozen

1565
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:40,680
pregnant brides

1566
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,920
run out of the party

1567
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,220
and approach the groom

1568
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,820
the real groom

1569
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,080
at the real church

1570
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,760
and start throwing

1571
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,560
themselves on him

1572
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,920
about how he's

1573
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,680
their baby's daddy.

1574
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,320
And you've got

1575
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,440
all the ushers

1576
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,520
the whole wedding party

1577
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,180
their family

1578
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,420
very sort of a

1579
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:59,400
it's a happy joy

1580
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,760
family celebration

1581
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,260
children are getting married

1582
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:02,700
and here come

1583
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,920
six pregnant brides.

1584
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:05,740
Yeah.

1585
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:07,720
All that guy's responsibility.

1586
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,040
Well yeah

1587
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,160
he actually looked like

1588
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:10,640
he recognized

1589
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,560
a few of them too.

1590
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,100
Yeah.

1591
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:13,500
He looks scared.

1592
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,860
That's what you get.

1593
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:16,700
I rise

1594
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:17,740

1618
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,360
