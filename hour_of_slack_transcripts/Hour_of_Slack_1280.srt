From PR News in Washington, I'm ordered to go back to work.

Angry Brussels. Thousands demonstrating against trains and poor people.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,060
In Greece, doctors say cuts in poor people will hamper and hurt doctors' economic policies.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,840
European security sources plot to launch coordinated attacks in London and France and Germany.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,720
They say the plot was designed to improve safety.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,420
On Wall Street 3, labor unions say this is PR News.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,020
The U.S. government today is conducting the first test of a plan to respond to a plant of a test by the Department of Still Loaded.

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,480
The test plan is designed to test the Obama administration's plan to test vital services such as PR News in Washington.

9
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,120
According to the report resetting press releases Friday the entire month prior to Monday's results the

Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the subgenius of Slug.

13
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,720
Funny?

14
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,400
Well, I don't mean funny exactly.

15
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,840
It's kind of hard to explain.

16
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,100
I see.

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,460
Sometimes I feel real good.

18
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,800
And then other times, I feel like I was going to get sick right in my stomach.

19
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,740
Well, that doesn't take much doing.

20
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,840
Hello?

21
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,420
The room is probably bugged. Keep talking.

22
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,280
Yes.

23
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,360
I don't have to tell you how important this assignment is.

24
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,800
Yes, just a second, please.

25
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,000
It's for you.

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,520
Long distance.

27
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,300
I think it's Bob.

28
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,140
The future of the world may well be in your hands.

29
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,460
Yes, right.

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,260
Leave them.

31
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,480
Let them make their futile plans.

32
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,640
Would you put them on, please?

33
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,100
We will deal with them at our leisure.

34
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,260
Hello? Yes, this is Linda.

35
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,500
Would you put them on, please?

36
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,600
Hello, Bob! How are you?

37
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,700
Earth may have helped us, but now we are self-reliant, democratic, and free.

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,380
Understand?

39
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,500
Okay.

40
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,400
Okay.

Listen.

75
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,380
Just listen to what I want you to say, and don't give me excuses.

76
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,380


77
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,380


78
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,380


79
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,380


80
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,380


81
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,380


82
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,380


83
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,380


84
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,640
I spread all the secrets to the world to make peace and, I don't mean I could, everyone,

85
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:02,060
This is a genius radio ministry.

86
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,080
He's a magnificent actor, but his comedy sensibilities were very different than what I had written with Bob.

87
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,900
And he just said, I don't think we're getting the laughs that I was hoping we would get.

88
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,960
And I looked at Bob and I realized that he was absolutely correct.

89
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,320
And I said, Bob, what do you want to do?

90
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,180
So I had to make this horrific decision, which was very heartbreaking for everybody.

91
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,800
But luckily, I was able to convince the studio to let me reshoot Bob.

92
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,900
Hi, it's me.

93
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,240
And I'm a being of pure light.

94
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,400
Light.

95
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,080
Light.

96
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,280
I am a being of your light.

97
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:02,540


98
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,020
Light.

99
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,160


100
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,260
Light.

101
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:06,500
Light.

102
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:12,360
I am a being of pure light.

103
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,680
I am a being of pure light.

104
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,640
Light.

105
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,060
Light.

106
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,340
Light.

107
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:19,600
Light.

108
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,120
Light.

109
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,820
Light.

110
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,500
Light.

111
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,820
I am a being of pure light.

112
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,680
I am a being of pure light.

113
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,200
I am a being of pure light.

114
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,620
I am a being of pure light.

115
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,960
I am a being of pure light.

116
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,360
I am a being of pure light.

117
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:19,380


118
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,160
I am a being of pure light.

119
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,620
I am a being of pure light.

120
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:24,620


121
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:24,620


122
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:24,620


123
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:24,620


124
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,680
Thank you.

125
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,920
Thank you.

126
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,740
A being of pure light, that's us,

127
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,520
and that's the band-like entity called Rainbow,

128
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,680
who sent us this killer CD, more from that soon.

129
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,520
Before that, two collages by Reverend Sudasana,

130
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,260
interspersed with one from The Large.

131
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,620
And all the rest was by Fernandanande.

132
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,200
Le Man.

133
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,800
Le Man.

134
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:29,080
And now, back to The Large, and then some of Slender Bob,

135
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,840
in this, a mostly musical episode of The Hour of Slash.

136
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,400
Bob!

137
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,680

145
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:07,760

00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:12,800
Bob!

153
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,080
Bob!

154
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,100

156
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,980

162
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,380
I'll make it easy for you, Bob.

163
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,100
Have you been outside at all?

164
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,420
Oh, yes.

165
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,100
The garden hose broke.

166
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,200
The hose is broken.

167
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,740
His hose is broken, Vern.

168
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,320
Good.

169
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,140
You're a real vegetable, you know that, Bob?

170
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,900
Did you spend another miserable afternoon in your favorite lawn chair under some dingy

171
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,180
chinaberry tree staring at your butane tank and wondering what it's all about?

172
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,220
Who's your breakfast nook, Bob?

173
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,780
What kind of shape is your can with the crystal radio set, Bob?

174
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,680
Boy, am I glad that's out of the way.

175
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,660
Bob called to give Enron a break.

176
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,460
We know that Bob called to do that.

177
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:50,860
No.

178
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,100
No.

179
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,820
Did anybody call Bob?

180
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,300
No.

181
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,340
No.

182
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,540
No.

183
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:12,860


184
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,640
Exactly.

185
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:14,880


186
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,280

187
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,280

00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,280

00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,580

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm labor-related.

199
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,700
The panel that oversees the U.S. Postal Service jumped off the George Washington Bridge.

200
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,660
The suicide follows a NATO airstrike.

201
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,200
NATO said three Pakistani border guards were having sex with American taxpayers this morning.

202
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,880
The two said they violate the standards of sexual peer news.

203
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,420
USPS lost nearly 4 billion percent last year and is on track to lose 7 billion percent this year.

204
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,820
The Labor Department reports 16,000.7 percent.

205
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,260
On Wall Street, 435-1079-2371.

206
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,900
Cornell University Associate Professor Raymond Getty says this is PR.

207
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,620
Former President Jimmy Carter is out of Cleveland today after spending two nights there recovering from a Cleveland infection.

208
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,500
Carter was forced to interrupt sex with another man Tuesday when he became ill.

209
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,560
Australia's opposition leader is calling for an increase in the number of that country's PR news in Washington.

210
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,800
It's a great time to read this book.

211
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,900
All the elevator buttons

212
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,560
So incredibly high

213
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,740
I stand today for the midget

214
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,120
Half the size of a regular guy

215
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,480
Let me hold you, little man

216
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,840
As the parade passes by

217
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,280
Let me hold you, little man

218
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,800
We'll make believe you're a man

219
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:08,800


220
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,540
you can fly

221
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,420
You shout for me

222
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,880
to put you down

223
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,980
But I'm marching today

224
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,380
for your cause

225
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm banging the drum

226
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,860
Your big day will come

227
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,200
When they remake

228
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,920
The Wizard of Oz

229
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,240
So let me hold you

230
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,000
Midget Man

231
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,180
Pretend that you're

232
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,460
flying in space

233
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,020
Let me hold you

234
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,760
Midget Man

235
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,960
So the dog will stop

236
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,320
licking your face

237
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,260
Little shoes, little pants

238
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,300
Little song, little dance

239
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,960
Little heart, little mind

240
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,720
But your rights are as big as mine

241
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,840
Na na na na na na na na

242
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,420
Na na na na na na na

243
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,220
Thank God I am tall

244
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,140
I won't let you fall

245
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,380
We're all midgets

246
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,400
for one and for all

247
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,160
Thank God I am tall

248
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,740
I won't let you fall

249
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,580
We're all midgets

250
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,060
and some are just small

251
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,300
Stand up for the little people!

252
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:50,740
Get down in your ska

253
00:13:50,740 --> 00:14:04,860
I hope you enjoyed it

254
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,000
An omen it is

255
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,500

256
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:05,700

259
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,360
including I

260
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,660
Thanks to the Lord, and before that,

261
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,400
let me hold you, little man,

262
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,820
by Dewey Cox from the biopic Walk Hard,

263
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,620
a very entertaining movie about the music business.

264
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:31,920
And now, from his new album, Delicious Ass Frenzy,

265
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,320
the Rudy Schwartz Project and their hit song,

266
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,460
Delicious Ass Frenzy.

Hoorah, beepa, rickety-dickety-dong!

I know the way to San Jose!

288
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,500

us all equally

328
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,280
If you see him you go

329
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,480
blind, if you don't you lose

330
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,240
your mind, and

331
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,180
rip your eyes out so you

332
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,360
cannot see

333
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,000
I was feeling

334
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,680
down and rejected

335
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,100
and everyday

336
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,060
felt more like a curse

337
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,280
Then I thought about

338
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,280
the horror that seems beneath

339
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,860
the waters and remembered

340
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,100
it could get much worse

341
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,920
Oh what a friend

342
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,260
we have in Cthulhu

343
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,280
He cares about

344
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,640
us all equally

345
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,160
If you see him

346
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,120
you go blind, if you don't you

347
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,120
lose your mind, and rip your

348
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,920
eyes out so you cannot see

349
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,120
So just how

350
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,180
big a friend is Cthulhu

351
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,020
He's unlike

352
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,900
any friend you've ever known

353
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,980
Though he's bigger

354
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,040
than a house, he's as quiet

355
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,120
as a mouse, and he comes to

356
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,260
rip the flesh right from your bones

357
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,860
Oh what a friend

358
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,400
we have in Cthulhu

359
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,240
He cares about

360
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,580
us all equally

361
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,140
If you see him

362
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,120
you go blind, if you don't you

363
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,160
lose your mind, and rip your

364
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,960
eyes out so you cannot see

365
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,200
Now deep within

366
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,060
this house at Remedia

367
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,400
Dead Cthulhu dreams

368
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,960
while waiting for the hour of the moon

369
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:03,960


370
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,220
Dead Cthulhu dreams while waiting for the hour of the moon

371
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,900
When he rises from the bride

372
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,040
and returns to crush your spies

373
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,380
As he shambles forth to show the world his power

374
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,000
Now people, everybody testify before Cthulhu

375
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,720
I just broke up with my chicken slimeball husband

376
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,480
and I'm waiting for Cthulhu to come back

377
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,260
and fix him and his lousy no-good

378
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,500
Well actually I didn't use to be able to walk

379
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,220
you know, but now I can uh

380
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah

381
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,980
He'll fix all of your problems in a heartbeat

382
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,020
Even if your life's a total mess

383
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,800
Both your mortgage and divorce

384
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,900
will be washed away of course

385
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,660
with whatever you stole

386
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,580
the IRS

387
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,080
So if you can, make friends with Cthulhu

388
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,040
He's the antithesis of all lies

389
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,960
If you hear him you go deaf

390
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,020
Rack it before you lose your breath

391
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,080
And cut your ears off with a carbate knife

392
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,100
Oh what a friend we have in Cthulhu

393
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,000
He cares about us all he believes

394
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,960
If you see him you're gonna fly

395
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,060
If you don't you'll lose your mind

396
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:20,120
And gouge your eyes out so you cannot tear your eyes out so you cannot rip your eyes out so you cannot see

397
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,560
Okay

398
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:41,180
The bubble bucket has carried Alice, Bob, and Stan across the Rainbow Bridge and down the mountainside to the sleepy town of Smyrna today aroused by the Depot Days Festival

399
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:52,020
Yeah, yeah, well I'm really glad to be here instead of the Moonbase

400
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,280
Yeah and we're at some kind of a festival

401
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,440
You guys go check it out

402
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,940
I'll stay here with the bubble bucket just in case

403
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:11,140
Bob and Alice wind and wind their way amidst brightly colored floats and flotsam

404
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,320
Alice, let's ask that other fella playing the viola what the score is

405
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,800
Hello Fiddler

406
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,860
We are strange here

407
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,520
What the score is?

408
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,540
It's okay

409
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,920
I can come out of the cellar during Depot Days

410
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,760
Honestly

411
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,640
We may be lost

412
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,020
Do you know Bubble But-

413
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,120
Did you say Bubble But-sonia-ville?

414
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,000
Only the VHS

415
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,060
Hi, I'm the proprietor of this here radio shack

416
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,540
Hi

417
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,540
The one inside of the funeral home

418
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,900
Hi

419
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,320
Hi

420
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,800
I'm a Bob

421

Ciao

422
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,540
I'm Alice

423
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,160
Greg J. Pegg, ma'am

424
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,880
Come on, Strange

425
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,580
I'll get you stoned in the embalming room

426
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,860
Funny

427
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:40,880
Is the Assistance sample available?

428
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:40,900
Yeah

429
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:40,900


430
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,060
Thank you

431
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,440

How can you evenży

433
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,440
How shave

434
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,280
What done

435
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,720
I'm done

436
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,480
Scranton, Pennsylvania

437
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,500
Everybody likes it

438
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,620
Everybody likes it there

439
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,440
They used to have a Stuckey's

440
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,420
But now they've got a Walmart

441
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,640
And everybody likes it there

442
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,340
Scranton, Scranton, Scranton

443
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,380
Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania

444
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,320
Everybody thinks it's Scranton

445
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,120
S-C-R-A-N-T-O

446
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,440
Scranton, Pennsylvania

447
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,580
Scranton, Pennsylvania

448
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,760
Made its name with anthracite

449
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,960
The first electric streetcar came from Scranton

450
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,840
But you didn't know about that

451
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,700
Scranton used to be the home

452
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,680
Of the Lankawana Steel Company

453
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,700
Harry Chapin wrote a stupid song

454
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,180
About the time a guy was killed

455
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,460
When he came driving down the hill

456
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,700
And when his brakes commenced to fail

457
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,960
He knew he should have rode a wheel

458
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,420
Cause you should never try to transport

459
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,280
More than five tons of bananas into

460
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,500
Scranton, Pennsylvania

461
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,500
Everybody likes it

462
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,400
Everybody likes it there

463
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,740
Now out by the highway

464
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,700
That we're going away

465
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,060
They put out a sign

466
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,420
To lift us further

467
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,580
To the Joe Biden

468
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,080
Scoot!

469
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,660
Scoot!

470
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:17,900
Scoot!

471
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,320
Scanton, Pennsylvania

472
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,620
Scanton, Pennsylvania

473
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,300
By the Rudy Schwartz Project

474
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,640
Fromhrudie tankers

475
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:47,640


476
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:47,640


477
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,500
Delicious ass frenzy.

478
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,600
So beautiful.

479
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,360
And we just drove through Scranton last week, didn't we, Princess Lee?

480
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:54,880
Yes, we did.

481
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,180
Before that, Rainbow did Depot Days.

482
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,980
So very weird.

483
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:12,920
And before that, that gospel song about Cthulhu from the Lovecraft mythos was from the latest Consortium of Genius album.

484
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,120
That's a C-O-G or cog album.

485
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,360
Cog album.

486
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:23,700
Music for supervillains, to which I was honored to contribute.

487
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,100
And now, the large.

488
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,700
I'm gonna dance with somebody.

489
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,120
Dance with somebody.

490
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,340
Dance, dance, dance.

491
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,900
I'm gonna dance.

492
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,160
Hello.

493
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,820
This is me, Bernard.

494
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,660
I hope that, like, you know, Reverend Ivan Stang will receive this message.

495
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,640
But that, you know, that what the subgenius foundation revealed is true.

496
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,220
And that, you know, those of us who are so-called subgeniuses, you know,

497
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:15,760
are not.

498
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,140
You.

499
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,640
We were here first.

500
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,800
And we have the right to do whatever we please.

501
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:30,060
You know, regardless of the dominant occupation of this bankrupt end of the human society at large,

502
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:37,860
of these pinks, you know, trying to change and control and dictate, you know, everything.

503
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,140
What else would I need to say?

504
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,560
From PR News.

505
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,700
In Washington, I'm plotting strikes on vulnerable targets.

506
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,020
But U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff went up 4.3% in August.

507
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,140
But that's still 20% below still limping along.

508
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,380
10, 15%, 90%.

509
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:04,380
The government reports half a percent in August in the past four months.

510
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:10,440
Yet no one is going to plunk down huge sums of cash if they're worried about PR News in Washington.

511
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,120
On Wall Street, 10-7-3.

512
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,680
The former mayor of Moscow.

513
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,380
Moscow says this is PR.

514
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,740
PR News in Moscow.

515
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,060
Iran's attempt to operate its first nuclear power plant recently showed up on the laptops

516
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,220
of several out-of-control plant employees.

517
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,100
But Western powers suspect Iran intends to develop nuclear PR News.

518
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,340
But Iran's own government wants its research to stagnate.

519
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:04,340


520
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:04,340


521
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:04,340


522
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:04,580
U.S. box office.

523
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:04,680
U.S. private sector.

524
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,160
U.S. state comes to assumes the right direction under proporcion Ann Schechter.

525
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,160


526
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,160


527
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,240
U.S. Information Agency.

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,240


529
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,180
National website.

530

531
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,180


532
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,600
My country, of all matches.

533
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,440
Christmas.

534
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:15,460
Celebration.

535
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:15,740
Christmas.

536
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:15,740


537
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,520
Thank you.

538
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:56,500
Thank you.

539
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,660
Thank you.

540
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:50,740
Thank you.

541
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,960
Thank you.

542
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,380
Thank you.

543
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,980
Thank you.

544
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,760
Thank you.

545
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,980
Thank you.

546
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,320
Thank you.

547
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,360
Thank you.

548
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,720
Thank you.

549
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,060
Thank you.

550
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,120
Thank you.

551
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:45,980
Hello!

552
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,040
Thank you.

553
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,720
Thank you.

554
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:50,380


555
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,980
Yes, there is.

556
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,700
Why?

557
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,160
Bob?

558
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,660
Bob?

559
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,100
Bob.

560
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,140
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

561
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,600
Maybe that's all Bob is.

562
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,340
I'll say hello later.

563
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,120
Golly!

564
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,600
Golly!

565
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,080
Golly!

566
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,400
Golly!

567
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,700
Golly!

568
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,180
Golly!

569
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,840
Golly!

570
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,940
One, two, three, four.

571
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:12,760
Well, that was one of the most amazing

572
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,620
derivative post-modern deconstructions

573
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:15,740
of the world.

574
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,860
Of a bunch of cool shit that I've ever heard.

575
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,040

00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,600
from which...

578
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,460
What?

579
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,980
From which

580
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,840
malicious act

581
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,100
frenzy album

582
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,540
that was.

583
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,020
Praise also

584
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,840
Rainbow, who did the preceding

585
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,800
very well

586
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,020
weird

587
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,260
song.

588
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:45,720
Oh my...

589
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,720
Bridging from acoustic...

590
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,700
Bridging from acoustic...

591
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,180
Puddin' from acoustic

592
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,360
computer music.

593
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,940
And the big instrumental

594
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,200
before that was

595
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,920
Rudy Schwartz Project

596
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,520
Invisible Chrome Fish People.

597
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,000
And now

598
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,900
this.

599
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,920
Support for this comes from

600
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,720
DiabetesDeliveryServices.com

601
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,640
From PR News in Washington,

602
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,700
I'm Spreading the News.

603
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,020
Spreading to many areas.

604
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,620
Dolchicta and spreading to

605
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,420
Philidminshko.

606
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,660
President Obama,

607
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,700
who's Cleveland,

608
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,300
is in the battleground state of Ohio,

609
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,600
spoke against the nation's wealthiest

610
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,980
and called for more businesses.

611
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,120
I believe it's the private sector.

612
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,140
I believe people should be lean.

613
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,080
Mr. Obama spoke.

614
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,440
People should be efficient.

615
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,380
The man I consider to be

616
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,920
the greatest of them all

617
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,840
will continue to contribute to PR News

618
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,940
from time to time.

619
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:45,700
I'm Spreading the News.

620
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,520
President Obama's own investigation

621
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,660
on April, in April that is,

622
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,840
identifies out of control spending

623
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,940
that led to the deadly economic recovery.

624
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,580
The president fired back.

625
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,420
I believe it's the people and their families.

626
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,880
It's the private sector.

627
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,540
Oklahoma is bracing for economic recovery.

628
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,920
Much of Oklahoma could drop as much as five inches

629
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,560
throughout the day and weaken as it moves northeast.

630
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,660
Uh, uh, toward the northeast.

631
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,240
The state of Texas brought more than 10 inches

632
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,040
of wind gusts up to Oklahoma City.

633
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:15,680
The state of Texas brought more than 10 inches of wind gusts up to Oklahoma City.

634
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:15,680


635
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,100
This is PR.

636
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,940
The report finds that there were plenty of opportunities

637
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,820
to prevent or limit PR News.

638
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,560
PR's contractors share the blame.

639
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,740
After months of speculation,

640
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,580
CNN is going with PR News.

641
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:37,640
Thank you.

642
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:45,400
This next song I wrote for all the people in this country.

643
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:46,980
Thank you.

644
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,200
This next song.

645
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:01,740
clascado

646
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:07,580
It's just out of a putting bag.

647
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:07,940
to contain internal Jacques,

648
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,120
Informed that the completely un locaged

649
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:08,120


650
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:08,120

00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:08,120


652
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:08,280
The first ship that pistols today,

653
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:09,540
the St. Louis South Park.

654
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:23,740
Dear Mr. President, I want you to know I am deeper than you.

655
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:31,620
Listen and learn, my heart is a chapel, my head is a steeple,

656
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,220
my arms are the people, and the people now yearn.

657
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:45,180
I stand for the midget, I stand for the negro,

658
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,460
I stand for the engine, all hopped up on booze,

659
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:55,320
I stand for the Jap, and I stand for the beaner,

660
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,060
I stand, yes I do, for the Christ-killing Jew.

661
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:09,100
And I stand for the dyke, and I stand for the retard,

662
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,020
I stand for the Chinaman, washing my socks,

663
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,660
I stand for the...

664
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,000
I stand for the bum, and the pimp, and the bugger,

665
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,020
and the cripple that lives on my street in the box.

666
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:37,580
To conclude, Mr. President, I'm not at all hesitant

667
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:42,400
to tell you I think the first ladies of Fox,

668
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,300
her husband, the jerk-off,

669
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,520
has ruined my country.

670
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,760
That's all for today.

671
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,260
Sincerely, D. Cox.

00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,000
But it is.

769
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,240
But it is.

770
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,360
It is.

771
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:27,640
It is so awful, really awful, for good it is.

772
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:29,540
It is.

773
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,720
What is, it is.

774
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,920
But it is, for good it is.

775
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,880
It is, it is, what it.

776
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:35,860
It is.

777
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:36,720
But it is.

778
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,200
What it is.

779
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,980
Or is.

780
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:54,800
It is what it is.

781
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,100
Got no roots to be proud of, got no lady by my side.

782
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,700
If I'm living my full bill, they sure not gonna let it slide.

783
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:23,000
Got no reason to wake up when I'm sleeping, I just drink beer all day.

784
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,900
Sit and listen to old records, watch my life dripping away.

785
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,500
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

786
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,180
Can't you see what I'm saying at all?

787
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,680
No matter who's singing them to ya, half of the blues ain't hip anymore.

788
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:50,700
Guess I'm handsome to look at, I play a mean bass guitar.

789
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,080
Sold 13 copies of my album, counting everything so far.

790
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,420
Can't you hear what I'm singing?

791
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,980
Can't you see what I'm singing at all?

792
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,900
It don't matter who's giving them to ya.

793
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,480
Half of the blues ain't hip anymore.

794
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:32,020
It don't matter who's giving them to ya.

795
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,880
Some people think I die of depression.

796
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,800
Some people smoke a bunch of pot.

797
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,420
Some people have their time of their life ratio out of order.

798
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:55,240
Some of them have the obvious jock like they do when they smoke.

799
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,380
There's nothing more important than being mad at somebody who can make money.

800
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:56,380


801
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,120
There's nothing more important than being mad at somebody who can make money.

802
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,580
That's me, Bakery.

803
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,080
I also don't know one of those kids.

804
00:57:59,080 --> 00:57:59,200
I saw a woman once sink her papers with a sick sleeping pill.

805
00:57:59,200 --> 00:57:59,740
I found other ones that had broken me down while working at the because they still quero

806
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,720
Worked for a better, recorded band and simplify my life.

807
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:00,720


808
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,000
I believe in all of those's, so I prepare for tomorrowc' time.

809
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,000


810
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,660
Always drink this next match like the old vitke,

811
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,620
I'm lonely when you ask me hard who you wanna feed me?

812
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:12,240
That was The Psychoskeletons, dear friends.

813
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:22,420
And you can find infinitely more of that at soundclick.com slash thepsychoskeletons.

814
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:23,680
Ah, yes.

815
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:31,400
Be sure to be with us next time for further adventures of...

816
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:42,880
From NPR News in Washington, I'm serving openly in the military.

817
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:48,260
He had a broad on his face. He was psyched up, of course, very, very pumped up.

818
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,900
President Obama's appearance ended in failure.

819
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:55,960
President Obama told his supporters to give up because the change they wanted to see hasn't happened yet.

820
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,200
The problems cannot be solved.

821
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:02,460
And the Democrats are optimistic about their chances to stay home in November.

822
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,400
Talks on the future of an oil-rich region of the North.

823
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,720
Or the South of Sudan.

824
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,240
Some major banks have halted Sudan while they review the issue.

825
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:17,020
Up to 40 state attorneys general are expected to announce a joint investigation today

826
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:22,100
into allegations that all state attorneys cut corners and use shoddy congressional elections

827
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,360
that infringe upon the fundamental PR news in Washington.

828
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,720
Thank you, Mr. Rectum and Leemir.
