1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
You talking to me? You talking to me? Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,200
The Self Genius Power of Swag.

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,520
Oh, what is it?

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,560
Never mind.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,460
Public access, public access, tacky as it looks. It doesn't look so bad once you get it on camera.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,640
Go into the entertainment industry. Go into, go into.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,100
Work your crap, work your crap, direct and produce the crap, crap.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:32,060
Television controls, television controls the world. I mean, I mean, I mean, everywhere you look has something to do with TV.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,440
You can get on TV, get on TV.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,780
Do it, do it. Hey, you got no talent. You should not be on TV.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,060
Exploitation of self.

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,260
Psychedelic.

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,500
Drug, drug, crack cocaine heroin.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,440
I want to get an Asian puppet.

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,060
It's scary.

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,200
You're insane. This is a stupid show.

17
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,420
You are living with your puppets.

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,320
I don't want pussy. I don't want pussy.

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,560
When I get married, I'll have pussy.

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,500
I get my sex to Jesus.

21
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,480
This is what Christianity does to you. Basically, it's like a psychedelic free-for-all.

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,700
Well, he's retarded. He's like this retarded genius.

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,840
I did my first UFO.

24
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,940
We all know UFOs exist.

25
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,420
I have problems.

26
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,320
I am the reincarnation of Keith Partridge.

27
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,360
We like to use television as a mind expansion tool.

28
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,260
Church of Scientology.

29
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,140
We love television.

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,160
The dick of schtick.

31
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,020
Rudy the rubber.

32
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,780
Oh, my show is geared to anyone who's got a penis or a vagina.

33
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,920
You love doctor.

34
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,820
You can call me.

35
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Where are all my dildos?

36
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,940
Uh, crack, heroin.

37
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,220
Tell me, do you think there's anything wrong with your mind, really?

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,420
Not a thing, doc.

39
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,920
I'm a goddamn marvel of modern science.

40
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:52,620
Only vain like your

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,080
acostirasias.

42
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,620
Bye.

43
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,740
Hands on the window, let me see your ID.

44
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,640
Time to give a rest by the APD.

45
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,300
And cuss on, give his kidneys a smack.

46
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,060
Kick him in the balls if he tries to talk back.

47
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,600
Flucking off at stop and go, drink a Mr. Pip.

48
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,480
Beat up on a wino till you bust his ribs.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,180
Cracking down on whores if you do your job right.

50
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,960
You'll get a free flow.

51
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,860
Job on a Saturday night.

52
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,140
Force you in a ditch.

53
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,240
It's a war on drugs.

54
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,020
It's a war on drugs.

55
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,220
Time, cuss and a gag.

56
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,440
Stop and serve a pen to fill your coffee mug.

57
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:20,400
Spray your eyes with vape and jab a nightstick in your spine.

58
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,320
Deep as a time and freezing to 29.

59
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,760
Green hp.

60
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,020
Negative favourites?

61
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,280
Acrisi you.

62
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,120
Rep permeate.

63
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,800
Power off and try it without it getting you.

64
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,380
Voilà А gravity illustration.

65
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:48,380


66
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:48,380


67
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:48,460
Your max damage mismos to cover your viper in the future.

68
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:48,460


69
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:48,460


70
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:48,460


71
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,060
The cuenta is still the home of a health chart Clair's business on health.

72
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,520
Be sure even minimal felix math okay give free will

73
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,080
blast Oh never mind about my first hit.

74
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,080


75
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,820
How would you like all your teeth kicked in

76
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,660
with the point of my shiny release boot?

77
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,220
Don't piss and moan about your civil rights.

78
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,520
The judges are in on it, too.

79
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,660
What's wrong with your torture?

80
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,420
Why color crime doesn't matter to me

81
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,500
long as I get some ultra-v.

82
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,460
Most of those guys are friends of mine.

83
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,240
See them at the Klan meeting Wednesdays at 9.

84
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,180
Y'all come back now, Pierre.

85
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,660
Y'all come back now, Pierre.

86
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,060
Y'all come back now, Pierre.

87
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,540
Y'all come back now, Pierre.

88
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,220
Oh, yes, baby.

89
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,020
That was the Rudy Schwartz Project

90
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,140
with a song called Protect and Serve.

91
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,280
Baby, you are listening to the Hour of Slack,

92
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,420
triple X rated, number nine.

93
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,840
Actually, what that means is not that

94
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,640
we're going to have a show,

95
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:54,640


96
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:54,640


97
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:54,640


98
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:54,640


99
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:54,640


100
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,100
especially sexy or salacious material on the show.

101
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,100
But it's just that we get all these great cuts

103
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,700
that there's just no point in trying to use them

104
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,900
on the regular broadcast version of Hour of Slack

105
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,500
because when you cut the fucks and the shits,

106
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,980
there's nothing left.

107
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,740
It just doesn't work.

108
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,340
So these are the things that, for whatever reason,

109
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,600
we decided we could not use.

110
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,000
We decided we could not use

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,980
on normal American airwaves.

112
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:34,580
But I'm sure they'll end up there in yon anyway.

113
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,580
Friends, the intro was by Fernando Nandili-Murr.

114
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,900
And the next thing up would be by

115
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,840
the Reverend Bill T. Miller,

116
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,740
the King of Slack.

117
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,140
Are you a voyeur?

118
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,560
Do you like to watch?

119
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,220
Uh-huh.

120
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,680
What's your name?

121
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,620
Bob.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,480
Hi, Bob.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,580
Oh, boy.

124
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,700
I tell you, I get such a hard time.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,600
Oh, what are you going to do with it, Bob?

126
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,280
Tell me.

127
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,640
Why don't you fuck me with it?

128
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,220
Tell me how you like it if I came in your room right now.

129
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:08,920
Uh-huh.

130
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,760
What would you do to me?

131
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,980
Oh, baby.

132
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,980
If you came in my room right now,

133
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,980
I'd want you to put your fingers in my pussy.

134
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,900
Oh, boy.

135
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,100
Oh, yeah, Bob.

136
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:18,940
Oh, yeah?

137
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,700
Uh-huh.

138
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,340
Do you think you can find my sub-G spot, Bob?

139
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,040
I think so.

140
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,300
Come on, baby.

141
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,380
Behind it for me.

142
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,760
Yeah.

143
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,920
Oh, Bob.

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,220
Oh, yeah.

145
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,080
Yeah.

146
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,700
Oh, oh.

147
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,800
Yeah.

148
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,980
Four, three, two, one, fire!

149
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,600
It's a boss.

150
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,920
It's a boss.

151
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,420
It's a boss, young.

152
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,800
It's a boss.

153
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,880
lives lived for no reason at all

154
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,740
only so that they didn't have to do

155
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,980
what they were told to do

156
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,400
pee in the special pot

157
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,600
they were told and they did what they were told

158
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,400
don't pee in the bed

159
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,640
don't pee in the street

160
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,500
just pee in the special pot

161
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,520
one little boy refused to pee in the special pot

162
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,920
he peed wherever he wanted to

163
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,420
sometimes

164
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,940
wouldn't even pee

165
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,400
at all

166
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,860
one day he didn't have a pot to piss in

167
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,620
and he didn't know what he was going to do

168
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,460
don't pee

169
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:52,580
pee

170
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,540
where you can't pee

171
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,220
but where will i ever get a pot to piss in

172
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,640
but i'm a poor poor lad

173
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,960
i am desperately poor

174
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,500
he decided to found a charity for those who did not have a pot to piss in

175
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,260
never in the history of the future will a boy ever be born that did not have a pot to piss in

176
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,440
he probably didn't have a pot to piss in

177
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:22,440


178
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,400
he promised himself and he promised the world

179
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,340
pisspots for the poor were born that day

180
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,900
one of the greatest

181
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,160
charitable organizations ever created and founded by

182
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,780
the united nations

183
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,440

184
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,940

185
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,500
Pisspots for the poor from johnny future

Well, dear chap, I have the advantage.

You see, I got a dove sack and my posse's got my back.

Got your back, fool.

316
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,740
And even if you got away, well then, we got to follow you home with the chrome.

317
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,000
Hey, we got you covered.

318
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,480
Well, mate, my boys got your surrounding lock outside.

So will you admit you ripped off my best snaps?

324
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,760
I say, this does look like a bit of a standoff.

325
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,100
For I cannot recall biting a single rhyme of yours.

326
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,800
Look, sport, don't make me break you off something.

327
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,200
Do you know I believe a few caps on your ass will quieten you down, my dear boy.

328
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,560
Right, well, then there's nothing else for it.

329
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,560
Hey, you better not try, motherfucker.

330
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,880
Hey, step up, fool.

331
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,020
Get that motherfucker, man.

332
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:07,100
I say, before we do this thing up proper, I couldn't help noticing that it's 4.20.

333
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,860
Hey, yo.

334
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,460
It's 4.20.

335
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,580
Shut your pie hole.

336
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,360
Blimey, you're right at that.

337
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,440
And you do know what that means.

338
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,700
Oh, yeah.

339
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,740
4.20, that's the type of smoke.

340
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,060
4.20's down for this old school bloke.

341
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,380
Well, then, how about some hits from the bong, as it were?

342
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,500
Do what now?

343
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,640
Hits from the bong, old boy.

344
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,800
You see, a bong is a water pipe for smoking denk.

345
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,360
The denk is filtered through the water.

346
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,340
When you take a fat hit, the pressure drops in the holding chamber.

347
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,920
So the smoke gets to the bottom of the tank.

348
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,340
And the bong gets pulled through the water.

349
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,800
You think I don't know what a bong is?

350
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,580
I roll in that get low hood too, squire.

351
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,980
Let's take some fat green hits from that five-footer.

352
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,820
All right, governor.

353
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,380
Oh, what is that, eh?

354
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,660
Ah, yes.

355
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,820
Oh, yes. Lovely.

356
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,220
Ah.

357
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,360
Blimey.

358
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,520
That's the chronic, that is.

359
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,020
I know this is clogged, G.

360
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,220
Say, that pipe's bugged.

361
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,880
It's just hella clogged.

362
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,840
Let's roll a fat one.

363
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,240
Yo, don't hide the crop, because I got the easy wise.

364
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,180
Hey, yo, look out for that cherry, fool.

365
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,100
Oh, bloody hell.

366
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,640
You're gonna burn yourself.

367
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,840
What seems to be the trouble?

368
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,580
What, what?

369
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,900
Oh, bollocks.

370
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,980
I'll burn a hole in me brand new dickie.

371
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,880
Ah, don't trouble yourself about that.

372
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,300
You may have one of mine.

373
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:28,720
What?

374
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,280
I say, butter knife, roll us some fatties, Holmes.

375
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,160
Damn, fool.

376
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,120
I already rolled up some hella fat spirits.

377
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,600
Look at that, fool.

378
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,420
I got the most...

379
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,400
Ah.

380
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,580
Oh, bugger.

381
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,540
Beam me up, Scotty.

382
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,200
That's the dank, that is.

383
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,040
Tally-ho.

384
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,300
Oh, blimey, mate.

385
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,400
Damn, I fucked up.

386
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:49,980
Damn, I'm...

387
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,500
All this booyah has given me hella cotton mouth.

388
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,040
Yeah, it's worked up a right fine thirst in me as well.

389
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,260
Have you got anything to drink?

390
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,220
Oh, yes.

391
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,900
Are you down with Mickey's?

392
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,700
Well, I used to drink them every day.

393
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,300
Straight forties to the head, fool.

394
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,440
Ah, butter knife.

395
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,160
It's for us all.

396
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,140
It's all good.

397
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,140
Yeah.

398
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,460
Well, I suppose we must conclude our business, as it were.

399
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,360
Ah, damn.

400
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,320
Right, um, what were we on about?

401
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:25,420
You know, call me daft, but strangely enough, I can't seem to remember.

402
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,500
Hmm.

403
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,060
Hmm.

404
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,760
Hey, hey, yo, they forgot what it was about the foster care.

405
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,640
That's fucked up.

406
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,560
Yeah, that's hella fucked up.

407
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,240
They forgot.

408
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,280
They forgot their shit.

409
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:33,720
Yeah.

410
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,320
That's fucked up.

411
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,040
Hey, yo, trip on this, governor.

412
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,580
You wanna go score a fat key, then, Charlie?

413
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,300
Indeed.

414
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,360
Let's go half on a bag of dank.

415
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,820
Then we could go down to the pub and bomb up on a Guinness, maybe throw a few darts like.

416
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,840
Oh, yeah, man, I'm all up in the Guinness.

417
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,800
Spot on.

418
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,760
You've read my mind, old bean.

419
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,680
Let's roll up on that place.

420
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,820
Damn, it's cold.

421
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,540
Well, once again, we out of here.

422
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,200
So, as always, let me leave you with a few words of pithy advice.

423
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,620
One.

424
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,340
While you were at your job working nine to five,

425
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,980
the Beastie Boys were at the garden cold-kicking it live.

426
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,960
And two.

427
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,740
Remember, to all my peoples in the pens, keep your head up, keeping it real out in the field, y'all.

428
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,800
And if you don't know...

429
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,860
And if you don't know...

430
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,880
Now you know.

431
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:20,980


432
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,860
Let's go, brother. We go.

433
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,480
Come on, food.

434
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,580
You're weakening on your ears.

435
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,420
Well, we've got a slide.

436
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,040
This bit's been played out.

437
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:27,960
See you around.

438
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,040
Peace out.

439
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:29,800
Cheerio.

440
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,040
Pip pip and all that.

441
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,220
아닙ist

442
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,220
Had shit in the hot tub at XD that year.

443
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:06,160
And it took many gallons to make it all clear.

444
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,140
Now the saucers have left me

445
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,360
I'm stranded right here

446
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,420
A tub-shitting moron

447
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,220
Is nothing to be

448
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,420
A tub-shitting moron

449
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,260
Is nothing to be

450
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,820
I shit in the tub

451
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,300
And made everyone sick

452
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,680
By trying just to fart once

453
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,280
And letting her rip

454
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,040
Now I'm stranded in brushwood

455
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,220
Left holding my dick

456
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,440
A tub-shitting moron

457
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,060
Is nothing to be

458
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,800
A tub-shitting moron

459
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:05,800


460
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,760
Is nothing to be

461
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,960
I used to play songs

462
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,420
With a gay rapist's band

463
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,020
But the exes, they came

464
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,360
And destroyed the whole land

465
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,840
Now I'm stuck in a world

466
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,560
Without slack, I can't stand

467
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,900
A tub-shitting moron

468
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,580
Is nothing to be

469
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,940
A tub-shitting moron

470
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,760
Is nothing to be

471
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,800
When they've tortured and burned you

472
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,000
Till your ass is red

473
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,140
The exes will stomp you

474
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,980
And rip off your head

475
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,960
Then they'll shit down your neck, son

476
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,020
And leave you for dead

477
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,780
A tub-shitting moron

478
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,460
Is nothing to be

479
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,660
A tub-shitting moron

480
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,400
Is nothing to be

481
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,260
You wish you were on

482
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,560
Planet X

483
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:35,800
When you were young

484
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,480
With the mob

485
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,000
The first you must learn

486
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,140
How to smile

487
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,160
Just like Bob

488
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,480
So you just sit there

489
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,320
In the brown water

490
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,160
And sob

491
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,820
A tub-shitting moron

492
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,440
Is nothing to be

493
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:05,800
A tub-shitting moron

494
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,180
Is nothing to be

495
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,240
If you wanna be an asshole

496
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,260
Then just follow me

497
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:28,340
A tub-shitting moron

498
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,640
By Reverend Phineas Narco

499
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,320
That was taken from his

500
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,740
Either Midnight Voice Jail

501
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,800
Or National Public Radio Show

502
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,860
Or the National Cynical Network

503
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,940
And before that,

504
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,280
Chap in the Hood

505
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,980
Was also from

506
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,780
National Cynical Network

507
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,560
I can't remember the name

508
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,360
Of the guy who does it

509
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,580
But you can get all of that

510
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,400
And much, much more

511
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,300
At nationalcynical.com

512
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,820
Before that, we heard some

513
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,800
Lemur

514
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,380
And now more Norel Pref

515
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,980
John, there's no way

516
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,100
To put it into words

517
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,800
What I feel now

518
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,780
I will do anything you want

519
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,780
In one of the most important days of my life

520
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:05,920
I will do anything you want

521
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:05,920


522
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,800
Is the most powerful positions

523
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,400
Over and over put me down

524
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,000
In ways that I don't recall

525
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,760
Experiencing before

526
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,880
It will reverberate

527
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,740
All my adult ass media

528
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,220
I would do it right

529
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,340
All in all, I am deeply committed

530
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,000
To marriage between a man and his donkey

531
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,720
We're talking about me

532
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,560
Who cares?

533
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,120
I could get sexual movement

534
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,820
But ass reveal it all

535
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,700
Do it, people

536
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,760
This is my job

537
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,740
I can't wait any longer

538
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,800
Not just for marriage

539
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,460
Or a ninth grade

540
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,600
And I think, if you'll excuse me

541
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:45,600


542
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,280
There's still thr s

543
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,840
We're talking about

544
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:48,840


545
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,240
He has to keep breathing

546
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
And mix up all his

547
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,360
branquit

548
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,580
That he doesn't expressed

549
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,120
Back and forth

550
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,120


551
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,160
And have a certain

552
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,460
Teaching

553
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,360
And both guys

554
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,520
Do what you're supposed

555
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:58,660
To do

556
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:58,920
But also

557
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,580
Live a specific life

558
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,060
What do you want?

559
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,400
And we'll try

560
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:04,980
Every every week

561
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,260
And we will

562
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:05,520
Live for

563
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:05,520


564
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:05,760
What should that be?

565
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:05,760


566
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:05,760


567
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:05,760


568
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:05,760


569
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,460
All in all, I am deeply committed.

570
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,480
Who cares?

571
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,260
I'm getting up in this bullshit right now.

572
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,940
You either shoot me or tell me what the fuck is going on.

573
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,700
What the hell are you doing?

574
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,640
I'm banging that girl.

575
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,160
Why, out of all of the godforsaken shitholes in Mexico, do we have to meet here?

576
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:36,780
Spam?

577
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,460
Mmm, yummy.

578
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,700
You are puked.

579
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,040
Forever.

580
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,760
Forever's a long time.

581
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,080
Yeah, tell us about it.

582
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,200
This movie's a long time.

583
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,140
He's alive!

584
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,100
You're a shit monkey, boy.

585
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,720
Easy for you to say after you've fucking out a man's wife.

586
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,620
I am moving fucking around.

587
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,060
I am the devil.

588
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,840
As soon as that camera is off, he's gonna fuck that little guy.

589
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,140
The ghost in the darkness.

590
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,100
Here you come.

591
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,540
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?

592
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,940
Well, the thing about life is, it gets weird.

593
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,260
People are always talking to you about truth.

594
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,040
Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something.

595
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,740
And they got a supply in a closet.

596
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,980
But what you learn as you get older is there ain't no truth.

597
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,940
All there is, is bullshit.

598
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,620
Pardon my vulgarity here.

599
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:23,860
Layers of it.

600
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,360
One layer of bullshit on top of another.

601
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,900
And what you do in life, like when you get older, is

602
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,040
you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer.

603
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,100
And that's your bullshit, so to speak.

604
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,460
What's your felacity on life?

605
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:36,980
No, it's me.

606
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:37,760
Oh, who?

607
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,320
It sucks shit!

608
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,240
Heavy metal rules!

609
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,700
Heavy metal rules.

610
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,220
All that punk shit sucks.

611
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,340
It doesn't belong in this world.

612
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,840
It belongs on fucking Mars, man.

613
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,560
What the hell is punk shit?

614
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,120
And Madonna can go to hell as far as I'm concerned.

615
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,060
She's a dick.

616
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,740
I mean, seriously, heavy me-

617
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,100
Ow.

618
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,620
Ha ha.

619
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,560
Heavy metal.

620
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:00,620
Oh, fuck.

621
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,600
Heavy metal definitely rules.

622
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,300
Twisted Sister, Juice Priest, Darkin.

623
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,120
Ozzy, Scorpions, they all rule.

624
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,340
Yeah, she's tripping Jack Daniels.

625
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,480
It all rules.

626
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,460
All that shit rules.

627
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,800
This punk shit circle of shit and the dicks and all, that can go to hell.

628
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,420
I don't care.

629
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,640
You know, I don't really give a shit about that kind of punk fuck.

630
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,000
Now, ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to do a song about Casner head pussy.

631
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,180
I'll never forget the first time we-

632
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,000
It's a long-winded explanation, too, so bear with us.

633
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,120
It's about Casner head pussy.

634
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,240
Now, Casner heads, well, Jayner will explain to you the song.

635
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,200
It has some- it's baby heads, the big wig, Casner heads, you know, like this.

636
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,180
It's like a store you go to.

637
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,620
Well, we'll do it for you and maybe you'll understand later.

638
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,040
I'll never forget the first time we played this song for Willie.

639
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,900
He'd been drinking whiskey and he liked to die after he heard it.

640
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:04,680
We said, �Hey, Willie, we wrote this song about Cosmic goom abortion tolerance levels

641
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,620
and we'd like to play it for you now.�

642
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,400
It's called Casner Head Pussy.

643
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,200
Y'all can sing along.

644
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,720
The words are Casner head, Casner head, Casner, Casner, Casner, Casner, Casner head, Casner.

645
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,300
Casner head, the Casner head.

646
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,780
Y'all ready, One, two, three.

647
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,560
Casner head, the Casner head, the Casner head.

648
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,900
Casner head, the Casner head, the Casner head, the Casner head, the Casner head, the Casner head.

649
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,400
相 ladies помo, Samueler, The customers felt the rock.

650
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:29,860
Hey guys, what's up?

651
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:29,860


652
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,120
We can't get no Casner head pussy

653
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,760
Since they took away our little pretty windows

654
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,580
Oh they put em in a jar

655
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,420
And then set em on the bar

656
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,020
And when county law came

657
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,240
That's when we put em down the drain

658
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,120
Casner Head

659
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,200
Casner Head

660
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,820
Casner Head

661
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,500
Casner Head

662
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,860
We can't get no Casner head pussy

663
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,060
Since they took away our little pretty windows

664
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,860
Oh they put em in a jar

665
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,880
And then set em on the bar

666
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,680
And when county law came

667
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,320
That's when we put em down the drain

668
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,900
Casner Head

669
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,620
Casner Head

670
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,900
Casner Head

671
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,620
Casner Head

672
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,320
Casner Head

673
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:49,320


674
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,120
Casner Head

675
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,180
Casner Head

676
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:54,240
Well, if you really want to get into a castor head pussy, you've got to have an anchor anchor.

677
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:02,160
An anchor ankle, which keeps you from being sucked into the other zone by the incredible suction force of a castor head pussy.

678
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,000
Oh, but I wouldn't expect you to know anything about that.

679
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,700
Oh, no, you wouldn't know about castor head pussies.

680
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,900
I forgot. Oh, you've never gotten into castor head pussy.

681
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,280
But actually, castor head pussy is a bastardization of baby head.

682
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,240
See, baby head is round like this, where castor head pussy is plain down.

683
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,740
It's like, castor head, castor head, castor head.

684
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,640
They shoot across the ground at 200 miles per hour.

685
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,180
All they do is they're going to sing their songs.

686
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,020
Castor head, castor head, castor head.

687
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,880
And that's what their song sounds like.

688
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,900
It only has those three words.

689
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,000
Castor head, castor head, castor head, castor head, head, castor head.

690
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,660
Castor, castor, castor head, castor head, castor head.

691
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:46,060
Oh, we can't get no castor head.

692
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:46,600
Castor head pussy.

693
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,620
Since they took away our little bitty windows.

694
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,400
Oh, we put them in a jar.

695
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,860
And we set them on the bar.

696
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:08,260
And when county law came, that's when we poured them down the drain.

697
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,900
One, two, three, four.

698
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,300
That's it.

699
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,340
Thank you.

700
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,160
Castor head pussy.

701
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,320
That was castor head pussy.

702
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:17,820
Thank you.

703
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,960
What really concerns me is heinous wounds.

704
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,140
Catastrophic attack.

705
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,180
We'll have disaster.

706
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,140
I fear heinous wounds.

707
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,380
I think we have a real good chance for heinous wounds.

708
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:35,900
I think there's a chance we may see our civil liberties abridged in a way we haven't seen since the Civil War and maybe further.

709
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,640
I relish heinous wounds.

710
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,140
Government is not reason.

711
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,440
It is not eloquent.

712
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,440
It is force.

713
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,020
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.

714
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,360
I know this will sound as if I'm equivocating.

715
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,180
But we were.

716
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:46,900
We were very eager.

717
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,020
The President had already made up his mind to go to heinous wounds.

718
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,700
Vision.

719
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,240
D-d-d-d-d-division.

720
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,740
Heinous wounds.

721
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,260
They're heinous wounds.

722
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,100
They're terrible wounds.

723
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,140
They're tragic wounds.

724
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,880
If you have sex in the springtime, you might just make a person.

725
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,100
The beginnings of a baby.

726
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,020
What happens is this.

727
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,260
Let's say the man and the woman are lying in bed together.

728
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,360
Because men lie to women in bed a lot.

729
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,720
This part often happens in bed.

730
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,700
Because a bed is so nice and comfortable.

731
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,860
The man loves the woman.

732
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,800
Or that's what he says.

733
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,100
So he gives her a kiss.

734
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,440
And she gives him a kiss.

735
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,440
And they hug each other very tight.

736
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,940
And after a while, the man's penis becomes stiff and hard.

737
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,940
And much bigger than it usually is.

738
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,240
It gets bigger because it has lots of work to do.

739
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,580
By this time, the man wants to get as close to the woman as he can.

740
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,260
Because he's feeling hurt.

741
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:46,260


742
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,660
And very loving to her.

743
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,420
Or that's what he says.

744
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,920
And to get really close.

745
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,040
The best thing he can do is lie on top of her.

746
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,180
And put his penis inside her.

747
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,860
Into her vagina.

748
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:03,000
This is a very nice feeling for both the man and the woman.

749
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,620
Or so she says.

750
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,940
He likes being inside her.

751
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,780
And she likes him being inside her.

752
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,080
Or that's what she says.

753
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,940
It's called making love.

754
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,560
Or whoopee.

755
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,940
Because it all starts with the man and the woman loving each other.

756
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,980
Unless it's an act of commerce.

757
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,620
It's a difficult feeling to describe.

758
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,780
But if you can imagine a gentle, tingly sort of tickle.

759
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,540
That starts in your stomach.

760
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,900
And spreads all over.

761
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,580
That will give you some idea of what it's like.

762
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,840
And as you know, when you're feeling tickly, you wriggle about a bit.

763
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,840
It's just the same here.

764
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,140
Except it's a special kind of wriggling.

765
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,420
It's easier to understand when you realize that the parts that tickle most.

766
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,920
Are the man's penis.

767
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,500
And the woman's vagina.

768
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,360
So most of the wriggling happens down there.

769
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,140
The man pushes his penis up and down inside the woman's vagina.

770
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,380
So that both the tickly parts are being rubbed against each other.

771
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,460
It's like scratching an itch.

772
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,900
But a lot nicer.

773
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,120
This usually starts slowly.

774
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,280
And gets quicker.

775
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:11,900
And quicker.

776
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,660
And quicker.

777
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,480
And quicker.

778
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:13,580
And quicker.

779
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,440
The tickling feeling gets stronger.

780
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,380
And stronger.

781
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,480
And stronger.

782
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,200
And stronger.

783
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,140
Oh, god.

784
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,900
Oh, yeah.

785
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,460
Now you may be thinking.

786
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,900
If it's so nice.

787
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,280
Why don't people do it all the time.

788
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,800
There are two reasons.

789
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,680
First, it's very tiring.

790
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:36,840
More than playing football or running or skipping or climbing trees or playing grab ass or almost anything.

791
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,200
Good as it is.

792
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,480
You just can't do it all day long.

793
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,740
And the second reason is that something really wonderful happens, which puts an end to the tickly feeling.

794
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,180
And at the same time starts the making of a baby.

795
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:57,320
When the man and the woman have been wriggling so hard you think they're both going to pop, they nearly do just that.

796
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:03,680
All the rubbing up and down that's been going on ends in a tremendous, big, lovely shiver for both of them.

797
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,820
Or one of them, if he's selfish.

798
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,380
Again, it's not so easy to tell you what this feels like.

799
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:16,280
But you know how it feels when you have a tickle in your nose for a long time, and then you have a really big sneeze?

800
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,460
And the mucus goes all over the back of the girl's head? It's a little like that.

801
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:26,860
At the same time, a spurt of quite thick, sticky stuff comes from the end of the man's penis.

802
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,660
And this goes into the woman's vagina. Or whatever.

803
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,920
Well, believe it or not, this sticky stuff is how you and I all started.

804
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,920
It's called semen. And in the semen are sperm.

805
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,440
And they make babies. The end.

806
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,600
And that's why your mother's a slut.

807
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,420
Uh, yes, dear friends.

808
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,800
Uh, that was the Lymph Node Institute from WREK's show.

809
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,560
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse. Sex instructions there.

810
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:20,280
And you can actually download all of the Bob's Slack Time Funhouse shows from WREK.org.

811
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:26,400
Before that, we heard the anus wounds cut by Norel Preff of NorelPreff.com.

812
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,020
And cast their head pussy by Doctors for Bob.

813
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,400
I think that may have been a live recording.

814
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,740
Either from a Dallas.

815
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,920
Or Arkansas show in the early 80s.

816
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,080
Cast their head pussy.

817
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,780
Um, and before that, uh,

818
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,360
with some movie quotes that Moolah Muthata sent to us.

819
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,740
And Don't Try This was by the Lamprey Systems.

820
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:53,880
And now, Queen of the Robotoids by Heart Ignition.

821
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,060
Robotoid alert apprehend.

822
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:04,680
Bob Dobbs, he'll make you pregnant with his driven penis.

823
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,120
And we don't need that.

824
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,780
Robotoid alert apprehend.

825
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:18,400
Bob Dobbs, he'll make you pregnant with his driven penis.

826
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,840
And we don't need that.

827
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,420
Robotoid alert apprehend.

828
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:32,140
And Bob Dobbs, he'll make you pregnant with his driven penis.

829
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,900
And we don't need that.

830
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,320
We don't need that.

831
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,420
Robotoid alert apprehend.

832
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:56,640
Robotoid alert apprehend.

833
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,140
And we don't need that.

834
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,320
And we don't need that.

835
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:29,280
Ha ha ha ha!

836
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,220
From your life, from mother's religion and greed

837
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,460
After you load your pay through all

838
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,660
And Jerry will save you

839
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,520
Nothing will ever seem like you're taking it off the ass

840
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,900
For God so loved you, he gave you horrible skin problems

841
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:24,120
For God so loved you, he gave your daughter multiple birth defects

842
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:29,300
For God so loved you, he gave your mother multiple birth defects

843
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:36,480
For God so loved you, he severed both of your legs in a car accident

844
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:28,100
For God so loved you, he severed both of your legs in a car accident

845
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,300
For God so loved you, he severed both of your legs in a car accident

846
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,340
Oh Clark, you're such a scab

847
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,300
Lucky she doesn't know I'm secretly Superman

848
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,200
If only you were a real he-man like Superman

849
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,360
Didn't Mr. White have a job for us today?

850
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,000
We had a job for me, Clark

851
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,840
He doesn't trust you because you're just a, you're just a art fag

852
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,460
But I've got seniority, Lois

853
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,980
Look, I've got a press pass here

854
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,900
Oh, seniority smartly

855
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,500
Superman, if he doesn't need a press pass

856
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,860
Because he can get anywhere he wants

857
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,980
He's a man of steel

858
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,300
If he owns it

859
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:29,300


860
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:29,740
He's a man of iron

861
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,340
Wow, what a run

862
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,820
He really knows how to

863
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,280
One of my headphones just went dead

864
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,960
It must be Lex Luthor

865
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,200
Excuse me, I'll just step into this stock room and take the inventory

866
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,620
At long last, they've got Lois Slade alone

867
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,320
If I capture her, I'm sure I can get Superman

868
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,000
All right, Luthor, unhand Lois

869
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,220
Where is Lois?

870
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,620
Anyway, I thought you said she was here

871
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,060
That one guy's Luthor, but he's even Luthor

872
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,300
Superman, you came here just to do this?

873
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,320
I got even Clark Kent's

874
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,140
Wait a minute, where is Clark Kent?

875
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,520
I had him in my secret compartment

876
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,340
Now I've got the drop on you, Luthor

877
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,680
Kent's working for me

878
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,480
If he only knew

879
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,720
Oh, Superman

880
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,440
You and your stupid little reporting tricks

881
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,760
Unfortunately, though, I've got the kryptonite ray

882
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,560
Have some of this

883
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,740
Must get the new red cape

884
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,220
Are you all right, Luthor?

885
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,760
Blacking out, can't take it

886
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,940
At long last, the man of steel

887
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,300
Groveling at my feet

888
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,180
Luthor, I'll kiss your fundament

889
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,880
Gotta keep him talking until I can get that red cape ray off

890
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,840
I'm sure you're willing to know

891
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,040
What my evil diabolical plan is for world domination

892
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,480
Yes, you always tell me before you attempt to snuff me

893
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,160
Well, it's something I can't resist, you see

894
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,420
You see, quite simply, it's this

895
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,860
First, I took over the world

896
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,840
Then I dominated

897
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,340
Faster, Luthor, faster

898
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,440
I've heard it all before

899
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,960
You cheap tin-pot mad scientists are all alike

900
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,800
I'm not a potty

901
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,420
You talk tough

902
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,100
But when it comes down to the real nitty-gritty

903
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,920
You're just a big cream puff with no moxie

904
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,140
You get me, Luthor?

905
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,720
Your dynamite ray or whatever it is isn't working

906
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,720
See, it's bouncing off my chest

907
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,020
Oh, I guess it isn't bouncing off my chest

908
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,560
I know what you're trying to do, Superman

909
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,420
You're trying to make me think like I'm not a man

910
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,380
Well, I'll show you

911
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,680
I'll turn off the kryptonite ray

912
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,240
And I'll beat you with my own bare hands

913
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:21,660
Here

914
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,480
That was your mistake, Luthor

915
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,420
Because my X-ray vision

916
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,720
My X-rated vision reveals that you are indeed a weenie

917
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:28,940
A weenie?

918
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:28,940


919
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,280
I'm not a male chauvinist

920
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,640
I'm not a male chauvinist

921
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,220
Jainer, wake up

922
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,040
You're having a dream

923
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,000
Oh, I'm not a feminist

924
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,020
I'm not a feminist

925
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,900
Oh, I'm sorry, sir

926
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,420
I'm not a feminist

927
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,680
It was all a little switcheroo

928
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,700
It wasn't Jainer dreaming at all

929
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,820
It was a feminist dreaming she was Jainer

930
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,720
And being dominated by a male chauvinist

931
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,000
That was being dominated by a female chauvinist

932
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,540
Now the whip's on the other foot

933
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,660
I'm sorry, Lois

934
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,780
I didn't mean to interrupt you while you were dreaming

935
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,380
But who is this Jainer anyway?

936
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,240
What's he got that I haven't got?

937
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,560
Well, actually, I think it's something along the lines of a long schlong

938
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,700
That's not anything we can say on the radio, Lois

939
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,280
But, you know, you can get away with anything

940
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,960
Well, he calls himself Superman

941
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,440
You're talking to a boy

942
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,360
Hell, I can't be stopped by kryptonite

943
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,260
Birth control pills or anything else

944
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:16,660
A boy?

945
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,240
You're talking about

946
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,140
Well, you must have seen me skinny dipping in cold water

947
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,880
I don't think you're talking to a boy now

948
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,900
Gosh, Miss Lane

949
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,320
Who is this crude character?

950
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,980
He's the man of steel with a rod of iron

951
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,940
But it looks like a hyperbole

952
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,900
A perclesian or something

953
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,600
Well, I'm not saying I'm well endowed or anything like that

954
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,520
What I am trying to say is my dick one time

955
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,940
Hitchhiked down to New Orleans

956
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,540
Got some, come back up here

957
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,580
Now, we can't be doing that on air

958
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,740
We can't be doing that

959
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,240
We can't talk about Richard Nixon

960
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,580
Ain't nobody worth losing show

961
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:48,280
We will not refer to the president Richard Nixon as dick

962
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:48,940
Richard Nixon is president

963
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,140
Don't you know that we're right before the gospel hour

964
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,300
And all those old ladies will get mighty offended

965
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,320
And so I guess we can't say anything about pussy

966
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,240
Oh, my God, turn him down

967
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,560
He's gonna get us to lose our broadcast license

968
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,440
If you listen carefully, you'll find he's gone

969
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,560
Oh, yes, dear friends

970
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,320
Hal and Papa Joe Mama on an old KPFA show

971
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,020
I think you can also hear Janer in the background

972
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,020
It takes Janer a long time to pick up on

973
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,720
That they've switched to Superman

974
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,000
And it's not Star Trek anymore

975
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,360
Before that, Noral Preff

976
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,900
Absolute consistency cut up

977
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,300
And nice lawn asshole

978
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,840
The musical bit was by the Rudy Schwartz Project

979
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,740
And you can get more of the Rudy Schwartz CDs

980
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:39,300
At schwartztone.com

981
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,820
And now, Noral Preff

982
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,960
Rio, one of the most beautiful cities in the world

983
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,000
It's hard to find more gorgeous man anywhere

984
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,460
I came to Rio for man

985
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,860
Absolutely crazy

986
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,040
Man, I heard a lot about it

987
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:58,940
I'm Arnold Schwarzenegger

988
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:58,940


989
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:58,940


990
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,360
Over, over

991
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,960
Everything sexy in the world

992
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,400
One thing I do believe

993
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,780
My favorite body part

994
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:05,700
The ass

995
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,360
Because it's so romantic

996
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,860
I like that

997
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,660
You know something?

998
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,240
Shake it

999
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:12,940
The ass

1000
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,680
Can you teach me a little bit about it?

1001
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,840
Some nice words

1002
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,940
Oh, my God

1003
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,220
Good

1004
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,320
Yes

1005
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,520
This is NBC, the national baby

1006
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,480
That's scouting

1007
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,080
Bubba

1008
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,120
Across the nation

1009
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,920
Boy Scouts are observing boys

1010
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,120
That's scouting

1011
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, O'Reilly, O'Reilly, O'Reilly, O'Reilly

1012
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,160
Ssssssssssssssmear

1013
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,420
American children

1014
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,480
There are no rules

1015
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,580
O'Reilly throwing dirt all over the place

1016
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,480
Every day of my life

1017
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,320
Smear

1018
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,340
Little boys

1019
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,280
There are no rules

1020
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,280
Little boys

1021
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,680
Lick me, lick me, lick, lick, lick, lick

1022
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,940
Do and say pretty much anything

1023
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:58,000
Harm people with vile, no ethics or scruples

1024
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,920
Off the hook!

1025
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,280
The worst

1026
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,020
All bad

1027
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:00,640
Um

1028
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,240
Awful

1029
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,420
Um, um

1030
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,000
Liar, liar, pants on fire

1031
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,560
Yeah, I get that every day

1032
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,800
Liar, liar, pants on fire

1033
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,360
Yeah, I get that every day

1034
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,400
Um, can't even think

1035
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,300
Um, zombies

1036
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,000
Can't even think, can't even think, can't even think

1037
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,620
Nutcase

1038
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,300
Bush orchestrated the 9-11 attacks

1039
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:13,660
Oh!

1040
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,380
Bush orchestrated the 9-11 attacks

1041
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh

1042
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,740
Loony

1043
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,480
You know you're making a good point

1044
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,620
Absolutely valid

1045
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,120
Exactly

1046
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:22,900
Excellent point

1047
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,840
Spit this stuff

1048
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,300
This stuff

1049
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,640
Facts are what they are

1050
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,820
But then what are you, crazy?

1051
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,940
Little boys

1052
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,660
I gotta have them

1053
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,560
Thank you very much

1054
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,880
Me, me, me, me, me, me

1055
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,440
6873515

1056
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,480
Got another caller here taking the bait

1057
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,580
You're on the air

1058
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,960
Uh, yes, I'm just listening to your show

1059
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,760
This is Reverend Magosia

1060
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,180
And I don't appreciate how you talk about Jesus Christ

1061
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:49,320
And then one guy on there, he wants to talk about porn

1062
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,100
If you're gonna talk about Jesus, then keep it all the way Jesus

1063
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,220
Because there are children listening to this radio station

1064
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,900
Well, what are they doing, what are those children doing up this line?

1065
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,880
Jesus and his children

1066
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,300
Aw

1067
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,420
See, what's wrong with these people that hang out so quickly?

1068
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,400
What about Christian pornography?

1069
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:05,600
Yeah

1070
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,840
Uh, my friend Sterno one time, uh, no, it was Legume, I think

1071
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,820
Uh, uh, it posted something, uh, that was offensive to some Christian guy

1072
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,600
On a porno news group

1073
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,060
And this guy gets all upset with Legume for posting this artwork

1074
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,240
And, uh, Legume goes, what the hell are you talking about?

1075
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:28,880
You're Christians and you're regulars on this disgusting porno news group

1076
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,340
And, oh, it turned into this whole defense of, well, just because we're Christians

1077
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,420
That doesn't mean we can't be, you know, uh

1078
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,280
Porn addicts

1079
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,700
Dedicated masturbators, I mean, come on

1080
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:43,500
It was, it was really, uh, boy, they got so mad at Legume

1081
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,080
And they asked him for a picture of himself and he sent a picture of me

1082
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:52,820
And the next thing I knew, my head had been added to all these, uh, gay porno pictures

1083
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,700
That was supposed to be terribly insulting

1084
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,260
That's when, that's when you know you've arrived as a celebrity

1085
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,760
Yeah, I thought I was pretty proud of myself

1086
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:05,560
Actually, I was proud of Dr. Legume, he did a great job of trolling those guys

1087
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,740
You know what, that's, uh, that sounds like one for the books

1088
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,080
I don't know which, uh, news group it was

1089
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,580
I recently looked at a midget porno

1090
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,380
Christian porn, probably

1091
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,900
You know what, I just saw

1092
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,980
This wasn't a Christian midget porno news group

1093
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:25,220
But it was just, I guess, midgets of any religious belief

1094
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,840
Or even atheist midgets

1095
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,460
Engaged in hardcore sex photography

1096
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,000
You know, just, uh, just the other night

1097
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,360
I think it was Friday night

1098
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,300
On, uh, on WVIZ

1099
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,580
There was a show about the lives of little people

1100
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,440
Oh, really?

1101
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,660
They interviewed these people back in like 1981

1102
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,580
And they came back and interviewed them, you know, 25 years later to see how they've turned out

1103
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:54,280
It was, uh, really just like surreal

1104
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,820
Just watching all these, uh, you know, these people

1105
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,440
And, uh, I think it's midget school, but

1106
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,960
Except midget is not an accurate term

1107
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,120
It's not that it's politically incorrect

1108
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,220
It's that it's inaccurate

1109
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:05,120
Right, right, yeah, technically they're all dwarves of different types

1110
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,560
Right, and, uh, and these couples

1111
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,080
Like, you had dwarf couples that had dwarf children

1112
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,380
And they talk about how, like, oh yeah, we've all got this kind of dwarfism

1113
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,260
But, you know, except for this one kid in the family

1114
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,340
You know, one of our kids has this kind of dwarfism instead

1115
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:16,640
Right

1116
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:22,140
Like, and, you know, this one couple talked about how they first, you know, got interested in each other

1117
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:26,820
Because they had the same type of dwarfism that was really rare and, you know, these people would have their own kind of dwarfism

1118
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:26,820


1119
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,820
And they would have their houses modified to, you know, to be for somebody who's three feet tall

1120
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:31,740
Right

1121
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:36,960
And then they had their, their toddler children who were extremely adept at finding their way around the kitchen

1122
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,960
Because at that point, you know, the kitchen is built for somebody that size

1123
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,760
So they just have their normal sized kids go do everything for them

1124
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,000
Right, yeah, there's lots of cases where they'll have normal sized kids

1125
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,280
Yeah

1126
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,460
I've, uh, there was a dwarf guy in my high school

1127
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:54,480
He got, it was maddening to me because he got more than I ever did

1128
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,020
Oh

1129
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,120
He got some

1130
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,100
I say

1131
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:57,400
Yeah

1132
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:10,540
A little bit of radio synesthesia there with host Dr. Sinister from WCSB.org in Cleveland

1133
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:19,800
Before that, we heard the Nutcase Bush by NeuroPref, some Lemur cut-ups and other NeuroPref cut-ups

1134
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,260
And now some more NeuroPref cut-ups

Eastern Europeans, Western Europeans came in and brought a couple of bozos.

Haven't you seen the light?

But you know what, folks?

1270
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,240
We're the ones who are going to die.

00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:20,240

What do I get for it?

1276
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,640
They just don't get it.

1277
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,860
