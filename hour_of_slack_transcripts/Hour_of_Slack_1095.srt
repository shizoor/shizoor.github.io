1
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,720
I can't get no education

2
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,400
Can't step in for major voice control

3
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,500
Bobcats, Bobcats, Bobcats, the Bobcats, Bobcats coming

4
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,460
Oh, the Bobcats are coming, cats and kitties

5
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,240
Big Bobcats

6
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,300
Bobcats, Bobcats, Bobcats fans

7
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,700
Bad, step up, I like the Bobcats

8
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,480
The Bobcats, step up, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad

9
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,760
Bobcat, Bobcat, Bobcat fans

10
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,480
Bobcats, Bobcats coming

11
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,100
Meat, meat, meat, meat, all meat

12
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,240
It's plain arithmetic, when war needs go up

13
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,200
The amount of...

14
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,960
...meat left for civilians goes down

15
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,540
The War Food Administration estimates

16
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,560
That there will be 127 pounds of meat per civilian this year

17
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,700
That's against 143 pounds in 1944

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,660
That's less for us

19
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,960
And that is the number one job of your meat industry

20
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,020
And now back to the...

21
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,980
...so genius

22
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,960
Power of...

23
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,740
...watch

24
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,740
I always sing...

25
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,580
...Don't Fence Me In

26
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,840
This lonesome cowboy dance song

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,100
Don't fence me in

28
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,140
Don't fence me in

29
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,760
Don't fence me in

30
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,640
It was awfully gay

31
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,140
Don't fence me in

32
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,620
There was always conflict

33
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:11,680
I never liked violence

34
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:11,680


35
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:11,680


36
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:11,680


37
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:11,680


38
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:11,680


39
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:11,680


40
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:11,900
The love you got

41
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,820
The love you got

42
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:23,280
Oh, he's got give, too

43
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,300
I know it's foreign

44
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,300


45
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,300


46
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,020
I watched Bwimin Jest

47
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,380
I used to be strong

48
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,180
I Chaoukan 오き

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,800
came out and she was surrounded.

50
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,740
Don Imus came out.

51
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,420
Don Imus came out.

52
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,360
Mr. Imus came out.

53
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,380
Very proud.

54
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,340
Don Imus fired.

55
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,420
Manipulate life in ways that do not respect.

56
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,560
We must continue to work for a culture

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,580
to manipulate life in ways that do not respect

58
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,160
the most vulnerable among us.

59
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,200
The airways can be used to commercialize and mainstream

60
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,600
sexism and racism.

61
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,060
This is about gloating.

62
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,680
It is really in...

63
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,580
Don Imus joining Al-Qaeda.

64
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,120
Conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction.

65
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,300
I guess you have to just worry about that everywhere now.

66
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,180
Don Imus, one of the loudest...

67
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,240
Transmit the smut.

68
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,780
Campaign to clean up the culture.

69
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,700
I really didn't listen to him that much.

70
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,080
Don Imus.

71
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,800
Don Imus.

72
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,020
Don Imus.

73
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,900
Ky convinces the commiee.

74
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,760
I was worried borrowers.

75
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,580
I was worried ?"

76
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,160
But it's burning me and telling

77
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,160


78
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,020

To

82
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,700
That's a pretty good description of the show.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,940
It's a genius ignorant.

84
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,180
Yuck.

85
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,620
Insipid, dull, or uninteresting.

86
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,640
Troglodyte.

87
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,400
Troglodyte.

88
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,180
Benighted.

89
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:10,820
Ignorant.

90
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,560
Troglodyte.

91
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,640
A brutish person.

92
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,840
Old, mildewed, antiquated, run down, or out of date.

93
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,100
Nailing Kenny G securely to the center of your brain.

94
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,040
Keep the power.

95
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,480
Keep the people ignorant.

96
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,420
Ignorant people.

97
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,440
Wow.

98
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,020
Dog.

99
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,040
Is it hot in here or is it me?

100
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,120
Great, wonderful.

101
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,220
I'm not sure.

102
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,460
Get as much fertilizer on you as you possibly can.

103
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,500
Dog.

104
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
To believe anything.

105
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,740
Get freaked out.

106
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,940
Not a new idea.

107
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,060
Vibrate, vibrate.

108
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,380
Motion.

109
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,060
Vibration.

110
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,560
Your finger, your finger, your tongue.

111
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,540
Vibrate, vibrate.

112
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,000
We are Freak, Freak, Freak, Freak, Freak.

113
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,080
Hello and welcome, I'm Bob.

114
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,240
Hello and welcome, I'm Bob.

115
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,980
The law of cult is shit.

116
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,160
I said I am Bob.

117
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,800
The truth is I'm not really Bob.

118
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,120
Bob's not me.

119
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,400
But this isn't Bob.

120
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,600
And money, money, money.

121
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,300
You see, dick.

122
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,400
Intellectual abuse.

123
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,160
Drip, drip.

124
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,580
We, we, we.

125
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,280
Terrible ideas.

126
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,440
You will never make up your mind right now over and over again.

127
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,140
Because they're called products.

128
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,840
Help me.

129
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,940
I want you to help me vibrate.

130
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,160
This is Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

131
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,420
I did ignorant people.

132
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,540
I did ignorant people too.

133
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,060
I've done many ignorant people and they've done me right back squarely between the eyeballs.

134
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:34,440
Norrell Preff did those ignorant people and most of the cuts coming in there, except for the ones that were done by Fernandez and Leamer.

135
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,100
Both quite salacious, salacious artists, or quite salubrious, isn't that the word?

136
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,060
Salubrious.

137
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,120
I've lost my words.

138
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,360
I can't even remember which station I'm at.

139
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,000
I never lose your words, laddy.

140
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,800
If you're trying to find them again.

141
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,320
Is this Dallas or Cleveland?

142
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,080
This is Portland, Stang.

143
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,900
No, no, not Portland.

144
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,360
Oh, man, look at the coffee you're drinking.

145
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,700
Schnout Whistle Cafe?

146
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,100
Come on, man, you're in Portland.

147
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,420
And we're heading for Tacoma tomorrow to have a blast.

148
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:03,980
Ugh.

149
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,720
A literal...

150
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,000
I've had some terrible times in that part of the country.

151
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,340
And a few good ones.

152
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:18,700
It's as bad as Norway when it comes to, like, poking and fondling strangers and, like, trying to barbecue them with little sticks.

153
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,820
Do you like that idea of going to a new town and maybe asking for directions and having people, like...

154
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,260
Point at you and poke you with sticks?

155
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,140
Story of my life, man.

156
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,700
Well, it's the story of every subgenius' life, and that's why we demand recompense from the universe at large.

157
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:44,800
Or it could be the universe minoris, the smaller universe, which is the one lodged at the top of the Bodhis-Larma Karma.

158
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,020
Um, karma.

159
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,380
It's a current that you can actually fly by focusing on.

160
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,140
Did you know that?

161
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,400
Uh, say what?

162
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
By focusing on the karma.

163
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,240
I wasn't focusing. I'm sorry, Dave.

164
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,760
The electromagnetic current in the brain known as karma.

165
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,960
One may be able to fly, as in the days of the ancient rishis.

166
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,060
Can you believe that?

167
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,520
Bob could fly when he was a little kid.

168
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,380
Yeah, but he had such small wings.

169
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,160
Well, he lost the ability when he got old enough to know he wasn't supposed to be able to do that.

170
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,260
But when Bob Dobbs was a tiny child, up until about the age of two...

171
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,540
Oh, I thought you were gonna say 38, yeah.

172
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,660
...he could fly and pass miracles and so forth.

173
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,320
And he even... there's stories that he robbed banks.

174
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,780
The flying cherubic...

175
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,800
A little toddler with a .38 pistol.

176
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,100
...baby with a little pipe in his mouth, flying into banks...

177
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,660
That's so cute to think of.

178
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,980
...and with a gun, and robbing them.

179
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,600
Now, that's possibly apocryphal.

180
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,700
Yeah, did he... let's just put it bluntly...

181
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,540
Stories that they told before the apocalypse.

182
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,820
Let's just put it bluntly. Did he whack any team in?

183
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,340
Did he actually have to shoot his way out of a bunch of pinker teams, so to speak?

184
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,340
Well, you know, those are the...

185
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,740
Those are the...

186
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,640
So to speak?

187
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,140
...voke tales that people like to tell.

188
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
I'm sure it wasn't quite that exciting.

189
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,040
He was like...

190
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,460
He was like, you know, an adolescent pretty boy Floyd.

191
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,060
Well, I think that's what he was...

192
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,880
If he really did rob banks, then that's kind of what he was emulating.

193
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,380
Because this would have been in the 20s.

194
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,220
Oh, yeah, for sure.

195
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,940
He would have been a pretty boy Floyd guy.

196
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,160
And he would have also imagined himself being murdered by the FBI later,

197
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,800
and calling it a shootout.

198
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,380
Well, you know, anything that Bob imagines...

199
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,740
I like to say stuff like that, you know, to stir things up.

200
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,240
Bob doesn't really imagine anything.

201
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,620
They happen as he...

202
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,700
What we would call imagines things, they actually happen.

203
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,320
That also works for God, but believe me, don't mix the two up.

204
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,340
Bob is not really very closely related to the God who created the universe.

205
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,600
He's the God who created slack, which is kind of like the opposite of this universe.

206
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,900
But it's one of the most important cohesive factors and elements in the universe,

207
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,720
well, you know, of relative importance.

208
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,220
It's the...

209
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,380
It's the importance that you...

210
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,080
You...

211
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,600
You...

212
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
You...

213
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,040
Speaking of importance, wasn't there something important that we were supposed to talk about?

214
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,920
Was it the weather?

215
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,980
No, the game?

216
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,580
I don't even know what those teams...

217
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,980
What games those teams play.

218
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,740
A small number of mutants are meeting in a small part of a small area...

219
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,160
That's right!

220
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,300
Somewhere near Austin...

221
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,900
How do you pronounce this word?

222
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,280
Austin, Texas.

223
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:20,840
Right.

224
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,600
In Texas, the state of Texas.

225
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,160
Right near the state of denial.

226
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:30,280
In early May, May 5th, in fact, weekend, there's...

227
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,040
I am getting ready for an event called Tex Day.

228
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,240
Tex Day.

229
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,780
Tex Day 3.

230
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,780
A day to forget.

231
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,220
No, not really.

232
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,140
It's a survival drill, really, because you don't know what day...

233
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, wait, we'll come to that later.

234
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,340
Okay.

235
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,160
But the world is ending any minute now, and we should be ready and should practice by

236
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,540
doing the things that you would do if you thought the world was going to end, right?

237
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,900
Pillage, all the, you know, drink...

238
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,680
Well, when they want you to...

239
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Go crazy, do everything that you were always afraid to do when you thought the world was

240
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,380
going to continue, and you'd get caught.

241
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,900
Well, they once asked me and my girlfriend, do you practice tantra?

242
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,280
And I said, yeah, practice.

243
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,380
We got our little suits with the names on the back and everything, and the numbers and

244
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,260
the whole deal, you know?

245
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,660
We got the sports shoes and everything.

246
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,640
Professional sports tantric.

247
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,780
So if you're going to practice tantra...

248
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,020
Yeah.

249
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:29,160
If you plan to escape this sphere, if you're planning to leave here any time soon when

250
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,880
it's too late to get off for so many of them...

251
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,640
Well, speaking of leaving this planet, as we have...

252
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:45,280
I have this press release, news release, kind of a speech for the subgenius ministers here.

253
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,880
It came from Corey Lee Smith's Unclaimed Mysteries.

254
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But friends, global warming.

255
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,860
Global warming has finally been explained by the pundits.

256
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,700
The sun is getting warmer.

257
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,580
Therefore, we must fight the solar radiation there on the sun so we won't have to fight

258
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,000
it here.

259
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,060
The liberation of the sun will be a cakewalk.

260
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,680
The sunspots will welcome us with parades and flowers.

261
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,960
The prominences will become McDonald's and the flares will provide power to pay for the

262
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,420
liberation.

263
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,000
The lost tribe of solar green energy.

264
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,260
The sun will be our natural allies.

265
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:31,280
Our intelligence indicates that there is nuclear activity hidden in the core.

266
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,840
If we hesitate to invade the sun, it will be too late to save ourselves.

267
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,620
To oppose this fully justified preemptive strike is to embolden the enemy, then to proclaim

268
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,600
your treason.

269
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,780
Death to the sunnies!

270
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,800
Death to the sunnies!

271
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,720
Death to the sunnies!

272
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,520
And the shy-ites who are too shy to fight.

273
00:12:53,740 --> 00:13:03,100
Friends, that news report came from Corey Lee Smith's Unclaimed Mysteries at www.unclaimedmysteries.net.

274
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,220
Keep your head and arms inside the mixer at all times.

275
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,740
That's good advice for a DJ, a radio DJ.

276
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,080
It certainly is.

277
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,660
I think that's a lesson for everyone to learn and know well as we conquer and pass these

278
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,380
next few weeks, Dave.

279
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:19,760
As we pass.

280
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,800
Days, years, and moments learning to solubriate and renunciate each and every battlefield

281
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,540
we cross.

282
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,940
We will pass those fiery gas balls.

283
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,220
We shall pass them into the...

284
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,580
From sun to sun through Outar space.

285
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,720
Outar space, pardon me.

286
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,020
Yep.

287
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,260
We're pronouncing that by this new subgenius fad now is to pronounce everything that ends

288
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,800
with E-R as if it ended with A-R. So you say Outar space.

289
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,360
Oh, yeah.

290
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


291
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


292
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


293
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


294
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


295
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


296
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


297
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


298
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


299
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


300
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


301
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


302
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,360


303
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,300
I see.

304
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:56,620
So if Einstein were perhaps to predilicate upon the idea of setting off a nuclear explosion

305
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,520
somewhere between Earth and the sun, that the atmosphere would explode, would ignite,

306
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:06,420
and all the little atoms and molecules in between would become united in friendship,

307
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,660
harmony, brotherhood, solidarity, and peaceniks.

308
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,360
If only we had more of those many things, friends.

309
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,480
I think we need...

310
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,860
Solidarity, peaceniks.

311
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,080
If everybody was peacenik, why, there'd be no war.

312
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,700
Just think of that.

313
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,140
Except you know there would be.

314
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,180
There'd be somebody going, I'm more of a peacenik than you are.

315
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:24,840
Nuh-uh.

316
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,700
I'm more into peace than you.

317
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,800
I was...

318
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,620
You want to prove it?

319
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,240
Yeah.

320
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,160
Who do you think...

321
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,560
Do you know who you're talking to?

322
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,320
I may laugh at bees and eggs, dude.

323
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,900
That was from something else.

324
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,140
But I was accosted today by...

325
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,100
I wasn't accosted.

326
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:48,620
I was actually extended a warm hand of friendship by a soldier of some kind who you hardly ever

327
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:48,920
see.

328
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,360
And he looked angry at me.

329
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,780
And I was wondering maybe they were sending his units, if he has more than one, back to

330
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,040
the squid zone there.

331
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,580
Maybe that's why he acted so...

332
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:07,440
Well, they don't want soldiers that are jolly and sweet and all sappy.

333
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,020
I'll open the door for you, pal.

334
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,960
Yeah, they want soldiers with blood and guts and veins in their teeth.

335
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,420
Right.

336
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,340
Literally hanging from their teeth.

337
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,440
Well.

338
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,740
I didn't know what to say to the man, so I didn't say anything.

339
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,560
I just hid in the closet and waited for the next thunderclap.

340
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,300
You can say, I support the men in blue.

341
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,500
Or green, or whatever color they were.

342
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,020
You could say that.

343
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,760
You could say, I support my cerebral cortex and the green, blue, and different things

344
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,920
that it has to do with.

345
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,160
I mean, if you want to.

346
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,640
I'm against the war, but I hope you kill them before they kill you, just because.

347
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,400
That is probably the safest thing to say.

348
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:44,620
You couldn't say that.

349
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:44,820
Yeah.

350
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,320
I'm against you having to go there, but since you are going there, kill everyone before

351
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,000
they kill you.

352
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,720
And may God bless you.

353
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,860
Yes, may God bless you and your duties.

354
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,500
I love you, and welcome to the United States Marine Corps.

355
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:05,300
I had a lot more sympathy and understanding for professional shoulders after I edited

356
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:11,220
that film about the war in Vietnam as seen from the Viet Cong point of view.

357
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,900
It was quite frightening.

358
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,800
Yeah, it was quite frightening.

359
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,500
In fact, I was in a clappy-eyed stupor of indolence and sweat for three days after perspiring

360
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,140
through that part.

361
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,760
It actually took me there to donate and untree and all those places.

362
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,200
Yeah.

363
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,520
Think about the guys that had to actually fight it.

364
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,760
All we had to do was edit and write scripts about it after the fact.

365
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,080
I can imagine you guys were written out numerous times by the powers that be.

366
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,960
I was written out because I had flat feet, and I was stamped 4F, even though I was number

367
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,660
30 in the Vietnam lottery.

368
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,240
There you go.

369
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,700
They were about to pack me off to Hamburger Hill, boy.

370
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,180
Yep.

371
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,620
And you know, the funny thing is all those other young Texans that were going through

372
00:16:51,620 --> 00:17:00,400
the draft physical with me, except for one obnoxious hippie besides me, they all seemed

373
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,020
to be pretty eager to go.

374
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,100
They were ready to start marching against the monsters.

375
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,660
Little tiny tanks.

376
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,080
Tiny.

377
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,880
Wait a minute.

378
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,820
Let me sing this song right.

379
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,840
The gargoyles are coming.

380
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,600
Tiny tanks.

381
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,260
Tiny tanks.

382
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,640
Lots of little tiny tanks.

383
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,540
Tiny jets.

384
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,320
Tiny jets.

385
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,840
Lots of little tiny jets.

386
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,560
Maybe only Ooo.

387
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,360
These Utah puns might be good...

388
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,000
Citizen gotta improve.

389
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,020
cle Crossing, 20 years later.

390
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,120
Little tiny jets.

391
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,120


392
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,020
By and by,fer, I will show ya some other pulping a

393
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,240
py.

394
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,140
はい I don't understand the Russian

395
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,520
language.

396
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:44,620
load that word -"large", man I really love how lift it

397
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
does it?

398
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,740
This is the music from Godzilla, by the way.

399
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,920
It's the Godzilla theme.

400
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,040
I had no idea Godzilla was...

401
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,580
That's why I was singing about tiny planes and tiny tanks.

402
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,180
Yeah.

403
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,320
Because it's a guy in a big pajamas fighting the tiny tanks and planes.

404
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,320
Yeah, I thought it was a song about the matriarchs.

405
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,060
You know, the ancient elementals.

406
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,140
Well, sure.

407
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,220
Sure, it could be.

408
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,280
Well, let's go to...

409
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,260
Speaking of Texas,

410
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:15,860
I, you know, since I could stand to benefit from a large crowd showing up at Tex Day,

411
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,240
which I frankly...

412
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,000
That'll never happen.

413
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,940
We did, however, make a video about the Tex Day.

414
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,680
This would be the third Tex Day at Dragon's Wild Ranch,

415
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,860
formerly High Rock Ranch in Red Rock, Texas.

416
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,600
And it's a funny subgenius event.

417
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,620
It's not as big as X Day at Brushwood,

418
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,040
but it looks a lot like X Day at Brushwood,

419
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,580
with not quite as many people.

420
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,960
And we're going to place the soundtrack of the videos,

421
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,960
the edited Tex Day documentary,

422
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,220
which you can look at on YouTube,

423
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,980
if you just do a search for subgenius on YouTube,

424
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,020
or Tex Day.

425
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,680
You'll probably find these.

426
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,660
Actually, the longer version is on Google.

427
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,920
But let us go briefly.

428
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,540
Well, first we need to have a...

429
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,200
You should warn them first, Dane,

430
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,600
that if they get the wrong bit,

431
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,580
bite of this chip type...

432
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,880
No, if they get the wrong one,

433
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,920
there could be serious...

434
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,380
Is there anything serious about it at all?

435
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,140
No.

436
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,160
You won't get no education at Tex Day.

437
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,000
Now a look at some current conditions.

438
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,360
There is a severe sport warthrum

439
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,600
just south of Austin,

440
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,120
all the way down towards Laredo,

441
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,480
and outside of Corpus Christi.

442
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,320
Isolated, severe northern Oklahoma.

443
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,020
In fact, Garfield County,

444
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,140
slowly drifting towards the north.

445
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,820
Now there is some New Hampshire lingering in Boston.

446
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,420
Further west, St. Louis,

447
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,760
still pulling towards Reno.

448
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,660
We will continue to see Texas,

449
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,440
which has been emerging out of northern Mexico.

450
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,340
Folks, we've had some nasty Kansas

451
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,920
across portions of Missouri.

452
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,260
Thank you.

453
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,460
Thank you all for coming out.

454
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,000
That's my gift.

455
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,640
I'll give you a hug for the future.

456
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,920
Annual Tex Day survival drill and revival.

457
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,100
If the saucers land,

458
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,000
we are not responsible for crushed tents.

459
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,300
Praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob,

460
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,300
praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob,

461
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,840
praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob.

462
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,260
Hey, that's not supposed to happen.

463
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,460
What makes you think it's not supposed to happen?

464
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,460
Hey, this is something to take advantage of, Dave.

465
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,940
We'll take advantage of it.

466
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,320
It's like a messed up...

467
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:35,840
We're an hour right now.

468
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,860
Messed up, uh...

469
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,720
We're taking advantage of it right now.

470
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,380
See, now you forced us to not take it...

471
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:41,880
Here we go.

472
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,560
This is the great groovy Neptune

473
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,500
performing live at Tex Day.

474
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,740
When I start to realize

475
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,480
What till now has been disguised

476
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,600
Keep looking through the sky

477
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,800
That the saucers fly and buy

478
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,760
And maybe by and by

479
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,560
You will see the light

480
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,160
At the end of the pipe

481
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,580
That leads to Bob Dobbs

482
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,500
Bob Dobbs

483
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,820
Talking about the salesman

484
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,760
To the gods

485
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,520
He's still in check

486
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,200
The coffin lid

487
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,280
On the conspiracy

488
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,720
Of normality

489
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,000
Oh, who could it be

490
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,880
But Bob!

491
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,180
Oh, my.

492
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,160
We're getting some strange effects

493
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,040
On this CD player here.

494
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,200
I don't know, uh, quite...

495
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,960
It's not really going.

496
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,060
You can't say it's going.

497
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,100
It's just, um...

498
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,500
Uh-huh.

499
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,600
It's locked in a sphinx.

500
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,540
Stir.

501
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,600
He's crazy about Bob.

502
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,660
He'll pick your pocket.

503
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,640
Yeah.

504
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,060
Yeah.

505
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,280
See, Bob's pretty slick.

506
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,900
He's like the opposite of neutral.

507
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,060
You got, like, good, evil, neutral.

508
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,800
You can have the opposite of neutral.

509
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,720
Slack.

510
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,840
The third edge of the coin, my friend.

511
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,460
There's a three-sided coin to life.

512
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,500
And I choose the...

513
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,000
The slack plane.

514
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,200
I choose the luck plane.

515
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,040
Noise, noise, noise.

516
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,580
There you go.

517
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,840
Raise Bob.

518
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,720
I'll certainly be editing this show.

519
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,900
Oh, what we're hearing now is the theremin

520
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,060
Being played by Sister Decadence's

521
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,000
Breastages.

522
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,060
Yeah, but you cannot hear the boobs.

523
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,140
Or, well, you can imagine in your mind, the...

524
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,140


525
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,140


526
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,680
Breasts.

527
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,600
When I get on the spaceships, I'll have as many boobs as I want.

528
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,960
A fair amount of...

529
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,240
A carpet.

530
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,860
A veritable carpet of boobs.

531
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,220
I'll tell you, legs.

532
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,940
Think of the masturbatory potential.

533
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,100
I was...

534
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,540
You're funny.

535
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,640
You should mention that.

536
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,940
Today might be X Day!

537
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,480
X Day could...

538
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,560
July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m. might be two minutes from now.

539
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,760
Are you ready to meet Bob?

540
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,540
Have you prepared...

541
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,960
Do you have that $30 sub-genius minister's card in your pocket?

542
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,080
Are you going to be left behind going,

543
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,920
Well, I've been lifted up and up.

544
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,040
There's piles of clothes around here on the ground.

545
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,600
I'm laying...

546
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,440
I'm all by myself.

547
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,680
Are you ready to meet...

548
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,540
Have you spent your time wisely?

549
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,640
Or else, have you blown everything off?

550
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,340
Either one.

551
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,700
Because anything else is a waste.

552
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,340
It's...

553
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,380
Well, it's probably a waste anyway, friends.

554
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,160
Well, who was that guy?

555
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,160
That man sounded febrile, if that's the correct word.

556
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,000
He sounded as if...

557
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,720
That was a man of Bob, my friend.

558
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:47,800
Bitten by thousands of spiteful mosquitoes, thousands of wary, angry crustaceans.

559
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,720
Well, now, if I sometimes sound like I have a chip on my shoulder, it may be because there's

560
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,600
only a few of me, and there are millions and millions of that one guy.

561
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,680
Listen to that, man.

562
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,020
My...

563
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,580
This CD is...

564
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:00,780
Well, you sounded...

565
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,140
This was made for this night.

566
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,720
Okay, this is cut...

567
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:03,740
This is cut...

568
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:03,740


569
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:03,740


570
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:03,740


571
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:03,740


572
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:03,740


573
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:03,740


574
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:03,740


575
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:03,740


576
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:03,740


577
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:03,740


578
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,940
I'm going to bring up the other background music.

579
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,540
Well, this was actually making my arm twitch.

580
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,120
So what's up with that?

581
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,360
I think either I have a...

582
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:25,220
This Text Day stuff was burned by myself onto a bad CD, or the CD player itself, the self-same

583
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,520
CD player, just is not in good shape and doesn't like...

584
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,160
You know, this is college radio, and friends, we do have pledge drives for...

585
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,380
I...

586
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,760
For a reason.

587
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,480
We have it for a reason.

588
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,560
We follow the whales around the park for a reason.

589
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,980
Maybe Bob doesn't want us to play the sex...

590
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,600
Grab him their keys.

591
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,680
...at Text Day.

592
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,600
Did I say Sex Day?

593
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,100
Did I say Sex Day?

594
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,120
No, it's Text Day because of Texas.

595
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,160
Even though there is a sex temple...

596
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,120
There is actually...

597
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,580
Dave...

598
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:54,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

599
00:24:55,060 --> 00:25:01,120
There is a sex temple at the site of Text Day, and I've...

600
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,360
To tell the truth, I've been afraid to go in there.

601
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:03,360


602
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,100
When there was anybody else in there.

603
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,520
So is it widely copulated by copulating copulators?

604
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,640
I mean, you walk up to this temple and you say, may I be sexed, or is it just...

605
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,620
He's like looking at the Belgian Museum of Neural Wax, you know, the artifacts of the

606
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,400
auto-erotics.

607
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,320
You know, what is it like?

608
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,500
You just said, there's a sex temple.

609
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,160
Well, I'll tell you...

610
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,980
You know, everybody automatically in radio land goes, oh, oh, there's a sex temple.

611
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,120
I must go.

612
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,360
Yeah, I know.

613
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,880
You envision this thing that looks like the Taj Mahal and it's full of water beds.

614
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,240
Right.

615
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:37,320
And actually, it's a bunch of tarps wrapped around trees to fence off an area, a clearing,

616
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,240
where there are...

617
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,980
Where the trees can have sex?

618
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,940
These sort of like gynecological looking chairs, these like massage tables and things,

619
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:55,140
and I guess cots and stuff, where I guess some of the people who go to this campground

620
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,620
have...

621
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,560
I don't want to say it because...

622
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,580
Gynecological sex?

623
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,340
Text.

624
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:01,620
Text.

625
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,720
Let's just say text.

626
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,640
They have text.

627
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,880
Well, there's been a lot of school text...

628
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,820
Sex days?

629
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,660
...scandals lately.

630
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,060
If you noticed in the news, there's all the elementary school kids and principals and

631
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,480
teachers all over the country apparently having texts...

632
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,040
At all times with each other.

633
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,220
Yeah, all the time.

634
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,400
Or every other thing they can have it with.

635
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,700
Now, where were they when I was a kid?

636
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:24,820
Well, me too.

637
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,180
I was thinking the same thing.

638
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,360
I was such a young lad for such a long, long time.

639
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,700
How long were you a lad?

640
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,280
A long time.

641
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,620
I never...

642
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,160
I wanted...

643
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,480
Well, I had a crush on Miss Sapson.

644
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,400
I had a crustered...

645
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,260
You had a crustered on Miss Sapson?

646
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,120
I'm not paying attention to you right now because I'm irritated.

647
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,260
I'm sorry.

648
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:53,920
I'm just going to...

649
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,140
I am too, man.

650
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,020
I'm going to be quiet for a...

651
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,340
Wait.

652
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,940
If you think we're irritated, think how the audience feels.

653
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,340
There is no audience.

654
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,340
I'm sorry.

655
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,340


656
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,340


657
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,340


658
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,340


659
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,340


660
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,340


661
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,340


662
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,340


663
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,340


664
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,340


665
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,340


666
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,700
I wouldn't worry about that part of it.

667
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,440
We have bigger problems.

668
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:03,500
There is...

669
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,660
I hear a music coming out of this CD player.

670
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,180
See what I'm saying?

671
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,920
But that's not text day.

672
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,940
I know, but it's...

673
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,420
You didn't even cue it up.

674
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:10,860
It's just...

675
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,020
It's not.

676
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,360
...coming out of the system.

677
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,200
Oh, okay.

678
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,600
Now there's the text day.

679
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
The Texian...

680
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,580
The Texian music.

681
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,620
Well, who's the general of the other army then invading from the north there?

682
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,480
Loke E. Coyote.

683
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,240
Oh.

684
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,260
Loke E. Coyote is the person playing the guitar in the background.

685
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,100
It has a band called Loke.

686
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,460
Loke E. Coyote.

687
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,760
And Loke is also the host of text day.

688
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,320
Oh.

689
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,180
I didn't know that.

690
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,880
Which you can learn more about by going to textday.biz.

691
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,160
Because this isn't just the kind of religion that's into love and saving your soul.

692
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,100
That's...

693
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,100
We provide those services for money.

694
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,100
You see.

695
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,620
Sometimes it's for money.

696
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,500
Sometimes it's for favors and trades.

697
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:56,940
Sometimes it's just for kicks.

698
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,740
Sometimes it's for sick kicks, baby.

699
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,080
We'll save your soul just for kicks.

700
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,080


701
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,080


702
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,080


703
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,980
Just because we're sick.

704
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,900
We'll be sick.

705
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,500
Because we get kind of a weird kick out of saving your soul.

706
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,080
And delivering it into...

707
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,260
We smoke propane.

708
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,420
We drive off a cliff real fast, man.

709
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,880
Get a kick.

710
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,620
This is the great groovy Neptune is playing in the background at text day.

711
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,060
I never knew the gods could play such.

712
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,320
He is no man but a great golden god.

713
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,360
Neptune.

714
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,520
Let alone god of the deep stuff.

715
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,740
I've always thought of the great groovy Neptune.

716
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:35,300
As being a guy with a long beard that lives underwater surrounded in a trident surrounded

717
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,280
by sea monkeys.

718
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:37,980
Oh, okay.

719
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,840
And mermaids.

720
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,700
And those sea monkeys, you know, the kind that have families.

721
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,920
Yeah, they did drive cars.

722
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,380
And the mermaids also did his foreboding.

723
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,320
But as it turns out, the real great groovy Neptune is just these three guys from Texas

724
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,860
and there's no water to be seen for miles.

725
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,120
Yeah, but one of them sleeps in the trunk of a car.

726
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,220
Not a real car.

727
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:09,300
This music in the text day documentary goes with a walk through the mysterious text day

728
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:15,780
woods where there's hippie artwork hanging from all the trees and strange occult mystic

729
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:21,980
symbols and giant owl statues like at the Bohemian Grove where you can like splay out

730
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:28,100
the sacrificial cherbubs and the barbarian fruitcakes and really, you know, the...

731
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,980
Do your ritual.

732
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,120
Everyone loves barbarian fruitcakes, especially after an afternoon of revolting.

733
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,120
Listen.

734
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,780
There it goes again.

735
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,200
Yeah.

736
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,380
It even did it on the top CD player.

737
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,140
Well, I can hear a clicking sound in this.

738
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,700
I think it's the side of my head.

739
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,780
And the funny thing is, it's still timing down.

740
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,680
It's still going like...

741
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,220
Well, it's just literally spitting all those little discrete bits of information which

742
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,040
you've recorded and in which you hope so much...

743
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,740
Oh, here's a song.

744
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,280
I think there's a song.

745
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,740
It's a cute song.

746
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,080
Sounds cute.

747
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,860
And I can talk lay on.

748
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,160
We can pluck a string.

749
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,120
Without a little bob of money corn.

750
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:24,100
Without a little bob of money corn.

751
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,860
Without a little bob...

752
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,680
Bob, bob, bob, bob, bob, bob, bob.

753
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,120
Please don't blink.

754
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,920
Bob, bob.

755
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,400
You're gonna...

756
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:54,080
And when I went to the map, looking for a map.

757
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,840
Looking for a job.

758
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,120
Then I met Bob and he told me no prob, Bob Dobbs.

759
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,140
Oh, Bob Dobbs.

760
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,820
You got me propping in a slag and slagging in a propping, Bob Dobbs.

761
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:12,320
And when I lost all my slack to the cons of tech, Bob came along, told me how to get it

762
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,460
back, Bob Dobbs.

763
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,760
Oh, Bob Dobbs.

764
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,840
You got me propping in a slag and slagging in a propping, Bob Dobbs.

765
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,900
You know I was a wage slave.

766
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,060
I was a wage slave.

767
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,060


768
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,160
I had a one foot in the grain.

769
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,780
Bob came along, showed me how to rent and read, Bob Dobbs.

770
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,120
Oh, Bob Dobbs.

771
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,220
You got me propping in a slag and slagging in a propping, Bob Dobbs.

772
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,000
Wow.

773
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,960
That was Lopey Coyote.

774
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,720
Very original tune there.

775
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,540
Only there's one little difference, Reverend Stank.

776
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,040
The man you call whatever you just call that man's name is not really Bob Dobbs.

777
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:59,540
He's not really a member of the Hunan race, but a member of an ultra breed from far beyond

778
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,680
the cosmic register.

779
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,700
Look here on the screen.

780
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,540
It's one of the...

781
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,260
It's a pipe screen.

782
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:05,820
It's awesome.

783
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,960
Awesome stakes us.

784
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,040
That's right.

785
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,160
Austin, Texas, in another dimension.

786
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm shocked and awed.

787
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,880
Awesome stakes us.

788
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,460
And remember your mission when you arrive.

789
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,220
Yes.

790
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,660
If you can remember anything.

791
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,040
As the missionary, I must remember not to remember anything at all of my mission.

792
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,040


793
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,040


794
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,040


795
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,040


796
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,040


797
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,040


798
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,040


799
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,040


800
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,040


801
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,040


802
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,600
Yes, especially if you're an e-missionary.

803
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,640
That means every mission you complete must be a full blown e-mission.

804
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,600
Have you completed enough e-missions?

805
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,480
Oh, there's never enough e-missions.

806
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,780
Then e-mit.

807
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,740
E-mit.

808
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,020
I've already had kids.

809
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,680
E-mit.

810
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,060
Oh, now he's flaccid.

811
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,760
There went another one.

812
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,300
Now there goes three more of them.

813
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,000
Three more little water heads, as Bill Hicks called them.

814
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,460
Sliding down the slide into the big pool.

815
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,020
Yep.

816
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,020


817
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,020


818
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,020


819
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,020


820
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,020


821
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,020


822
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,020


823
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,900
That's where we all ... There's more where they came from.

824
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,960
That's where I came from.

825
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,960
Cyber's not, they call it, back in the old days.

826
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,320
Some of them did anyway.

827
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,240
Anyway, the ones ... You were born of woman, weren't you?

828
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,840
No, I was not of woman born.

829
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,080
Were you one of the new generation?

830
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,440
No.

831
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,660
I thought you were older than that.

832
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,640
Well, I did have to make my own navel.

833
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,240
Is that what you mean?

834
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,160
Much like ham tail or whatever.

835
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,880
Oh, so you were like in between generation before the test tubes.

836
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,440
I actually used a pool cue.

837
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,380
I rubbed the navel areas if I were chalking up.

838
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,020
It worked.

839
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,480
It worked after about three or four years.

840
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,920
Anyway, now I have a navel.

841
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,240
Time to see you talk so long about me having a navel, so let's change the subject.

842
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,700
Yeah.

843
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,880
The subject of iniquity.

844
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,060
There was some other important thing we were going to talk about besides ...

845
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,320
The queen.

846
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,340
... Subgenius Festival.

847
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:39,760
The queen?

848
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:45,120
The British and the Dutch royal queens, many of whom called you up at all hours of

849
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,100
night asking if they can crash at your pad.

850
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,020
The Dutch one anyway.

851
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,280
Oh, especially him.

852
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:50,940
No, her.

853
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,320
Well, what ...

854
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:52,980
Well, the British.

855
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,000
Well, the British.

856
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,000


857
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,840
It depends on whether you're talking about Prince Heinrich or ... I think that's his

858
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,120
name.

859
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,880
Well, see, now you can't tell whether it's a he, his name or her name.

860
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,740
Well, there's the queen and then there's the prince.

861
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,900
Prince and queen yet.

862
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:07,820
He stands to become queen later on.

863
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:13,260
But I think Holland has a queen who rides her bicycle through Amsterdam occasionally

864
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,660
and said that she did inhale once.

865
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,640
Cuculina, bambina.

866
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,840
Yeah, of course.

867
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,460
Of course she inhaled, but it wasn't ...

868
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,860
Although they're crashing down on all that now, you know.

869
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,520
It's not like it used to be.

870
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:32,560
It's now you can legally smoke drugs of certain kinds in the coffee shops, but it's illegal

871
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,040
to transport the drugs to or from the coffee shops, they've decided.

872
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,920
So they've kind of got you coming or going.

873
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:40,760
The legislation ...

874
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,400
As long as you're just sitting there, it's okay.

875
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,060
Yeah.

876
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:49,300
Well, the legislation is getting so bad they may expect a lot of people to expel everything

877
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,840
they've held in all these years.

878
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:56,160
The little stations they're going to put up in every street corner you walk in, you get

879
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,400
your little scan and it tells you how much you've consumed and then you have to exhale

880
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,360
everything you've inhaled over the past 45, 55, 75 years.

881
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,720
Well, that's ... Anybody who comes to work for Subgenius Foundation gets a drug test

882
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,120
too.

883
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:14,040
If you don't pass, we're not going to give you the free drugs in order to be able to

884
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,320
pass the test that we require.

885
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,980
Why does it have to include drinking blood, though, Stan?

886
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,560
Well, I don't understand that part of it.

887
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,380
Why ...

888
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,900
Well, it's to discourage drinking alcohol.

889
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:31,380
We don't really want people drunk on the job at the devivals and stuff, although usually

890
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,000
they are.

891
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,100
I mean, let's be real.

892
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,600
I've been known to do it myself, sure.

893
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:42,980
I'm not Little Miss Goody Clean Shoes or anything, Little Doopoo Pootie Face or anything.

894
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,160
No, not when it comes to drinking a gallon and a half of hemogloboid.

895
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,160


896
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,200
I'm Little Miss Dinky Winky Fine.

897
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,060
No.

898
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,720
No Little Pimper Winks for me.

899
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,140
No.

900
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:50,260
No.

901
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:50,980
Not me.

902
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,440
No, sir.

903
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,720
You won't catch me lipping those nipple bottles outside the pinky face.

904
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,540
Not in the days of glory.

905
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
Not in the days of blood on your neck and hands.

906
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,560
No, sirree.

907
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,340
Not in a hundred years.

908
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:03,960
Bob.

909
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,440
Tips that have touched the bottle shall never brush mine.

910
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,960
Well, unless it's the good stuff.

911
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:19,940
You can mask the flavor of the plasma with perhaps Scott's whiskey or the flavor of a

912
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,060
donut.

913
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,160
I love them.

914
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:21,960
Myself.

915
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,660
I don't love myself as much as I do love them.

916
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:30,420
Well, you know, speaking of love, I've got this song by Loke Coyote called Horn Dog and

917
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,420
Slut Puppy that's a real cute song.

918
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,240
And they fall in love?

919
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:42,600
But, you know, I've burned these CDs to play at the show here, every show, and I've never

920
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,940
had this problem of the stuttering machine.

921
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:46,600
Beep, beep, beep.

922
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:46,600


923
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,040
Beep, beep, beep.

924
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,700
This is an unusual show because I usually have it ready sooner, but when Dave got to

925
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,300
the Slacker Mansion, I was just in the middle of burning the show in a big hurry to rush

926
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,620
out the door, and I had a funny feeling about that CD.

927
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:06,000
I thought, you know, maybe I shouldn't be showing Dave the text-day video while I'm

928
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,340
burning the CD on the same computer.

929
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:07,420
Oh, right.

930
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,480
So all of a sudden it's Bastille Day in everyone's mind, right?

931
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,980
No, that wasn't what I meant.

932
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,540
Oh, okay.

933
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,680
Heidegger's Principle or Schrodinger's Cat.

934
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,940
No, Heidegger's Principle.

935
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,620
I walked into the room and screwed up the machinery, right?

936
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:25,080
That was Vonnegut's cat, and that one turned out to be actually dead after all.

937
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,220
Yeah, after it took too many turns.

938
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,320
Really?

939
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,580
No, it just was cradled in.

940
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,240
It took one ice-nine pill too many.

941
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:37,820
Yeah, yeah.

942
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,860
Yeah, Kurt Vonnegut.

943
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:45,100
For those listening in the future, in our past, Kurt Vonnegut had just recently died,

944
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,840
in the past that we're recording now.

945
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,280
Yeah.

946
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,200
He was actually in Dresden.

947
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,840
Did you know that?

948
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,040
Yeah.

949
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,360
During the billowing of the Fourth World War?

950
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,020
Yeah.

951
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,160
Slaughterhouse-Five is based on his true slips in time.

952
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,080
Yeah.

953
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,020
And he actually had ...

954
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,860
I know how it is.

955
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,480
I had that same problem just before X-Day 98.

956
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,960
I still don't know whether it was the future or the past that I went to.

957
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,420
Oh, well, you went to the ...

958
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,560
I don't know whether to hope it was the future or to hope it was the past.

959
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,340
It was all ...

960
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,740
It was marked aside, the she-poked-the-golf bag, whatever it was.

961
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,480
How did you know?

962
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:17,920
I didn't know.

963
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:17,920


964
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:17,920


965
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:17,920


966
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:17,920


967
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:17,920


968
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:17,940
I didn't know.

969
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:17,960
I didn't know.

970
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:17,960


971
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:17,960


972
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:17,960


973
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:17,960


974
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:17,960


975
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,940
Well, because I was ...

976
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,600
You weren't taught.

977
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,500
You slipped, Dave, so you were one of the agents.

978
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,180
We keep slipping.

979
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:23,900
Mm-hmm.

980
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,020
We can't stop slipping.

981
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,720
I thought ... I fully suspected ...

982
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,040
I'm having a different life and dimensions.

983
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,500
Somebody had to be the agent, the inside agent.

984
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,080
The Agent Smith.

985
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:32,840
I'm on this string now.

986
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,120
Someone of us had to be the Agent Smith.

987
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,420
Who is it going to be?

988
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,420
DeLuca or Smith?

989
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,340
I mean, wait a minute.

990
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:38,780
Uh-oh.

991
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,200
Dick ...

992
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,680
Damn.

993
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:39,900
Dick ...

994
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:47,380
I remember back when plots for that kind of a filament were so simple to write.

995
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:53,120
You'd just sit down and scratch your hirsute parts on a sunny afternoon or a rainy day

996
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,200
with a little bottle of pills and perhaps a razor blade next to it.

997
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,160
No, no, that's ...

998
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,980
But you just ...

999
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,400
Babysitter has sex.

1000
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,540
Babysitter is slain by serial killer.

1001
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,000
Other babysitter doesn't have sex, manages to kill serial killer.

1002
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,680
That was the ... That's the pattern.

1003
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,080
It's one ...

1004
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,300
Boy meets girl, kills girl.

1005
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,500
Boy meets girl, gets killed by other girl.

1006
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,140
Mm-hmm.

1007
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,140
That's the ...

1008
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,820
There's no reinvention.

1009
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,980
Slasher movie ever since Peter, Laurie and Em.

1010
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,860
What can we improve on?

1011
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,260
And ...

1012
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,680
How can we bring dimension to this art?

1013
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,520
It's ... It's ... It's ... I don't know if it can be done.

1014
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:34,400
It all seems to center or the focus seems to be some sort of bug-like creature.

1015
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,440
Maybe one with three or four eyes.

1016
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,580
It has a nuclear or an atomic power.

1017
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:38,660


1018
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:38,660


1019
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:38,660


1020
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:38,660


1021
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:38,660


1022
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:38,660


1023
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:38,660


1024
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:38,660


1025
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:38,660


1026
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:38,660


1027
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,560
Just like the little bean wagons in the old days.

1028
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:46,580
And then, and perhaps on another afternoon like the ones you described, this creature

1029
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:52,660
actually takes over the entire world and one hero and one heroine decide to stop it.

1030
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,740
I think you've been watching too many David ... You've been reading too many David Cronenberg

1031
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,600
movies, Dave.

1032
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,340
I can't ... I can't read them anymore.

1033
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,240
The ...

1034
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:03,960
I tried ...

1035
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,340
That's right.

1036
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,400
I tried to stop, yeah.

1037
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,300
That one that sucked you, that tried to make out with you.

1038
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:08,720
Well, yeah.

1039
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,780
The one where the lips came out of the TV and sucked you in.

1040
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:10,780


1041
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,460
It sucked out part of my temporal ... Well, temporal, I don't know if we believe in time,

1042
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:20,140
but one of my lobes was actually sucked out by one of those furtive creatures.

1043
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,860
Okay.

1044
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,060
I'm going to try ...

1045
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,860
Go ahead.

1046
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,060
I'm going to try to play this next cut on the bad scene.

1047
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,140
Horned dog had horns like a pan.

1048
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,160
Slut pup had a minivan on.

1049
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,600
Oh, yeah.

1050
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,280
Oh, yeah.

1051
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:38,280


1052
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:38,280


1053
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:38,280


1054
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:38,280


1055
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,580
Parked the man in a cozy spot in the parking lot on home.

1056
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,380
Oh, yeah.

1057
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,940
Slut puppy reached for horned dog's whopper.

1058
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,560
He said, having your way, didn't try to stop her.

1059
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,800
She said, extra pickle.

1060
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,100
He said, you're the boss.

1061
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,060
Gave her a taste of a secret.

1062
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:08,280
She said, you're the boss.

1063
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:08,420
He said, you're the boss.

1064
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:08,680
You can't tell me that because my dad's a secret sauce.

1065
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,240
All the customers get food to go.

1066
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,300
Gave horned dog a slut pup standing in a wall.

1067
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,760
They don't tell you everything in school.

1068
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,680
Oh, they teach creationism.

1069
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,620
Oh, they teach evolutionism.

1070
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,600
But they don't tell you where subgeniuses came from.

1071
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,200
What test tube were you spilled from, my friend?

1072
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,560
And what genetic engineering laboratory?

1073
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,100
Good morning, sang.

1074
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:36,920
Thank you.

1075
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,260
I'm young.

1076
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,260


1077
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,260


1078
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,260


1079
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,260


1080
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,260


1081
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,260


1082
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,260


1083
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,260


1084
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,260


1085
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,260


1086
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,260


1087
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,260


1088
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,260


1089
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:38,260


1090
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,780
Her boobs are tired.

1091
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,160
They need a rest.

1092
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,100
Oh, I understand.

1093
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,840
We're slinging them about.

1094
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,720
You're really generous.

1095
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,020
Just like the flying cars,

1096
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,140
we need anti-gravity boob devices.

1097
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:54,920
Yeah.

1098
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,560
They promised me one in 2000.

1099
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,820
I still haven't gotten one.

1100
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,460
Lying version.

1101
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,580
Bush stole it.

1102
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,560
You know what people go?

1103
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,380
Well, they're just puppets of the conspiracy.

1104
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,880
We're all puppets, friends.

1105
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,840
Even the masters of the conspiracy

1106
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,220
are puppets of something.

1107
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,100
We don't know how far up our strings go,

1108
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,260
but I don't see any of you working any puppets now, do I?

1109
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,720
Well, the kid over there.

1110
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,300
Bob says get up!

1111
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,540
Fellas and girls,

1112
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,500
what I have to say will only take a few seconds.

1113
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,320
It's about cleanliness.

1114
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,360
Being clean in mind

1115
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:35,860
is well-adjusted.

1116
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,980
Think clean and keep clean.

1117
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,500
Lack of cleanliness

1118
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,600
is usually a sign of carelessness.

1119
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,260
And carelessness indicates laziness.

1120
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,120
Remember always that

1121
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,780
carelessness and laziness

1122
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,160
lead to the self-genius

1123
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,740
power of

1124
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,760
slush.

1125
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,400
I'd like to thank those of you

1126
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,740
who have donated

1127
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,960
to Evolution I

1128
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,820
irreducible complexity

1129
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,720
irreducible complexity

1130
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,800
personal incredulity

1131
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,360
logically fallacious

1132
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,400
by evolution

1133
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,320
by evolution

1134
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,800
quoting out of context

1135
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,580
dirty rhetorical trick

1136
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,440
by a translucent membrane

1137
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,900
deeper Darwinian evolution

1138
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,500
evolution

1139
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,160
unpleasant side effects

1140
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,560
have pubic hair

1141
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,180
what?

1142
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:25,640
what?

1143
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,600
weird places

1144
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,540
why are we naked?

1145
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,340
well, the

1146
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,880
well, the pubic hair

1147
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,340
sexual pubic hair

1148
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,140
pubic hair

1149
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,520
ready to procreate

1150
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,040
now

1151
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,560
now

1152
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:35,760
now

1153
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,740
now we're naked

1154
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,120
we're naked

1155
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:38,980
so

1156
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,340
why are we

1157
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:40,700
naked?

1158
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,220
naked mole-rat

1159
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,300
the reason for our

1160
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,020
nudity

1161
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,020


1162
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,020
properly manipulated

1163
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,220
meaty muck

1164
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,220
sticky and nasty places

1165
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:48,820
but

1166
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,200
sticking them in

1167
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,860
thick deposits of subcutaneous fat

1168
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,760
existence of pubic hair

1169
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,380
sexual signal

1170
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:56,940
hairier

1171
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:57,360
hairy

1172
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,680
harriers

1173
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,140
harriers

1174
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,200
the jets

1175
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,800
you naked mole-rat you

1176
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,240
the levitating jet route

1177
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,400
you naked mole-rat you

1178
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:05,540
you naked mole-rat you

1179
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:05,540


1180
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,200
I know you use a naked mole rap.

1181
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,600
What was that one song, Snake Pounder,

1182
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,240
Milk's Cerebral Sky from Snots and Whiskey's Woman Dog?

1183
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,560
What is the name of that?

1184
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,160
You know, it was like,

1185
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,840
And they raced on down and clapped his whammy three times.

1186
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,460
You know, something like that.

1187
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:28,860
Well, Dave, you know, I'm not really a musical scholar like you are.

1188
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,780
Four pieces back.

1189
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,000
Oh, a song I played?

1190
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,280
Yeah, with one guitar guy.

1191
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,960
That was Loki Coyote.

1192
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:36,780
Right, Loki Coyote.

1193
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,760
Horned Dog and Puppy and Slut Puppy.

1194
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,280
Horned Dog and Slut Puppy.

1195
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,220
I forgot their names.

1196
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,440
That's all I was asking, really, to reiterate the names.

1197
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:50,800
Yeah, Loki Coyote has several CDs out at wickabilly.com.

1198
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,560
I was trying to remember the name, Wickabilly.

1199
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,520
And that's what, I think that guy plays at Starwood every now and then.

1200
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,960
Sounds like a kind of band that would put a spell on you.

1201
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,060
In fact, he lives in the woven,

1202
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,560
dream hippie bus, which we first encountered at Starwood

1203
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,340
as a place of child labor, I think.

1204
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,360
That was our suspicion.

1205
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,540
It was a hippie bus that we thought might be full of child laborers.

1206
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:24,180
And child rock bands of, like, 13-year-old girl children

1207
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,100
singing salacious songs.

1208
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,780
And it gave us the creeps.

1209
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,340
It turned us into prudes.

1210
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,380
Imagine subgeniuses.

1211
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,260
How bad something would have to be to make a subgenius.

1212
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,480
into a prude, my friend.

1213
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:44,820
Well, actually, I've been, sometimes I see the subgenius behaviors that are so wild and free,

1214
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:49,600
and it makes me realize how thankfully normal I really am.

1215
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,420
Well, what about the subgenius?

1216
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:59,800
The ones that, you know, change their text into another's face and, oh, God, I mean, stuff.

1217
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,080
Radical free expression, I guess, is what it is.

1218
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,260
But, you know, I'm not sure.

1219
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:12,380
I mean, I guess that's supposed to be, you know, cool and everything and radical and free and self.

1220
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,020
And expressive.

1221
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,620
You know, I always end up feeling like Hank Hill.

1222
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:21,180
Not just sounding like him, but, I mean, really feeling him.

1223
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:21,840
I know.

1224
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,700
You tend to look like him when it happens.

1225
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:29,200
When I met him at X Day, I ended up wanting, you know, it's like my inhibitions went down

1226
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,840
and I almost wanted to hug him instead of shake his hand.

1227
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:32,540
Yeah.

1228
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,020
But I'm a Texan.

1229
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,180
And we don't do that.

1230
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:35,780
We don't hug.

1231
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,480
Well.

1232
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:42,920
I've noticed I say that to my pagan Wiccan friends around here and they go, oh, I'm sorry for you.

1233
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:43,640
Well.

1234
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,800
I think my boot's going to put a spell on your ass.

1235
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,540
How about that, buddy?

1236
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,140
You know, but really the hex.

1237
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:51,960
Wicca, Mr. Wicca.

1238
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:58,740
The hex, as you're referring to, it's not really a tool that anyone can use offhandedly.

1239
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,440
And that's the part I don't understand.

1240
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,840
And also, you don't look like the king of the hill after that.

1241
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,560
No, I look like one of the hippie Wicca type or at least an old man.

1242
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:10,140
Yeah.

1243
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:10,540
Yeah.

1244
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,620
No, you look like a post-ejaculatory.

1245
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,820
Oh, now I forgot the word.

1246
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:18,860
Flagella.

1247
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,040
No, like a bonobo monkey or one of the.

1248
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,640
A tired bonobo monkey who's just been doing it too long.

1249
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,760
Trying to braid its own armpit hairs.

1250
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,000
Yeah.

1251
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:27,700
He's worn out.

1252
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,200
He's just like, that's the end of the day.

1253
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,520
Might be the end of everything as far as I know, you know.

1254
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,820
Like an old limp.

1255
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:33,520
Beep.

1256
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:33,780
Beep.

1257
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,000
Beep.

1258
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,200
Beep.

1259
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,260


1260
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,260


1261
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,260


1262
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,260


1263
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,260


1264
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,260


1265
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,260


1266
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:34,580
Beep.

1267
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,260
That's me.

1268
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,200
Yeah.

1269
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,780
I can't be beat anymore.

1270
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,060
You can be stroked.

1271
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:41,960
Yeah.

1272
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:42,800
Perhaps.

1273
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:43,340
Yeah.

1274
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,260
I mean, I wouldn't describe it, but, you know, I've heard that you can actually be brought

1275
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,420
back to life.

1276
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,660
Well, I'm getting on in years.

1277
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,040
Take a lot of stroking.

1278
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,900
You can start any time, Dave.

1279
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,320
I know.

1280
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,760
If you're hitting around at that.

1281
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,480
No, I was just.

1282
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:00,460
You can inch your way over across the station over to where my microphone is.

1283
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,140
No, no.

1284
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,640
You can stroke me if you want.

1285
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,440
No, no, no.

1286
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,060
On my head.

1287
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,760
No, no, no.

1288
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,520
I was just hoping you would elucidate on, you know, the folk knowledge that you're getting.

1289
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,480
You think I'm a loose date?

1290
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,400
No, I think.

1291
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,880
I ask you to stroke my head and you, suddenly you're like, you want to go all the way.

1292
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,020
No, I want to go home.

1293
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,420
Stroke my.

1294
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,940
I want to go home right now.

1295
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,300
Don't blame me.

1296
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,180
Please drive me home.

1297
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,060
I don't blame you, man.

1298
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:25,140
Please drive me home right now or else I'm going to get out of the car and start walking.

1299
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,760
You know, it's not the same without Princess We here.

1300
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,560
Look at us.

1301
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:33,500
Here we've devolved into like trying to pick each other up in the bathroom.

1302
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,200
But just because there's no lady around.

1303
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:36,760
Yeah.

1304
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,220
Those guys are terrible.

1305
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:43,300
Well, that's, you know, John, John Janay said that was the, that's a prison mentality we

1306
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:43,680
have today.

1307
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,180
And we believe we're in a prison right now.

1308
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:52,540
We all believe that we're perhaps reincarnated criminals who've been brought back to, been

1309
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:58,820
resurrected on this planet and this sphere to act out some sort of a cruel game or, or

1310
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,240
perhaps be saved by our own higher, deeper selves.

1311
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:02,740
If we have.

1312
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,440
Prison planet.

1313
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:03,720
Earth.

1314
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,440
Escape from new earth.

1315
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:11,100
Drink three, six, seven, old is on its way as snake Plissken.

1316
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:16,700
You know, did you ever see any of the escape from New York or the sort of satirical sequence?

1317
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:17,800
Yeah.

1318
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,800
I wore an eye patch and I had a game leg for a while.

1319
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:21,140
Yeah.

1320
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:21,520
Yeah.

1321
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:21,960
Right.

1322
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:22,580
On purpose.

1323
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,140
I think Plissken, I thought you were dead.

1324
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:31,420
Well, you know, in, in escape from LA, he refers constantly to a, a meek will in between the

1325
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,520
two films called.

1326
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,740
Escape from Cleveland.

1327
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,500
Cause they're all going, I thought you got killed in Cleveland.

1328
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:42,420
Like after escape from New York, something really bad happened in future Cleveland.

1329
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:48,880
And if LA and New York are penal colonies in the future, what then is Cleveland solitary

1330
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:49,840
confinement?

1331
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,880
If they can't, and they can't, yeah.

1332
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,820
He was in the hole for five weeks.

1333
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,700
Cause I destroyed the LA.

1334
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,900
He talked back to the wardens.

1335
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:01,700
They threw him in the hole Cleveland, but nothing could stop snake Plissken.

1336
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:02,880
Are you ready to come out?

1337
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,080
I see the daylight now.

1338
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,660
The warden, the big warden, the game warden.

1339
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:09,260
Ivan Stang.

1340
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,100
I thought you were dead.

1341
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:10,880
Actually.

1342
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,700
I got one of those.

1343
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,580
I got a, I have a, my space page now.

1344
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,420
And I'm staying.

1345
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,240
I thought you were dead.

1346
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:16,540
Yeah.

1347
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,900
I got a letter from some guy.

1348
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,000
He's like going or an, a my space message.

1349
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:21,720
They call them.

1350
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:28,080
And he's going, if you really are the real life and staying and like, I've been told

1351
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,700
to avoid the sub geniuses online because they're sold out to the.

1352
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,800
Green energy demons.

1353
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,960
You're probably not the real life and staying.

1354
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,420
You shouldn't make a mockery of a great man.

1355
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,980
He's probably dead by now.

1356
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,540
And I wrote him back and said, well, you're right.

1357
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,960
It's really me, but I'm dead.

1358
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:48,900
He said you were a cocky optimist for the spleen eyed energy hogs.

1359
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,100
He was real happy though.

1360
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:51,720
That wrote him back.

1361
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,260
He said he would.

1362
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,380
Maybe somebody said they'd print it out and put it on the refrigerator.

1363
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,000
Cause cause to them, I was a celebrity.

1364
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:58,520
Right.

1365
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,900
Just like you remember that to them?

1366
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:01,600
I'm a celebrity.

1367
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,660
Oh, I remember it.

1368
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,460
I'm made aware of it.

1369
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,220
I remember.

1370
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,180
Did you hear that?

1371
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:06,760
I'm a celebrity.

1372
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:11,440
Actually, I got a letter from somebody wanting to know about the show where you died because

1373
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,800
they'd lost their copy of it and they wanted to know which hour of slack it was that had

1374
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,220
Dave goes to hell.

1375
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:24,200
And it was it's our slack number 748 as opposed to this hour of slack, which is number 1095

1376
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,480
and friends you're listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack, a religious

1377
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:29,840
show.

1378
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,360
You wouldn't think it to hear us talk.

1379
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:31,880
Of course not.

1380
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,020
We'd offer you a hot, moist towelette if we could, but we cannot at this.

1381
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,700
It's against the law.

1382
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,320
Now they give you a towelette test.

1383
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,940
We're members of the church of the subgenius.

1384
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:46,400
And if you want more information about that August assemblage, which gets together every

1385
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,700
August, no July, July 5th, July 5th, kill the world.

1386
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,060
You can look at subgenius.com.

1387
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,560
Subgenius does not have an O in it.

1388
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:00,700
Although there may be a subgeniouse.com that links you.

1389
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,440
There used to be.

1390
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:01,880


1391
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,560
The arm.

1392
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:09,920
Dr. Armand Geddon had set up a subgeniouse.com that just forwarded people to the correct

1393
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,740
one because it was such a common misspelling.

1394
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:17,860
But the true subgenius is spell subgenius with an O.

1395
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,780
But I mean the pure ones.

1396
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:24,380
And the pure spell.com as .com.

1397
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,880
They spell out the dot.

1398
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,600
D-O-T.

1399
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,340
If we could.

1400
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,780
But this is about as quiet.

1401
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:31,860
And what is real?

1402
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:31,860


1403
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,980
Re-articulis.

1404
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:37,140
I guess we both have spiders in our ears now in our elderly times.

1405
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:37,660
Oh yeah.

1406
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:41,140
Dave and I are both getting deaf from listening to each other.

1407
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,360
What's the name of it?

1408
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,120
Again.

1409
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,360
Tinitus.

1410
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,940
Oh I thought you were talking about tuna fish.

1411
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:52,020
Because the tiny little demons inside your ears make this bzzz sound all the time.

1412
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,220
Watch him very carefully.

1413
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:57,020
Look, the little demons are growing in his head.

1414
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,160
Knock, knock, knock.

1415
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,080
I heard that.

1416
00:52:59,080 --> 00:52:59,380
Sorry.

1417
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,300
I forgot.

1418
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:01,860
The little demons.

1419
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:01,860


1420
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:01,860


1421
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,300
Demons are growing in his ear holes.

1422
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:05,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1423
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,360
And now he cannot only hear anything.

1424
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,760
He's only hearing us inside his own brain.

1425
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,360
He's hearing us.

1426
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,280
Us.

1427
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:15,200
Walk to the window.

1428
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,920
Step, whoever you are.

1429
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,440
Look out the window.

1430
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,240
He's not doing it.

1431
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,040
Wait.

1432
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,180
Stand back away.

1433
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,720
Dave's using that expensive filter again.

1434
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,920
Yeah, there's this thing.

1435
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,460
He spent $150 for that special audio filter.

1436
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,020
Off the internet years, too.

1437
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:31,780
Off the internet.

1438
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:36,840
Google, this thing is worth about $4,000 or $5,000 if I could find the right buyer.

1439
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,960
Okay, we have to play the news now.

1440
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:40,880
Yep.

1441
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:41,720
Unfortunately.

1442
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,500
Prepare yourself for the truth.

1443
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,560
Okay, here it is.

1444
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,360
You're cubic hair.

1445
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,980
This is PR.

1446
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,680
PR in Washington serves the military dictatorship that's ruled for decades.

1447
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,280
PR comes from the Supproving Subjects Portal Foundation.

1448
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,000
Online at Supproving Subjects.

1449
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,400
PhD.

1450
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:08,200


1451
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:21,860
And last one from 받아 researcher from the

1452
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:22,400
Control Center in Washington.

1453
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:25,260


1454
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:26,160
I'm Paul già Zirko, and I'm proud of the one.

1455
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:26,160


1456
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,180
eAnd you're watching herkesl monitor on H-çu-o-diests.org.

1457
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:27,180


1458
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,680
but it should end by tonight.

1459
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:29,980
Second Until It's Over

1460
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,000
Air Cups Any wielka

1461
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,980
move into parts of Georgia and South Carolina by tomorrow.

1462
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,840
Among those opposed is Connecticut Democrat Christopher Dodd.

1463
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,840
Last week, Dodd announced he is still without electricity

1464
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:45,240
after a massive Republican lawmakers' plan brought down miles of power lines.

1465
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:49,560
The Labor Department reported today the prices show up in grocery stores.

1466
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:54,880
In the meantime, Columbus business owners destroyed green leafy PR news in Columbus, Ohio.

1467
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,860
In December, 2.5% after an even bigger 6.1% in November.

1468
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,920
That was a moderate 2% jump by nine-tenths of 1%.

1469
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:09,220
Analysts believe further increases or decreases are 1.7%.

1470
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:14,060
For all of 2006, that's 1.1% for its slowest five years.

1471
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,360
On Wall Street 1245666, this is PR News.

1472
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:22,020
A young Chinese journalist has been in China.

1473
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,360
In hemorrhage, local police told state media

1474
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:31,080
that bogus PR news has sent reporters to investigate as well.

1475
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,980
Last week, Chinese rice wound up in China.

1476
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,100
Unfortunately, they're probably, you know, lingering today.

1477
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:41,200
However, Jarek says 300,000 homes and businesses

1478
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,800
are still without sectarian violence to spill over into PR news in Washington.

1479
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,060
In Washington, ah, yes.

1480
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,080
These are the days.

1481
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:54,440
Lost, set adrift in a maddening sea of confusion.

1482
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,760
And dichotomies.

1483
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,380
Things that can't be figured out so easily.

1484
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,800
And the occasional shark.

1485
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,640
Oh, the occasional.

1486
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,560
At occasional times.

1487
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,720
Dichotomies and sharks.

1488
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,380
Huge, huge top feeders.

1489
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,480
Tiny little bottom feeders.

1490
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:08,980
That's me.

1491
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,640
And in-betweener feeders.

1492
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:11,740
And...

1493
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:14,520
What, what, what, what?

1494
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,380
What did, what was God thinking?

1495
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,940
Is there an absolute to blame for all this?

1496
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,700
I think we have bigger fish to fry.

1497
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,100
I don't know who they might be.

1498
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,060
Yeah, but who? Which?

1499
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,220
I guess our own individual soul fish.

1500
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,840
I guess we have to look that way.

1501
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,820
We're not theocrats.

1502
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,720
We're monocrats.

1503
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,160
We're, uh, we're hypocrites.

1504
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,620
Yeah, we're, we're not gonna, we're not gonna practice what we preach.

1505
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,720
Nor are we gonna preach, uh, anything.

1506
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:42,680
Very well, no.

1507
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,540
You know, anything that we might practice.

1508
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:44,940
No.

1509
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,720
But we will practice every day.

1510
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,600
No, and we've been, when we do preach, it's to the saved.

1511
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:50,140
Yeah.

1512
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:50,680
To the choir.

1513
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,140
Well.

1514
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,140
The pew packers.

1515
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,340
The ones who claim they're saved.

1516
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,740
They're just an audience of liars.

1517
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,820
I'm not a solipsist, but I'd be one on television if I could.

1518
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,880
That's what salvation's all about, is being the penultimate liar to yourself.

1519
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:05,940
It is, isn't it?

1520
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,160
To believe what cannot be true.

1521
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:08,840
That's truth.

1522
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,640
That's real faith.

1523
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:17,300
And as Nenslow pointed out, once you believe one thing that can't be true, you can believe anything that can't be true.

1524
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,120
And that's the credo.

1525
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,940
And that explains all rival cults besides the Church of the Subgenius.

1526
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,480
Because we don't believe.

1527
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,380
We don't believe anything we say.

1528
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,480
We don't?

1529
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:31,160
Well, of course, you just said that, but I thought we did.

1530
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:39,020
Yeah, you caught the little, the one little paradox in there that, of course, gives the lie to all of our lies.

1531
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,900
I thought maybe I was the only one.

1532
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:41,720
And it proves that they're actually true.

1533
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:47,560
But we have to dress it up like silliness in order to not end up like our predecessors.

1534
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,100
And look at them.

1535
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,220
Whoever they might be.

1536
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,880
Well, nailed to telephone poles, hanging in little cages.

1537
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:54,800
It was.

1538
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,640
With turning into skeletons in the, you know, creaking wind.

1539
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,200
Yeah, they're hard to wear around your neck, too.

1540
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:06,600
So the people who walk by go, well, I'm not going to make fun of Jesus because I'll end up like that man up in that cage on that wheel.

1541
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,760
Dressed up like a little basket job.

1542
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:13,380
I'm not going to question my betters because I might end up like that.

1543
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,120
I wouldn't.

1544
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,560
And that's why it works, you see.

1545
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,240
Who would question a crucified man?

1546
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,100
You'd only get an agonized reply.

1547
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,280
We don't want to go that way.

1548
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,820
Well, we don't want to go anyway, really.

1549
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,060
But yet we must go because it's about the end of the show, Dave.

1550
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,320
Can't we just be left out of the religious conundrum in every way?

1551
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:36,680
Can't we just kind of like walk out of it and let this church be its own ism?

1552
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,460
Hey, now that's an idea.

1553
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,840
I forget.

1554
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,420
Actually, friends, you already have slack.

1555
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:49,180
You have all the slack you'll ever get.

1556
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,700
And it's more than you could ever possibly use.

1557
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,660
The trick is.

1558
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,460
Figuring out, you know, how to use it.

1559
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,520
Knowing it's there.

1560
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:03,400
Usually, all it takes is to have most of it taken away.

1561
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,620
Then you'll know what your slack was.

1562
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,080
Can I get a praise, Bob?

1563
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,560
Praise Bob!

1564
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:10,480
Bob who?

1565
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:42,740
Alright, all right all right, I guess we're liftin'.

1566
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:43,440
They make the

1567
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:43,440


1568
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:43,440


1569
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:43,440


1570
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:43,440


1571
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:43,440


1572
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,780
the

1573
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:45,780


1574
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,340
this

1575
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:48,600
week,

1576
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:48,600


1577
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:48,600


1578
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:48,600


1579
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:48,600


1580
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:48,580
