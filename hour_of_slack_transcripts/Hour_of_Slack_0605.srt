1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860
I don't deserve to die.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,680
I don't deserve this phone abuse.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,740
So please just stay a while.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,200
Work in a graveyard ship.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,620
Work in a graveyard ship.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,040
Work in a graveyard ship.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,260
Work in a graveyard ship.

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,540
Gosh.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,440
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,900
Hour of Slack.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,400
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,280
I look, I see there's three calls there.

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,960
They're all calling all the way from Bob.

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,340
All right.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,780
Back to Bob.

16
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,180
Bob?

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,360
Back to the pleasure ship.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,240
Please.

19
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,700
Please.

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,640
That was another one of those little toy boxes that Dobbs' voice was recorded for.

21
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:26,320
That's a little known fact about the early career of J.R. Bob Dobbs was his voiceover talent for laugh boxes and other novelty sound doohickeys.

22
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,940
Remember back before the days of chips?

23
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,660
Yes.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,860
Little tiny, like, records inside of them.

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,680
Duma-flotchies?

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,220
Yeah, Duma-flotchies and Duma-floshies.

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,700
What are Duma-flotchies?

28
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,480
What are Duma-flotchies?

29
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,040
I'm sorry I'm so ignorant.

30
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,260
Well, they're just, they're an old recording technique.

31
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,300
They were like little plastic records, like in a Chatty Cathy doll.

32
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:45,940
Like when you're...

33
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,900
Had a tiny record player inside of it.

34
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,040
Yeah.

35
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,720
You insert the records.

36
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,820
It was an ancient computer.

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,440
Yeah.

38
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,120
In a way.

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,480
I heard that if you took some scotch tape and put it over your eyes and then put, like, iron oxide in it and rubbed it on the ground real hard, that it would hurt.

40
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,880
Well, yeah.

41
00:01:59,460 --> 00:01:59,840
Of course.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,460
But that's...

43
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:13,300
Anyway, the point is that, yes, J.R., our guru, our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs, was indeed the voice in that laugh box that goes...

44
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:23,400
And also, he created the answers in the Magic 8-Ball.

45
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,340
And you know those little Halloween...

46
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,580
Yes, you mean yes and no?

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,340
The Valentine's Day candies.

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,860
The little...

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,460
Tiny hearts that have sayings written on them.

50
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:32,760
Kiss me, sweetie.

51
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,620
Yeah, yeah.

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,420
Oh, you kid.

53
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:34,920
Oh.

54
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,240
Dobbs wrote those.

55
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,380
So Bob was an errant copywriter as he traveled through his vagabond?

56
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,280
He was also a script writer for Bazooka Joe bubblegum comics.

57
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,980
For Bazooka Joe, those little strips down there.

58
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,860
He wrote those.

59
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,380
Oh, damn.

60
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,800
And a subgenius, J. Lynch, drew those for several years.

61
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,040
Let's see.

62
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,560
Other early...

63
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,840
Of course, everyone's familiar with Bob's modeling.

64
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,100
Yeah, he did a lot of radio.

65
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,640
He was a model, too?

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,100
Well, of course he was a model.

67
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,520
Like a male, like with the pipe and so forth.

68
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:03,720
Yeah.

69
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,780
And like a cashmere sweater.

70
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,000
Pick up any magazine from the 1940s, 50s, and early 60s.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,780
Pick up any babe.

72
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,380
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,100
You know, Bob.

74
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,180
That's pretty stupid, actually.

75
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,560
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,100
Juvenile.

77
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,140
Well, you need to go that way.

78
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,740
You haven't been reading your prescriptions, have you, Dave?

79
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,660
No, I just thought, you know, that Bob was supposed to be such a sexually charged, highly charged being, you know.

80
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,760
You said pick up any, and I said pick up any.

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:29,980
Yeah.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,060
Yeah, that's great, Dave.

83
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,620
That's good.

84
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,540
I'm glad you're coming to grips with yourself.

85
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,280
Now, please take your hand out of your pocket.

86
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,120
I'm not necessarily coming to grips with myself.

87
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,860
Yeah, I can see what you're hiding behind that guitar.

88
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
You can see it?

89
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,280
Zip up and...

90
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,840
You're about the only person that's ever been able to make out a difference down there.

91
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,780
I got new glasses.

92
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,300
Telescope lenses.

93
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,780
Anyway, x-ray.

94
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,040
X-ray specs, friends.

95
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,580
He did them, too?

96
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,760
Stand in an elevator.

97
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,360
Next time you're in an elevator, whip out your x-ray specs.

98
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,680
I know they don't really work.

99
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,020
But the pinks think they do.

100
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,760
And just glare at people and giggle.

101
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,740
Look them up and down wearing your x-ray specs and just giggle in the elevator.

102
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,440
Man over there.

103
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,800
But either way, friends were...

104
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,960
This is the noise.

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,820
This is the noise, the buzzing in your brain.

106
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,480
Yeah.

107
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,300
What?

108
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,660
But...

109
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,360
Oh, okay.

110
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,400
Thanks.

111
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,040
Sorry, that's not the buzzing in your brain.

112
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:34,900
Thanks, Dave.

113
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,120
We'll be right back.

114
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,420
We'll be right back.

115
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,800
We'll be right back.

116
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:49,920
We'll be right back.

117
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,440
We'll be right back.

118
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,120
We'll be right back.

119
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,260
We'll be right back.

120
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,280
We'll be right back.

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,340
We'll be right back.

122
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,880
I am a clone, I am not alone

123
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,780
I live in a world where the other clones roam

124
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,260
It's your DNA

125
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,240
So just sit around and get stuck

126
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,600
I am a clone, why don't you leave me alone

127
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,420
My DNA

128
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,760
In my plastic world in a fadeaway zone

129
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,480
It's your DNA

130
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,040
It's the only place I call home

131
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,640
I wonder as I wander

132
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,400
Whatever happened to the time

133
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,220
When people could see with their eyes

134
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,160
I wonder as I wander

135
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,460
Down the line

136
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,300
I wonder as I wander

137
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,520
Down the line

138
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,780
I am a clone, I am not alone

139
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:37,780


140
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,320
I, I, I, I

141
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,100
I am a clone, I am not alone

142
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,740
My DNA

143
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,620
I was born in a dome, my power's a throne

144
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,480
It's your DNA

145
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,860
My power's an autochrome

146
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,220
My DNA

147
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,220


148
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,220


149
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,540
I am a clone, I am not alone

150
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,240
We all live in a world of siliconic growth

151
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,780
It's the only place I, I fall

152
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,800
I wonder as I watch

153
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,580
Whatever happened to the time

154
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,560
When people could see with their minds

155
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,720
I wonder as I wander down the line

156
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,840
I wonder as I wander down the line

157
00:07:50,560 --> 00:08:19,320
I wonder as I wander down the line

158
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,220
I am a clone but I won't be for long

159
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,720
My DNA

160
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,220
From inside I planted a little bomb

161
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,180
Is your DNA

162
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,180
To turn everything off once and for all

163
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,200
I am a clone now I'm on the road

164
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,660
From the plastic world in a fadeaway zone

165
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,400
My DNA

166
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,540
If never, I'm never going home

167
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,380
I wonder as I watch

168
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,980
Whatever happened to the time

169
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,900
When people could see with their minds

170
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,040
I wonder as I wander down the line

171
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,280
I wonder as I wander down the line

172
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,940
I wonder as I wander down the line

173
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,760
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder

174
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,920
нesean lining me with

175
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,400
a chain Everyone's tied around my neck

176
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:35,720
And every day You're in my arms

177
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,520
A song for my soul

178
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,620
All my planning

179
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,500
I fingers never come apart

180
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,140
I know for now

181
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,220
You feel for me

182
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,340
You're all I have

183
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,320
I know my listeners

184
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,320


185
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,460
You're the talk

186
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:43,460


187
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:43,740
I'm the rap

188
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:43,740


189
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,280
I'm the energy

190
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,860
I'm the rhythm

191
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,280
In my dream

192
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,080
Even though it seems like my life won't stop

193
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,260
Cowboy Name with all those other people.

194
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:09,880
I was just having errant bee thoughts.

195
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,380
Hey, man, you guys aren't messing with the bees, are you?

196
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,040
Actually, I have been messing with the bees.

197
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,840
I have been messing with, I've got to admit, I've been messing with the bees for a long time.

198
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,540
You've got that smelly smile. You've got that shirt and faraway look.

199
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,640
Covered with honey.

200
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,440
Yeah.

201
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,460
Sticky. Tiny little red bumps all over.

202
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,100
A pollen.

203
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,900
You can tell, can't you?

204
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,480
I've been pollinated.

205
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,320
Takes one to know one.

206
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,420
Yeah, it does.

207
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:44,260
We're just waiting for the old queen to kick off so we can take over the place ourselves and start an anarcho-syndicalist commune.

208
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,780
Oh, what would you guys do without that queen and her huge...

209
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,340
Egg sack pulsating out your little brothers, your endless little, little maggot brothers?

210
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,300
We'd repopulate the insect world with Bob's face populaces of our own kind and our own makings.

211
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:06,460
You know, now, Dave, don't get Bob wrong. He does not want a planet of Bobs.

212
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:15,560
Bob Dobbs, that's what the conspiracy wants, is a planet of all male white salesmen going from place to place, just selling crap to each other.

213
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,140
Yeah, but she should.

214
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,860
That's the conspiracy's view of Bob.

215
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,360
It is.

216
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,260
Bob himself wants only himself.

217
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,560
And millions of babes.

218
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:35,480
Well, and customers. We, his customers. We're not his victims like the Christians are to their god or sheep.

219
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:43,320
But we are customers. It's a deal. It's a covenant. It's a contract.

220
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,480
I thought you said we were frozen custards.

221
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,000
I thought you said that...

222
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,060
At some point in time, some of these beings was gonna huff us all up in some kind of like...

223
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,120
Like our souls is gonna be their queen.

224
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,360
No, no, not custards. Customers. You must have been listening on the internet.

225
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,000
Didn't understand.

226
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:08,920
You missed... You know, it's sad. Kids miss one word. They get one word wrong in the word of Bob and spend the rest of their lives in misery because of it.

227
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,160
Just because they got one word wrong.

228
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,980
Where Bob said, you know, too much is always better than not enough, but it's almost as bad.

229
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,100
You know, they miss that second part of it.

230
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,020
Just because we never...

231
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,280
Never printed that second part.

232
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,580
And they...

233
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,320
They overdose on alcohol and stuff.

234
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:22,980
And it's sad.

235
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,060
But, you know, I believe in evolution and so does Bob and good riddance.

236
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:34,600
The good riddance factor is the most important thing in the death of any pink, poe-bucker or...

237
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,860
Or bad subgenius.

238
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,480
I know that sounds harsh.

239
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,640
May go down harsh on the polished ears of the modernist liberal listeners out there.

240
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,160
But, you know, Bob is not a just god.

241
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,920
But what is Bob?

242
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,080
I thought you said one time he was a hologram to make the words go away.

243
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,980
And then I thought you said another time that Bob was like the trumpet of wisdom from...

244
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,540
From XXX dimension.

245
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,300
Bob is as old as the mountains and as young as the streams, Dave.

246
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,500
And he's as watery as the streams.

247
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,720
And as...

248
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,140
Productive of fluids and...

249
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,620
Little germs.

250
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,340
And things.

251
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,560
Yes, Bob puts out a lot of fluid.

252
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,280
He...

253
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,940
You can be washed in the love of Bob and the pee of Bob, Dave.

254
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,920
You can...

255
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,820
You can be cleansed.

256
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,140
You can...

257
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,440
You can...

258
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:30,700
You...

259
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,740
It's like a river.

260
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,920
It's like...

261
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,040
It's like a river coursing through...

262
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,320
Just up and down your back.

263
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:43,700
It's like when you feel that rocket ride of Bob go up your spine and explode in your brain.

264
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,340
And then you look down and that grab for that old Kleenex...

265
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,080
To wipe up.

266
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,700
You know Bob didn't lie.

267
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,300
You know it was real.

268
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:52,960
What I...

269
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,040
You know that that pledge was worth it.

270
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:06,540
I've heard that some of the mystics, some of the gurus, and some of the swamis in far off land say that Bob's mucous fluids could actually rejuvenate your cells.

271
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,580
Much more so than any of those other progesterone treatments you get on at midnight hours watching them, uh...

272
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,600
Info muscles.

273
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,380
The font of Bob can save.

274
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,340
It can make a rich man poor.

275
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
It can make a...

276
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,180
A harlot clean.

277
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,340
And it can make a...

278
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,960
A square uptight woman into a crazed harlot.

279
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,320
It can...

280
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,200
It can...

281
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,560
It can make a...

282
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:38,840
A dumb-asticated pink boy turn into a smart-asticated subgenius.

283
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,780
I'll be damned.

284
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,020
I don't know if I want to sign up yet or even part with this dirty bucksy.

285
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,260
I was going to get me a bottle of Wild Irish Rose, but you know...

286
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,720
Bob ain't gonna stand between you and that bottle of Wild Irish Rose.

287
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,500
He ain't gonna stand between you and the hangover either.

288
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,600
What you're saying then...

289
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,180
So what you're saying is Bob is...

290
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,280
He's real, man.

291
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,060
He's real.

292
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,100
He's as real as you and me, perhaps.

293
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,260
He's as real as that drunk and he's as real as that hangover.

294
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,020
Yeah, but...

295
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,400
He's the high and the low.

296
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,460
He's the shotgun and the shell and the target.

297
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,060
And the buckshot.

298
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,840
That's some powerful words, buddy.

299
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,300
And the saltpeter.

300
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,620
Where does he dwell?

301
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,440
Where does he abode?

302
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,200
I mean, I'd like some tangible proof someday.

303
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,880
Oh, he lives down the street from me.

304
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,640
From me?

305
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,740
He lives in your postman's mailbox.

306
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,980
He lives in your shoe salesman's shoebox.

307
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,640
Bob lives in your ketchup bottle on your kitchen table.

308
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,640
He lives in every Christmas present you ever got.

309
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,080
He lives in every toy you ever broke.

310
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,520
He lives in the four-leaf clovers.

311
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,080
And the horse...

312
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,180
The lucky horse shoes.

313
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,780
And in Lady Luck's cleavage, he's kind of tucked down in there.

314
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,300
Whew, in the glistening spot.

315
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:53,920
Yeah.

316
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,620
Yeah.

317
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,380
Before you're spinning the BS, buddy.

318
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,700
Oh, Bob, you love me.

319
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,600
It's because Bob...

320
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,520
It's because Bob loves you, Dave.

321
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,940
He loves you.

322
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,860
He gave...

323
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,780
Well, he actually didn't give anything for...

324
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,700
Actually, he doesn't...

325
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:13,560
Actually, I don't think Bob ever mentioned you, but, you know, his love encompasses everything generally.

326
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,680
And you're part of every...

327
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,700
Well, actually, he did come to think of it, he did ask if you could...would not call him anymore.

328
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,320
But...

329
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,080
I didn't know...

330
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,680
If you...as long as you stay out of his hair, he...he loves you...

331
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,040
Yeah, but...

332
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,080
...with an unquestioning love.

333
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,160
Oh, man, but these business ideas, man, they're sure to take off, especially with a man with an eye for the Midwestern market like good old Bob has.

334
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,220
So you're trying to give...you're trying to tell Bob how to sell something?

335
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,600
No, no, no, no.

336
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,620
How to do his business now?

337
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,300
Never would do.

338
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,540
That's like telling God how to do his business.

339
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,520
Tell God how to create his universe.

340
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,800
No, never, never would tell God...

341
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,340
Hey, God, why didn't you create this universe without that pain stuff, huh?

342
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,560
Hey, oh, God, why didn't you create this universe with...couldn't you have left out the death part?

343
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,620
Well, what's wrong with that?

344
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,440
How about...what...what...could you...could you have left out a little bit of that starvation stuff you invented, Lord?

345
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,800
I could use another...

346
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,860
See, you're gonna...you're gonna second-guess Bob now.

347
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,360
Why?

348
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,140
You're gonna tell God how to create the universe.

349
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,200
You're gonna tell Bob how to make a sale.

350
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,680
Don't go telling him that.

351
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,500
How to get those people to pledge to the station.

352
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,160
No, no, no.

353
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,480
You're gonna...you're gonna...you're gonna do Bob's job, okay?

354
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,160
No, no, no.

355
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,920
Okay, here's the pipe.

356
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,700
Here, take it.

357
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:16,940
No.

358
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,240
No.

359
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,180
Oh, and here's the whip.

360
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,080
Here's the crown over all the universe.

361
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:22,640
Wait a minute.

362
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,320
Now you're Bob.

363
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,660
How does it feel?

364
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,420
You still feel like an idiot, don't you?

365
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,160
I feel disembodied.

366
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,800
Now, do you understand?

367
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,900
I feel a bit queer.

368
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,880
I do feel a little picky.

369
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,520
Jeez.

370
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,400
She's looking picky.

371
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,700
Hey, this is pretty cool.

372
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,560
Heh heh.

373
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,460
He likes being Bob.

374
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,600
This is great.

375
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,200
You know, I...I...I feel so stupid I can't even express what I feel.

376
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:50,820
Stupid.

377
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,220
Oh.

378
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,780
Wow, man.

379
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,840
That's so beautiful.

380
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,640
Things are getting dead.

381
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,080
It's time to visit the graveyard.

382
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,080
To look for the shells, inspectors.

383
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,680
And to dance around for the departed.

384
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:07,920
Ready?

385
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,640
Set?

386
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,080
How many of you have ever done it in a graveyard?

387
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,920
Please.

388
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,720
Please.

389
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,440
Do our poem about...

390
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,580
I put an old gal in the graveyard.

391
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,720
Damn her poor soul, she was dead.

392
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,680
The maggots crawled out of her eyeballs and her hair slid off of her head.

393
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,580
After I'd finished my business, I knew I'd committed a sin.

394
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:41,840
So from my pocket I pulled out a straw and sucked out the load I'd shot in.

395
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,140
I'm sorry.

396
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,720
In these days it's easy to have a broken heart.

397
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:07,760
And to think a little poiiiiy has been like this,'ve been like this too.

398
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,640
It's too bad.

399
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:08,720


400
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,560
Well I've only just written songs about it.

401
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,920
And I've not finished anything else but the one from my name book.

402
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,280
I like it.

403
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,400
Well yeah.

404
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:11,400


405
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:11,680
Maiôe.

406
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,620
Goodbye

407
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,260
I don't deserve to die

408
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,060
I don't deserve this fall of you

409
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,880
So please just stay a while

410
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,320
Working a graveyard shift

I'm standing

417
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:08,900
I'm standing

418
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:08,900


419
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,140
in white light

420
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,240
I have no clue

421
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,340
to help me through

422
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,020
So please just

00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,560

Working a graveyard shift

425
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,100
Working a graveyard shift

426
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,340
Working a graveyard shift

427
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,560
Working a graveyard shift

428

432
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:13,420


433
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,980
I was working the graveyard shit

434
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,220
late one Sunday night

435
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,060
keeping an eye on the trains

436
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,640
making sure everything was uptight

437
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,180
keeping a close eye

438
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,780
back beat on the 409

439
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,540
making sure the trains

440
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,780
didn't run on time

441
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,100
I looked off in the cold distance

442
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,100
and what did I see

443
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,560
It looked like a solitary headlight

444
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,500
coming after me

445
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,680
coming to take me away, yeah

446
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,280
I miss the dark

447
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,580
Secret darkness around me

448
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,200

449
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:51,160
I miss the dark

450
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:14,860
I miss the dark

451
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:50,340
I miss the dark

452
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:37,180
I miss the dark

453
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:56,800

454
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:16,480

463
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,420

This entire planet.

Well, friends, it's because there's a war on and we've got a war to fight.

523

We've got to support our soldiers against the Martians.

00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,920
We must defend Earth.

Department of Energy and Defense Department are going to start building a bunch of Chernobyls across the United States.

Then I heard Chernobyl's not really over now. All these people are dying.

547
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,060
All the underground aquifers are connected so we're getting two.

548
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,560
Yeah, we're getting two.

549
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:40,000
Then I wondered, how come my movements get so jerky like jerky?

550
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,900
Four, two, one, go!

551
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:54,360
The iodine, the 131, has got my thyroid on the run.

552
00:33:54,420 --> 00:34:00,120
And the krypton, 885, is making it hard just to stay alive.

553
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,540
It's making it hard just to stay alive.

554
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:06,380
But the iodine, the 131, the iodine, the 131,

555
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,060
is no more running through the metal lanes.

556
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,680
No more paper in the woods.

557
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,060
Shake the pony hand of the poison man.

558
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,740
Shake the pony hand of the poison man.

559
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:30,460
Barium, a 248, it's made me sterile, I can't appropriate them.

560
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,240
And the plutonium, a 247,

561
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,160
has told all folks I see in heaven.

562
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:42,240
But the iodine, 131, the iodine, 131,

563
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,880
has no more running through the metal lanes.

564
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,420
No more paper in the woods.

565
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,020
The power of powers and the powers made.

566
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,520
Shake the pony hand of the poison man.

567
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,620
I've heard it!

568
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:11,220
The iodine, the 131, has got my thyroid on the run.

569
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,200
And the krypton, 885, is making it hard just to stay alive.

570
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,140
And the plutonium, the 131, the 131,

571
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,000
has told all folks I see in heaven.

572
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,360
I've heard it!

573
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:18,540
I've heard it!

574
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:24,300
The iodine, the 131, the 131,

575
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:24,600
has got my thyroid on the run.

576
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,460
Outro Music

577
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,280
Yeah, I remember one time he broke out in tears when they gave him the award.

578
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,480
Remember that? It was a little teeny bob.

579
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,440
No, what award was that?

580
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,740
It was a little teeny bob pipe. They said that he was so lax in his duty that he had relaxed.

581
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,260
Festus was a slack master, no doubt.

582
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,620
He was an impromptu slack master, and he was also quite a vegetable.

583
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,720
A vegetable?

584
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,900
Well, you know, after the coma, he never really did come around.

585
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,980
They put him on stilts and walked him up and down.

586
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,920
He was down with a computer thing in the back of his head, but you know he wasn't Festus after that.

587
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,740
He was, you know, P-H-F-E-S-T-U-R or something like that.

588
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,060
You know, I mean, I don't know necessarily if that's really what they would have called him.

589
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,500
But that looks kind of like science fiction way of doing it, don't it?

590
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,840
Like, if you had one of them bits in the back of your head and you were, you know, technically brain dead,

591
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,720
and they put one of them alimite bits in the back of your head and walked you around and your name was Fister,

592
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,960
wouldn't it be better?

593
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,640
I don't know if they called you P-H-F-E-S-T-U-R.

594
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,460
Hey, who the hell's Fister anyway?

595
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,920
Is that the guy on The Addams Family or is that the guy on Gunsmoke?

596
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,580
I think it's both of them.

597
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,640
I think it is, too.

598
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,620
At the same time?

599
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,540
Yes.

600
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,140
Oh, what a magnificent dream.

601
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,320
Oh, what a magnificent dream.

602
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,320
Thank you.

603
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,340
Thank you.

604
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,420
Thank you.

605
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


606
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


607
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


608
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


609
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


610
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


611
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


612
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


613
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


614
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


615
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


616
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


617
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,860
In a bowl of tomato soup.

618
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:31,160
And these Yeti women, I'm telling you where they were built.

619
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,700
I don't mean they were built like a brick, you know what.

620
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,380
Ladling the soup around my shoulders.

621
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:43,680
And a homemade cream of tomato, not from a can, by the way.

622
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:52,560
And also, they were stuffing these feathers in my feet for a pig regalia they were going to have later in the afternoon

623
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,960
as the ships would be leaving.

624
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:53,960


625
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,620
We're circumnavigating Saturn, I guess.

626
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,160
It was going to be a big brouhaha.

627
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,880
Everyone was going to be there.

628
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,480
A prime rib special, of course.

629
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,800
Goulash and pickled pig's feet, I think,

630
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,540
someone was going to wear as a crown.

631
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,300
And in some way, midway during the ceremony,

632
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:18,180
once again, we were all to be treated with this horrific face,

633
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,940
the geezer of Bob J.R. Bonerhead,

634
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,640
who never, ever had his name taken in his veins,

635
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:29,800
but did live through numerous colostomy events,

636
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,400
one of which my son Richard, who was also a paraclassical...

637
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,180
Chaz, I was talking to a young person just the other day,

638
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,040
a young person here in Dallas, Texas,

639
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:50,140
didn't even know that we had had an interplanetary...

640
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,460
interplanetary war at the turn of the century,

641
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,000
in the year 1900.

642
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,500
They thought that was a funny science fiction story

643
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,740
that had been made into a radio show.

644
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,140
Just like declaring war on the planet a couple of weeks back.

645
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,740
Oh, yeah, they don't take this kind of crap seriously.

646
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,320
And the reason they don't is they don't know any history.

647
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,300
You talk to a modern-day high school student or college student,

648
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,360
and, well, sure, they know about the Gulf War.

649
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,400
You know, they remember the Gulf War,

650
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,060
but they don't know about the war in Vietnam,

651
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:25,960
World War II.

652
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,040
They don't know about...

653
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,820
They don't even know we landed on the moon.

654
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,660
And, yeah, no, they don't know that we walked on the moon,

655
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,240
and they don't know that we had a war with the Martians

656
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,100
at the turn of the century.

657
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,920
It just, it kills me.

658
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,520
It's like there's these giant Martian tripod museums

659
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,460
in Baltimore and, I think, there's one in Akron.

660
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,600
They've got one of the damn Martian tripods in Akron.

661
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,820
And the people in Cleveland,

662
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,560
don't even know that we had a war with Mars.

663
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,900
It was, admittedly, it was 90 years ago.

664
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,920
90, exactly, 97 years ago, praise Bob,

665
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,080
that we defeated...

666
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,960
And there's a crashed pyramidal spaceship in Mississippi,

667
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,520
and nobody talks about that either.

668
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,400
Oh, they don't pay any damn attention to it at all.

669

688
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,540
There was a little man

689
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,820
Who ran a two-shot stand

690
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,500
And every day the man would sweep

691
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,580
The water from the busy stream

692
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,560
Seldom said a word

693
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,400
That anybody heard

694
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,260
There was something in his face

695
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,160
Loneliness could not erase

696
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,000
guitar solo

697
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,940
Like a

698
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:11,960
Like a

699
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,120
Like a broken cup

700
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,260
He looked up from his cup

701
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,200
He drank his morning coffee

702
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,640
And wiped the dribble

703
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,980
From his chin

704

705
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,320
All right, let's go.

706
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,760
When his eyes met mine

707
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,660
He made a little wine

708
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,520
Came with an annual joke too

709
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,820
And then he whispered

710
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,540
I hate you

00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:37,840


729
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:37,840


730
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:37,840


731
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:37,840


732
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:37,840


733
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:37,840


734
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:37,840


735
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:37,840


736
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:37,840


737
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:37,840


738
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:37,840


739
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:37,840


740
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:37,840


741
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:37,840


742
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,080
orchestra solo

743
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:38,080


744
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:38,080


745
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:45,420
��

746
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:45,420


747
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,620
What sort of nonsense was he getting on about back here while I was passed out?

748
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,520
Why, that wasn't Dave. That was some passerby.

749
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,920
Was that that little Dave program that spews like Dave?

750
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,080
I guess that was what it was. It was the Dave program, yes.

751
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:24,380
That was Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave version 3.0 beta, like third beta version.

752
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,300
It's buggy. It's real buggy.

753
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:35,300
It crashes a lot, and it'll scramble the other icons on your desktop.

754
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,180
Oh, yeah, something terrible in it.

755
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,740
Where all of a sudden the last five porno pictures that you looked at

756
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,360
will be your desktop pattern.

757
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:49,320
It's kind of embarrassing if you're trying to show your mom your website or whatnot.

758
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,020
For real.

759
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,400
I've never shown my mom my website.

760
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,420
That's one of the most sickest things you ever said on this here airwaves.

761
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,640
One of them.

762
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,560
So I dare you to take a breath for me, Zoom.

763
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:05,420
It's only a matter of time

764
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,820
before the room starts filling with liquid nitrogen

765
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,620
and we go back in our shells.

766
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,620
No, it's not so bad back in our shells.

767
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,200
With that...

768
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:23,280
The liquid nitrogen, of course, it freezes you,

769
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,140
but it feels warm.

770
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,560
It's like being in a cocoon.

771
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,920
And it's just like waking up on a Saturday morning

772
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,440
and rolling over and going back to sleep.

773
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,940
Like sleeping for another five...

774
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:41,720
Getting another five.

775
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:41,720


776
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:41,720


777
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:41,720


778
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,620
Another five minutes in bed.

779
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,040
The only difference is that you're in suspended animation

780
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,180
and that five minutes is really 50 years.

781
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,840
You wake up and all your relatives back on Earth are dead.

782
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,540
You know, but who cares?

783
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:04,000
Because you've got a whole new life ahead of you

784
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,420
on this new colony planet.

785
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,420
And why there are people or creatures,

786
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:14,220
or whatnot, from all over the galaxy

787
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:19,160
also helping to colonize this brave new world.

788
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:25,180
You'll be so used to seeing outlandish life forms

789
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,820
that you'll kind of...

790
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,400
You'll be surprised when you see another human.

791
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:36,220
You'll look across the rodeo stadium or whatnot

792
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:40,260
and on your new colony village and...

793
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:40,980
What?

794
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:41,300
Look!

795
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:41,720
There's a...

796
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,860
Is that another human over there across the...

797
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:44,360
Across...

798
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:44,740
Hey!

799
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,660
Hey, man, you're from Earth, aren't you?

800
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,380
Yeah, man, what kind of place is it?

801
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,000
What kind of...

802
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,020
Hey, hey, where are you from?

803
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,040
You sound like you're from the Northern Hemisphere.

804
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,740
I'm from the Northern Hemisphere, too.

805
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,940
Yeah, the Venusians run the birth and rebirth game.

806
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,320
The Martians torture us in our sleep.

807
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,360
The Saturnians are Saturnine, to say the least.

808
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:09,760
And let's just say the Jupiterians ain't so jovial, bud.

809
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,640
Yeah, the Uranus bug...

810
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,760
The Uranus bugs are the worst of all.

811
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,240
Yeah, well, I like them personally, but that's my own prerogative.

812
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,420
Well, that's why we declared war, friends.

813
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,740
We declared war against all the planets.

814
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:25,260
At our tent show meeting just the other night,

815
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,380
Halloween revival, you might say,

816
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,260
we, for the first time, declared war,

817
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,740
literally declared war against all the planets.

818
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,100
Because, you know, as the great...

819
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,700
All the heavenly hosts tell that, man.

820
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,100
As the great sage, Ronald Reagan,

821
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,700
once told the premier of Russia,

822
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:48,160
you know, if aliens from outer space were to invade our world,

823
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,900
all the nations would forget our differences and band together.

824
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,100
That's right, Reverend.

825
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:53,860
We'd all...

826
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:56,280
Well, we'd have to, but...

827
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,920
While old Roddy was doing that, of course,

828
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,960
he had already sold the planet out to the greys.

829
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,340
Sign here and here.

830
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,140
Well, paper means nothing to them.

831
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,040
But who cares about the greys, man?

832
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,740
The greys are a bunch of punks, pipsqueaks, little bug boys.

833
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,000
Nothing but a bunch of, like...

834
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,080
Shh!

835
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,860
Space clones, they take the meat,

836
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,400
they put them in a mecha-clone,

837
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,740
they put them in the thing and fly them around so they don't croak.

838
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:17,720
Our...

839
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:22,900
Let the Pentagon party with the greys all they want.

840
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,180
Our alien allies are as unto God.

841
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,120
Their spaceships do not crash,

842
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,140
for they do not need spaceships

843
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,720
any more than Bob Dobbs needs brains in his head.

844
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,020
But it's true, friend.

845
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,240
You know, we're gonna be on the escape...

846
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,180
Those of us who've, you know, signed up with Bob,

847
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,440
we're gonna be on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

848
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,960
We'll each have our own fleet of planets.

849
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,500
If that's what we want.

850
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,900
If all you want is a house with a creek behind it, then fine.

851
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,320
If all you want is a mansion and a mall, great.

852
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,600
I've been thinking a small planet myself.

853
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,080
I'm looking for one of them little God's Mansion planets.

854
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,140
Places where you just step in through the door

855
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,900
and everything changes as you wish it.

856
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,320
Yeah.

857
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,580
A whole planet, I mean.

858
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,160
Yeah.

859
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:18,440
Yeah.

860
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:23,100
Everything you want instantly brought to you.

861
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,380
Yeah.

862
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,720
That's what we'll have.

863
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,780
Wheels of gorgonzola cheese

864
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,840
and lovely, nubile young yeti nymphs bringing them to us.

865
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,740
And crackers too, right, Rev?

866
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,320
That's what awaits the subgenius minister.

867
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,840
240 days from now,

868
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,060
when we leave this planet,

869
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,360
and you know, friends, it kind of makes,

870
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,460
now that we're leaving,

871
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,320
as much as we hated Earth,

872
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:50,140
we're getting kind of sentimental now, you know?

873
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,920
It's like graduation's coming up.

874
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,620
We're already signed up for that college.

875
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,840
We're going to leave Ma and Pa.

876
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,400
And they hated us while we were at home.

877
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,980
But, you know, friends,

878
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,440
somebody's got to stay behind to protect them.

879
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,040
You, our little friend,

880
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:19,000
brothers and sisters that didn't spend that extra $30 on Bob,

881
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,740
or that didn't pledge your radio station,

882
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,060
you're going to have to stay behind to protect Mother Earth, friends.

883
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,660
And we promised that when we have,

884
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:30,480
that when we commandeer our battle planets,

885
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,780
when we come back to trash the planet,

886
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,840
we'll just trash the pigs.

887
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,120
We'll just kill the normals.

888
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,980
We'll just set fire to the,

889
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,540
the,

890
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,080
the ugly city.

891
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,000
But we'll leave.

892
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,160
We'll leave.

893
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,480
We'll be kind to our mother.

894
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,540
Mother Earth, friends.

895
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,820
Because when we're on the spaceships,

896
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,260
we won't think about the,

897
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,900
the pollution and all the humans and jobs and stuff.

898
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,540
We'll remember the oceans,

899
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,460
the forests,

900
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,060
the proud cities,

901
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,340
and the fast food restaurants

902
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,820
and comic books and monster movies.

903
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,160
The Moogoo Guypan.

904
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,320
But, friends,

905
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,320
Bob ain't gonna be around to protect you.

906
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,640
The planet's gonna be crawling with aliens.

907
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,880
Are you gonna be brave enough to just say no to the alien threat?

908
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,360
Are you gonna,

909
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,220
are you gonna be willing to take on the job,

910
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,240
become the new stewards and stewardesses over spaceship Earth?

911
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,740
Or Earth Farm 1, or whatever's left of it, friend?

912
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,480
Rev, I was wanting to ask you.

913
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,300
You said the Stinky Pinks is gonna be the only one that's gonna be around.

914
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,140
They're actually gonna be the ones under the tutelage after it's gone.

915
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,700
But they're gonna be roasted.

916
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,560
And then you said that these like, fallen subgeniuses...

917
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,920
The ones it wasn't in the crafts, so to speak?

918
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,180
Yes, the, the subgeniuses, the thousands

919
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,040
of subgeniuses will be left behind.

920
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,600
Who's chosen to stay behind?

921
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,760
And leave the Earth into a farm status?

922
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,520
A status of some-

923
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,560
Well the Earth is a farm.

924
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,640
Earth Farm 1 is what its called by its owners.

925
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,860
What do they grow there?

926
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,260
Human souls.

927
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:07,340
Anguish.

928
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:07,980
Pain.

929
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,220
suffering. That's what's grown here

930
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,280
on Earth Farm 1.

931
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,280
Yes, human souls. They grow as many

932
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,080
as possible. They grow them under

933
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,200
stressful conditions, and

934
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,560
they get high

935
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,280
off the anguish stored in those

936
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,160
souls after they buy

937
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,140
them from Bob.

938
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,160
From Bob? The Archons got

939
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,440
an agribiz going?

940
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,180
For sure, Dave. That's what this

941
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,920
is all about. I knew it!

942
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,800
We're the spuds. I knew it!

943
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,800
The church of the subgenius is the

944
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,460
tractor. I knew it!

945
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,820
My post office box is the sack

946
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,700
into which the spuds are thrown,

947
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,840
thence to be thrown into

948
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,460
the thresher, the compressor,

949
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,940
and extracted, and the souls

950
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,000
are then compressed into these church

951
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,920
air canisters, from which

952
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,840
we occasionally take

953
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,840
what you might call a little pinch off

954
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,960
the church pour box.

955
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,580
Have a hit, Dave.

956
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:04,800
Uh-oh.

957
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,160
Church air

958
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,680
one soul per breath.

959
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:10,360
Oh.

960
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,960
This guy was a little

961
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,660
bit fuzzy

962
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,020
on the inside.

963
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,100
Yeah, it's kind of weird

964
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,220
when you huff a

965
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,840
human soul, you

966
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,880
kind of pick up a trace of

967
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,640
their little watered-down

968
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,660
personality. You wouldn't want to

969
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,820
huff another subgenius soul. I had a

970
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,660
little bit of Jane-er soul once,

971
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,580
just a touch. It was like we...

972
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,880
Oh, man! We had this real, real

973
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,940
pink soul. It was like, hey, man,

974
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,700
let's throw some Jane-er souls into there

975
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,540
and see what happens, and we tried it.

976
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,640
You blended, man? Yeah, it was like, oh, well,

977
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,400
let's just try some... Yeah, I did

978
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,820
some Jane-er souls. That'd be like going down to that

979
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,760
gas pump. I haven't been

980
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,640
able to remember my own phone number

981
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,820
ever since, no matter how

982
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,360
many times I try to learn it.

983
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,880
That's what that... See, friends,

984
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,300
you gotta be careful. Just...

985
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,720
Just say no

986
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,100
to droids.

987
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,720
And just say no to the alien

988
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,200
threat.

989
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,380
Friends, the Earth spirit

990
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,140
is your mother,

991
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,240
Gaia, the great

992
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,840
personality, the living

993
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,120
thing that is the Earth,

994
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,580
which inspired

995
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,140
us, the human and subgenius

996
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,060
races, to create

997
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,860
the great weapons,

998
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,000
nuclear bombs, factories,

999
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,260
which we once...

1000
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,740
We once turned against each other,

1001
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,480
friends, but now that we're leaving,

1002
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,940
we will turn them against the other

1003
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:38,520
planets.

1004
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,160
Symphony!

1005
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,080
Symphony!

1006
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,780
Against all other planets

1007
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,560
except our own.

1008
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,180
Until only

1009
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,820
Mother Earth

1010
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:49,860
remains.

1011
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,800
War against the planets!

1012
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:55,300
War

1013
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,380
against the universe!

1014
00:54:59,220 --> 00:54:59,640
War

1015
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,620
against God

1016
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,620
in the name

1017
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,500
of God!

1018
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,760
In the name of God!

1019
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,720
Yes, in the name of Earth,

1020
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,280
and in the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1021
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,180
I

1022
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,620
hereby declare all

1023
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:20,060
other planets to be designated

1024
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,880
New Earth.

1025
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,260
And as such,

1026
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,740
ours to

1027
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,660
use and trample

1028
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,540
as we see fit.

1029
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,020
And if they resist

1030
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,540
us in the name of

1031
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,620
Bob and the Earth, we shall crush them.

1032
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,220
We shall crush the Martians.

1033
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,460
We shall crush the Venusians.

1034
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,200
We will crush the Jovians.

1035
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,860
We will crush the Skri-Alaq of Saturn's moons.

1036
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,440
And the Uranus bugs.

1037
00:55:54,360 --> 00:56:00,360
The very sun itself we will harness and master the sun.

1038
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,920
We will enslave the sun.

1039
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,220
We will make you pay for light.

1040
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,280
We will bill you for light.

1041
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:13,700
You will thank Bob for the light when the sun rises every morning.

1042
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,000
And we shall bring the 25-hour day.

1043
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,360
And then after that we will go on to Pluto.

1044
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:26,560
We will crush the Plutonians and the Dogmen of Pluto.

1045
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:31,420
We will advance into the stars, to Alpha Centauri, to Tau Ceti and beyond.

1046
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:37,180
And if we cannot conquer a planet, we will destroy it!

1047
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:45,340
If Bob cannot have it all, then no one may have any of it.

1048
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,440
All worlds are none!

1049
00:56:52,800 --> 00:57:01,260
Thank you for watching this film.

1050
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:01,260


1051
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:01,260


1052
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:01,260


1053
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:01,260


1054
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:01,260


1055
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,900
well, you've just seen Yeah.

1056
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,240
and her, the transcribed

1057
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,800
and for the criminally

1058
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:08,560
impaired and the deafness

1059
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,700
of the Reverend Ivan Stain's

1060
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,940
speech on the final days of Earth

1061
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,420
as

1062
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:15,440
recollected

1063
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,840
by Mr. Sturm

1064
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,540
Herman, the realizer

1065
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:22,300
and Jetty Post,

1066
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,600
the producer, and

1067
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,420
Miss Francine Stuit was the

1068
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:27,980
camera person

1069
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,240
and Jane Swath was the

1070
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,020
gaffer.

1071
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,140
And we'll be back with our

1072
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,840
Meet Bob Dobbs series

1073
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,940
and part two

1074
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,920
for the criminally insane also and for

1075
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,820
the hearing impaired.

1076
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,640
A transcribed and previously

1077
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,880
recorded message of the Reverend

1078
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,500
Ivan Stain

1079
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,200
and the

1080
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,560
Paul Reiter.

1081
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:58,000
And now, for the

1082
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,240
news.

1083
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,800
Bob spoke to me using mental

1084
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,420
telepathy.

1085
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,360
Hector Brea told

1086
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,460
Colombian government investigators

1087
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,940
he told me he was a male

1088
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,840
of his species just as I am

1089
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,140
a male of the human species

1090
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,680
but Bob didn't act like

1091
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,480
any male, that's for sure.

1092
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,180
He acted like

1093
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,560
a pansy from another

1094
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,140
planet.

1095
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,740
