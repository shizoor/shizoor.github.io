1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Praise Phil!

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:02,940
Next.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,940
Well friends, it's true. Robert Wisdom probably has the best musical taste of anybody at this whole station.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,380
But unfortunately for all of you, he's leaving and I'm coming in.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,600
I'm going to say more about that Caravan of Dreams thing too.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,200
That's going to open with a short subgenius devival.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,960
Dear friends, yes indeed.

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,420
I need to stick my headphones.

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:38,420
This coming up, just to make a break here from the quality stuff.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,220
This is the worst song in the world I suspect.

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,040
Maybe not, you know, there may be worse.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,700
But, ah yes.

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,040
So where'd it go?

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,520
Why don't I hear it?

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,440
Tape.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,180
Look at this.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, folks, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,660
I just don't know what the...

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,380
Oh, look at that.

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,480
We turn up the output.

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,820
And we're stepping up.

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,760
Oh my gosh.

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,600
Oh my gosh.

24
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:14,940


25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,260
Oh my gosh.

26
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,200
Oh my gosh.

27
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,460
Oh my gosh.

28
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,900
Oh my gosh.

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,180
Oh my gosh.

30
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:32,700
Oh my gosh.

31
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,580
Oh my gosh.

32
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,620
Yeah.

33
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,500
Oh my gosh.

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,280
Oh my gosh.

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,760
Oh my gracias!

36
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:45,760


37
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,260
Oh maやって.

38
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:46,820
Oh ma lo que sé.

39
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:53,160
all'am ocean 및

40
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,180
о

41
00:01:53,160 --> 00:02:09,500
And if it's your time, then the show must go on, baby. Come with me and you will see. We are stepping high. What is the name of our show?

42
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:36,760
We are stepping high.

43
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,720
We are stepping high.

44
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,580
FM in Dallas, Arlington, Fort Worth.

45
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:20,420
I couldn't believe I was in Fort Worth earlier today and could hear the station on my cheesy car radio.

46
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,180
That was an inspiring thing to discover.

47
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,140
Oh, yes, dear friends.

48
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,500
This is another one of those slackless hours of slack.

49
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,920
That job, that job just won't stop.

50
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,300
They never stop, friends.

51
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,800
Oh, yes.

52
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,040
But the power can come for one hour a week.

53
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,880
And, yeah, as I said, just signing off last week, folks.

54
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,360
We were lying about not making any money on that pledge drive.

55
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,060
We actually did really well.

56
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,060
I couldn't believe it.

57
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,660
We raised about a thousand bucks.

58
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,560
And I want every, those of you who pledged had better make good on that thing.

59
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,280
Buddy, I'm telling you.

60
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,660
Because.

61
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,400
Last time they didn't.

62
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:18,160
Tonight's show is going to be a puzzling evidence show, folks.

63
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,400
We'll be right back.

64
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,860
We'll be right back.

65
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,100
We'll be right back.

66
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,060
We'll be right back.

67
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,700
We'll be right back.

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,700
We'll be right back.

69
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:52,580
And yes, indeed, we had some incredible fallout from that last show, that Pledge Drive show.

70
00:04:52,580 --> 00:05:00,000
I know many of you are waiting to hear what happened with my date with the $200 sex change pledger.

71
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,180
It didn't happen.

72
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,160
Praise Bob.

73
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,060
Praise Bob.

74
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,080
It didn't happen.

75
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,780
There was no way it was going to happen.

76
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,280
And I don't think we ever did see that mighty $200 pledge.

77
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,680
So maybe we didn't really make it out.

78
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,940
But we did really good.

79
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,340
And thank you, the money-paying listeners out there.

80
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,280
Oh, yes.

81
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,340
And, boy, we had a hate caller that kept calling all night long.

82
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,660
He refused to turn his radio off.

83
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,420
He just had to listen to that which he hated the most.

84
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,660
And, of course, we had those that loved us.

85
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:42,780
And, in fact, one guy, last week, we actually had to tell him not to give us any money

86
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,880
because he was drunk as can be and wanted to give the station,

87
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,580
because he loved the Hour of Slack so much that night,

88
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,460
he wanted to give us all.

89
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,240
All his worldly goods, all the money in his checkbook.

90
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,420
Praise Bob.

91
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,360
And we talked him out of it.

92
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,280
Can you believe it?

93
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,820
I don't know what came over us.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,860
It was kind of embarrassing, too, because the station manager walked by right in time

95
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,580
to hear Dr. Grant say, no, don't send any money here.

96
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,880
We had a caller who got really upset about playing Lee Harvey Oswald

97
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,780
was a friend of mine by Homer Henderson and the Dal Worthington Garden Boys.

98
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,560
And, see, it's not that we think it's great.

99
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,860
It's not that we think it's great that Kennedy got shot,

100
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,600
although even if we did, it's none of your bizwax.

101
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,360
It's just that we don't think Oswald did it.

102
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,520
But we'll be getting deeper into that subject a little later,

103
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,160
because, as I said, it's the Puzzling Evidence Night.

104
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,060
But, dear friends,

105
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,540
oh, listen to those alien computers chanting,

106
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,440
hammering at each other.

107
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,480
How insipidly stupid.

108
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,780
Well, I can talk.

109
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,460
We've got a subgenius devival coming up, a short one,

110
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,340
at the Caravan of Dreams.

111
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,280
And it's really what it is, is me opening up,

112
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,020
doing an opening sermon and invocation

113
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,940
and healing and sickening ceremony

114
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,540
to open up this Caravan of Dreams performance art show,

115
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,540
if you can imagine.

116
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,920
Oh, we can't have our own church here.

117
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,520
Nay, we've got to have, they have to call it,

118
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,800
quote, performance art, unquote.

119
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,760
But that's this Friday night

120
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,100
at the Caravan of Dreams in Fort Worth.

121
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,980
And I can talk about this,

122
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,440
because even though it costs six bucks to get in,

123
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,220
I'm giving my money, my pay,

124
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,000
all six or seven bucks,

125
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,520
as a donation to KNOA.

126
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,340
And so there's going to be a lot,

127
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,360
I don't see who all, John Hale, a bunch of,

128
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,240
there'd be some weird stuff going on.

129
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,680
But the first, first right off the bat,

130
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,460
eight o'clock at the Caravan of Dreams this Friday night,

131
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,140
Caravan of Dreams in Fort Worth on 312 Houston Street,

132
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,920
right off of I-30.

133
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,000
We're going to start the thing off with a subgenius devival.

134
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,280
It ought to be a pretty good one,

135
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,360
folks, because I'm going to,

136
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,240
I'm going to haul down there the giant six foot bob heads.

137
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,340
And for those few of you who've never actually dazed upon

138
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,260
the mighty visage of our guru,

139
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,520
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

140
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,020
Praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob.

141
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,140
This will be your chance, folks, your big chance.

142
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,740
So not only that.

143
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,320
I went to a very strange place.

144
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,240
It's called the inner zone in outer space.

145
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,340
When I climbed out of my golden spaceship,

146
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,080
I saw many things that would make you flip.

147
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,840
And you'll be seeing many things that will make you flip.

148
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,840
Besides the subgenius half hour,

149
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,180
I mean, we're going to show the subgenius video,

150
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,680
the first 10 minutes of it.

151
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,080
That's two subgenius music video, folks.

152
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,140
The X-rated rap song.

153
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,080
And also, well,

154
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,700
something some of you will be might familiar with.

155
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,980
Also, following the revival is this.

156
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,080
And this is for real folks.

157
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,920
J condom or J cotton,

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,820
depending on what church you go to J cotton and also the song gods.

159
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,160
That's right.

160
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,820
The song gods themselves will play following the subgenius show at this caravan of dreams things.

161
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,740
Also, the show continues on Saturday night.

162
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,320
Now, I'm not going to be there Saturday night,

163
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,580
and I don't believe the song gods are either.

164
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,100
But the producer of the show,

165
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,940
Laney Yarber,

166
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,760
is going to,

167
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,240
she's doing something like it's like the Candace Montgomery story.

168
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:16,520
She was the lady who ax murdered her or her husband's girlfriend a few years back.

169
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,860
And I understand the show involves.

170
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,520
It's a very high tech section.

171
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,960
The Candace Montgomery story,

172
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,740
including a washing machine full of body parts.

173
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:34,120
And I was really glad that this was just another silly dream I've had.

174
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,640
So friends,

175
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,940
you better you better show up at that thing.

176
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,440
Like I said,

177
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,020
it's eight o'clock Friday night at the caravan of dreams.

178
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,680
That's the that's the hippie,

179
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,380
the sort of hippie underground avant garde.

180
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,500
Yeah.

181
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,120
And it's a little bit of a weird performance theater.

182
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,240
You know,

183
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:59,200
they show William Burroughs movies and all kinds of weird stuff over there.

184
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,780
It's a it's a groovy hangout for you kind of beatnik types.

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,500
So the song gods and the subgeniuses and it's going to be a killer show.

186
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,680
Well, we're going to get on,

187
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,360
get on here with things.

188
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,920
I forgot to go pick up my co-host this season.

189
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,240
I'm going to go pick up my co-host.

190
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm going to go pick up my co-host.

191
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,000


192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,280
I turned on the Pee Wee Herman Saturday morning show the other day,

193
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,760
and Bob's face is in the titles of that show.

194
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,960
Not only that,

195
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:44,120
but I want you to listen to this song coming up here and see if you can count the subgenius references in this song by this popular quote,

196
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,900
new wave,

197
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,460
unquote group.

198
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,940
New wave.

199
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,560
Thank you.

200
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,400
Thank you.

201
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,240
Thank you.

202
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,680
Thank you.

203
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,480
Thank you.

204
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,480
Thank you.

205
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:02,480
Thank you.

206
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,920
Thank you.

207
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,840
Thank you.

208
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,980
Thank you.

209
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,700
Thank you.

210
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,680
Thank you.

211
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,920
Thank you.

212
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,960
Thank you.

213
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,780
Thank you.

214
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,980
Thank you.

215
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,200
core' how we speak.

216
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,640
Doug Day hold it right here.

217
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,240
Doug Day hold it right here.

218
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,240


219
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,280
And and.

220
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:21,480
Sir.

221
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:27,360
Huh. If somebody else wants to sink their money into that, that's fine with me.

222
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,860
I don't want to have another Edstock happen here.

223
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,640
I'll tell you what, though, dear friends, that song that I just played,

224
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,340
and normally we don't play stuff like Talking Heads at all the other stations play,

225
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,440
or not on this show that frequently, but that particular song,

226
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,480
and I've got to tell the true story behind that,

227
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,000
because otherwise the credit will get misplaced,

228
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,660
and people will think that we were copying Talking Heads rather than vice versa.

229
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,720
Puzzling evidence, as all of you diehards know,

230
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:05,220
is the secret name of a great subgenius hierarchite in Oakland, California,

231
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,920
whose other code name is Unibrow,

232
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,820
and he's like one of the main hosts and the granddaddy of subgenius taping.

233
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,440
He's also the host of the Less Than an Hour More Than a...

234
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:20,980
No, Less Than an Hour...

235
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,300
Less Than an Hour More Than an Hour anti-show,

236
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,620
which has been running for like four years in Berkeley now.

237
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,260
Subgenius show.

238
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,980
And so I'm going to...

239
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,320
Just because puzzling evidence has gotten more and more puzzling,

240
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,700
we're going to devote this hour to bits from his tapes and from the shows

241
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,540
that he and the mighty radio doctors over there do.

242
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,980
Ah, ha-ha, I just killed that noise with one press.

243
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,940
I just killed that noise with one press of a button.

244
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,040
Uh...

245
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,400
I can't talk without background music.

246
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,420
This is ridiculous.

247
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,820
Ah, yes, dear friends, I feel the power.

248
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,680
I want you to put your gland on the radio and feel that energy

249
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,800
burst up through them wires, up through the flesh tubes,

250
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,640
and into your... into the soul gland at the bottom of your foot.

251
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,420
Ah, yes.

252
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,100
Anyway, yeah, you know, as many of you know,

253
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,100
David Byrne came to Dallas to shoot his movie True Stories.

254
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,560
Now, originally, oh, it was...

255
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,100
There was this whole subgenius revival scene in it.

256
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,700
Well, it wasn't subgenius by name,

257
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,860
but it was based on...

258
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,180
more or less on subgenius shows.

259
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,440
And originally, I was going to...

260
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,180
I was supposed to do an animation sequence

261
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,900
that's shown in the...

262
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,340
background of this revival.

263
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,880
And the Pope of all New York,

264
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,640
Reverend Dr. Dr. Mr. M.D. David N. Meyer,

265
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,060
was supposed to play the preacher.

266
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,820
Well, that was all going well and good

267
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,820
until Hollywood money entered the scene,

268
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,400
and slowly but surely, it fell by the wayside,

269
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,320
except for all the lines and the scripts and the songs.

270
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,080
A few little things cribbed from the mighty book

271
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,560
of the subgenius,

272
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,980
which is no big deal.

273
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,380
Because we've used...

274
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,920
There are quotes from Talking Heads songs

275
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,180
in the book of the subgenius,

276
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,960
but I didn't know they were from Talking Heads.

277
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,520
I didn't know where they were from.

278
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,760
Anyway, I just wanted to get...

279
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,300
You know, I'm...

280
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,980
As Bob said, I am the gun and you are the bullet,

281
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,580
dear friends.

282
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,400
So be ready at any minute

283
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,400
to ram into those who don't give you credit.

284
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,760
Anyway.

285
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,660
I'm not going to ram into you.

286
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,060
Anyway, we're going to get off of this.

287
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,700
I'm going to do a cart here.

288
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,820
You can tell this is one of the highly edited subgenius shows yet,

289
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,240
but it's about to turn into it.

290
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,220
After this cart, we're going to go into

291
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,060
the land of the puzzling evidence show.

292
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,400
It's not just puzzling evidence.

293
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,220
It's the radio show in Berkeley,

294
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,320
which also stars Dr. Howell,

295
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,920
the evil and verbose Dr. Howell,

296
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,140
the crazy Gary Gabrog-Fran,

297
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,100
and the suckling Bob Nelson,

298
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,020
as well as...

299
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,040
Oh, there's so many of these minor celebrities

300
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,900
and giants of the art world,

301
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,420
I could...

302
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,740
But forget it.

303
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,880
Everybody, this is the Nightman calling from KNON 90.9 FM,

304
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,960
the home of rock and roll in Dallas-Fort Worth.

305
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,820
Monday, 7 to 9 p.m.,

306
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,960
we've got Kelly and Elmo bringing you From the Hip.

307
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,680
If you're in Dallas-Fort Worth

308
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,440
and you dig rock and roll music,

309
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,360
alternative rock and roll music,

310
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,880
there's only one place for you to tune to,

311
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,940
and that's KNON 90.9 FM,

312
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,160
the hottest station on the planet Earth.

313
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,180
Right here in Dallas-Fort Worth.

314
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,180
The hottest station on the planet Earth.

315
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,780
Yeah.

316
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,480
All right, here's...

317
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,200
Now, get ready for some...

318
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,000
This is the kind of radio that you've never...

319
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,860
I don't know.

320
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,300
I mean, if you tuned in tonight to listen to music,

321
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,280
you might as well just shut it off, friends,

322
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,080
because this is spoken word

323
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,180
that you're going to have to listen to real close.

324
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,060
You're going to be in a different universe

325
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,680
every 10 seconds.

326
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
For the next...

327
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,640
20 minutes, all right?

328
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,640
And, I mean, this is...

329
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,200
You thought you knew what surrealism was.

330
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,440
You thought you knew what Dada was.

331
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,820
You thought you knew what...

332
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,580
what Bob is.

333
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,760
Sometimes his normal size,

334
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,560
he runs around from radio station to radio station

335
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,740
trying to show you what it is

336
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,540
to talk about the tilting boxcar of Dobbs.

337
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,120
Bob is the real thing.

338
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,920
He came to re-fertilize your sexual preconceptions

339
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,320
to make us all relieve our reincarnality

340
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,640
in the million polyverse combinations we once enjoyed.

341
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,120
Sure, this church drips with machismo irony

342
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,080
with insanely overblown cahones.

343
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,940
This religion isn't for the amalgamation of the sexes,

344
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,040
but it sure is as hell for the divine union of them.

345
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,640
He's Bob.

346
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,300
Bob don't ever change.

347
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,140
He's Bob.

348
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,940
Bob.

349
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,660
Bob.

350
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,400
Bob.

351
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,460


352
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,460


353
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,460


354
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,460


355
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,460


356
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,460


357
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,260
He'll be Bob.

358
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,260
Whenever he lets...

359
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,120
Oh, that Bob is the same.

360
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,780
He's Bob.

361
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,640
Bob.

362
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
Working on the sub-D railroad.

363
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,740
Bob don't ever change.

364
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,500
I've got a hammer down to silver.

365
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,440
He's Bob.

366
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,560
Oh, it's tough hammering these pipes.

367
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,300
Oh, it will be Bob.

368
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,540
His pipe is the bowl with the doddle

369
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,060
that rains on the roof like fire.

370
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,580
Oh, hammer these pipes in the ground.

371
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,040
His neck is...

372
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,980
His skin with the waddle

373
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,660
inflaming folks' desire.

374
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:25,980
He's Bob.

375
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,800
How you learn to sing so good out here?

376
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,380
Just hammering pipes in the ground all day.

377
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,300
Don't make no sense.

378
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,200
Bob don't ever change.

379
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,880
He's Bob.

380
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,840
And he's got luggage with a brain.

381
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,100
Yes, luggage with a brain.

382
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,000
That's what Bob's got.

383
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,960
I first had my experience with Bob at a Bob's Big Boy

384
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,240
on the corner of...

385
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,480
Bellevue Drive in Los Angeles, California in 1959.

386
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:58,740
It changed my life and I became able to open my third nostril

387
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,120
and snort the divine wisdom of the sub-genius.

388
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,720
Every morning before breakfast,

389
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,020
I find it helpful to go into my sternutician room,

390
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,300
as we call them, and sniff up...

391
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,640
Yes, violent sternutician may be...

392
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,060
Named after the famous sternio?

393
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,480
Well, yes, the famous sternio does practice sternutician,

394
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,980
as does everyone who possesses...

395
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,860
...a simple accoutrement of a handkerchief...

396
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,640
...and a head full of ideas that need to be relieved...

397
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,160
...blasted out as it might be.

398
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,720
Subdivide the box brain.

399
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,620
Oh, Bob, with your square little gray brain.

400
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,000
How do you use that thing?

401
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,960
It's hooked up all wrong.

402
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,200
Oh, Bob, what about this rumor that your pipe is a living organism?

403
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,440
Yes, that has invaded your brain and made everything all wrong.

404
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,180
Yeah, what about that Bob grinning malarkey turkey flunky...

405
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,760
What about them aliens, as you say, or us aliens?

406
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,620
We're not aliens.

407
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,500
How about it, Bob?

408
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,900
And who's this anti-Bob?

409
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,880
Some relation of yours?

410
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,940
Some nepotistic cousin on the payroll?

411
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:57,060
We dare to question our supreme epopt, Bob, because we have the freedom within the Church

412
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:01,780
of the Subgenius to question even the basic verities, like whether or not there is a Mokele

413
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,680
Mbembe, whether it's frog-like bellow does echo over the South American or even the African

414
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,260
swamps.

415
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,460
Swamp?

416
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,120
Swamps.

417
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:09,740
Swamps.

418
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,900
Yes, yes, swamps.

419
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,320
Right now, Glass Madness is in that swamp.

420
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,680
Yes, he's gone down to visit Green Hill.

421
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,780
They say the Mokele Mbembe lives in Lake Ukabalabonga, which is only four feet deep,

422
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:18,860
but...

423
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:18,860


424
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:18,860


425
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:18,860


426
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,620
The creature of our consider...

427
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:21,820
Bala.

428
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:21,820


429
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,700
No, Ukabalabonga.

430
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,380
All that rubbish.

431
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,520
These people are eating rubbish.

432
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,040
Let's just keep walking.

433
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,180
That's not stopping us.

434
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,980
Look at the book of Huckabug.

435
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,940
It's a tiny little book.

436
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,040
Oh, yes.

437
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,240
It looks like it's time to go.

438
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,040
Buy the book of the Subgenius from me.

439
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,640
I feel like I'm just screaming.

440
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,120
Yeah, man.

441
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,780
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta get a job!

442
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,020
Get a job!

443
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,500
Get a job!

444
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,460
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta get a job!

445
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,740
Get out of work!

446
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,860
Say something cool!

447
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,320
I'm in a tank in the Navy!

448
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,780
I got a job!

449
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:48,860


450
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:48,860


451
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:48,860


452
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,260
Yes, I got a job!

453
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:53,260


454
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:53,260


455
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,160
You got it!

456
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,700
Daddy!

457
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,460
America is coming!

458
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,960
Yeah, sure.

459
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,860
Well, we'll find out.

460
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,940
Good morning, Safe Muffin.

461
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,000
Hi there.

462
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,300
I was just wondering if you could tell me

463
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:34,620
what those occasional extremely low rumbling sounds

464
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,600
that almost sound like acoustic feedback

465
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,420
coming to my speakers are.

466
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,960
And then it happened.

467
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,480
Affection.

468
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,460
Oh, no!

469
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,600
Look, it's happening!

470
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,320
And he should dabble in his coffee.

471
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,420
Okay, turn down your phone and turn up your mind.

472
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,680
Take off your...

473
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,100
Okay, here we go.

474
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,340
Got it.

475
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:52,940
Dead center.

476
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,520
Well, we're tuning in on you right now.

477
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,780
And there, we're centered.

478
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,840
Oh, okay, we're on lockup.

479
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,400
I die now, my son.

480
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,380
But someday, there will be a man

481
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,920
with something in his mouth from which smoke comes

482
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,520
like the fire on the sacred mountain.

483
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,920
I am weak.

484
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,300
My...

485
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:17,820
My dear son.

486
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,280
But I tell you that this man will be named...

487
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:27,040
Yes, this early misinterpretation of prehistory

488
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,420
predicted the coming of Marlboro Man as a leader in the future.

489
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,060
Marlboro Man operated with these crude stone implements

490
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,620
to pound the tobacco and roll the papers,

491
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,680
which gave his caves and habitations this distinctive odor.

492
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,560
Okay, I suppose that explains it.

493
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:44,860
Thank you.

494
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,560
Thank you.

495
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,600
It's a lot like talking to any tape.

496
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,460
I know it's difficult because I haven't ever called up a radio station before

497
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,100
and talked to just a dumb old tape.

498
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,140
And here it is, an eight-track tape answering yes.

499
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,820
But you can't believe you're talking to an intelligent machine.

500
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,760
I know.

501
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,220
This is your future.

502
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,180
Your phones will act like us very soon.

503
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,440
Bob will massage men.

504
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,900
776-2438.

505
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:13,900
Okay, Bob.

506
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,460
Is that your Bob?

507
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,180
That's right.

508
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:15,640
Yeah.

509
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,160
Not to mention the...

510
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,940
Weasel men.

511
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:24,120
Yes, they're little teeny ones that came over the sands early in the morning without food.

512
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,860
They stole away the picnic baskets and the babies.

513
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,920
They stole away the picnic baskets and the babies.

514
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,300
Don't say babies.

515
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,520
Oh, oops.

516
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,520
Don't we say babies?

517
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:33,840
Oh, no.

518
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,400
Oh, I...

519
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,660
We're giving a mouth-to-mouth perspiration right now.

520
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,860
Hold on a second here.

521
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,500
It's your turn.

522
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:45,960
Oh, man.

523
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,800
Wait.

524
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,620
Wait.

525
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,960
There's a kitty here somewhere.

526
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,260
We're trying to find a kitty.

527
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,540
Next time.

528
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,360
Yes, it's...

529
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,420
You mean that this is one of their May Day and Gardy shows?

530
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,140
No.

531
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,380
I'll tell you what.

532
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,580
We all know this is great.

533
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,600
Hey, look at him.

534
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,340
Hey, what?

535
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,520
We can make him do anything.

536
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,440
We can make him just...

537
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,100
Hey, no, stay.

538
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,920
Hey, then look.

539
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,360
Don't make me do anything.

540
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,840
Yes, of course.

541
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,500
It's just a little too much to swallow, I think.

542
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,340
All radio is dead.

543
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,680
And now the horrible memories are starting to come back.

544
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,620
Oh, the horror, the horror.

545
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,780
The terrible war.

546
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,580
All radio is dead.

547
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,240
Oh, my God.

548
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,300
She still snapped at turntable three, and I'm afraid it's not going to get any better.

549
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,260
Little Dr. Prunto.

550
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,540
Many people talk about Bob, but Bob is not human.

551
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,840
Bob is a complicated robot.

552
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,980
But the music always made me real sad.

553
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:01,920
It was just the Tijuana Bible quotes and all that stuff piled up in my soul.

554
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,800
Not to mention the Tijuana Bible.

555
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,000
Soon I felt guilty about what happened to Herb Albert.

556
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,680
You can't even talk anymore.

557
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,080
They just put Helen, this old speaker's home, I think, or something.

558
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,160
Ask about it, yes.

559
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,860
Give it to me.

560
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,980
Ask about money.

561
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,220
Ask about money.

562
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,860
Yes, Little Hal had grown larger, stupider and older.

563
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,160
And he thought he was on the show.

564
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,720
Yes, we'd say, here, here's a microphone and here's some headphones.

565
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,020
And say something funny.

566
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,280
And Little Hal would come out, and he'd jibber and jabber.

567
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,860
And we'd take the tape.

568
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,200
We wouldn't play that stuff on KPFA.

569
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,480
No, we wouldn't do that.

570
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:41,720
No.

571
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,760
We'd talk about funny stuff.

572
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,020
Only Little Hal in his deranged state would try to do the charge of the light brigade in pig Latin.

573
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,100
Yeah, these auditions can be time-consuming, but necessary.

574
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,640
What are what like?

575
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:12,360
I think the problem is that we're getting a little off the beat track now.

576
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,320
The caller is singing.

577
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,160
He doesn't have a body.

578
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,000
He doesn't have a body.

579
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,920
He doesn't have a body.

580
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:16,920


581
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,720
The bottom line that we're here to talk about, which is, of course, the puzzling evidence

582
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,180
that we present the public with.

583
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,680
The right hand picture shows men of the Nunu Stone Age.

584
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,480
Nunu Stone Age.

585
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,040
Yes, here we are in the Nunu Stone Age.

586
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,400
Yes, I think we should talk more about the Nunu Stone Age and not be distracted by these

587
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,380
tiny callers.

588
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,480
Yes, in the Nunu Age, everybody's going to feel a little bit hinky.

589
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,520
They're not.

590
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:42,580
They're not.

591
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:42,840
He's not.

592
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,740
That's to the difference that one...

593
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,440
Are you interested in the strange and the unusual?

594
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,880
Are you curious by the baffling and the bizarre?

595
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:13,400
If so, you will tune in Thursdays at midnight until 2 a.m. for Radio Soiree.

596
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,620
Allow me to introduce myself.

597
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:24,240
I am the Martian Neon Creature, your masterful controller for those two hours for which you cannot escape.

598
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,700
And you will listen to Radio Soiree Thursdays at midnight until 2 a.m.

599
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,860
Or come under the sudden threat of instant vaporization.

600
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,800
You have been warned.

601
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,000
Woo!

602
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,120
Help me, somebody.

603
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,280
She ain't got no legs.

604
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,360
My legs are on fire.

605
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,260
Pull the lever.

606
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,020
Down you go.

607
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,100
Phase five.

608
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,560
UPS.

609
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,560
Workers find 12 human heads in package.

610
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,180
United Parcel Service employees discovered 12 human heads when they opened a package because it was leaking.

611
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,700
And the FBI is investigating whether any laws were broken.

612
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,080
This newspaper clip was sent in to us, I'm sure, in reference to the...

613
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:22,940
bleeding head of the World Cup golfer split-off schism cult that split off the Church of the Subgenius in Little Rock, Arkansas.

614
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:29,280
Anyway, a doctor in Philadelphia said he shipped the heads to a medical training facility in Colorado.

615
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:35,260
But the county coroner thinks the physician should find another method of shipment.

616
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:43,300
We don't think that personnel of carriers such as UPS should be subjected to having to handle body parts such as heads

617
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,060
without being able to handle the heads.

618
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:49,160
Without being assured they're protected from any type of infectious disease in the handling of these body parts.

619
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,460
These UPS workers were, quote, upset and discomforted by the fact that they'd found these human heads.

620
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:02,560
So, you know, any agency in this country that encounters a dead body or parts of dead bodies that they can't account for

621
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,700
ought to notify the coroner's office, folks.

622
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,460
We've got to identify these things to make sure somebody's not killing somebody.

623
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,040
So, somebody out there, you better be careful.

624
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,420
Speaking of killing somebody, another important piece of puzzling evidence,

625
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:28,200
not only important to Dr. Howell and Gary Gebrogfran and puzzling evidence there in Oakland,

626
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:36,900
but also to all of us here in Dallas, is, of course, the Kennedy performance art piece that was done in Dealey Plaza

627
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,320
oh, so many years ago.

628
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,780
And, well, you know, it's just...

629
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:50,000
In time, can you believe that one man alone could assassinate John Kennedy?

630
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,220
Three leagues ahead.

631
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,800
Look out!

632
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,540
Now, turn on the TV.

633
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,520
Let's relax, Doug.

634
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,420
Thanks for the Dallas magazines about John Kennedy's death.

635
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,580
The fact is, he's not dead yet.

636
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,300
So let's just watch TV, shall we?

637
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,820
The memory banks are discovering...

638
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,640
Makes me feel relaxed.

639
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,460
The memory banks are discovering...

640
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,400
Each one calling out at the top of his voice,

641
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,240
The tyrant is dead!

642
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,800
The tyrant is dead!

643
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,120
Throw off your chains!

644
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,440
Throw off your shackles!

645
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,620
The world is free!

646
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,420
Now you have liberty!

647
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,000
Now the future is yours!

648
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,040
You are now free men!

649
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,380
The tyrant is dead!

650
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,160
Go to the Capitol building!

651
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,820
The great Brutus will tell you all about it!

652
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,340
Well, the people were dumbfounded.

653
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:41,160
It was much as though someone were suddenly to announce that, uh,

654
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,040
Jack Kennedy's best friend had just...

655
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,560
stabbed him.

656
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:44,900
Ah!

657
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,880
No, no, no.

658
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,440
No!

659
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,080
No!

660
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:47,400


661
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:47,960


662
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,180
No!

663
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,480
There is an underlying tension here in Dallas.

664
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,920
It's not something you can put your hand on,

665
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,780
you can see or touch,

666
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,060
but it is here.

667
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,080
Let the newsmen feel it.

668
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,040
They hesitate to leave the press room here in the city hall,

669
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,320
or even a moment,

670
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,240
because it's there.

671
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,040
And I'm terrified.

672
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,800
I don't enjoy feeling temporary.

673
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,440
And for many of you,

674
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,040
following comments like this,

675
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,300
and even sense safety precautions,

676
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,900
could mean the difference between the vacation of your life,

677
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,940
and the last vacation of your life.

678
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,300
For maximum protection, all doors and windows should be part of the alarm system.

679
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,980
And LBJ said,

680
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,680
let us continue.

681
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,900
And they continued.

682
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,540
The evening and the morning were the first day.

683
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,700
And LBJ said,

684
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,240
let us make war on poverty.

685
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,800
And lo,

686
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,020
there were words in the news,

687
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,860
and welfare checks fallen upon the land.

688
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,500
And upon them it was writ,

689
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,620
fold not,

690
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,420
neither shall ye spindle,

691
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,260
nor mutilate.

692
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,300
And LBJ saw that it was good.

693
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,980
Very strange happenings, you know?

694
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,280
And, uh,

695
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,500
if there'd been something legitimate there,

696
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,880
and I could have seen exactly what was going on,

697
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,060
I guess I really would have done my best.

698
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,300
But, uh, there wasn't nothing I could do, you know?

699
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,020
I can't understand, you know?

700
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,520
You're on my side.

701
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,560
Well, anyway, the point is, is that, however,

702
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,860
a lot of the kinds of things that people have brought up about the Warren Commission,

703
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,640
and about the Kennedy assassination,

704
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,320
have sort of gotten tilted off into this area,

705
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,160
the area of the fringe participants.

706
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,920
And as we stated at the earlier part of the show,

707
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,260
and as we're going to prove conclusively next week,

708
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,340
um, the fringe has very little to do with it,

709
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,480
although, as with any event of any magnitude,

710
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,740
fringe groups are, become attracted to it.

711
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,800
And I don't know anything about Mr. Thornley,

712
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,060
other than what we've talked about here,

713
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,480
but, uh, fringe groups certainly are attracted to events of this magnitude.

714
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,680
However, as we stated before at the beginning of the show,

715
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,080
you either believe in the Warren Commission,

716
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,700
or you believe in the laws of physics,

717
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,080
and there are no, uh, two sides to that particular street.

718
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,820
It is strictly a one-way voyage.

719
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,240
Anyway, so I hope that we can put the Church of the Subgenius to bed with that.

720
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,900
In fact, why don't we formally do it?

721
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,140
I'll, I'll, I'll stay right here.

722
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,980
If you want to talk about the Church of the Subgenius,

723
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,780
call up Bob Nelson and talk to him about it.

724
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,440
Don't bother us with that nonsense anymore.

725
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,540
Call the Church of the Subgenius.

726
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,420
Anyway, back to the phones.

727
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,680
Yeah, call the Church of the Subgenius.

728
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,440
No way, friend.

729
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,520
You know, assassination is a, a big part of,

730
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,760
of, uh, of our government, really.

731
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,680
And, uh, you know, the, the, the Church is a patriotic group.

732
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:38,020
This is, uh, you know, the, I got a call from somebody earlier,

733
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,920
it said, Reverend Stang, we were worried hearing you play talking heads.

734
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,720
We thought maybe you were really selling ads.

735
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:43,840
We thought you were really selling out.

736
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,400
Well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna play another, uh, ex-pop group,

737
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,480
and that's, uh, Devo.

738
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,160
But I can because, because they're, they're dues-paying members

739
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,340
of the Church of the Subgenius, friends.

740
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,120
So, I, I just lost the bread and butter.

741
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,880
Devo knew what the hell we were complicated with,

742
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,080
and he got disqualified.

743
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,040
See, so allegedly, there's just no dragging it out,

744
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,140
you know, you have to хотm Uneaspcıین,

745
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,360
lost in a.'s rule.

746
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,460
But ultimately, I got my money,

747
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:39,540
my

748
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:40,840
on me.

749
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,720
And then, The ICSرك not only 이거는

750
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
in I, uh, the CIS circles,

751
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:43,720


752
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:13,680
I do a super show.

753
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,740
Big mess, he was all mixed up.

754
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,400
And a big mess, big mess, he was a...

755
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,740
He was really mixed up.

756
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,520
He was a big mess, big mess, he was a...

757
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,820
He was really mixed up.

758
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,900
I won't care my M, this true reality.

759
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,380
The most important thing, I put away my toys.

760
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,300
Do my microphone, I do a super show.

761
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,120
I'll announce the winner on the radio.

762
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,340
I'm a man with a mission.

763
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,300
A boy with a gun.

764
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,440
I got a picture in my pocket of the lucky one.

765
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,120
Who doesn't know?

766
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,520
I'm a big mess.

767
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,320
I mean a really big mess.

768
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,680
A big, big mess, he was all mixed up.

769
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,880
And a big mess.

770
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,440
Big mess, he was a...

771
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,740
He was really mixed up.

772
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,040
He was a big mess.

773
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,480
Big mess, he was a...

774
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,840
He was really mixed up.

775
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,160
I'm a man with a mission.

776
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,120
A boy with a gun.

777
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,300
I got a picture in my pocket of the lucky one.

778
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,000
Who doesn't know?

779
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,420
I'm a big mess.

780
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,140
I mean a really big mess.

781
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,540
A big, big mess, he was all mixed up.

782
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,400
And a...

783
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,320
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

784
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,460
You know, it only takes one vote to put somebody out of office these days.

785
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,080
As long as that vote is coated in lead.

786
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,380
Not that we recommend that you vote that way.

787
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:13,180
But, you know, I have a feeling that some of our most respected citizens have arranged that very thing.

788
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,540
And doesn't that bless your heart?

789
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,020
Well, you know, since we've been...

790
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,340
You know, we've been name-dropping like crazy on this show tonight.

791
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,560
And that's okay because...

792
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26,820
And the Church of the Subgenius recruits celebrities because we need money.

793
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,900
And people...

794
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,440
You know, nowadays, so many people, they can't take anything at face value.

795
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:38,060
They can't believe that it could be good because they themselves think it good.

796
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,320
Oh, no, no.

797
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,440
They've got to have somebody on television or on their...

798
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,900
Their demonic back-masked records tell them that it's good.

799
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:49,760
You know?

800
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,280
Just ask John Lennon or any other assassinated rock stars.

801
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,560
They'll tell you the same thing, baby.

802
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,220
Thank you.

803
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,160
Thank you.

804
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:31,680
Oh, yes, that beautiful...

805
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:43,080
Oh, yes, that beautiful...

806
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,360
Oh, yes, that beautiful...

807
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,140
Oh, yes, that beautiful...

808
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,500
It was all mixed up, friends.

809
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,180
It's a problem these days.

810
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,740
Businesses, don't forget the K&ON Scrapbook.

811
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:04,800
You can support K&ON and attract new customers to your business by advertising in our K&ON Scrapbook.

812
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,300
20,000 copies of each issue are distributed throughout town

813
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,500
and sent to all K&ON supporters to find out about our reasonable rates.

814
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,880
And to place your ad, call Phyllis Arp at K&ON 828-9500.

815
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:22,160
And I'm going to make sure tomorrow that there's some of those things down at the studios at Las Colinas

816
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,900
so that people can pick them up in the lunchroom there.

817
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,180
Well, that was...

818
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,420
Yes, Reverend Chris...

819
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:29,840
There's...

820
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:31,840
And here it said hi.

821
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:32,500
Yeah.

822
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,880
Chris, Dr. Hair Dr. Gross tells us more and more.

823
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,700
But, you know...

824
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,500
You know...

825
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:42,480


826
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:42,480


827
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:42,480


828
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:42,480


829
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:42,480


830
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:42,480


831
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:42,480


832
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:42,480


833
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:42,480


834
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:42,480


835
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:42,480


836
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:42,480


837
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,240
There's just a couple of things.

838
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:46,240


839
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:46,240


840
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:46,240


841
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:46,240


842
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:46,240


843
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,500
When Carol delivered the finished tape,

844
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,660
the Sweeneys discovered that following the wedding sequence

845
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:58,380
was 70 minutes of Carol nude playing with himself.

846
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,940
He had mistakenly taped the wedding over a personal tape.

847
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:05,040
So those of you people who videotape weddings out there,

848
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,560
which I've had to do in the past,

849
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,100
just be careful now.

850
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,320
Also, these little news,

851
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,380
items here. I'm going to get through back to puzzling evidence pretty quick here, but these

852
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:22,580
are very interesting. It's from a little newsletter called View from the Ledge, which for those of you

853
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:34,140
taping, write for information from P.O. Box 57141 Washington, D.C. 20037. 200,000 used bras were

854
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:40,340
blessed in Tokyo when Buddhist priests used the brassieres in a temple memorial service for cast

855
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:45,100
off underwear in Tokyo. The abandoned bras were heaped in a big pyramid for blessing in pouring

856
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:52,120
rain outside the main doors of the wooden temple in the center of Tokyo. South Burlington, Vermont.

857
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:58,900
Police yesterday had no idea who stole a life-size big boy statue from its display at a hamburger

858
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:07,200
restaurant, shot it in the head, and dumped it in some nearby woods. And this Captain Ray McGee

859
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,320
found the 50-year-old big boy covered in brown.

860
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:18,480
He had been shot in the head, right in the ear. Is there no respect, friends, is nothing sacred.

861
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:26,280
Here's some items that, based on articles in various medical journals, the following items

862
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:33,540
have been recovered from the rectums of patients. A live, shaved, declawed gerbil. A bottle of Mrs.

863
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:39,660
Butterworth's syrup. An axe handle. A nine-inch zucchini. Now these are all things that have been

864
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,320
extracted from the restaurant. These are all things that have been recovered from the rectums of patients.

865
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:48,600
Extracted from people's bodies, friends, from a certain specific place. A 14-inch vibrator with

866
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:56,300
two D-cell batteries. A plastic spatula. A Coke bottle. An 11-inch carrot and antenna rod. A 150-watt

867
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:03,280
light bulb. Let's get down to the good ones. This goes on. A frozen pig's tail. A plastic toothbrush

868
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:10,320
package. A 10-inch length of broomstick. An 18-inch umbrella handle. Two-inch toothbrushes. A 10-inch

869
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:17,600
glass bottle. Two Vaseline jars. A whiskey bottle with a cord attached. An oil can. A six-by-five-inch

870
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:26,780
toolbox. A baby powder can. A test tube. A peanut butter jar. A pair of eyeglasses. Tumblers and

871
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:33,900
glasses. A polyurethane waste trap from the U-bend of a sink. And a corborundum grinder with handle.

872
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:40,040
Friends, these medical facts are just amazing. And here's one quote from President

873
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:40,320
Russell.

874
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:46,640
Reagan on psychics. Quote, I've found it difficult to write them off entirely. The scriptures say

875
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:54,020
there will be such people. Speaking of psychics. And the 1950s actress Jackie Park said that Reagan

876
00:48:54,020 --> 00:49:00,140
was the, in bed, was the worst he had ever had. Mechanical. The worst. The worst. Unquote.

877
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,920
Well, well. Okay, back to puzzling evidence, folks. This is it.

878
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:07,880
I've been telling you.

879
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,460
No, it's not.

880
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,460
Weird.

881
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,660
Oh, God.

882
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:17,340
Where's the, where's all the assistants? Where's all the zombies? Huh?

883
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:26,240
So what if your hair falls on a great climb, sir? Perhaps your nose falls off onto your feet.

884
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,880
Calling Bob Dobbs. Calling Mr. Dobbs.

885
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,300
This is him.

886
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,880
Bob, is that you?

887
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:31,340
Yeah.

888
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,760
What the hell's going on?

889
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,120
Nothing like a little togetherness to take care of this scrambled shell structure of mine.

890
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,440
What can we just redo about it in the 80s?

891
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:46,320
So this is the scrambled shell structure. This is the show that, until this point, has not led to any new conclusion.

892
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,160
Try to define what exactly you've been seeing from your vantage post out there on the ship.

893
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,000
Well, it looks pretty, looks pretty terrible out here.

894
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,780
I'm still trying to get a hold of Werner Klempel. Where is he anyway?

895
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:04,060
There's some guy out here in a half-melted phone booth trying to dial desperately for old friends long dead.

896
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,320
Oh, that's the DJ whose show this normally is.

897
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,440
You can see some of his skin's been blasted away there in the air.

898
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:09,440


899
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:09,440


900
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:09,440


901
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:15,440
He's wearing a polyester shirt he was so proud of only a few minutes before his skin completely melted around his chest.

902
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:16,500
Hey, who is this?

903
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,240
I've got you right under my armpit.

904
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:19,720
Oh, my.

905
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,120
His mind has snapped. Use scopolamine if this show makes you dizzy.

906
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:23,660
Right.

907
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,860
Don't use those other pills.

908
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,820
I rubbed the small...

909
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,640
Thank you for the inspiration you've given me.

910
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:28,120
You're welcome.

911
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,220
You're the greatest star of all.

912
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,420
I don't care how much money you make, Tobin. I won't listen to this fucking music.

913
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,220
Oh, no, no, no.

914
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:39,420
He was completely surrounded by a bevy of 14-year-old girls all dressed up in Brady Bunches.

915
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:39,920
Brady Bunch outfits.

916
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:40,460
Yeah.

917
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:44,840
Actually, I just couldn't believe a guy like him would be able to attract such a crowd

918
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,040
of willing TV females.

919
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:51,200
But there they are, drinking that TV water and hanging out with a little neat-n-cow.

920
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,480
It takes about a month to get a car.

921
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:52,840
Yes.

922
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,820
I know what'll bring him back.

923
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,140
Guess hell, we're in serious trouble now.

924
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,520
It was time for the doctors.

925
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,120
Oh, no.

926
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,060
And they were operating tonight.

927
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,420
Yeah, new patients coming in every hour.

928
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:09,420


929
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:09,420


930
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:09,420


931
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:09,420


932
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,440
Oh, here comes a asthmatic.

933
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,000
Let's cut out his lungs.

934
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,140
Oh, here comes a heart patient.

935
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,280
Let's cut out his heart.

936
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,660
Hand me that scalp.

937
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,200
It's the doctors.

938
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,680
Oh, watch out.

939
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,880
This is the film that was supposed to be run right as the bomb was happening.

940
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,840
This is a very pleasing film and calming.

941
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,780
You can see here that...

942
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:35,280
Yes, they call this one the sex bomb, and it itself was responsible for much of the

943
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,780
dismay we've seen this evening.

944
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:37,740
Never mind.

945
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,640
Skip from your porch.

946
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,300
I knew they would've said, plus green, gray bones.

947
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:45,420
The sub-tay back and sub-tay away, but it just makes it two halves of my brain.

948
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:45,780
Right.

949
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,320
Welcome to Dr. Ranch.

950
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:47,920
Yes.

951
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,800
What about he will stop there, and I'll just cut out that fibrostic tumor.

952
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,040
Here goes.

953
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,480
This is pretty amazing here.

954
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,960
Bring me that sigmoidoscope.

955
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,480
I want, I want to take a look.

956
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,800
You know where.

957
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:04,300
This is sigmoid colon and his brother, the descending semicolon.

958
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:08,760
The elevator operator adds sisters of mercy, tears of Our Lady of Sorrows Hospital.

959
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:09,420
What's that?

960
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:09,420


961
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:09,420


962
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:09,420


963
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:09,420


964
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:09,420


965
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:09,420


966
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:09,420


967
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:09,420


968
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:09,940
Oh, ho.

969
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,880
Nurse, nurse, nurse, bring me another shot, please.

970
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,340
Got it.

971
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:17,980
Dead center.

972
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,820
As you can see, it's a modern, highly up-to-date facility.

973
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,980
Yes, and using every kind of doctor-prescribed device.

974
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,780
If a doctor needs it, they buy it.

975
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,760
This floor is the exclusive obnoxio-pirosis ward.

976
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,260
For three pills, chainsaws, and operations.

977
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:35,000
Let's step in, shall we?

978
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,340
Will the honor of a large German shepherd please come to the salt flat behind the door?

979
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:39,400
Yes, sir.

980
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:39,400


981
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:39,400


982
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:39,400


983
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:39,400


984
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:39,840
And the hospital.

985
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:40,620
Thank you.

986
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:45,140
Yes, here the doctors work in complete comfort, sometimes ignoring the patients altogether

987
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,000
as they operate with the newest tools.

988
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,940
Here's where the doctors kick back.

989
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,440
It's the luxury lounge in between the floors.

990
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,100
Yes, these are the transport...

991
00:52:55,100 --> 00:53:00,820
On Vibes, you see Dr. Spiegelman, and there's Dr. Clutterhouse over there on drums.

992
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,700
Okay, folks, now back out onto Doctor Highway.

993
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:06,580
Wow.

994
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,180
Whoa.

995
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,140
That's right.

996
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,280
Flying high over Oakland.

997
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:09,580
I know.

998
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,340
Discovering there is a false bottom to the container, and the...

999
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,960
Death ship drops its load.

1000
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:16,940
Death ship.

1001
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,360
It's better than the...

1002
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,700
Deathly bacteria over the Bay Area.

1003
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,500
And now you see the Subjection kitchen as they cook the morning meal.

1004
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,040
We're gonna mix up our pre-holocaust breakfast.

1005
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,260
Because all the bacteria are dead, too.

1006
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,540
It's all right, but it's a lot easier to cook things.

1007
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,520
Here are the cafeteria...

1008
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:35,760
No.

1009
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,000
You just set it out, and it cooks itself.

1010
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,240
You gave me plenty of rest.

1011
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:39,800
That's the secret.

1012
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,920
They always draw the furniture into the circle when you do that, but there's a way to get

1013
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,820
over that circle.

1014
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,160
Fire arrows.

1015
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,780
Chairs and sofas with a flaming arrow.

1016
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:47,660
Surrounding us.

1017
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,940
Something was missing from Little Napa Caller's menu.

1018
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,000
It was the tuba.

1019
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,840
So we put it in here on the show.

1020
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,760
If you're listening, you can put it on your sandwich and have it just the way you wanted

1021
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,060
it there.

1022
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,240
Ah.

1023
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:58,220
Yes.

1024
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,640
And if you have a four-channel stereo, put the tuba on the front.

1025
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:07,040
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

1026
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,140
boom.

1027
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,520
Oh, a little tiny Wotan's in the background.

1028
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:09,900
It's true.

1029
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:10,840
Oh, yeah.

1030
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:11,620
Here we go now.

1031
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,720
I think I'll practice that.

1032
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,640
This is the Relax Show, so don't get too upset.

1033
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,340
Just lay back on the bed.

1034
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,800
And they were able, usually, to understand the flaming arrow and turn it to their own

1035
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,200
advantage.

1036
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,340
Then you have to think of yet another weapon.

1037
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,080
Come on, guys.

1038
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:26,780
Let him talk.

1039
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:27,380
Let him talk.

1040
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:27,880
Which one?

1041
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:32,060
You know, I never thought atomic war would be so much fun, guys.

1042
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,320
Well, you know, we heard about nuclear winter.

1043
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,820
Nobody heard about nuclear toaster.

1044
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,020
Well, I guess it's a little more fun.

1045
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:37,020


1046
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:37,020


1047
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:37,020


1048
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:37,020


1049
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,480
We have an atomic toaster oven.

1050
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,160
Yeah, well, you got your nuclear winter sports, and I'm going out for the downhill skiing.

1051
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,880
Yes, here, the downhill fallout skiing.

1052
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,540
You can see the contestants for the Olympics are...

1053
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,060
Yes, on their flaming skis.

1054
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:50,720
Whoosh, whoosh.

1055
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,440
There they go.

1056
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,840
It is a race towards the shelter.

1057
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:53,920
The glowing tips.

1058
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,520
Smash their face on the bottom of the run.

1059
00:54:55,620 --> 00:55:01,620
Of course, each contestant only can survive one run, but it is a fabulous show of final

1060
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,060
surge of energy of humankind.

1061
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,640
Losing their hair in the wind as they fly down.

1062
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,500
Yes.

1063
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,480
And still optimistic in the face of eternal darkness.

1064
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,380
And now...

1065
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,200
Is she a nun, by the way?

1066
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:17,860
Yes.

1067
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,280
No.

1068
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:18,520
Oh, no.

1069
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,680
None of the above, right?

1070
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,780
No, it's just the way it is.

1071
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,640
It's always contradictory.

1072
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:23,260
I know.

1073
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,260
Reverend Dominatrix.

1074
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,260
Let's see her show it first.

1075
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,680
It's cool.

1076
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,700
Food, food monsters.

1077
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:34,260
Yes, the food monsters were on the prowl through the studio, eating all the old hamburger

1078
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,620
stubs and the leftover hot dogs.

1079
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:36,620


1080
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:36,620


1081
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:36,620


1082
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:36,620


1083
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:36,620


1084
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:36,620


1085
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:36,620


1086
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:36,620


1087
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:36,620


1088
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:36,620


1089
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:37,520
The food monsters.

1090
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,440
The food monsters.

1091
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,280
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

1092
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,280
Well, this is the last time we play this club.

1093
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,300
They don't give you enough to eat.

1094
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,300
Food, food monsters.

1095
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,340
I want royalties.

1096
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,020
I want dessert.

1097
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,540
I want post-prandial liqueurs.

1098
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,640
I want the best cognac and, you know, the whole shot.

1099
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:58,740
Yeah, well, it's a good thing you're with us because it's fun to be the only thing keeping

1100
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,360
somebody alive.

1101
00:55:59,620 --> 00:55:59,960
Really?

1102
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:00,600
Yes.

1103
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,260
We're going to be having a news feature more ways than you think.

1104
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:04,920
It's called From the Brow.

1105
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,620
So if you have a subject you'd like to talk about, you can do it.

1106
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:06,620


1107
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:06,620


1108
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:06,620


1109
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:07,500
I'm going to take the brow to speak on.

1110
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,140
Just ask the brow.

1111
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,160
Can I ask the brow?

1112
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,200
As the nasal passages are cemented shut and the brain is pulled out and stored in a little

1113
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:16,940
jar overnight.

1114
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:18,600
Yet the patient lives.

1115
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,320
Oh, there it goes.

1116
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,680
Well, I dropped the jar, but the patient lives.

1117
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,860
The patient lives.

1118
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:30,180
All because of the ministrations of the Gibrofram and the special plastic implement they use

1119
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:30,880
shown here.

1120
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,420
Yes, just push the little black...

1121
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,580
And now we'll show you that technique once again.

1122
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,700
Dr. Gibrofram?

1123
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,400
Yes.

1124
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:42,320
We hope to welcome you all tonight to the fervid celestial spoutings of the inner

1125
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,040
epops and clockwork workings of the church.

1126
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,160
But this task will not be easy.

1127
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:55,220
The fruits of the subgenius plant are not as cordial to the taste as others may be,

1128
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,200
kind of mucilaginous paste.

1129
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:05,120
But it's easy to become tangentially twisted along precarious paths that have nothing to

1130
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,380
do with the straight and...

1131
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:06,380


1132
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,120
true direction of our search.

1133
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,400
We are born with the Dobbs nature.

1134
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:19,380
However, only exist technology can complete a subgenius's transfiguration into overmanhood

1135
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:24,900
or overwomanliness and so far Bob has allowed this to happen to one solitary guinea pig,

1136
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,780
his friend, Dr. Philodrummon.

1137
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,380
Red, goddammit!

1138
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:36,360
Man was born with original slack, yet most civilized people don't believe in it and they

1139
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:36,360


1140
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:36,360


1141
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,620
are most learned scholars.

1142
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:43,120
Well, I've studied the Saurian stage in human evolution.

1143
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:47,600
As it turns out, many of our ancestors are not the primates as commonly thought, but

1144
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,680
the theropod line of the great archosaurs of the Mesozoic.

1145
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,180
Get him out of here.

1146
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,500
Oh, Bohandas is approaching Tokyo.

1147
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,260
We will have to get away from the city now.

1148
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,320
Oh, move your karate school away from here.

1149
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,160
It does not help.

1150
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,800
We must keep Bohandas from approaching the science center.

1151
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:06,180
Yes, I complained that I had no starter fluid and then I met a man who had no chainsaw.

1152
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:06,340
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1153
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:06,340


1154
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:06,340


1155
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:06,340


1156
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:06,340


1157
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:06,340


1158
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:06,340


1159
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:06,340


1160
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:06,340


1161
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:06,340


1162
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:06,340


1163
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:06,700
We will have to get him out of here.

1164
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,600
And he will be able to fight the monster and we will be able to protect the super racist

1165
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:09,880
people.

1166
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:10,580
We need to grow.

1167
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,380
We need to grow.

1168
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,300
Before the weekend.

1169
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:16,080
That is what we do with our troublemakers and malcontents.

1170
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,120
We pack them off to Monster Island where they are buggered by prisoners.

1171
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,940
These creatures are something amazing.

1172
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:28,580
You can't imagine all the little spines and projections, the scaly outer epidermis, the

1173
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:34,180
rind, a wart-like sagging covering that covers the outer cuticles of these critters.

1174
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,840
They are really a sight to see.

1175
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,340
And when they are out there, they are really a sight to see.

1176
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,280
And when they all get going, it's better than a party.

1177
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,820
It's like bobbing for apples in a giant barrel of radioactive sludge.

1178
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,220
And I only wish everyone would be...

1179
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:51,800
...movie that's swept America is one entitled The Encounters of the Third Degree.

1180
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,140
May I tell you this?

1181
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,000
I'm not so sure what UFOs are.

1182
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,260
I don't know if I believe them or not.

1183
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:06,340
The New Zealand Air Force was on alert recently because of the UFOs appearing in the air.

1184
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:10,320
So I поделил.

1185
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:16,380
I don't know if you can hear theのn.

1186
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:36,320
And I handle theSlan Part 1 now.

1187
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,280
Oh, it goes down so well.

1188
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:47,920
So instead, you'll have everlasting life here in Happy Town.

1189
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,960
Where everything will be gratifying and free.

1190
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,680
And you'll never have to say, we can't even say it here.

1191
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,020
You cross the gates over into...

1192
00:59:59,020 --> 00:59:59,980
I just think of you.

1193
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,880
That's much better.

1194
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:15,980
Here in Bobtown, you'll have to pay obsequious homage to the great bearded figure, Jehovah One.

1195
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:32,580
Here, holding the sky, Jehovah One presents his own history in a small slideshow that you'll be obligated to attend every day.

1196
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:45,840
And friend, you'll be obligated to attend that mighty show at the Caravan of Dreams.

1197
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:50,100
This Saturday night, like we were...

1198
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:50,780
Or Friday night.

1199
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:54,300
Friday night at 8 o'clock, Caravan of Dreams, Fort Worth, Subgenius, DeVival.

1200
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,300
All proceeds of mine go to KNON.

1201
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,680
And also the Song Gods.

1202
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,420
And John Held.

1203
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,820
Who else? I can't remember who.

1204
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:08,800
Anyway, friends, if you need information on the Church of the Subgenius, here's that mighty P.O. Box to write.

1205
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,800
Just write for the free information.

1206
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:18,180
That's Bob at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1207
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,040
I'm going to read that number again.

1208
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:25,240
That's P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1209
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,080
Praise Bob.

1210
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,520
And coming up next here is Ron Lindsey and Soul Oldie.

1211
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:32,000
So stay tuned for Slack.

1212
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,600
Slack in pure, pure form.

1213
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,240
Praise Bob.

1214
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,520
Praise Bob.

1215
01:01:43,520 --> 01:02:01,980
Praise Bob.

1216
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,580
Praise Bob.

1217
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:03,960
Praise Bob.
