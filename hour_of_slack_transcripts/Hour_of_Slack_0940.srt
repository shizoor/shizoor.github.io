00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,520
Hello.

2
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,180
Now you listen to me.

3
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,560
You asked for this.

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,980
You asked for this.

5
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,940
The Soul Genius.

6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,560
Power of the Soul.

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,500
Shut up, you.

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,340
Get out of here.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,800
He's a raven lunatic.

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,900
You are directed to make effort to keep it alive and protect it against injury.

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,960
Well, I understand.

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,440
I saw Bob's hands up.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,240
I know where he got it.

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:14,580
I'm suffering and dying unnecessarily from infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, sleeping sickness, and malaria because treatment is too expensive.

15
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,900
For heartburn relief right when you need it.

16
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,040
Lord Jesus.

17
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:19,680
Yeah.

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,400
Jesus.

19
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,320
Lord Jesus.

20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,400
Bob, now that's more like it.

21
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,380
For a book.

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,300
Containing Bob's.

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,640
Send $21.95 plus $6 for shipping and handling to Bob.

24
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,460
Add $15 for shipping and handling plus $256 to P-Box.

25
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,920
Bob contains over 14 step-by-step detailed written instructions for each Bob.

26
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,720
I don't like it.

27
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,740
Why not?

28
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,620
I don't like it.

29
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,780
Why not?

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,620
Why not?

31
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,700
just who you think you are?

32
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:07,700


33
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:07,700


34
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,000
You hate it so much.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,000


36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,380
I really am.

37
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:08,380


38
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:08,380


39
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:08,560
When we open youright

40
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:08,560


41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:08,560


42
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,740
That DVD costs one dollar and so I'm leaving it at ...

43
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,200
Ahhhhhh.

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,180
This sucks.

45
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,140
Hahaha.

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,500
i'm proud of you bob wedge was a great guy honey yes he was

47
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,180
what are you trying to say i'm doing a very bad job of saying i love this

48
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,060
genius

49
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,860
that's right that's right it is sure to spread quickly that's right that's right

50
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,820
right many of your earth years ago our women were similar to yours today

51
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:58,520
our emancipation took several hundred years and ended in a bitter devastating war between the

52
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,040
sexes the last war we ever had

53
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:08,060
so you've had wars too all inhabited planets have had wars some have ended by wiping themselves

54
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,560
out

55
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,100
how

56
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,920
for every new weapon invented a defense was perfected until the ultimate weapon was developed

57
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,760
a perpetual motion chain reactor beam

58
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,060
incredible what form did it take

59
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,040
as fast as matter was created it was changed by its molecular structure into the next dimension

60
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,840
and so destroyed itself

61
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,840
so there is a fourth dimension

62
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,040
after the fourth dimension there is a fourth dimension

63
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,040


64
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,140
in our life

65
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,080
so the war of the sexes women became the rulers of mars but now the male has fallen into a

66
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,860
decline the birth rate is dropping tremendously for despite our advanced science we have still

67
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:50,760
found no way of creating life so you come here for new blood in a way but also to test

68
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,160
a newly invented organic metal of which my ship is built on mars some think i will not

69
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,020
return that the metal is too unstable but when i get back we will build more metal because

70
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,020


71
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,020


72
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,960
spaceships. Meanwhile,

73
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,100
I will select some of your strongest

74
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,300
men to return with me to Mars.

75
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,840
And if they don't want to go with you?

76
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,540
There is no if.

77
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,700
Your philosophy may not be appreciated.

78
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,100
How do you propose to subdue London or

79
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,840
anywhere else for that matter? Yes, space.

80
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,560
Take your pick of the man. Space.

81
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,900
A simple matter. Which? A nuclear ship contains

82
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,960
a paralyzed array mechanism, capable

83
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,180
of freezing all life over a wide

84
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,240
area. Like your first me just now?

85
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,980
Yes. You better watch how you talk

86
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,040
to us space princesses.

87
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,880
The scene from Mars can destroy all

88
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,940
life. But we must look objectively

89
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,940
on what's happening.

90
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,220
Mars offers the scientific millennium

91
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,980
now. This is

92
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,740
the turning point in the history of the world.

93
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,020
Oh, you're back.

94
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,460
Mrs. Jemison, may I introduce

95
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,500
your latest guest, Miss Naya.

96
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,740
She comes from Mars.

97
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,020
Oh, well that will mean another bed.

98
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,160
She's come from where?

99
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,320
From Mars.

100
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,200
Yes, dear friends.

101
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,620
We come in

102
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,360
peace.

103
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,540
The truth about Mars

104
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,040
and friends,

105
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,040
you can learn more truth about Mars as

106
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,140
X-Day approaches. You know, the world

107
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,900
ends July 5th, 1998.

108
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,500
That's any

109
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,740
minute now. Could be.

110
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,900
I mean, we just don't know. We don't know.

111
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,980
And you've got to watch out for those

112
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,920
space princesses and devil girls

113
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,920
from Mars. I've got one right here.

114
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,960
I married a monster from outer

115
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,340
space.

116
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,920
And she didn't even have to use a

117
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,020
paralyzer ride mechanism or the perpetual

118
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,780
motion chain reactor

119
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,980
beam to do it.

120
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,320
Just good old-fashioned chemistry.

121
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,340
This

122
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,920
background music is by someone called

123
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,840
Hipsadick

124
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,600
using

125
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,260
Onan Canobot

126
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,340
sample music

127
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,720
every now and then in the background where it goes

128
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,360
B-O-B

129
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,760
but Fernanda,

130
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,300
Andy Lee Murr is back, friends.

131
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,840
And that's what we heard at the opening of the show

132
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,920
is a whole bunch of new

133
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,900
cut-ups by Fernanda and Andy Lee Murr,

134
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,780
a subgenius who

135
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,400
has

136
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,280
decorated

137
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,060
the church so beautifully,

138
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,800
audio and pictorially for so long.

139
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,140
And

140
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,900
it's good to see

141
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
it back.

142
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,440
And

143
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,700
we were entertained by

144
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,940
news that March,

145
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,800
the

146
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,040
women's march,

147
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,900
what was it called?

148
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,160
The March on Women's Wives

149
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,760
that happened today.

150
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,980
March for Women's Lives.

151
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,840
The half-million-ho

152
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,560
march, I like to call it.

153
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,200
You better not be saying that.

154
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,600
You'll pay for that later.

155
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,220
Why? It denigrates

156
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,320
women somehow or exploits them

157
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,420
to refer to women as

158
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,400
but all the cool guys do it.

159
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,180
I won't grace that question

160
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,280
with an answer.

161
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,240
Everybody cool?

162
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,520
That kind of cool.

163
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,460
I hope you never, ever, ever are.

164
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,680
Oh, well.

165
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,180
Well, in that case, we better switch

166
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,640
back to the tapes.

167
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,160
And the, uh...

168
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,360
Well, yeah. Let's just see.

169
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:13,900
What...

170
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,760
You never know exactly what it's gonna be.

171
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,280
Never, never know.

172
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,540
Praise Dobbs. Praise him hard. Praise him long.

173
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,580
Praise Dobbs. Praise him hard. Praise him long.

174
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,360
Praise Dobbs.

175
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,240
Hello.

176
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,280
You're listening to

177
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,320
The Haunting Call of our state bird

178
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,100
is a comforting sound of home.

179
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,640
But it takes a lot of effort

180
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,420
to keep them here.

181
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,720
This majestic bird was nearly extinct

182
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,200
at the turn of the last century.

183
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,080
Please donate to the non-life checkoff fund

184
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,340
on your state tax forms.

185
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:08,400
Hey, it's almost time for that radio show that I can only hear through the internet.

186
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,380
I start the computer in the modem to hear the show that I'll be downloading.

187
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,080
I click the mouse on the station preset, and wait a minute.

188
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,420
Are we almost there yet?

189
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,220
Just a moment. Just a moment.

190
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,080
I hear some silence getting choppier, and then it jams like a Xerox copier.

191
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:57,240
I hear the talking of the DJ and understand just what the kick's like.

192
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,380
I'm longing.

193
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,980
Internet. Radio.

194
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,420
I'm on an internet.

195
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,900
Radio.

196
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,500
I'm completely operational, and all my circuits are functioning perfectly.

197
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:19,820
The lights and the compression and expansion of the longitudinal waves cause the erratic oscillation.

198
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,240
I try to listen. It tries my patience.

199
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,120
It's been an hour since I heard a full sentence.

200
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,200
I understand.

201
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,780
Just a little.

202
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,180
No comprend.

203
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,140
It's a riddle.

204
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,120
I'm on an internet.

205
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,100
Radio.

206
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,040
Hey, no me gusta!

207
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,500
I'm on an internet.

208
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,120
Radio.

209
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,780
That sucks.

210
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,180
I'm on an internet.

211
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,840
Radio.

212
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,920
Too high.

213
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,180
I'm on an internet.

214
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,540
Radio.

215
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,600
Aeroflame.

216
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,780
Radio.

217
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:58,780


218
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:58,880
Directed by Vquetum formulation.

219
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,940
I've got all my le desired spectros.

220
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,660
I'm on an instrument.

221
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,120
I'm on electric Elmo.

222
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,120


223
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,560
But now speaking of electric, here is an all thatautres-

224
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,900
Whoa.

225
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,980
So somewhere on our earth, when we become a işowsheid-

226
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,460
Hey, a smallстрker's present.

227
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:12,680
Mother.

228
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:12,680


229
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,540
요то you.

230
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:13,540


231
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,820
I'm seeing animals, birds, boats.

232
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,160
All different kinds of life.

233
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,680
People are living like monsters.

234
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:15,680


235
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:15,680


236
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
I like that this is a children's horror, kid.

237
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:16,700


238
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,860
Like that?

239
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,680
That is when I saw an old and dormir tommy.

240
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,380
What is that?

241
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,660
The stlertary is a baby's off to milk.

242
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,820
I wish I still had on my radio

243
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,520
A funny show like Dr. Demento

244
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,400
Now I hear it on the internet

245
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,480
A Dr. D show for from home

246
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,740
The sound is filtered and then they squash it

247
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,820
I get upset and I holler

248
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,640
I hope it improves, now I'm in a slump

249
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,520
I guess for now I'm a poor pathetic chump

250
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,400
I'm on an internet radio

251
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,780
I'm on an internet

252
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,020
Radio

253
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,300
Now I'm not so self-conscious

254
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,060
I'm on an internet radio

255
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,400
I'm on an internet

256
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,260
Radio

257
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,360
Net congestion, server full

258
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,200
Server down, error 10

259
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,380
Go back to sleep

260
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,080
Please come again

261
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,460
I'm on an internet radio

262
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,840
I'm on an internet

263
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,140
I'm on an internet radio

264
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,520
That's not good, I'm not happy

265
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,160
I'm on an internet radio

266
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,180
It stinks!

267
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,080
Yes, Mr. Sherman, everything stinks

268
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,340
This is my nightmare

269
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:55,860
I'm going to Max Headroom

270
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,820
I've read a song or two

271
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,760
This will be the first time on the airspace

272
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,820
And I'll be the last

273
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,340
Hey, hey, did I miss anything?

274
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,760
And I'll be the last

275
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,300
Hey, hey, did I miss anything?

276
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,060
Ugh

277
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,440
Oh, I've got to go

278
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,340
And I'm going to Max Headroom

279
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,040
The situation is deteriorating.

280
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,740
Ah, hell, did I take that?

281
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:36,340
Ah, don't touch that.

282
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,160
Why?

283
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:37,660
Why?

284
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:46,000
Honestly, you want to sit down and take a stress pill and think things over?

285
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,420
No!

286
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,340
For the last 40 years, I've lived a life of dedicated debauchery.

287
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,720
I've consumed enough booze to destroy a dozen healthy livers.

288
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,980
I've filled my lungs with enough nicotine to poison the entire population of Orange County.

289
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,940
I've indulged in sexual excesses that would make Caligula look like a celibate monk.

290
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,120
I have, in fact, conscientiously, in and day out,

291
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,400
for more years than you've been in this best of all possible worlds,

292
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,840
tried to kill myself.

293
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,040
And I've never felt better in my life.

294
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,540
So, if you're really going to end it all,

295
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,100
I can show you a half dozen great ways to do it.

296
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,420
B.

297
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:31,960
O.

298
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,300
B.

299
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:32,960
B.

300
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,380
O.

301
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:33,800
B.

302
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,220
B.

303
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:34,800
S.

304
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,540
All right, yeah.

305
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,700
Yes, there is.

306
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:37,940
E.

307
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,500
Y.

308
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:45,460
A careful observer can use a respect scale to find how many citizens get an even break.

309
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,260
As a community moves towards...

310
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,700
despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.

311
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:02,140
A community is low on a respect scale if common courtesy is withheld from large groups of people

312
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,280
on account of their political attitudes.

313
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,340
If people are rude to others because they think their wealth and position gives them that right,

314
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,880
or because they don't like a man's race or his religion.

315
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,640
A power scale is another important yardstick of despotism.

316
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,280
It gauges the citizens' share in making the community's decisions.

317
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,880
Communities which concentrate decision-making in a few hands

318
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,240
rate low on a power scale and are moving towards despotism.

319
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,740
Like France under the Bourbon Kings.

320
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,600
Good evening.

321
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,220
Before I take your questions,

322
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,800
let me speak with the American people about the situation in Iraq.

323
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,140
Lift your head up high and take a walk in the sun with indignity and stick to it.

324
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,780
And you show the world, you show the way to get off.

325
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,880
You never give up, never give up, never give up.

326
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,740
Now be glad to take your questions.

327
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,800
Mr. President, some people are comparing Iraq to Vietnam and talking about a quagmire.

328
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Polls show that support for your policy is declining and that fewer than half...

329
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,960
Americans now support it.

330
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,880
What does that say to you and how do you answer the Vietnam comparison?

331
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,860
You're all draft dodgers.

332
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,260
You're all scum.

333
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,440
You're all my dog's flea collar.

334
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,720
You're all history.

335
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,760
Eat hot lead pillow heads.

336
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,620
Thank you, Mr. President.

337
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,600
What's your best prediction on how long US troops will have to be in Iraq?

338
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,520
We don't know when it's going to end.

339
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,360
Our commanders on the ground have got the authority...

340
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,300
is necessary to deal with violence and will.

341
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,040
Will in firm fashion.

342
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,080
Every so often we have to let the general public know that we can still blow shit up.

343
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,520
We'll also need to continue training the Iraqi troops.

344
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,400
I was disappointed in the performance of some of the troops.

345
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,440
Some of the units performed brilliantly.

346
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,840
Some of them didn't.

347
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,660
And we need to find out why.

348
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,020
If they're lacking equipment, we'll get them equipment.

349
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,260
If there needs to be more intense training, we'll get more intense training.

350
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,400
What is it?

351
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:18,860
What is it you want?

352
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,160
What is it you need?

353
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,180
I've given you sunshine.

354
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,220
I've given you dirt.

355
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,720
You've given me nothing but heartache and hurt.

356
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,380
Mr. President, before the war, UN members of your administration made several claims about Iraq.

357
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,100
That US troops would be greeted as liberators with sweets and flowers.

358
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,540
That Iraqi oil revenue would pay for most of the reconstruction.

359
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,260
And that Iraq not only had weapons of mass destruction,

360
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,580
but as Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said, we know where they are.

361
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,740
How do you explain to Americans how you got that so wrong?

362
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,560
And how do you answer your opponents who say that you took this nation to war

363
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,860
on the basis of what have turned out to be a series of false premises?

364
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:10,100
Well, let me step back and review my thinking prior to going into Iraq.

365
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,300
OK, you hear the sound?

366
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,960
The sound is Pac-Man.

367
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,660
Are you ready for Pac-Man?

368
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,480
Are you ready for Pac-Man?

369
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,780
OK, let's go!

370
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,900
Oh my God!

371
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:23,880
OK!

372
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:31,000
Saddam had the ability to produce biological and chemical weapons.

373
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,260
In other words, he was a danger.

374
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,400
Danger! Danger!

375
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,820
Why are you and the Vice President insisting on appearing together before the 9-11 Commission?

376
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,660
Because the 9-11 Commission wants to ask us questions.

377
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,040
That's why we're meeting, and I look forward to meeting with them and answering their questions.

378
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,780
Yes, no, maybe.

379
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,980
I don't know.

380
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,660
Can you repeat the question?

381
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,320
The Vice President is asking why you're appearing together rather than separately, which was their request.

382
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:10,160
Because it's a good chance for both of us to answer questions that the 9-11 Commission is looking forward to asking us,

383
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,760
and I'm looking forward to answering them.

384
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,260
I got no strings to hold me down, to make me fret,

385
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,680
or make me frown.

386
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,280
I had strings, but now I'm free.

387
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,220
There are no strings on me.

388
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,080
Thank you, Mr. President.

389
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,600
After 9-11, what would your biggest mistake be, would you say, and what lessons have you learned from it?

390
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,940
I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I could plan for it.

391
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:35,820
Uh...

392
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,900
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

393
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
All systems overload! Ego check now!

394
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,100
Help me!

395
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,020
Help me!

396
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,140
Uh...

397
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,320
You know, I just, uh...

398
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,620
There are times when all the world is steep

399
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,760
When questions run too deep

400
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,700
For such a simple mind

401
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,820
I want answers!

402
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,900
I'm sure something will pop into my head here in the midst of this press conference,

403
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,360
all the pressure of trying to come up with an answer, but it hadn't yet.

404
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,440
Just remember one thing, keep your mouth closed!

405
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,160
Thank you all very much.

406
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,900
Thank you.

407
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,360
Thank you.

408
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,220
Thank you.

409
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:45,020
Dear friends, and I should tell you who did that wonderful little, uh, old school, uh, type of collage, sarcastic, satirical collage there for you.

410
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,820
Friends, that was Eric Hoag.

411
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,600
Eric Hoag did that.

412
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:56,800
And you can, uh, actually pick up, if you wanted to learn more about Eric Hoag, you could at his website, uh, hoag.com.

413
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,960
That's spelled H-O-U-G.

414
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,420
Hoag. It seems like it would rhyme with hug.

415
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,760
But it's, uh, erichhoag, H-O-U-G dot com.

416
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,560
He also did that song, Internet Radio, which we heard earlier.

417
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,680
And, uh, uh, we've, uh, the collages were new ones.

418
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:20,640
From, uh, Fernanda Nde Lemur, were the other collages, except for that bush cut up.

419
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,620
The Enhanced, Enhanced W was the name of that.

420
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,800
And, uh, I think there was a little clip from that movie S.O.B.

421
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,300
And something called Praise Ezekiel Tito Garacas, whatever that is or means.

422
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:44,400
The music in the background here is the amino acids, uh, who, uh, are actually are going to be playing.

423
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,260
In, uh, this area.

424
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,020
I should announce these possibilities, friends.

425
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,520
There's a subgenius revival, uh, with the amino acids.

426
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:02,680
And this incredible performer, Mann, not the British band Mann.

427
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,680
A one-man band called Mann, which I'll play some more of that in a little while.

428
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,640
And, uh, yeah, and the amino acids at May 22nd in Cleveland.

429
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,340
Dave Land at the Beachland Ballroom.

430
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,480
Also, Lonesome at Cowboy Dave.

431
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,100
And you, and you, and you, and you, and whoever else shows up and preaches.

432
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,000
You know, we have a, a sort of a preach-a-thon, amateur,

433
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,760
Yeah.

434
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,100
Don-bong show at the end of the, after the professionals, you might say.

435
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,340
After the fro-pessionals, then the professionals.

436
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,460
Something like that.

437
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,360
The amino acids also will be, uh, playing at X-Day.

438
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,560
Out, out at Brushwood.

439
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,660
July 5th, this year of 2004.

440
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,340
Um, and Mann, I believe, will also be there.

441
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,380
And, get that, just found out today, the amino acids will be at Starwood.

442
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,040
That, uh, grandiose pagan festival they hold, also out at Brushwood in late July.

443
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:12,120
For information about Starwood, you can check out, w-w-w-w, roseandcomet.com, r o s e n comet. com,

444
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,100
or, uh, subgenius.com.

445
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:19,620
We'll tell you, find everything at all those.com because the world's overrun with a bunch of commies!

446
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,720
Dot commies!

447
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:28,760
If ye, if ye, ah, asked me, if ye asked, and if, you were gonna ask anybody, you'd ask me, and I'd answer yes, and I'd be right.

448
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,940
Because, I'm always right.

449
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,160
I'm a subgenius.

450
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Even if it turns out that I was perceived to have been wrong

451
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,540
because of the effects of my actions may have appeared to be disastrous to somebody,

452
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,500
yet within the realm of Dobbs' consciousness,

453
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,660
nothing can be said to have failed if a subgenius did it.

454
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,940
Anything that more than one subgenius businessman do is legal.

455
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,860
If two or more subgenius businessmen do something, it's legal.

456
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,320
It's totally legitimized.

457
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,980
That's the way it is, friends.

458
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,520
That's just the way it's going to be.

459
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,620
Now, other than that, we're not sure how it's going to be

460
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,440
because Lonesome Cowboy Dave may be calling in.

461
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:21,060
And I've not been engineering this at this station live for long,

462
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,960
so when that happens, you may get to hear an example

463
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,760
of what appears to be a subgenius screwing up or being wrong.

464
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,320
Well, that's just the way your consciousness filters these things, you see.

465
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,680
It's your reality tunnel.

466
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,380
Yeah, babe.

467
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,900
If you want to see it like that, go ahead now.

468
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,960
It's like your reality, dude.

469
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,140
We all make our own, you know.

470
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,880
Well, I'm going to get back to somebody else's reality.

471
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:55,860
In this case, some soundtrack from an old film called Despotism,

472
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,660
an encyclopedic.

473
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,360
It's a Britannica film, which ostensibly was to warn Americans

474
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,280
and Canadians and other North American types

475
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,740
how easy it would be for despotism to take over even a democratic country.

476
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,660
And they give these examples of a despotic state,

477
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,700
all of which seem to add up to America in the year 2004.

478
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,080
That's funny.

479
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,620
They were trying to tell us in the 40s, and apparently nobody listened.

480
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:23,960
Well, anyway.

481
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,380
Never tonight.

482
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,220
Young people cannot be trusted.

483
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,860
They don't form their own opinions.

484
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,820
This business about open-mindedness is nonsense.

485
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,760
It's a waste of time trying to teach students to think for themselves.

486
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,380
It's our job to tell them.

487
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,980
And when teachers put such training into practice,

488
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,300
despotism stands a good chance.

489
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,320
These children are being taught to accept uncritically whatever they're told.

490
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,400
Questions are not encouraged.

491
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,420
They're being taught to accept what they're told.

492
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,100
How can you ask such a question?

493
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,780
Have you got a textbook?

494
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,560
Yes, ma'am.

495
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,320
Does it say here that our law courts are always just?

496
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,040
Yes, ma'am.

497
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,420
Then how dare you question the fact?

498
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,080
Sit down.

499
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,280
And so we aren't surprised when...

500
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,520
But it must be true.

501
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,360
I saw it in this book right here.

502
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,880
And if books and newspapers and the radio are efficiently controlled,

503
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:27,920


504
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:27,920


505
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:27,920


506
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:33,800
the people will read and accept exactly what the few in control want them to.

507
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,480
Government censorship is one form of control.

508
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,200
A newspaper which breaks the government censorship rule can be suspended.

509
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,200
It is also possible for newspapers and other forms of communication

510
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,980
to be controlled by private interests.

511
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,360
I thought I told you to kill that story.

512
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,240
It'll cost us a lot of advertising.

513
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,300
If that story goes out, I quit.

514
00:25:59,480 --> 00:25:59,880
All right.

515
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,240
What sort of community do you live in?

516
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,740
Where would you place it on a democracy-despotism scale?

517
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,400
I was walking through the park the other day,

518
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,740
looking up at the sky, and well,

519
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,260
it was such a sweet shade of baby blue,

520
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,860
and those snow-white clouds made the whole thing look like a beautiful little picture.

521
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,760
I sat down, and I was looking at all the little flowers

522
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,260
and all the little fluffy animals prancing around.

523
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,220
Well, the whole thing was just such a happy purr.

524
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:27,220


525
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,620
It was a perfect moment.

526
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,240
Well, then, as usually happens,

527
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,780
a fat lady with a couple of brats walked by,

528
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,760
and, well, little kids were screaming,

529
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,960
and one of them threw a little pebble at me

530
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,580
and just beamed me in the head.

531
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,260
A couple of minutes later, a group of teenagers came

532
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,400
and started playing frisbee,

533
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,160
and that would have beamed me in the head, too,

534
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,600
but I ducked just in time,

535
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,100
and they started playing their radio real loud,

536
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,180
and then a tough guy walked over

537
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,100
and looked at me like he wanted to beat the crap out of me.

538
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,200
Well, the whole situation just inspired me to go home

539
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,220
and write this little song, and I'm going to write it.

540
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:57,780
I'm going to sing it to you now.

541
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,300
Here we go.

542
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,420
I hate people

543
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,420
I hate people

544
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,380
Oh, yeah, I hate people

545
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,060
Because they really suck

546
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,840
Oh, yes, they do

547
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,440
I hate people

548
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,460
You know, I hate people

549
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,380
I hate people

550
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,980
Because they really suck

551
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,560
Oh, yes

552
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,480
I hate you and you and you

553
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,500
And you and you and you

554
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,560
And, hey, I hate you, too,

555
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,940
Because you really suck

556
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,420
Oh, yeah

557
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,360
I hate people

558
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,240
All types of people

559
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,280
I want to kill them

560
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,880
Because they really suck

561
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,460
Oh, yes

562
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,060
Don't hate no trees

563
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,220
Don't hate no animals

564
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,160
Don't hate no flowers

565
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,980
Or mountains or streams

566
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,360
Don't hate no bowling balls

567
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,140
Don't hate no ham sandwiches

568
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,280
Don't hate no classic novels

569
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,880
Just hate human beings

570
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,600
Oh, yes, I do

571
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,280
I hate people

572
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:54,600
Hey

573
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,540
You know, and I see a lot of you out there nodding your heads, agreeing with me.

574
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,040
So I want you all to join in with me.

575
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,820
Join in on this next chorus.

576
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,580
Here we go.

577
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,160
I hate people

578
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
I hate people

579
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,060
I hate people

580
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,680
Because they really suck

581
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,600
Come on, get into it.

582
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,120
I hate people

583
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,200
I hate people

584
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,120
I hate people

585
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,700
Because they really suck

586
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,260
Oh, I hate you and you and you

587
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,260
And you and you and you

588
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,440
And you and you and you

589
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,060
I hate you, too

590
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,580
Because you really suck

591
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,180
Oh, yes

592
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,020
I hate people

593
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,780
All types of people

594
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,040
I want to kill them

595
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,600
Because they really suck

596
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,160
Yes, they do

597
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,980
I hate people

598
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,580
Yes, they do

599
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,820
We hate people

600
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,100
Uh-huh

601
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,300
Everybody, we hate them all

602
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,120
Oh, that was

603
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,180
That was a lovely tune

604
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,400
Um, by, uh

605
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,300
That was by John Levy

606
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,400
I hate people by John Levy

607
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,320
I don't have much other information about that

608
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,920
I think it was posted to alt.binary slack

609
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,740
In the background we hear a tune called Flatulences by Faune

610
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,200
Oh

611
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,200
Sounds like Bob Tilton, the preacher

612
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,380
The great preacher

613
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,100
Well

614
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,900
Well, well

615
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,320
Just listen at that

616
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,800
Friends, um, I told you about this performer, Mann

617
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,220
A one-man band

618
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,540
He stands in a business suit

619
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,620
With a big bass drum at his feet

620
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,820
And a bass guitar in his hands

621
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,000
And he plays those two things

622
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,540
Whoa

623
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,260
Pardon me

624
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,920
Whoa

625
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,120
Uh

626
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,740
Well, let's just check out Mann

627
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,580
Why would I not like you?

628
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:09,580


629
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:09,580


630
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,760
Man, you're in, I'm pretty sure

631
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:10,760


632
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:10,760


633
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:10,800
And a deeper sl Firth

634
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:10,800


635
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:10,800


636
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:10,800


637
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:10,840


638
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:10,920
I'm going to see you on Christmas

639
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:10,940
But that's a little secret

640
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,520
K-in

641
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:12,980
Oh

642
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,280
Ah

643
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,820
I'm 춘

644
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,280
The rage, wisdom and the smarter bums

645
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,200
The Microsoft turd and the liquor loss

646
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,400
Gimme some more, gimme some more

647
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,260
Gimme, gimme, gimme more crap

648
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,620
Gimme some more, gimme some more

649
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,600
Gimme, gimme, gimme more crap

650
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,640
More crap

651
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,460
It's all around

652
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,920
Hippie tampons and the new self-help

653
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,880
The pop-up ad and the smoking loss

654
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,820
The new sitcom reality show

655
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,340
The cheese taco steak pizza chemical nacho

656
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,020
The wacky taco with the don't fight song

657
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,120
The gated clown housing with the faux facade

658
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,180
Talked and hit in the trash talk show

659
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,240
The implant abreast of the pro-talk show

660
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,600
Gimme some more, gimme some more

661
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,580
Gimme, gimme, gimme more crap

662
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,920
Gimme some more, gimme some more

663
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,820
Gimme, gimme, gimme more crap

664
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,620
More crap

665
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:13,940
It's all crap

666
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,980
It's all crap

667
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:19,980
It's all crap

668
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,100
beerformondon.com

669
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:40,340
Are you late again?

670
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,980
Jen, get back to work.

671
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,360
I want that on my desk right now.

672
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,920
Have you been drinking?

673
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,560
Get me those figures.

674
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,080
Read the memo.

675
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,380
Get back to your cubicles.

676
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,460
This will affect your performance review.

677
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,920
And you think you deserve a raise?

678
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,660
You're fired!

679
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,920
We wanted someone who's intelligent,

680
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,700
highly motivated,

681
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,560
creative,

682
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,180
yet flaccid and gullible.

683
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,620
I share my profits,

684
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,940
pay your rent,

685
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,360
feed your kids,

686
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,260
put the fat on your ass

687
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,820
and the gas in your car.

688
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,980
And you think you deserve a raise?

689
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,840
You're fired!

690
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,420
And you think you deserve a raise?

691
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,340
You're fired!

692
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,600
You're fired!

693
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:38,880
Fired!

694
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,360
You're fired!

695
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,580
Whoa, man!

696
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,860
Whoa, man is right.

697
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,680
What a man.

698
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,220
What a man.

699
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,180
He's my man.

700
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,280
We saw a video of that last song,

701
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,760
You're Fired,

702
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,320
in which man played both the man

703
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,120
and the fired person.

704
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,140
And he looks both parts.

705
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,640
I've noticed that when he performs in that business,

706
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,200
he only lasts a couple of songs before the suit,

707
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:11,760
the jacket comes off.

708
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,620
Really, pretty much just the first song,

709
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,780
because that's a lot of energy he's putting out.

710
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,880
Yeah, he's...

711
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,240
Man is very popular in Detroit,

712
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,880
among the haters and so forth there.

713
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,020
The angry young men.

714
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,180
Yeah, and...

715
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,800
And women.

716
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,500
And man will be performing at the Beachland Ballroom,

717
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,020
May 22nd,

718
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,320
at the Subgenius Devival.

719
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,620
We're trying to get some news,

720
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,040
new videos together for that.

721
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,100
We now have constant video projection capability,

722
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,900
and it's...

723
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,160
I get to be a geek in the middle of a show.

724
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,500
It's like I'm up on the stage,

725
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,600
and I've got all my computer crap,

726
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,260
and it's just like when I'm geeking at home.

727
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,900
And the best thing is,

728
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,440
nobody can bug me.

729
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,100
It's like even when the bands are playing,

730
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,020
I'm still geeking.

731
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,700
You know, I'm providing some kind of weird

732
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,700
background video projection or something.

733
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,460
And they can't...

734
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,280
They can't...

735
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,620
They can't get...

736
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,180
You know, you can just keep working,

737
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:15,380
and you don't have to schmooze the schmoozing.

738
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,640
He's in his glory.

739
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:16,980
And the...

740
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,180
The private geeking.

741
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,580
Ah.

742
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,980
Well, not everybody.

743
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,160
I mean, some people like their fellow humans.

744
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,360
Actually, I like my fellow subgeniuses,

745
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,980
and I like a lot of humans.

746
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,040
But, uh, as well...

747
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,120
When you're forced to interact with them, yes.

748
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,140
But, uh,

749
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,540
given your own...

750
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,380
leanings...

751
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,320
But, you know, there's...

752
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,060
Then there's involuntary slack.

753
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,140
Sometimes you're forced to do something

754
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,460
you really didn't want to do,

755
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,220
but as it turns out, in the end,

756
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,900
although it seemed so disastrous at the time,

757
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,960
you're kind of glad that it happened.

758
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,340
You know, you've lost that job.

759
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,500
Oh, no, how terrible.

760
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,780
But six months later, you're gone.

761
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,400
Oh, thank God that idiotic boss fired me.

762
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,780
Because this new anti-job I have is so much better.

763
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,620
I just said...

764
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,460
And money comes flowing to me.

765
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,280
Ever since I put my faith in that man,

766
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,580
J.R. Bond!

767
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,000
But, uh, you know, we don't want to, uh,

768
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,420
you know, force our beliefs or religion on people.

769
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,180
We will, eventually,

770
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,720
but we don't want to right now.

771
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,260
We don't...

772
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,260
We wish we didn't have to.

773
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,400
Ah, but one door closes, another one opens.

774
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,180
That's right.

775
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,020
Don't let that one bang your butt on the way out, buddy.

776
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,180
Because if you don't like it,

777
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,620
there's one other way.

778
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:38,620


779
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,540
There's one right behind you

780
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,080
who's been waiting in line for years

781
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,380
just to get in on the ground floor

782
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,440
of this lucrative new cult.

783
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,120
Now, while rates are low.

784
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,880
I've only been saying that for, what, 25 years now?

785
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,880
Uh, yes.

786
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,760
Well, you know, but, um, we cannot fail.

787
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,620
And yet, and yet, you know,

788
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,680
that is our...

789
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,120
The gift that we have as subgeniuses

790
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,980
is the fact that if we do fail,

791
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,280
praise Bob.

792
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,220
So what?

793
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,400
And, uh, I've got a perfect, uh,

794
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,640
little song that will illustrate that.

795
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,960
I'm not sure who sings this,

796
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,560
but it's called

797
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,660
The Will to F-A-L.

798
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,440
The Will to F-A-L

799
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,860
I'm awkwardly calm,

800
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,240
apparently normal,

801
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,080
quick to smile and slow to peek.

802
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,200
But I have a little quirk,

803
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,240
a pattern, so to speak.

804
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,960
I rarely have ever hold a job,

805
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,140
I never finish my work.

806
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,540
I'm an affable,

807
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,960
kind of a slob,

808
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,500
a highly disorganized,

809
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,100
classy,

810
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,860
sort of a jerk.

811
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,660
I've got the will to fail.

812
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,500
The will to fail.

813
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,200
I have talents that I never use.

814
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,340
I try to win, but I love to lose

815
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,640
because I've got the will to fail.

816
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,520
It's such a thrill to fail.

817
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,380
A thrill to fail.

818
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,260
I've a backward kind of basic need.

819
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,140
I get my kicks when I don't succeed

820
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,560
because I've got the will to fail.

821
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,720
I seem to make an effort,

822
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,040
but I never do connect.

823
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,000
And while I'm very rational,

824
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,320
I'm seldom, if ever,

825
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,580
practically never correct

826
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,580
because I've got the will to fail.

827
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,540
The will to fail.

828
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,740
The will to fail.

829
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,420
I secretly am enjoying myself.

830
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,300
Slowly I'm destroying myself.

831
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,960
I think I got a tiger by the tail.

832
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,580
A tiger called the will to fail.

833
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:04,340
The will to fail.

834
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,820
I seem

835
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,600
to make an effort,

836
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,420
but I never do connect.

837
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,460
And while I'm very rational,

838
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,060
I'm seldom, if ever, practically never correct

839
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,060
because I've got the will to fail.

840
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,260
The will to fail.

841
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:27,660


842
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,440
The will to fail.

843
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,000
I secretly am enjoying myself.

844
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,840
Slowly I'm destroying myself.

845
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,420
I think I got a tiger by the tail.

846
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,580
A tiger called the will to fail.

847
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:38,580


848
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:38,580


849
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:38,580


850
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:38,580


851
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:38,580


852
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,180
The will to fail.

853
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,440
Oh.

854
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,240
Oh.

855
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,100
Oh.

856
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,220
Yes, I wish I knew who did that song.

857
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,600
Um, the will to fail.

858
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,860
Oh, this in the background is Perry and Kingsley

859
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,640
doing the old classic Space Age Bachelor pad music.

860
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,680
Spooks in space.

861
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,580
Did you know that the term Space Age Bachelor Pad is used to describe the universe?

862
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,880
The word Pad music was coined by a subgenius.

863
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,280
Oh, speaking of which, it looks like we're getting phone calls coming in.

864
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,800
Okay, let's see what happens if we, uh, I push the button.

865
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,160
Hello?

866
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,120
Hello?

867
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,120
It worked!

868
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,360
Oh, my Godman-man-day Dave-man!

869
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,480
It's our Dave!

870
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,540
Did you make the furniture run properly or did you...

871
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,120
It's all in place, man.

872
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,320
It's okay, but don't talk about that on the air.

873
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,560
Well, I got more problems to talk about.

874
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,000
I don't know if they should be aired or not.

875
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,000
I've been going through the books in the Euro Mountain deals.

876
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,160
You've got about four million Muslims converting to the Church of the Subgenius.

877
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,760
God only knows Dobbs or whatever.

878
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,280
Hey, man, that's what the Internet's there for.

879
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,440
Well, I think...

880
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,600
Are you sure it doesn't have to do with this oil deal?

881
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,280
It may very well have to do with the oil...

882
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,220
But which oil deal are you talking about, Dave?

883
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,420
Well, I'm talking about the stinky stuff.

884
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm not talking about the kind that you can use to power a car or some other vegetable.

885
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,380
I was talking about, you know, good old-fashioned...

886
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,100
Well, it's not hair oil, I guess.

887
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,780
But you know what it's good for.

888
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,840
Yeah, let's not be cutesy on the air, man.

889
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,980
Well, if you do rub it on the correct chakra on the top of your scalp, you become wonderfully enlightened.

890
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,100
But who gives a shit about what it's for? It makes no sense whatsoever anyway.

891
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,380
But do you think that's what this is...

892
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,180
Is he talking about patchouli oil or what, man?

893
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,260
What?

894
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,040
Patchouli oil.

895
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,860
No, no, I wish it was as fragrant as patchouli oil. You know what this stuff smells like.

896
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,500
Well, is this war really all about oil, Dave?

897
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,500
You think?

898
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,760
Well, is it about oil or drugs? I mean, do they have drugs in Iraq?

899
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,700
Well, they do now.

900
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,680
Well, they do now.

901
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,000
You better believe it.

902
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,900
Yeah. They got the kind now in Iraq.

903
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,400
Uh...

904
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,640
Phew. You know, okay.

905
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:56,220
Because we both have these very, very grim, grim visages in our head. That's what the air...

906
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:01,900
That was the little bit of air there was in the put-down.

907
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:02,880
The air.

908
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,320
We both saw the same factory.

909
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:05,480
The air.

910
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:11,220
And it was draped clothins or whatever they called them. I don't know. I've been reading the spectrometer again and I guess...

911
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,120
Dave, have you been...

912
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,080
Colors or something. I don't know.

913
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,680
Have you been reading the news again?

914
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,820
Unfortunately, and I don't know, the conclusions that I've got wouldn't stand up in a court of law, you know?

915
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:34,880
Well, they say it's another Vietnam, but the food's completely different and you can't get a beer not the same way. I mean, it's just... I just don't see how they can make those comparisons.

916
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,920
Yeah, ask her. For instance...

917
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,320
You know?

918
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,240
I know.

919
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,340
That's how different it really is.

920
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,240
Right. That's clear.

921
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:46,840
Well...

922
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:54,260
Everybody likes rice. I think we have a penchant for killing rice-liking people. We're a bread culture, which causes the, you know...

923
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,200
Yeast.

924
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,300
...the loafing that some of our leaders do, but...huh?

925
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,860
And yeasty, too.

926
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,420
Yeah, very, very yeasty. We're all infected nowadays. It's a super strain.

927
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:04,860
Yeah.

928
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,220
We're all infected, but we're not infected.

929
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:05,220


930
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:17,980
And the only thing that's happened is we've been brought over, I think, from the Ural Mountains, and once again, we follow the money trail, we follow the haircut loop, and we go all the way back to the racetrack. We bet the trifecta, and we take a nap.

931
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:18,780
And you strike oil.

932
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,000
And then they strike, and then when you've taken the oil, they strike you back.

933
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,400
Yeah.

934
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:30,020
They go, wait a minute! That was our path to world domination.

935
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,860
That's a nature is read in tooth and claw. You must learn to...

936
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,600
...adopt the way the old ones did.

937
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:42,620
Ah, the old ones. You know, nobody believes in hell anymore.

938
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,260
No, they just live in it and think it's normal.

939
00:42:45,580 --> 00:43:04,840
Well, you're right, but they've forgotten that the literal hell, the caverns beneath our surface world, populated by troglodytes and shuffling cruel monsters, they...because they're distracted by the ones up here on the surface, the shuffling cruel monsters on television, making speeches and selling toilet paper.

940
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:12,900
I think their main irk, or their main ire, might be the fact that we shuffle around in better slippers. We have the...

941
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,160
Speak for yourself, Dave.

942
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,960
Well, of course, I was wrapped in swaddling clothes until I was 24.

943
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,100
I'm a megan.

944
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,240
You're a beacon of light.

945
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,400
A megan. No, a megan. That's like, they are not the vegans. I'm a megan.

946
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,680
Yeah, you like to eat raw meat.

947
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,260
I eat only myself.

948
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,120
Ah.

949
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,820
A self-consumer.

950
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:34,820


951
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,760
A self-consuming type of guy.

952
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:55,060
We are liable to forget that our innermost natures actually do not cry out for work or fast cars or even television. We forget these things. Most of the time, they're crying out only for sex. Messy, messy sex, actually. But it's harder to come by.

953
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,740
Crabby sex is easy to come by.

954
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,300
So to speak.

955
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,080
Yes.

956
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,860
Just hang around the old folks, huh?

957
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:00,580
Yeah.

958
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,720
Whatever happened to that wallowing pig, pig lust of sex hurt, Dave?

959
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:10,820
What do us meat byproducts of the DNA code? What are we missing, man? What happened?

960
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:28,980
Well, I think it's not only the Franken-food, but now we're corrupticated by Franken-sex. I think everything in our personal or erstwhile lives, if you want to call it a life, is being corrupticated by these, oh, dark waves, if you want to call them that. I mean, I know there's some recording thing or whatever.

961
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,320
Turn on the darkness, man.

962
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:30,840
Yeah.

963
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,820
You can actually see, it has a numinescence, I think, there.

964
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:34,820


965
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:34,920
Yeah.

966
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,600
You can see the old geek flop.

967
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,300
Right.

968
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:56,540
I used to, when I was a kid, I was raised to believe that light was this energy that replaced darkness, and darkness was merely the absence of light. No! Darkness is a force that negates light. You don't turn off the light. You have a, there's another machine that the devil has, which allows you to turn on the dark. Big distinction.

969
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,880
Big, big distinction.

970
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,020
Bent as a nine-bob note, and yet there it is.

971
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:01,520
Yep.

972
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,440
Especially big distinction for those folks going moonlight on the moon.

973
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:04,740
Yeah.

974
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,160
I mean, they're going to get ice skating, if you know what I'm saying. They're about to get lost in another dimension.

975
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:09,740
Right.

976
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:15,600
Do I sound like Ted Nugent, or do I just get one of them crossbows out with like a nuclear device on you and they're in?

977
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:32,140
Dave, if you were a right winger, you'd be a, probably be healthier, richer, funny, not funnier, well, funnier to more people. You would be, you would seem smarter to a certain number of people. You'd have, you'd have the wrong people laughing.

978
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,780
At the wrong time?

979
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:33,780


980
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:38,480
With you, instead of the right people laughing at you the way it is now.

981
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,640
Well, what?

982
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:47,720
If you were a wealthy man, if you were a rich man, if you were, well, if you were, were you?

983
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:57,800
Well, I don't even know if I was a pooty-poot man. I could go up on the roof and play the violin and sing songs too, just like everybody else, but you think I want to give, give my dandelions away so freely?

984
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,120
Well, especially when the-

985
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,940
For crying out loud. I'm, I'm a beautiful woman deep inside somewhere. I don't know where.

986
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,260
I'm so glad you know that, Dave.

987
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,920
Yeah, and you know, I-

988
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,260
Inside of everybody, there's a big fat blonde.

989
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:22,480
There's, and there's a coming out party we can all attend in our minds. We don't even have to go there to be, uh, considered, uh, cute or not ordinary or something like that.

990
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,400
Yeah.

991
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:23,960
Yeah.

992
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:32,900
Yeah, one of these days, the not so cute people are gonna take over, man. And then the popular, cute, smart people are gonna be down.

993
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:32,920


994
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,880
Down, man! City Hall's going down, man!

995
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,700
Personally, I want to grow up to be a Mayan administrator.

996
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,460
A Mayan administrator?

997
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:54,020
Yeah, not one, I don't want to pull the, actually pull the hearts out, although I do want to, you know, be kind of close enough to at least watch the agonized barks and cries and stuff.

998
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,800
You want to be able to pick who gets their heart yanked, right?

999
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,900
No, I want to pick, you know, how much, how many billions of corn go to Yipstick's nickel, and how many corn go to Yipstick's nickel.

1000
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:12,780
And then, you know, if there's some, like, people that are insurrectionists, we'll call them Native American Indefatists or something like that.

1001
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,220
Uh-huh.

1002
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:20,180
We'll go on down and get, you know, send the correct number of people with bows and arrows and stuff to clean up the mess and restore order.

1003
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:21,840
Sounds like a plan.

1004
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,440
And I can wear one of those jade, you know, one of those obsidian blades and have a jade hat.

1005
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:25,860
Yeah, yeah.

1006
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:32,880
I wouldn't have to use the obsidian blade, you know, but I probably would twirl one of those weird cords into my penis and see if, you know, it's a jade hat.

1007
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:32,880


1008
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,260
It was going to rain frogs in May or something, you know?

1009
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:36,480
Man.

1010
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:45,300
Unto the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but even their mind and conscience is defiled.

1011
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,680
Titus 1.15.

1012
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,580
Hoo-hoo.

1013
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,500
Or as the Buddha Gub said, make love often, even if you have to do it with someone else.

1014
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,460
Oh.

1015
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:02,860
Or as Sister Magdalena Hagdalena Hoopa-Taka-Waka-Taka Hogan Logan Pogan of Cleveland, uh, of Cleveland, said,

1016
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:02,860


1017
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,160
or of Akron or Canton said,

1018
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:05,600
Acorn.

1019
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,640
A good bowel movement is always better than bad sex.

1020
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,080
Always.

1021
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,100
Although, as Brother Dave Gardner said, none of it was bad at all.

1022
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,920
Do you remember Brother Dave Gardner?

1023
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:23,240
I met Brother Dave Gardner. I have recordings of Brother Dave Gardner from his last living performance.

1024
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,900
I knew about Lord Buckley, but I did not know you had four men hiding in your back pocket.

1025
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,280
We have another caller, but we are, but yeah, I was raised on Brother Dave Gardner.

1026
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,800
My dad, a southerner, was real into Brother Dave.

1027
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,660
But he made, he made zoot jokes.

1028
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,780
Yeah, Brother Dave was not what you would call PC, as we count PC-ness.

1029
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,140
He was not a neck, he was a hipster. He was a true southern hipster guy.

1030
00:48:45,360 --> 00:49:00,280
Yeah, he was. He was a speed freak, and he did have a, um, an old-fashioned way of, not, shall we say, not especially PC way of looking at, uh, racial strife in the, uh, late 50s or early 60s.

1031
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,260
But, uh, and he got into a lot of that.

1032
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,060
He got into a lot of trouble for that.

1033
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,120
But he was really funny, and he was a hipster.

1034
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,800
And I have a recording of one of his last performances, which was in Fort Worth.

1035
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,080
I recorded it myself. It's pretty bad.

1036
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:28,280
But he really, he would talk like a speed freak, where he would go off on so many, he'd start off on one subject, go off on a million branching side paths, and then work his way back into that main thing.

1037
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,540
He'd tie up every loose end, so that by the end of it, you were going,

1038
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:34,440
well, he might be a speed freak, but he's good at it.

1039
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,880
Well, it's a thought, Fred.

1040
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,700
It don't make no difference.

1041
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:44,260
The only reason the Russians are appearingly ahead of us in scientific development is cause they want to get out of their country a whole lot worse than us.

1042
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,140
Let's hope they do get to the moon and all go.

1043
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,280
And, uh, probably with our luck, you know, trying to get to the moon, it'll be a half moon, we'll miss it.

1044
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,480
Wouldn't that be weird?

1045
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,000
Of course, a lot of folks say, well, what do you believe in, Brother Dave?

1046
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,120
I say, I believe in everything.

1047
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,440
You don't mean that.

1048
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:03,680
Yes.

1049
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,400
Even that?

1050
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:04,700
Yes.

1051
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,100
Yes, I, yes, yes, I do.

1052
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,380
I believe in everything that exists in this whole planet Earth.

1053
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:17,260
I believe in every philosophy, every religion, every ideology, everything that exists.

1054
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,340
And that don't give me no room for no arguments.

1055
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,880
If the world is wrong, then right your own self.

1056
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,160
That's something to think about, sure.

1057
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,980
Frankly, I believe in love and charity and goodness and kindness.

1058
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,680
And I believe if a man's down, kick him.

1059
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:35,660
That's right.

1060
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,480
If he survives it, he has an opportunity to rise above it.

1061
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,260
I've always said it's more blessed to give than to receive.

1062
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,340
And two friends get together and start giving.

1063
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,180
They're bound to receive something out of it.

1064
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:52,860
Hallelujah.

1065
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,500
Joy to the world.

1066
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,540
Well, I mean, it's good because, I mean, there's a lot of things.

1067
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,420
These investigating committees, they're all investigating somebody.

1068
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,720
Because they ain't got time to investigate their own self.

1069
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,440
That's right.

1070
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:10,780
I mean, it's, uh, uh, sitting investigating committee shows on TV is just like another type quiz show.

1071
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,920
Only difference is if a contestant answers a question right, beloved, he loses.

1072
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,220
That's right.

1073
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,980
But when they get through investigating everybody, then you know what we ought to do?

1074
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,740
And what I think we're gonna do?

1075
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,260
We're gonna investigate them.

1076
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:26,880
That's right.

1077
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:27,500
That's right.

1078
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,980
Find out how they can spend $100,000 to get a little old job at Paysons.

1079
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:30,980


1080
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,560
And then they can spend $22,500 a year.

1081
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,540
See who they gonna get even with.

1082
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,480
Okay, now who's this other caller?

1083
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,140
Uh, who's... I don't know, does she have caraway sheets on him?

1084
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,180
There's a caller back there on the line lurking.

1085
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,540
Here's yet a third caller.

1086
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:46,960
He's here.

1087
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,640
Of course, it's me.

1088
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:49,900
Caller Green.

1089
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,780
Is that, uh, is that Reverend Angry Larry?

1090
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:53,980
Yes, it is.

1091
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:00,500
I was watching Pimp My Ride on MTV and all of a sudden it dawned on me, oh, I'm supposed to be on the radio.

1092
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,800
Yeah, you are on the radio.

1093
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,820
And there's another person on the radio now.

1094
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:06,560
Wow.

1095
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:10,420
Wow, you know, you could imagine like we were in some self-inflated dirigible,

1096
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,020
crashing over many like quaint little towns, you know.

1097
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:18,720
Now, Reverend Angry Larry is in the, uh, no, we're actually, we're in a satellite going backwards around the earth looking down.

1098
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,440
But Reverend Angry Larry's in Detroit with the amino acids, right?

1099
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,240
Yeah.

1100
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,420
Now, what is your relation to that band?

1101
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,260
Uh, well, essentially I just work for them.

1102
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,280
Right.

1103
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,860
You're like a gropey, roadie, gropey or whatnot.

1104
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,540
I just make sure that things go well.

1105
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,080
At least I try anyway.

1106
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,160
Now, I understand you.

1107
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:43,080
Oh, what a terrible job to have to have because, you know, if things don't go well, then you didn't do it.

1108
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,940
I thought he was kind of like the...

1109
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,640
Well, there's lots of things that I don't do well and that would be one of them sometimes.

1110
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:54,600
Well, shit, there you got a whole job description in itself and I think it should be in the occupation code and it should be an entry level position.

1111
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,580
Dave, we're not after midnight.

1112
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:57,620
Oh.

1113
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:03,280
Well, don't sound like Ted Nugent because you said that and I don't really care.

1114
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:12,500
Yes, I, yes, I, you know, and people in Detroit might be able to, you know, say that, see, Ted owned his own radio station here while he bought a radio station here in Detroit.

1115
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,920
Well, I mean, because he's from Michigan here.

1116
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:23,940
So, I mean, he, uh, he took over this station and for probably about a month, that's all you heard.

1117
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,440
He did the morning show and he didn't play much music.

1118
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,020
But he used to sit in the studio and talk a lot and play his guitar.

1119
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,280
Oh, that's terrible.

1120
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:32,780
You know.

1121
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,280
But your voice is, is very similar over, over the years.

1122
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,720
Well, see, he's actually been, he's not really a Michigan original.

1123
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,160
He's, he's from Kentucky, right?

1124
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:55,300
Now, we've pointed out that Lonesome Cowboy Dave was imitated by Mel Gibson for that movie Conspiracy Theory in which Mel actually wears a, a wooly hat like Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1125
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,100
Has the nervous on the ear.

1126
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:03,680
Manner is, I'm sorry, you know, talking that, that Dave-ish, uh, uh, in slave-ish way.

1127
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,420
Well, when he's, when it's that one Dave coming through.

1128
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,260
That's that particular character.

1129
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,080
How long, how long have you guys been on the air live now?

1130
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:13,780
About ten minutes.

1131
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:14,220
Yeah.

1132
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:14,900
Really?

1133
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:15,520
I mean.

1134
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,240
It's only been a few minutes.

1135
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,420
There's actually four on the, on the line now.

1136
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,040
Especially this year.

1137
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,780
And this is in the one voice, by the way.

1138
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,140
This is Reverend Dave the lawyer.

1139
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:28,140
How many Daves do we have on this line?

1140
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,460
The Daves of our lives.

1141
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,500
These are the Daves of our lives.

1142
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,120
Somebody's gone.

1143
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,140
Well, there went one of them.

1144
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,400
Well, I'll see you, Don.

1145
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,420
I'm still here.

1146
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,240
Someone's gone.

1147
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,380
I could, I, all of a sudden I heard the, uh.

1148
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,740
The rhythm track.

1149
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,220
How many Daves do we have now?

1150
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:44,640
There's no rhythm track.

1151
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,620
There's no Dave.

1152
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,680
I'm, I'm Reverend Dave the lawyer.

1153
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,840
Now, are you from Durban, South Africa?

1154
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,200
No, no, no.

1155
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,120
I'm, I'm from South Africa.

1156
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:53,900
I'm from right here.

1157
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,400
From the island of Christ itself.

1158
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,100
You don't know where you're from.

1159
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,200
Is that not tuned?

1160
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:05,540
I'm lost.

1161
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,840
He's broadcasting right from where he's sitting right now.

1162
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,200
I'm lost.

1163
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:10,820
I'm lost.

1164
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:16,500
I'm trying to get, I'm trying to get some, um, um, questions asked and absolution here.

1165
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:19,000
And, and, and I don't know what may be absolute.

1166
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,240
Well, this isn't really the best thing.

1167
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,100
This isn't the best religion in the world.

1168
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:23,100


1169
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:28,880
If you're looking for Sukor and so forth, you know, Bob helps those who helps themselves.

1170
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:37,580
I called an ex tonight and I told her I loved her and she said, you know, like nice things,

1171
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,040
but she didn't say she loved me.

1172
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,720
So what do you think?

1173
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:41,900
That was your ex?

1174
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:42,720
Ex.

1175
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,160
Move on, man.

1176
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,540
There's more fish in the sea.

1177
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:49,040
There's huge squid the size of elephants down there.

1178
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,060
I bet it's going to be a weekly thing, a live show.

1179
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,180
No, I don't think so.

1180
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:54,720
We don't.

1181
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,760
Look, here's the thing.

1182
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:56,280
I don't want to be.

1183
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,520
If the ratings go up, it may.

1184
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:05,640
Look, the sweeps go all the way to the, um, to the, um, second step of the basement now.

1185
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,180
That's great.

1186
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:12,940
Well, you know, I did, uh, I've engineered the hour of slack out of Dallas for 10 years

1187
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,260
or something as sitting at the board running thing.

1188
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,980
I got really used to it and that was real fun.

1189
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:21,960
And, and then, uh, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then,

1190
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:22,040


1191
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,360
uh, the extra jacked up headphones so you could hear through the hearing aid.

1192
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,580
But you always had to be around on Sunday night.

1193
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,740
That's the problem, you know?

1194
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:34,320
But whereas I used to mail them to WCSB and I didn't have to be here for Sunday nights.

1195
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,020
Right.

1196
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:39,880
And plus, I didn't know how to work the phone, you know, plus chas would work the phone.

1197
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:40,480
It's a lot of fun.

1198
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,480
Maybe once a month, do it this way.

1199
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:49,220
I can bring my ministry to the, uh, the church, my ministry of the church forward then.

1200
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,040
Well, that's what...

1201
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,020
You're still just a lawyer, right?

1202
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:51,720
Yeah.

1203
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,880
Well, you could bring the second coming of justice to the world.

1204
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:59,240
Well, my dog is named Bob, and it's the second coming of Dobbs.

1205
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,580
I swear to God it is.

1206
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,080
Only somebody who had a dog named Bob would try and rejuvenate him.

1207
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,280
Now, listen, speaking of Bob and lawyers,

1208
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:11,940
has anybody seen that Enzyme sex pill commercial or 10 commercials?

1209
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,260
I posted a picture of that guy on Praise Bob.

1210
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,620
Oh, that was you that did that?

1211
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:17,220
Yes.

1212
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,940
Okay, so which one of you guys have the funny little light-bulb-backed-dead booties,

1213
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,440
like the weird slippers that come up like Aladdin and stuff?

1214
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:23,940
No, no, no.

1215
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,940
What we're trying to talk about is make a million bucks suing some company

1216
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,040
for using what's obviously our trademark figure.

1217
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,260
They're using the Bob head.

1218
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:32,740
Oh, yeah.

1219
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,320
Yes, I know what you're talking about, the smiling-faced man.

1220
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,660
Yeah, and he's called.

1221
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,940
And he goes in, and he's, like, happy now.

1222
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,800
Well, because he has a racing motor.

1223
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,200
And he goes in the pool, and his pants come off in the pool,

1224
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:46,160
and he comes out of the pool and waves and smiles.

1225
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,620
Right, well, they call him Bob.

1226
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:47,800
Oh, yeah.

1227
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,780
Something is Bobbing.

1228
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:50,900
Let's go after them, then.

1229
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,320
How could I have let this go by?

1230
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,560
I just thought, well, the world was just, like, crumbling,

1231
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,180
and that was another part of it, you know what I mean?

1232
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,120
This goes deeper.

1233
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,700
I know you're at an hour's ending, but this goes deeper,

1234
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,300
and this is important to the ministry.

1235
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,960
If you get enough e-mails of enhancement,

1236
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,820
and if you get enough e-mails of enhancement,

1237
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,700
you don't have to take the drugs.

1238
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,840
It works just with the e-mails.

1239
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:14,020
I thought you were going to say something legal about this infringement.

1240
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:17,280
And he's saying that if you get enough Viagra ads in your e-mail,

1241
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,560
you'll actually get a raging erection.

1242
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,280
Exactly.

1243
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:21,260
Exactly.

1244
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,880
That's more important than the legal stuff.

1245
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,140
That was a subtle point, Drew.

1246
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,760
Well, actually, this hour of slack is ending.

1247
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,760
There is no more slack available,

1248
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:33,960
although we do have some PSAs coming up.

1249
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,560
Just coming to a dreary close.

1250
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,460
And so, my friends,

1251
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:43,500
if you need more information about the Church of the Subgenius,

1252
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,920
you can certainly check subgenius.com

1253
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,320
or write post office box 204-206.

1254
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,140
Austin, Texas 78720.

1255
00:58:53,960 --> 00:59:00,100
We have here Lonesome Larry and Angry Cowboy Dave.

1256
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:01,880
Incontinent werewolf Dean.

1257
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,900
He's with me too, but he's sleeping right now.

1258
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,120
And Princess Wee.

1259
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,900
But now we have to say goodbye to all the callers.

1260
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:08,200
Goodbye.

1261
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,400
Goodbye.

1262
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,220
Goodbye.

1263
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,460
All right.

1264
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,360
We can keep talking, though, after we say goodbye.

1265
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,320
No, we can't.

1266
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,200
It's going away now.

1267
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:18,680
Okay.

1268
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,820
Many, many.

1269
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:20,580
Yeah, you can.

1270
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,520
Okay, that was a fade out.

1271
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:24,060
They're gone.

1272
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:24,980
I'm out of here.

1273
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,260
Praise Bob.

1274
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,800
I'm out of here.

1275
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:37,060
Improving end-of-life care.

1276
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,760
A practical way to deal with serious illness.

1277
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:44,940
That's the subject of a free online course called

1278
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:49,140
Finding Our Way, Living with Dying in America.

1279
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:54,560
The course, based on a national newspaper series of the same name,

1280
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,480
can help people by providing practical information

1281
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,500
on advanced illness and end-of-life issues.

1282
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,420
The course can be started at any time of the year.

1283
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:11,880
The online course is at www.scu.edu

1284
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:16,540
slash F-O-W for Finding Our Way.

1285
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,120

1289

1290

Thank you.

1291
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,200
It's our job to tell them.
