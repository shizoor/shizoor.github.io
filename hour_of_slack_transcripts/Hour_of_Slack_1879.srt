1
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:24,820
Yes, I know exactly how that poor listener feels.

2
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:33,740
Tonight, your host, Reverend Ivan Stang, is too busy with life, the universe, and everything to blather out a new show.

3
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:42,220
Plus, I already underwent two podcast interviews in the last two weeks, so maybe I'll play those in the future.

4
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,300
But, this is the past.

5
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,220
It's October 11th, 2003.

6
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,220
And we're listening to Overman First Degree.

7
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,740
Dr.

8
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:04,760
Philo Drummond, the sole guest that night in the KPFA Berkeley studio of The Puzzling Evidence Show.

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,240
Where we say, bring it on.

10
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,380
Because that's the way we roll.

11
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,420
On The Puzzling Evidence Show.

12
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,140
Great check.

13
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,560
Great check.

14
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,380
Okay.

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,300
Great check.

16
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,380
Wow, that's an ancient memory.

17
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,040
Great check.

18
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,960
That's what you get when you talk to a machine in the middle of the night.

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,900
Great check.

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,600
Okay.

21
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,660
Wow.

22
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,920
I think there's Charlie.

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,060
Charlie, is that you?

24
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,320
Charlie.

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:58,560


26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,240
Come down out of that hallway.

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,060
Lift yourself up by your own petards.

28
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,540
Computers don't laugh.

29
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:13,880
Okay.

30
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,020
That's better.

31
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,180
Regain your composure.

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
Regain your composure.

33
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,120
Okay.

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,120


35
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,120


36
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,020
I think that's better.

37
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,120
Yeah.

38
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,060


39
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:30,220


40
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:43,420
You think you can pull up on my feet?

41
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:43,420


42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:43,600


43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:43,600


44
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:43,860
And you?

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,520
Yeah.

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:46,560
I can.

47
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:46,680
I can.

48
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,680


49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,680


50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,680


51
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,680


52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:46,700
I can.

53
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:46,700


54
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:46,700


55
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:46,700


56
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:46,700


57
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:46,700


58
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:46,700


59
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:46,700


60
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:46,700


61
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,200
I can.

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,380
I can.

63
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,580

you have to prime the government with a lot of money to get and you put the you put the money

pathetic government art world

80
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,380
you know that something a lot of people don't know about but i'm going to go ahead and say it

81
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,060
because i remember

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,860
it today

83
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:55,840
you know something that bob really hates is he he hates dashes he hates to see things with

84
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,980
dashes in it so don't put a dash in the words we're putting dashes in your words would you stop

85
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:09,220
that i'm asking you that because it's not dobbs approved dashes are not at least some dashes most

86
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,100
dashes are not dobbs approved bob hates the unsettling transitional ambiguity that they

87
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,340
have been in the past and i'm not going to stop that i'm not going to stop that i'm not going to

88
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,360
advise a cop not to hire you to use dashedes

89
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,620
please i implore you don't use dashes inappropriately

90
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,720
only in a dobbs fashion if you can't remember what that is you just have to get your

91
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,600
manuals out turned to dobbs ecclesians 12 first

92
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,220
are grabbed to touch the door while five drivers approach them

93
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,540
yeah it's that little churchy stuff

94
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,040
but

95
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,500
Just don't use dashes, please.

96
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,940
Stay away from dashes.

97
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,140
Be all right.

98
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,640
If you went in doubt, kick the dash out.

99
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,120
That's what Bob says.

100
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,100
I love this old tune.

101
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,280
It brings me back to the old days, you know,

102
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,080
back in the swamp,

103
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,020
when me and...

104
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,920
Motel and Annie.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Me and Junior and Bubba were back there

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,760
sitting on those old oil drums

107
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,860
filled with oxygen.

108
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,200
Little Junior.

109
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,380
Little Bubba.

110
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,880
Just sitting there like a couple of old,

111
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,780
little kids.

112
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,020
You know, the...

113
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,300
Okay, thanks.

114
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,880
Yeah, we're just killing time here on the show.

115
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,700
Yeah, well, that's good.

116
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,800
Killing time is fine.

117
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,180
Bark people are killing time,

118
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,400
but it's unions against management,

119
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,920
and, you know, people have to get something done sometimes

120
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,060
to deal with the management.

121
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:39,700
That's true.

122
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,240
Thank you, guys.

123
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,080
Hang in there.

124
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,700
It's true.

125
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,880
It's all true.

126
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,560
People got to do

127
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,600
what they got to do.

128
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,360
And we just have to make...

129
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,080
And they got to do

130
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,900
what people tell them to do.

131
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,180
Because sometimes

132
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,860
you don't get to do

133
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,660
what you personally want to do

134
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,400
because you got to do

135
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,040
what the group says you got to do,

136
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,640
and that's more important sometimes.

137
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,220
And just to, you know,

138
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,580
that's what you're paying for.

139
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,240
That's the important thing to remember.

140
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,240
And so...

141
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,520
And there's people there that are experts,

142
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,940
so you got to leave it to the experts sometimes

143
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,760
to put things in line.

144
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,120
And make it right for everybody.

145
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,760
I think we can all agree that

146
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,080
we have confidence in our experts

147
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,340
to do what's right for us,

148
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,980
the non-experts.

149
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,240
I'm an expert at non-expertise.

150
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,740
That's where I try to concentrate my area of focus,

151
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,460
is in those non-expertise areas.

152
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,000
And I think that's where we're at.

153
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,780
Yeah, and on this show,

154
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,400
at this time,

155
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,620
we have to let off steam

156
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,120
to help the public.

157
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,020
Yeah, we like to help the public.

158
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,160
We really like helping the public.

159
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,540
Our job here is to help the public

160
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,020
understand things

161
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,720
in a non-ambiguous,

162
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,300
less vague,

163
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,540
more elucidating...

164
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,480
We like to elucidate the language

165
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,900
in a way that makes it

166
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,540
easier to understand.

167
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:13,540


168
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:13,540


169
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:13,540


170
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,940
Easier for people,

171
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,820
people,

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,340
to understand.

173
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,520
Oh, people, yeah, people.

174
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,980
To absorb, to process,

175
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,200
to get in their ears

176
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,520
and make their brain

177
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,420
see it

178
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,940
with their eyes

179
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,540
that are on their eye teeth.

180
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,100
Oh, there we go.

181
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,540
Ooh, that's just nasty, though.

182
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,700
Don't look at it.

183
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,120
No, no.

184
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:43,720
Do that.

185
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,120
Okay, I'll wash your dishes.

186
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,960
Okay, I'll wash your dishes.

187
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:10,840
Oh, yeah.

188
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,340
The nipples, tongue, neck, and lips may be utilized...

189
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,840
In ghost time?

190
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,440
Yep.

191
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,180
Yeah, as we were talking about earlier about those little guys.

192
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,440
These poor ghosts.

193
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,880
And that one 420 guy thinks that they don't even have a sex.

194
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,560
They're sexless.

195
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,580
He thinks that ghosts, somehow when people die, they don't retain their sex.

196
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,880
Like a gun.

197
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,940
Like a god?

198
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,740
A gun.

199
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,840
Well, like a gun.

200
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,160
Yeah, like a gun.

201
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,660
But you would be the same little ghost you were before?

202
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,380
I would be me.

203
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,080
Yeah.

204
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,220
I'd be part of you.

205
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,020
I would hope I wouldn't have to wear glasses anymore when I'm a ghost.

206
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,580
Really?

207
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,140
Do you think we'd have to wear glasses when we're wandering around in the ether zone?

208
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,320
We'd have to have ghost glasses.

209
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,400
When we're ectoplasm.

210
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,800
People that made the ghost glasses.

211
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,320
It would get rather confusing.

212
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,540
I always wondered about that.

213
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,500
When you would see a ghost.

214
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,740
Because you've got all the stuff, you know, when you become a ghost.

215
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,420
So you're ready to go.

216
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,800
Unless you didn't have your glasses on.

217
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,200
Yeah, that would be a bummer.

218
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,200
If you died without your glasses on, you're wandering around forever bumping into stuff.

219
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,000
Ghost furniture.

220
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,460
It was a good time.

221
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,920
Just gets more.

222
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,980
So you have to die with the stuff you're going to take with you.

223
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,480
Yeah.

224
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,280
Otherwise...

225
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,900
That's why Indians would burn the teepee full of things.

226
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,780
So what about...

227
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,200
Should you carry a few dollars on you just in case?

228
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,600
Probably.

229
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,380
And clean underwear like your mom said.

230
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:46,640
Yeah.

231
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:46,880
Always.

232
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,040
Because that's all very...

233
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,720
Two pair.

234
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,460
Should always wear two pairs of underwear.

235
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:51,840
Why?

236
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,680
Because then the outer one burns away as you go into it.

237
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,180
Well, no.

238
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,740
Because then you don't have to change underwear for eight days.

239
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,620
Oh.

240
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,940
You just inside, outside, front side, back side.

241
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,720
Then the next pair over the front pair.

242
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,160
Right.

243
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,920
Inside, outside, front side, back side.

244
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,720
So you've got...

245
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,020
Yeah.

246
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,440
Eight days of continuous wearing that way.

247
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,660
You don't want to...

248
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,500
No.

249
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,480
You don't want to go out on a motorcade because then you go into the future world with...

250
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,240
Depending on which theory you have, no brain or some brain.

251
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:17,940
Yeah.

252
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,740
Not really enough brain to do a good job.

253
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,920
I can't imagine like when I'm walking up to JFK and shaking his hand, he's just drooling

254
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,760
all over himself.

255
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,240
Yeah.

256
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,900
And you're thinking, this guy, this guy, he's so crazy.

257
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,340
I want to hear about what I'm supposed to do for my country.

258
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,060
Yeah.

259
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,260
And you're just drooling in your drool bucket.

260
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,820
Yeah.

261
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,360
Yeah.

262
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,020
It's pretty nasty.

263
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,620
That will be nasty.

264
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,100
So nasty.

265
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,400
So nasty.

266
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:39,520
So nasty.

267
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,480
But people like Washington...

268
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,760
Washington and Roosevelt, they'll be fine.

269
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,540
So you can go and walk, talk to them.

270
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,000
I would like to talk to those guys.

271
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,520
Yeah, Jefferson.

272
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,320
They're cool.

273
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,660
I want to hear some of the stuff they got to...

274
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,440
What they've been thinking all these years.

275
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:50,740
Yeah.

276
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,280
It's just we can't talk to Lincoln and Kennedy.

277
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,780
Watching their thing that they made, seeing what happened to it.

278
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,400
Yeah.

279
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
Because they hang around and ghost.

280
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,300
You know, I'd like to talk to this old Ben Franklin.

281
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,940
He's the one guy that signed everything.

282
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,160
Yeah.

283
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,000
He signed every major document that was to be signed that put this country in motion.

284
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,200
And he did lots of things.

285
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,360
He's a very interesting guy.

286
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,660
Actually, I'm listening to his autobiography right now.

287
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,660
It's one of those free books you can get...

288
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,240
What?

289
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,560
Out on the internet.

290
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,300
What?

291
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,740
Free?

292
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,500
It's free because it's in the public domain.

293
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,900
And we own that book now.

294
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,720
We do the public in our domain.

295
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,940
And a place like archive.org is one of them, I believe.

296
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,540
Or another one is...

297
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,360
Is the Gutenberg Project.

298
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,500
Wow.

299
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,560
You can get the text of that in either one of those places.

300
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,200
There's a place called LibriVox where you can get the audio version of that.

301
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,600
Wow.

302
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,700
If you want just to listen to it in an MP3 file, you can listen to it that way.

303
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,140
With no bark.

304
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,820
That's pretty cool.

305
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,340
Yeah.

306
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,240
That's what I did.

307
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,200
I downloaded it so I can listen to it at my leisure.

308
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,360
Speaking of which, I'm reading Zealot right now.

309
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,180
That's pretty wonderful.

310
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:08,840
It's...

311
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,600
Who Jesus was and the times he lived in.

312
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,600
Interesting.

313
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,620
Really fun.

314
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,260
I like Jesus times.

315
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,260
Yeah, me too.

316
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,860
Stories.

317
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,300
Because I don't really know much about it.

318
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,080
And the tapes are all wooden so they don't have players anymore.

319
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:23,880
Yeah.

320
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,620
Yeah, interesting times, those Zealot times.

321
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,760
Those early religions.

322
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,380
Those true believers.

323
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,660
Yep, true believers.

324
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,300
We got lots of true believers around today, I'm afraid.

325
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,100
Yeah.

326
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,080
Just like then.

327
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,100
Yeah, just like then.

328
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,020
Because at one point...

329
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:47,240
The guy weaves, the author weaves all the true believer leaders strolling around that area at that time.

330
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,520
There were a lot of true believers.

331
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:48,880
Yeah.

332
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,040
And that's part of the wonderful thing.

333
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:59,580
How did this guy get chosen as the one true believer that would go do the field goal, do the next thousand years of points in the game?

334
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,040
Because he's the guy that was willing to take the ball and run with it.

335
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,160
And get nailed to a stick.

336
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,320
That's...

337
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,900
You got...

338
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,620
That's, you know...

339
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,320
Boy, if you have that kind of motivation...

340
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,940
That's at the end and he knew it.

341
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,040
He knew it.

342
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,920
So, you know...

343
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,240
It's like, here's the deal.

344
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,460
You get to have this for a little while, but...

345
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,020
Yeah.

346
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,840
Later on...

347
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,400
But also, that's the motivation because that's sort of like...

348
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,440
That's why I shot Bob.

349
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,460
If the guy's willing to...

350
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,980
You know, if he can't whoop it, he goes down for the religion.

351
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,640
I think that propels the whole thing into the future.

352
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,520
At some point in time, every one of them's got to go down for the big game.

353
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,160
You know?

354
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,780
It's just the nature of the...

355
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,040
Right.

356
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,540
They can only spike the ball for so long.

357
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,380
Yeah.

358
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,920
And then you got to kick a field goal.

359
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:39,920


360
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:39,920


361
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,740
Yeah, right.

362
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,420
And at some point in time, you know...

363
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,200
The bad...

364
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,380
The enemy, the opponent is going to scrimmage.

365
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,260
Yeah.

366
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,800
And they're going to cross the line of scrimmage before you.

367
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,280
And somebody's going to throw a penalty.

368
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,940
And hopefully, you're going to come out ahead at the end.

369
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,560
Because, you know, the way it works out...

370
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,900
If you ask any football player what the secret of winning is...

371
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,280
He'll tell you.

372
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,000
You just got to score more points.

373
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:08,860
Really?

374
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,820
You just got to score.

375
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,540
You just got to score more points.

376
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,760
That's all there is.

377
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,200
I thought it was some elaborate truth.

378
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:13,880
No, no.

379
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,160
It's a really simple formula.

380
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:15,860
Whoa.

381
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,120
You got to score more points than your opponent.

382
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,600
And then you'll win.

383
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,780
It's that simple.

384
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,260
Okay.

385
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:22,980
I'm writing this down.

386
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,580
You can memorize that.

387
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,160
S-K-O.

388
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,100
If you know the score...

389
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,700
Score.

390
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,100
So, you should always look up the...

391
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,220
S-K-O-R-E board.

392
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:40,660
Yeah.

393
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,600
Reality.

394
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,760
Oh, it's like the formula for success here?

395
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,120
Yeah.

396
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,500
Yeah.

397
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
In the subgenius business class.

398
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:48,700
You know the score.

399
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,460
You'll be scoring all along the way.

400
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,380
Yeah.

401
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,880
So, okay.

402
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,280
Scoring.

403
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,560
Speaking of scoring, did you score?

404
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,780
I think so.

405
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,300
Oh, good.

406
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:56,580
Good.

407
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,880
I don't really know until I look at the computer.

408
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,800
Okay.

409
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,140
I can't...

410
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,920
That's the other thing.

411
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,000
If you're far from your computer when you die, it might be a virtual suicide.

412
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,440
I'm going to put my computer on my phone.

413
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:09,920
I'm going to put my computer on my phone.

414
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:09,920


415
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:09,920


416
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:09,920


417
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,920
And just in a hat.

418
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,040
And then put your phone on your forehead.

419
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,380
And then I'll wear my phone on my forehead.

420
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:14,600
Yeah.

421
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,600
Like a Methuselah.

422
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,700
In a little...

423
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,920
A special hat.

424
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,400
Yeah.

425
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,220
That holds it.

426
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,760
That holds it.

427
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,260
A tinfoil hat that holds it so you're ready to go.

428
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,060
And it'll send signals out to everyone around me that says, here's his status now.

429
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,440
He's ready.

430
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:30,720
Yeah.

431
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,160
You're reminding me of, I think, the Millennium or one of the end of the world things that

432
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,300
happened in the last few years.

433
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,160
This guy started doing great insurance for that.

434
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,900
Like taking care of his family.

435
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:39,900


436
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:39,900


437
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:39,900


438
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:39,900


439
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:39,900


440
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:39,900


441
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,020
Yeah.

442
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,400
And taking care of your pets and your kids and all the people that weren't blessed that

443
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,160
weren't going to make it.

444
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:44,480
You know?

445
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,140
You could set aside some money to take care of them.

446
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,460
Oh, yeah.

447
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,940
What about old Harold Camping?

448
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,400
I heard him on the radio the other day.

449
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,040
He's still alive.

450
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,020
But was it him or the millions of tapes?

451
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,100
Just like other religions I know that...

452
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,860
No.

453
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,080
He was talking about current stuff.

454
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,340
He was still...

455
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:01,820
He still...

456
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,580
He must be like 95 now.

457
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,020
Yeah.

458
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,880
He's old.

459
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,660
And he still rocks on the radio.

460
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,700
And he still sounds like this.

461
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:09,880
Yeah.

462
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:09,880


463
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:09,880


464
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:09,880


465
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:09,880


466
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:09,880


467
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:09,880


468
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:09,880


469
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:09,880


470
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:09,880


471
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,160
Yeah.

472
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,440
I mean, he's talking about Jesus and the devil coming back and Satan is the story and

473
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,100
the sons of man.

474
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,540
I can't believe it.

475
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,600
That's the stuff we want to hear.

476
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,060
He hasn't gone yet.

477
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,540
Harold?

478
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:26,540


479
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,880
610, I think, is the AM.

480
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,420
The AM.

481
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:30,840
Yeah.

482
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,240
Yeah.

483
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,280
Yeah.

484
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:32,620
I used to...

485
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,320
Before I knew who he was, I used to listen for hours out in the desert, driving along,

486
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,140
listening to Harold.

487
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,520
I like those old preachers.

488
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,100
With the rhythm they have.

489
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,600
His rhythm was...

490
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,880
Would get a little bit...

491
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,800
Ragged.

492
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,600
Yeah.

493
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:47,860
Yeah.

494
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,980
That's okay.

495
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,360
He's...

496
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,940
He's old enough to kind of have met God or something.

497
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,240
I'm trying to remember the one I used to really like listening to when he died not too long

498
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,560
ago.

499
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,720
I can't remember his name.

500
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,320
That's sad that I brought that subject up and I can't even remember.

501
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,840
That's so sad.

502
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,120
Okay.

503
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,500
I'm going to go on the punishment list.

504
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:09,500


505
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,080
I'm going to have to wait on the wheel for a while.

506
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,680
I'll be right back.

507
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,080
Yeah.

508
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,080


509
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,080


510
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,080


511
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,080


512
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,080


513
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,680
Oh.

514
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,840
Oh.

515
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,020


516
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,040
Oh.

517
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,560
Oh.

518
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,940
Oh.

519
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,180


520
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,080
Oh.

521
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,140
Oh.

522
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,140


523
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,140


524
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,140


525
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,120
Oh.

526
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,120


527
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,120


528
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,180
Oh.

529
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,240
Oh.

530
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,240


531
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,240


532
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,300
Oh.

533
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,060
Oh.

534
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,080
Oh.

535
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,080
Oh.

536
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:49,820


537
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:53,480


538
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:53,680


539
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,160


540
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:54,960


541
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:55,560


542
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:55,560


543
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:55,560


544
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:55,560


545
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:55,560


546
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:55,560


547
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:55,560


548
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:55,640


549
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:55,640


550
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:55,680
Oh.

551
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:55,720
Oh.

552
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:55,980
Oh.

553
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,080
Oh.

554
00:18:59,620 --> 00:18:59,700
Oh.

555
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,240
Oh.

556
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:01,740
Oh.

557
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,140
Oh.

558
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,700
Oh.

559
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,260
Oh.

560
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,920
A distinct smell as you came up in the ferry boat captain.

561
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,480
And he used the monstrous ship into its little landing.

562
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,540
It was great stuff.

563
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,580
There's something salutary about being out on the water early in the morning.

564
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,240
Like I always thought the way, the best way to go to work in San Francisco from the side would be on the ferry.

565
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,640
To see the city at dawn, yeah.

566
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,640
Even at a day of work, that's a nice way to start.

567
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,840
I see him over here.

568
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,360
Oh, sorry.

569
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,500
I had the wrong Al.

570
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,340
You thought I was Dr. Hal.

571
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
I'll show you Hal right now.

572
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:48,760
Yeah.

573
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,480
He's supposed to be calling in, isn't he?

574
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,140
Yeah.

575
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,500
But there's a mystery.

576
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,160
Why would he need to be calling in?

577
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,480
I think it's a conspiracy that he's not calling in.

578
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,860
Why would he have to call in?

579
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,900
Isn't he here somewhere?

580
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,320
I think he probably had the phone in his hand and he started to dial.

581
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,000
And because it's a show, he just went.

582
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,120
Uh-huh.

583
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,480
And he's.

584
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,480
But maybe he put the phone like this.

585
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,060
If his brain would stop thinking about the show, then he would just wake up.

586
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,300
He would wake up and he'd be drawing pictures again.

587
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,680
Yeah.

588
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,780
And working really hard.

589
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,800
He'd be working hard.

590
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,000
And making money.

591
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,620
But instead.

592
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,560
Making money.

593
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,480
If you think about, if you're Hal.

594
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,120
Drawing money.

595
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,100
Drawing money.

596
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,480
Hal's a good artist, so he just draws his money.

597
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:25,860
Yeah.

598
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,920
And then he gives it to the people to give back to him at the Ask Dr. Hal show Friday night.

599
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,300
Right.

600
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,720
Tomorrow.

601
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,280
The main thing is he gives it to the, he's giving to the people.

602
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,040
He is?

603
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,240
That's what we do here on the Puzzling Evidence Show.

604
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,860
We do.

605
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,200
We give our words.

606
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:39,600
Yeah.

607
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,660
Here's some more words for you.

608
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,700
Here, we'll give you another four.

609
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,600
This is 420, so after this would be 40 minutes of words.

610
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,380
Because you know what?

611
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,640
We don't want to grow up on the show.

612
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,100
But you know, we have the gift of discernment here on the show.

613
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,640
We do?

614
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,960
And the gift of knowledge.

615
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,560
Because this is what we gather up.

616
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,220
The anointing oil.

617
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,420
The anointing oil.

618
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,400
The prayer cloths.

619
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,580
Yeah, I wish you guys would send out the prayer cloths.

620
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,100
Prayer cloths.

621
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,900
Would you send those back?

622
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,440
To the people that need those?

623
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:16,760
Yeah.

624
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,460
We always send them back, yeah.

625
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,260
If you'd send those back, we can get your prayers answered.

626
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,820
Because then Bob makes stuff happen on them and gives them back to you.

627
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,980
He makes stuff happen on them.

628
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,220
And that is true.

629
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,660
Pastor David Epley is one of my favorites.

630
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,100
He's one of my favorites.

631
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,460
I'm trying to remember.

632
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,440
I remember that one of those other ones that, gosh, he was from Chicago.

633
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,460
Famous Chicago evangelist.

634
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,280
Yeah.

635
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,320
Epley was from Texas?

636
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,020
He was from Florida.

637
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,420
Somewhere in like St. Petersburg or Tampa.

638
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,320
I can't remember.

639
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,120
Out around Victorville, there are lots of little churches.

640
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:06,340
I guess you can make your house and your holy, holy sepulcher.

641
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:06,700
One.

642
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,700
No, not sepulcher.

643
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,580
But your holy clinic.

644
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,580
And if it's attached to the house, there's a tax world that happens there that's nice.

645
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,760
So way out in the desert are all these different fundamentals here in the desert.

646
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,480
Which up until recently was pretty far out there.

647
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:32,500
But it always seems like every time you drive from east toward Victorville and on 15.

648
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,960
So just everything.

649
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,300
So many of us.

650
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,320
Growing and growing and growing.

651
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:36,900
Growing, growing.

652
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,540
Growing.

653
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,000
Growing.

654
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:39,960
Growing.

655
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,460
Growing and growing.

656
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,000
Every little crossroads now is strip malls every place.

657
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,780
But that's the way it goes, I guess.

658
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,020
And that's why we love going to the desert.

659
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,040
Remember that guy, Creflo Dollar?

660
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,920
No.

661
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,880
Creflo Dollar, Reverend Creflo Dollar from Georgia.

662
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,580
Wow.

663
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,920
He drove a Rolls Royce.

664
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,320
He was a prosperity preacher.

665
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:04,940
Remember?

666
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,340
He was.

667
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,420
He said dollars are good.

668
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,100
Dollars are good.

669
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,500
He's kind of like Reverend Ike.

670
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,240
Remember him?

671
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,020
Yeah.

672
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,960
Now retired, Reverend Ike owns a fleet of mink-appointed Rolls Royces.

673
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,360
He said, the best thing you can do for the poor is not be one of them.

674
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,000
Oh.

675
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,860
Whoa.

676
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,480
Yeah.

677
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,100
That's what you can do.

678
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,740
The best thing to do for the poor is become rich.

679
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,120
Yeah.

680
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,920
It makes sense.

681
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,880
It makes perfect sense.

682
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,400
Yeah.

683
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,080
That's how all those churches should be.

684
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:48,340
I think the people that have extra money should take people in and let them live in their back room or something.

685
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:48,760
Yeah.

686
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,380
Just put in some extra beds.

687
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:51,840
That's like communism.

688
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,880
Put some extra beds in.

689
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,860
They got the money.

690
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,040
Come on.

691
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,860
See, there's the money.

692
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,720
There's the money over there in those barrels.

693
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,660
Don't you know that?

694
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,960
You got to share a little.

695
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,160
Give back some.

696
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,620
Give back some.

697
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:05,620


698
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,120
You've been blessed.

699
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,360
You may have had your eyebrows tattooed on, but that's okay.

700
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,760
We don't care about that.

701
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,480
That way when you wake up, you won't feel faceless.

702
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,880
You already have a face.

703
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,060
I like the way this guy plays that.

704
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,860
It's a little bit.

705
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:33,860


706
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:33,860


707
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,380
Oh, dang.

708
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,080
Oh, my God.

709
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,220
Oh, my God.

710
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,420
You can twiddle your knobs, and you can twiddle.

711
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,180
Look, big faces up here in the windows.

712
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,160
Big faces on the windows.

713
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,640
Yeah.

714
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,360
You can twiddle the face on Twitter.

715
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,640
Yeah, on Twiddle.

716
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,460
Twiddle.

717
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,760
That's one of my favorite little arbiters of how things are going.

718
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:03,860
Oh, my God.

719
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,200
in the world is, I say on YouTube,

720
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,280
under the share bar,

721
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,820
there used to be

722
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,760
three things, and now

723
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,160
there are 13 things.

724
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,880
Like I'm thinking, Wenzek Field,

725
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,680
you'll be 60

726
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,780
points. Well, there's another one you can go to that

727
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,440
shares on all those other ones automatically.

728
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,860
So there's a sharing of a share.

729
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,400
It's always about that.

730
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,780
But eventually it'll just be Google, so you'll just

731
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,100
push the button and Google will do it all.

732
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,880
And come to your

733
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,660
house and talk to you.

734
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,200
And make that Michael Pepe or a Martini.

735
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,860
But the main thing is, you can go out

736
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,960
and sign up now.

737
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,980
On the sign-up radio.

738
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,780
I forgot about that sign-up radio.

739
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,680
I want to write down the name of that thing that

740
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,740
that one guy told us earlier, because I don't

741
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,580
want to forget that.

742
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,640
I'm going to go to my list

743
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,240
of things that I don't forget.

744
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,680
And write it there.

745
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,860
Oh, the last thing I wrote there was the name

746
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,460
of a clown.

747
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
His name is Stabby the Clown.

748
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,900
He's a clown that uses

749
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,100
a lot. He has knives in his show.

750
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,880
He's a clown with big knives.

751
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,500
Does he throw them?

752
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,220
Throws them, carries them around.

753
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,720
Stabs things with them.

754
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,220
Because he's Stabby.

755
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,520
He's Stabby the Clown.

756
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,920
Hi, Stabby!

757
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,740
Well, I'm sure

758
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,940
going to use that.

759
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,480
I could use a

760
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,760
donut right now.

761
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,340
I wish it was later.

762
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,020
There it is.

763
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,100
T-O.

764
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,600
Okay.

765
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,640
I'll remember that.

766
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,020
T-O.

767
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,200
H-T-O.

768
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,780
A little colada and milk, if you don't mind.

769
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,760
Some H-T-O.

770
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,080
So soothing.

771
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,500
Ah, so relaxing here

772
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,900
in the morning.

773
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,940
It's almost like

774
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,660
the quiet storm.

775
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,500
Yeah, it is.

776
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,620
It's the quiet machine.

777
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,580
It's like the quiet storm.

778
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,400
Let's see if we get the bad noise this way.

779
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,440
Mr. V of Hoxhobos

780
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,700
says

781
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,160
McNivenin.

782
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,500
You're supposed to know that

783
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,000
on NBC

784
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,720
Numb.

785
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,420
So I'm sure that code

786
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,340
has broken through

787
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,620
to the other side already.

788
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,440
That's how I do it.

789
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,940
Ah, yes.

790
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,480
And there's that 60 cycle hum

791
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,800
that we've grown.

792
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,000
And there's that 60 cycle hum

793
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,420
that we've grown to love.

794
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,260
But now, just as soon as it comes, it's gone.

795
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,900
Oh, it's just a little thing.

796
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,000
It's what?

797
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,460
It's the power supply

798
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,980
to the computer

799
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,060
makes that weird, dirty sound

800
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,120
behind the mix.

801
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,880
Do you think it's because the...

802
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,320
It's ungrounded.

803
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,920
Does the power supply have a box on it?

804
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:25,920
Yeah.

805
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,620
Is the box too close to another electronic source, perhaps?

806
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,480
Could be.

807
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,020
An electronic source.

808
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:33,860
Could be.

809
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:34,980
Electronosaurus.

810
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,460
Electronosaurus.

811
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,460
Here he is himself, the electronosaurus.

812
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,400
Yes.

813
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,640
We can go get a donut now,

814
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,060
and he can just fall asleep on the...

815
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,600
Millions of bits of wire.

816
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,840
It's about time.

817
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,920
Time to construct this.

818
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,660
It's about time you went to work.

819
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,000
Well, it wasn't all done by one person.

820
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,540
They took an entire village.

821
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,140
One truck.

822
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,780
You've just been lounging around your bachelor pad, right?

823
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,380
Well, I figured there's no point in calling

824
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,540
during the Pedrovian ceremonies,

825
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,680
which I assume are now completed.

826
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,380
They've been complete, and...

827
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,280
And he's listening right now.

828
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,700
He's listening.

829
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,020
He's listening.

830
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:17,900
Well, naturally, he's one of our most constant listeners.

831
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,600
But I just heard about this strike at the very last minute.

832
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,760
Yes, that's what I was asking earlier about how strange it is,

833
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,820
because it seems like maybe some people went to sleep

834
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,760
and they're waking up going,

835
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,140
this is great, I guess I'll go down to the BART station and go to work.

836
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,820
Right, there's going to be some buses...

837
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,780
And they're not going to.

838
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,520
No, they'll fall off the edge of the platform onto just nothingness.

839
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,360
Yeah, it'll be like a zone of the abyss.

840
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,040
And they'll fall into...

841
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,880
They're going to leave from 5 to 7, and then later on at rush hour,

842
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,420
but they can't possibly accommodate the number of...

843
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,460
Or like the outer limits where the...

844
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,500
They'll never be able to accommodate...

845
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,820
Aliens steal the town, there's fog around the town.

846
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,240
Remember, you just can't drive past the fog.

847
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,060
Or like on Cabin in the Woods,

848
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,380
where you fall over the edge of that abyss and you fall on top of Cthulhu.

849
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,520
Damn, that's a problem.

850
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,780
That's a problem.

851
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,460
When you're just trying to get to work, I mean...

852
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:10,460


853
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,420
Yeah.

854
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,380
Now, what's that other movie?

855
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,100
I remember another movie where there's a doorway,

856
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,100
and on the other side of that doorway there's this big beast,

857
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,220
and they're trying to get through.

858
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,480
Well, there's a head with the monkeys on the inside of the doorway.

859
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,480
There's a hearing squirming green bug.

860
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,780
There's a doorway in the hearse, I think, where they...

861
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,440
No, it's not that one, yeah.

862
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,000
But it was like a doorway.

863
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,900
It opens up, and then on the other side there's this thing

864
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,580
that's like a giant elder god waiting to come through,

865
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,300
and it just got its little toe in the door.

866
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:40,700
Yeah.

867
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,460
Dr. Mordred has a butt like that.

868
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,580
It's a tiny little door, so the elder god can't get through.

869
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,740
But it's enough.

870
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,120
The doorway is now open, and so that's the next thing.

871
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,180
The elder gods are going to come back through.

872
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:54,820
Ah.

873
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,180
And they're the ones that H.P. Lovecraft mourned us about.

874
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,780
Who HBO is named after.

875
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:00,980
Yeah.

876
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,940
Well, nothing could be...

877
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,780
H.P. L.O.

878
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:04,900
...H.P. L.O.

879
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,260
...likely.

880
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,820
But on the other hand, there are certain things that we can do.

881
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,080
We're not totally helpless in this.

882
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,280
Yeah.

883
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,300
Who's this we you're talking about, Dr. Mordred?

884
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,800
No, we could go to Fluff Girl Donuts really fast...

885
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,380
...and buy six trays of donuts and throw them at the monster really fast.

886
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,920
Yeah, we could kill the monster with donuts.

887
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,320
And they would be distracted by all of them.

888
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,100
Yeah, or at least donuts.

889
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,420
Or sugar, nature's perfect food.

890
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,000
Exactly.

891
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,160
That's the stuff I'm talking about.

892
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,820
The monster would be distracted with the donuts while we run.

893
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,560
Yeah, we could run by real quick.

894
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,140
Yeah.

895
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:37,340
Well, for some, it's not such a good thing.

896
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:37,740
Mm-hmm.

897
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,240
Mm-hmm.

898
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,280
Well, you mean the monster now on sugar as it rages through...

899
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,780
Right.

900
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,400
...San Francisco?

901
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,240
That's bad.

902
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,400
Yeah, I guess that's bad.

903
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:45,760
That is bad.

904
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,440
Well, I wouldn't want it on my conscience, would you?

905
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,560
I'd want it on your conscience, but not mine.

906
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,620
Yeah, I don't mind it being on your conscience either.

907
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,940
I don't mind it if it's on yours, but...

908
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,500
That's two to one.

909
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,740
...you definitely don't want it on mine.

910
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:56,720
That's...

911
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,340
Well, if we can avoid such scenarios, it's probably better.

912
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,400
Any...

913
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:00,800
...for me, I don't mind.

914
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,640
...it's best to do it.

915
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,080
Probably.

916
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,280
To any conscience is...

917
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,200
So, here's the problem for me.

918
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:05,360
...because no conscience.

919
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,940
If I go to the dark room tonight, I'll just sit there in the dark, right, at 10 o'clock.

920
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,340
There won't be any Asdok for Hell.

921
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:11,860
It's be a dark show.

922
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,520
Why won't there be?

923
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:12,860
Yeah.

924
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,060
Because there's no Bart.

925
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,800
Oh, but that's only for those who come from the East Bay, which is actually an estuary.

926
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,420
Oh, yeah, and government's back up, so you'll be able to get their government...

927
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,220
Yes, I'll get my government welfare cheese.

928
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:26,940
That's...

929
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,020
You can probably take your government cheese...

930
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,020


931
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,980
...get your government cheese...

932
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,780
...a canoe and get to the Asdok for Hell.

933
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,180
...to the Asdok for Hell show.

934
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,160
And your government...

935
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,380
Well, I...

936
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,500
The problem is everybody else...

937
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,000
...health care.

938
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,620
...that idea, you see.

939
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,300
Oh.

940
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,340
But I only need to walk in my neighborhood to the Asdok for Hell show.

941
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,920
Oh, there'll be somebody there.

942
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,580
Oh, there'll be somebody there.

943
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,960
But it's not tomorrow, anyway.

944
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:46,980
That's what I mean.

945
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,800
That's what I'm saying.

946
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,700
I'll be sitting in the dark room in the dark...

947
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,480
Yeah, because it's not there.

948
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:50,660
...by myself.

949
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,720
It's not there.

950
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,500
It's not there.

951
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,040
You'll go...

952
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,140
I'll be like, did the government break this, too?

953
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,560
And then I think, oh, no, I guess...

954
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,960
No, it's the people did this one.

955
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,280
Maybe I'll just...

956
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:58,800
It's the people.

957
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,500
...sitting in the dark room.

958
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,400
It's the people's fault.

959
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,520
It's the people's fault?

960
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,400
They didn't come on the wrong night...

961
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:03,800
Oh, man.

962
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,140
...and force the show to be when it shouldn't be.

963
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,680
Yeah.

964
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,440
People.

965
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,660
That's the opposite of the Army's slogan.

966
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,700
Be all that you can't be.

967
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,160
Be all the people you can be.

968
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,900
Yeah, right.

969
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,620
Exactly.

970
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,140
Be everybody you shouldn't be.

971
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,460
Be all that you should not be.

972
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,660
Yes, exactly.

973
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,100
That's the...

974
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,880
Be the people.

975
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,940
...subgenius army.

976
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,800
So you can go to the Asdok for Hell show...

977
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:27,880
...in the subgenius army.

978
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,200
...and suddenly...

979
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,660
...you're Cal Worthington.

980
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,540
Oh, I see.

981
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,200
It's a...

982
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,760
So what happened to Charlie?

983
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,620
Is he still there?

984
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,120
Cal Worthington and his dog, Spot.

985
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,420
Only one call at a time, right?

986
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Who was once a giant...

987
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,920
No, we can take in two little calls.

988
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,520
We can take two little calls.

989
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,140
But most people are afraid when...

990
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,360
Why didn't Michael Pepe call?

991
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:45,640
I don't get calls in here.

992
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,700
We could get Michael Pepe on or...

993
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,500
No, Michael Pepe's not there.

994
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:48,860
...Charlie.

995
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,260
Get Charlie on.

996
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,680
How nocturnal...

997
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,480
...inhibiting factor...

998
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,320
...are these characters?

999
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,560
...callback inhibiting factor.

1000
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,120
Which ones?

1001
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,820
Well, there's a Victor callback and...

1002
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,260
...and a...

1003
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,260


1004
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,260


1005
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,880
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1006
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,500
...and a...

1007
00:33:59,500 --> 00:33:59,920
Smell...

1008
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,200
...Michael Pepe...

1009
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,580
Smelly...

1010
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:02,640
Smelling...

1011
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,240
Smelly Johnson...

1012
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,960
Yeah.

1013
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:06,960
Johnson...

1014
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,200
...and his...

1015
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,160
...baby...

1016
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,300
Johnson and Johnson.

1017
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,240
Right.

1018
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:12,880
...and...

1019
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,500
It's a really magical thing...

1020
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,780
...that they do on the show.

1021
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:15,980
...that's Rod Johnson.

1022
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,120
...Rod Johnson and Jock Osteel.

1023
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,240
Yeah, exactly.

1024
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,000
The old frat rats that we remember from...

1025
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,780
Right, those frat rats.

1026
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,720
You can't trust them.

1027
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,080
They're gonna always try to, like...

1028
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,240
...I'm gonna be...

1029
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,540
...trick you at the end, you know?

1030
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:29,880
That's right.

1031
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,980
They'll twist and turn, and even if they get caught in a trap...

1032
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,720
...they'll click and snap shut.

1033
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,340
...pull out the rug...

1034
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,780
...pull the rug out from under you...

1035
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,300
...throw a pie in your face...

1036
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,020
...and it's all in the nature of good, clean fun.

1037
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,260
...make you eat dog...

1038
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,120
...stuff, encrusted eclairs.

1039
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,460
I saw a movie where they did that once.

1040
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,200
Is that what frat...

1041
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,080
...frags do?

1042
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,880
...what frat guys do to their enemies?

1043
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,240
Well, that's what the enemies do.

1044
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:58,580
Enemies...

1045
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,520
That's what the frat rat enemies do to the frat rats, actually.

1046
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,240
No, wait a moment.

1047
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:02,580
This...

1048
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,680
You're talking about pledge season, right?

1049
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,160
Yes, yes, pledge season.

1050
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:06,460
Yes.

1051
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,980
Waxed beauty instantly as you dust.

1052
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,240
This is my pride and my joy.

1053
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,240
And they have a paddle also.

1054
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,840
That's skedaddle when I see that paddle, that's for sure.

1055
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,000
You're not allowed to.

1056
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,620
You have to take your medicine.

1057
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,820
You have to waddle around for a while after you've assumed that medicine.

1058
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,700
I'm not allowed to.

1059
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:27,800
I'm not allowed to.

1060
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:27,800


1061
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:27,800


1062
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:27,800


1063
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:27,800


1064
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:27,800


1065
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:27,800


1066
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,040
I'm not allowed to.

1067
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,740
Well, I'm not allowed to.

1068
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,760
Waddle like a duck.

1069
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,440
And the police are coming for their donuts.

1070
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,480
People shouldn't do that stuff to each other.

1071
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,260
That's bad.

1072
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:41,880
That's mean.

1073
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,120
Here come the helicopters.

1074
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,280
What are the little donut hole things called?

1075
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,340
I guess they're called donut holes.

1076
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:47,860
Donut holes.

1077
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,380
Those little...

1078
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,460
That giant tray of those things.

1079
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,780
Yeah, and they're too expensive, though.

1080
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,120
What are the...

1081
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,360
How much do those donut holes cost?

1082
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:54,760
I've never...

1083
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,220
They're like...

1084
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,340
I like them too much.

1085
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,820
...25 cents each or something.

1086
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,020
I don't know.

1087
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,020


1088
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,020


1089
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,020


1090
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,020


1091
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,020


1092
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,020


1093
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,020


1094
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,020


1095
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,060
That's crazy talk.

1096
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,180
They should be no more than a nickel each.

1097
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,720
Yeah, I was just going to say a nickel, exactly.

1098
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:03,740
But even if...

1099
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,740
You should be able to get 20 donut holes for a dollar.

1100
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,980
Many years ago, I would buy those by the box at Safeway.

1101
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,440
I'd buy about six.

1102
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,540
I'd buy...

1103
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,420
If you could get 20 for a dollar, I'd buy $3 worth.

1104
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,940
That's a lot, yeah.

1105
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,600
60 donut holes, and I'd eat them on the way home.

1106
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,040
And by the time I got home, I'd be down to like 20 donut holes or maybe 19.

1107
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,700
And then I would...

1108
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,020
Yeah.

1109
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,240
As I drove home, throw them across the freeway to the other cars going this way.

1110
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah.

1111
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,860
Try to get them in the window and somebody's mouth is yawning.

1112
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,280
He's going like this.

1113
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,160
Whoa.

1114
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,620
That's great.

1115
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,740
That would make up for not having Bart.

1116
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,640
That would make up for a lot of things.

1117
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,180
That'd make up for the deficit on a lot of things.

1118
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:49,600
Really?

1119
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:49,680
Yeah.

1120
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,080
Okay.

1121
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,520
If you could throw a donut hole in someone's mouth...

1122
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:53,700
Really?

1123
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,600
...just when they least expected it but wanted it the most...

1124
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:56,860
Yeah.

1125
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,720
...that's a lot of money.

1126
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:57,880
Yeah.

1127
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,020
I mean, I don't know.

1128
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,020


1129
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,440
I would do that just to...like both windows.

1130
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:02,920
Yeah.

1131
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,120
You should see this site.

1132
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,280
Puzzling was just now illustrating what it would be like throwing donut holes out of

1133
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,360
both windows...

1134
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,320
As people are crashing around.

1135
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,920
...at the same time.

1136
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:12,940
Yeah.

1137
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,340
It'd be fun.

1138
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:13,680
It'd look pretty good.

1139
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,060
I could see how that would work.

1140
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:15,560
That would work.

1141
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:15,680
It'd be fun.

1142
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,620
And then some percentage would get in those cars with the mouths of the...

1143
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,540
Now you're talking.

1144
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:27,040
Maybe you need some assistance where you would be like firing donut holes in rapid succession

1145
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,800
through some kind of like air pneumatic powered tube like those ones they use to shoot

1146
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,920
T-shirts into the crowds...

1147
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,580
Yeah.

1148
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,520
...at the Super Bowl.

1149
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:35,840
Yeah.

1150
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:40,020
Get one that can shoot donut holes into the car next to you while you're driving down

1151
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,400
the road.

1152
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,700
Even if the window's closed, you know, you just blast it right through the windows.

1153
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:45,960
Right.

1154
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:52,840
Donut holes flying with enough velocity to break the actual window of the car next to

1155
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:52,920
you.

1156
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,580
Big donut holes the size of...

1157
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,960
Now you could get in trouble for that because there could be shattering glass that could

1158
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,660
get on the...

1159
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,200
What?

1160
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:01,920
What's that?

1161
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,280
I'm sorry.

1162
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,280
You already made it happen because you said it on the radio.

1163
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:04,620
Hello?

1164
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,880
That's Charlie in a different world.

1165
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,600
So what are these guys wandering around here?

1166
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,500
They're just show ghosts.

1167
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,960
They're wishing they could have donuts, donut holes, ham and croissant, cheese sandwiches.

1168
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,040
What else?

1169
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,440
Yeah.

1170
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,160
Ham and cheese for small...

1171
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,080
Classic glazed powdered sugar.

1172
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,100
I might have to get...

1173
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,520
I'm going to get a classic glazed...

1174
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:26,560
I'm going to get a classic glazed...

1175
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:26,560


1176
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:26,560


1177
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:26,560


1178
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:26,560


1179
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,380
I'm going to get a classic glazed chocolate powdered brown sugar donut hole tonight.

1180
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:34,880
Yeah.

1181
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,780
Rolled in everything.

1182
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:37,640
Yeah.

1183
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,040
And then the little...

1184
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,240
I wish they would do that.

1185
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,620
They'd just take something in there and just make everything out of it.

1186
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,020
One donut with everything on it would be...

1187
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,540
And it's five bucks.

1188
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,180
I'm going to go in there and ask him, can you just do this one thing for me?

1189
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,280
He's very accommodating.

1190
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:53,520
Yes.

1191
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,120
He probably will.

1192
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:54,960
Probably will.

1193
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,240
He would say, hey, you know what?

1194
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,140
Hal owes you money from last week though and Hal's not here.

1195
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,560
He's going to think when we come in there and Hal's not with us, that Hal is skipping

1196
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:05,880
out.

1197
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,480
Hal, are you still there?

1198
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:07,860
No.

1199
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,280
Hal went away because he didn't want to talk about that.

1200
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:10,720
Oh.

1201
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,580
Come back, Hal.

1202
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,400
What are we going to tell Alex when we go to the donut place and you're not with us

1203
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,300
and you owe him a buck or something from last week?

1204
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,860
How much do you owe him and I'll pay your debt?

1205
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,460
I'll pay your debt for you.

1206
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:25,760
Yeah.

1207
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,020
Or maybe...

1208
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,780
Buzzing and I will...

1209
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,320
Why doesn't...

1210
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,540
Hal just barred over here.

1211
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:29,780
Oh.

1212
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,620
Oh, yeah.

1213
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,760
He can't barred over.

1214
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,860
Something's wrong with barred.

1215
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,860
I can't remember what.

1216
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,320
People are going to wake up.

1217
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:37,760
Silly of me.

1218
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,960
Now, how are they going to find out?

1219
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,340
Are they just going to drive there?

1220
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:40,660
That's what I mean.

1221
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,140
It's sort of like your coffee maker didn't come on.

1222
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,940
How do you live when that doesn't work?

1223
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,440
What do you do?

1224
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,920
Do people have to get up and...

1225
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,760
Do most people get up and listen to the news so they'll know?

1226
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,180
Yeah, I would think so as they're making a leery-eyed listen to the coffee.

1227
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,840
Or they'll turn on the television to support the news?

1228
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,160
Or maybe the radio is a little bit better than you, so you can make a little bit of

1229
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,160


1230
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:58,900
I think so.

1231
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:00,900
It's the internet.

1232
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,560
The internet is your only way to get information.

1233
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,900
It's not like one of those things where you can just turn on the TV and listen to the

1234
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,420
news and you can tell people what the news is.

1235
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,660
Well, I think that's going to be a real challenge, because you're going to have to

1236
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,720
get up and go to the internet.

1237
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,240
Yeah.

1238
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,420
I mean, the internet's not on.

1239
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,680
What?

1240
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,340
It's on.

1241
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:11,520
Look.

1242
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,080
It's on.

1243
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,600
It's never not on.

1244
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,940
I'm trying to get on the internet right now.

1245
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:15,380
Yeah.

1246
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,720
It says Hal's asleep.

1247
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,880
Hal, what are we going to tell him?

1248
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,340
You got to tell us.

1249
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,240
Call back.

1250
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,840
Call back.

1251
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:24,840


1252
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,860
Maybe you should call Hal.

1253
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,620
Yeah.

1254
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,620
But that's impossible.

1255
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,920
Maybe I should call Hal.

1256
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,180
Yeah.

1257
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:33,940
Yeah.

1258
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,720
And make sure you call the number in the hallway to wake Liza.

1259
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,700
Danger.

1260
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,700
Yeah, it'd be great.

1261
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:51,060
You could come out to the unofficial puzzling evidence show page, Hal, if you're online,

1262
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:55,220
and put a message there that tells us what should we do.

1263
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,400
What should we do?

1264
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,420
I'm afraid that he...

1265
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,080
I'm just going to tell him that when we get there, I'm going to say,

1266
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,980
Hal meant to come tonight, but he was afraid that he'd have...

1267
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:15,180
No, I'll say, Hal meant to come tonight, but he was afraid that Bart wasn't going to be running.

1268
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,120
We made this recording of him in the shower that'll help.

1269
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,760
Or is that me in the shower?

1270
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,940
I know it's not both of us in there.

1271
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,160
But how come you guys never talk about crawlers?

1272
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,360
Crawlers?

1273
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,600
Do they have them?

1274
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,160
Crawlers?

1275
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,900
We only talk about the ones they have.

1276
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,640
They have them at Donut World.

1277
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,340
The crawlers are the best because...

1278
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:49,860
But what I want to know is what gives it that pink color where...

1279
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,760
It's sort of a...

1280
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:56,740
It's a pink, a nice, pretty pink tan, but in the middle there's a ring that's kind of yellow.

1281
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,300
Are you sure we're talking about baked goods here?

1282
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,640
Yes.

1283
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,220
Well, I suppose that's simply some proprietary method.

1284
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,980
Oh, my God.

1285
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,420
This is the first time I've ever spoken on the phone when Hal was on the phone.

1286
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:19,640
Yeah, this is the first time I've ever been on the show when Hal was on the phone with Michael Pepe on the phone.

1287
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,040
Yes, that has to be a first.

1288
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,220
This is a first.

1289
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,300
Another example of how progress...

1290
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:32,740
And puzzling, if you start saying something now, this will be the first time that you said something when I was saying something while Hal was on the phone with Michael Pepe on the phone.

1291
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,280
Exactly.

1292
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,560
Okay, but it's not my first time.

1293
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,400
And, you know, even though this is the first time, it's...

1294
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,520
Well, it's not the first time I said something.

1295
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:49,480
This is the first time I've asked something with a question mark.

1296
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,020
You get it?

1297
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,660
Well, no, that's not a question, though.

1298
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,720
Mm-hmm.

1299
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:04,760
Anyway, it's the first time I've said something with a question mark at the end of it on a night when I've been on the show with the radio with Hal on the radio.

1300
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:10,320
But you can make a statement with a question mark at the end if you just say this, something.

1301
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,740
Yeah, no, you can't.

1302
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:16,960
If you say the word up, kind of up at the end, it sounds like there's a question.

1303
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,760
What's up with that, anyway?

1304
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,820
Like the way all young people talk.

1305
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,900
Yeah, the way they talk now.

1306
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,320
With a rising interrogative inflection at the end.

1307
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,080
As if there's...

1308
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,760
Even though there's just a statement being made, you say it at the end so that it goes up?

1309
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:34,580
Yeah.

1310
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:45,260
But you have to start the question the right way so that you have to say, can I have the goose or, you know, whatever.

1311
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,080
See, and you can't really do it because you don't have the skills.

1312
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,140
Well, I can.

1313
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,820
But I didn't in that instance.

1314
00:43:53,140 --> 00:44:13,300
You've got to be careful that you start asking your question at the beginning of your sentence because you can't just start making a statement and then in the middle of the sentence, suddenly you've got to keep your voice up high because you're always going to be asking the question until you get to the end of the question.

1315
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,400
Uh-huh, you have to keep your voice up high.

1316
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,120
Because when you get to the end of the question, if it's not up, then people don't...

1317
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,620
No, actually, I asked a question.

1318
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,320
Hey, and Michael Pepe.

1319
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:24,540
Yeah.

1320
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,200
He got the statement.

1321
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,900
Did you know there's this sixth annual body music festival happening?

1322
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,380
No.

1323
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,000
Yeah, it's the sixth.

1324
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,080
You mean like armpit noises?

1325
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,240
No, like behavior music.

1326
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,240
Behavior music.

1327
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:36,920
Oh, behavior music.

1328
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,080
Yeah, this is the sixth year they're doing it.

1329
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,780
It's here in San Francisco on November 5th through 10th.

1330
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:42,660
Really?

1331
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:43,560
Wow.

1332
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,340
Where is it?

1333
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,400
Well, I've got the thing for you here.

1334
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,660
It's out behind...

1335
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,180
And you can go to internationalbodymusicfestival.com.

1336
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:55,700
Internationalbodymusicfestival.com.

1337
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,000
Like write it all out?

1338
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,200
Yeah.

1339
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,920
Internationalbodymusicfestival.com.

1340
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:02,460
Yeah.

1341
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,300
Well, you know...

1342
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,180
It's behavior music.

1343
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,400
You have my email.

1344
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,520
You could send it to me or my Facebook or whatever.

1345
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,360
Okay.

1346
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,080
But, wow.

1347
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,340
Are you sure you want to take that step?

1348
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,560
Well, I think so, yes.

1349
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,460
I think it's time.

1350
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,980
I really got into the cyber age.

1351
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:23,780
Okay.

1352
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:28,620
But by being a cyborg, it's a kind of extreme way to help.

1353
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,000
Well, I think we're all...

1354
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,860
I think we're probably going to all become questioned.

1355
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,280
Yes.

1356
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,100
Body modification.

1357
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,300
But it doesn't have to happen before they make us do it.

1358
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,460
Anyway, that's all right.

1359
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,580
Anything you want is fine.

1360
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,120
You know, we're all pals here on the radio.

1361
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:45,980
Yes.

1362
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:46,600
Yes.

1363
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,900
But some of us are more stoned than others.

1364
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:50,840
That's really...

1365
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,160
That's the only inequality.

1366
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,580
Longer than...

1367
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,200
Recommend.

1368
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,580
What you want is of no importance.

1369
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,140
Speaking of which...

1370
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:00,900
Did you hear that?

1371
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,620
...with me whether you like it or not.

1372
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,340
No, he doesn't go with...

1373
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,260
You mean Eli Whitney?

1374
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,740
You're going with us.

1375
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,880
You're going with her whether you like it or not.

1376
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:14,920
And Eli Whitney's grandson went on an expedition to the Black Hills of Dakota with...

1377
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,900
So what is it that's keeping you awake?

1378
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,100
...dinosaur skeletons.

1379
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,140
Is that so?

1380
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,020
You'll sleep sometime.

1381
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:20,980
Did he find any?

1382
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,180
Yes, they did.

1383
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,680
They found all the canonical dinosaurs that we know today in the 19th century.

1384
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:27,960
Oh.

1385
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,460
And no evidence of feather bedding on those dinosaurs.

1386
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,120
They're just laying around out there.

1387
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:41,100
They had to fight hostile Indians to get to the site and deal with the freezing cold and extremes of temperature.

1388
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,140
Right.

1389
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,080
Was he an archaeologist?

1390
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,280
He was a paleontologist.

1391
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,640
Oh, my God.

1392
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:48,500
Well...

1393
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,920
Was his name Marvin Witt?

1394
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:50,160
Was his name Wittney?

1395
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,460
O.C. Marsh.

1396
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,100
You've heard of Cope and Marsh?

1397
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:54,980
He was Marsh.

1398
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,700
No, I'm talking about Eli Whitney's son.

1399
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,540
What was his name?

1400
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,820
He was the grandson of Whitney.

1401
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,020
The grandson.

1402
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,400
Was that Fred Whitney?

1403
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,880
I think he might also have been named Eli Whitney.

1404
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:06,760
Yes.

1405
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,160
I think it was Marvin Whitney.

1406
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,820
The name persisted in his family.

1407
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,020
Of Whitney Houston.

1408
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:12,800
Jitney Whitney.

1409
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,500
And it was said that most of the...

1410
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,620
...simply because they wanted to tangle with Indians and have an adventure.

1411
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,540
They didn't have much interest in paleontology.

1412
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:23,760
Wow.

1413
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:28,320
They were like adventurous guys that just were itching for a fight.

1414
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,360
Did they fight any Indians?

1415
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,720
Oh, I suppose.

1416
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:32,740
Who knows?

1417
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:39,200
These were sunset cowboys looking for some adventure from reading dime novels.

1418
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,000
To what was the exotic way.

1419
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:42,480
Drifters.

1420
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,940
They're called drifters.

1421
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,400
Yeah, they're just drifters.

1422
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,160
They just wanted to be what they read about.

1423
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:49,640
Correct.

1424
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,060
Yeah, but it's gone now.

1425
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,220
They were latter day cowboys.

1426
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,920
He died in 1927 with Wyatt Earp.

1427
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,160
He was the last.

1428
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,980
He's buried right out in Colma, in the city of the dead.

1429
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,540
In, really?

1430
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,200
Wyatt?

1431
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:07,640
Yes.

1432
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,100
Yeah.

1433
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,080
Wow.

1434
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:15,960
Well, I know he lived his last years with his wife in San Francisco.

1435
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,420
And, of course, they've also got Steve Silver.

1436
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,440
They're both on the beach at Blanket Babylon.

1437
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,240
Buried out there.

1438
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:24,900
Who's two of them?

1439
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,600
We should have a subgenius.

1440
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,040
Gordy.

1441
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,180
Gordy.

1442
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:27,380
Who's with him.

1443
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,540
Wyatt Earp's grave.

1444
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:37,060
It's quite possible there are many famous folks buried out there in that strange combo

1445
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,080
of monuments and...

1446
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,120
Perhaps a...

1447
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,020
We should go out there for a subgenius reunion like we had that time.

1448
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:44,900
I think we ought to.

1449
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,880
Yes, definitely.

1450
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:46,220


1451
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:46,780
Yes.

1452
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,840
That's where we ended up having a great reunion that one time.

1453
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,820
During Indian summer.

1454
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,300
Well, when the stangs are...

1455
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:52,320
Yes.

1456
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:58,840
Have a grave reunion and, you know, it'll be subdued, somber, and we'll be literally

1457
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,280
grave.

1458
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:03,080
We'll do that in February when the stangs come back to town.

1459
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,380
Oh, it's in February, eh?

1460
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:04,860
Yeah.

1461
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,140
Okay.

1462
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:05,980
When the...

1463
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,560
Maybe we can find out what famous people are buried there.

1464
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,600
Now let us bury them.

1465
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:12,860
Oh, yeah.

1466
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,600
You go findagrave.com.

1467
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,180
What about...

1468
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,200
Have you been to findagrave.com?

1469
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,700
I've been to Tomb Tale.

1470
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:19,820
Oh, yeah.

1471
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:19,820


1472
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:19,820


1473
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,260
I've been to the graves.

1474
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:20,880
I've been to the graves.

1475
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,020
Oh, yeah.

1476
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:21,020


1477
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,520
You can go findagrave.com.

1478
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,320
You can key in people's names and find out where they're buried.

1479
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,880
And you can reserve a...

1480
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,960
For yourself.

1481
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,140
Where's O'Berry?

1482
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,920
A cemetery block.

1483
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:32,720
What's that?

1484
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,580
That we'll pick.

1485
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,800
O'Berry in Baltimore?

1486
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,440
Who's buried in Baltimore?

1487
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,980
Oh, a lot of people.

1488
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,840
Edgar Allan Poe.

1489
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,080
Edgar Allan Poe.

1490
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:44,880
Yeah.

1491
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,920
Where's Al?

1492
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,820
He's buried in Baltimore.

1493
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:49,820


1494
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:49,820


1495
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:49,820


1496
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:49,820


1497
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:49,820


1498
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:49,820


1499
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:49,820


1500
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:49,820


1501
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,600
Edgar Allan Poe.

1502
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,620
Oh, that's good to know.

1503
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,020
That's good to know.

1504
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:55,360
Yeah.

1505
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:55,940
It's a good thing.

1506
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:59,160
When I go to Baltimore, I'm going to check out where Poe is buried.

1507
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:05,360
You've got to find out, because I know each country, each city claims him.

1508
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:14,540
You know, Baltimore, Boston, New York, all have some claim to Poe's legacy, and also

1509
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,000
in Athens.

1510
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,000
Oh, yeah.

1511
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,700
In Athens, did you say?

1512
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,820
In Athens, yeah.

1513
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:19,820


1514
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:19,820


1515
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:19,820


1516
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:19,820


1517
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:28,600
the Poe house in the Bronx, and there's also a place in the lower, the battery, you know,

1518
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:36,820
in the financial district, where he worked, where the newspapers were back in the 1840s.

1519
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,260
Ah, interesting.

1520
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,120
And so there's little Poe museums, but there's no really big deal.

1521
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,560
That's sad.

1522
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,440
They should make a really big deal museum.

1523
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:53,360
Right. A really true, original, great American.

1524
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:59,480
There ought to be like a Poe story museum, at least, where you could go in like a haunted park

1525
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:05,160
where everything was Poe-related to one of his great scary stories.

1526
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,000
Exactly.

1527
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:11,000
You know, you could get buried in a wall, and so you'd be there where they would wall you up

1528
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,060
and leave you there for a while, you know, like the cask of a Montalado.

1529
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,680
Yeah, telltale horrors every place.

1530
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:19,800
That's right.

1531
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,480
Women you fall in love with and die.

1532
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:25,520
Yeah, all those various reenactments.

1533
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,660
The telltale heart, you know, you'd have to dig.

1534
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,300
You'd get your heart ripped out.

1535
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:34,600
And there's a big, like a three-foot raven as you walk in saying,

1536
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,840
nevermore, over and over and over again while you're waiting to buy your ticket.

1537
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,520
You just want to write a story, and the raven won't shut up.

1538
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,900
Just lay down on your bed and have a...

1539
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,000
And the top of it starts coming down, yeah.

1540
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:46,660
Exactly.

1541
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,760
So that's Guy de Maupassant.

1542
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,740
That's the Wilkie Collin.

1543
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,320
The terribly strange bed.

1544
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,120
Well, it's also Guy de Maupassant.

1545
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:53,720
Oh!

1546
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,220
The top moves down.

1547
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,540
That form is the Collin.

1548
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,360
On you at night and smothers you.

1549
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:03,160
I like a bed that has spots in it that are more comfortable than others,

1550
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,920
and you can, like, get in that spot.

1551
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,760
Yeah, that's what I have.

1552
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,720
But then you run out of...

1553
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,340
That's the problem is, then you have to sleep in that spot

1554
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,460
because you can't make another mold.

1555
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,720
Yeah, you're too old.

1556
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,440
You're too old now.

1557
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,700
You can't make another mold.

1558
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:19,720
You can't start another show.

1559
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:19,780
You can't start another show.

1560
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,920
You can't remember everything about yourself.

1561
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,560
You got this one perfectly made.

1562
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,860
Why would you want to make another one?

1563
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,140
Yeah.

1564
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,660
We're all sleepy in our little nighties here.

1565
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:32,260
Well, you might want two positions other than just left side, right side.

1566
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,300
Getting kinky, eh?

1567
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,360
Yeah.

1568
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,000
Well, no.

1569
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,300
His horizons are over.

1570
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,580
Why don't you just lie on your back like in the king position?

1571
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,620
Because then you snore.

1572
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,980
You know, do you go to the same side each night when you go to sleep?

1573
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,820
All about 600 times each.

1574
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,140
I taught this to him.

1575
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:49,780
Yeah, but I mean...

1576
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,200
I'm like on a rotisserie.

1577
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,560
I look like a hog on a spit when I'm sleeping.

1578
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,720
Me too.

1579
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:00,120
You mean, are you saying, do I take a side on the bark struggle as I go to sleep?

1580
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:01,060
Yes.

1581
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,240
Are you going to sleep for a while?

1582
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,020
That's what I do.

1583
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:04,500
I go...

1584
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,020
I do.

1585
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:06,800
But I'm not.

1586
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:07,280
Good, okay.

1587
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:07,840
Just checking.

1588
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,220
When I wake up in the morning, the first thing I think of is, I hope I can get on the...

1589
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:13,800
Yeah.

1590
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,980
Well, I gotta go to work on it.

1591
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,620
I hope I can get on the bark this morning.

1592
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,460
Yeah.

1593
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,480
Well, now you've got a vacation now, right?

1594
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,420
An unpaid one.

1595
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,360
That's the sad part about it.

1596
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,180
Bark doesn't pay...

1597
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,460
Bark doesn't pay you for your vacation.

1598
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:30,380
Oh, oh.

1599
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,460
And your boss won't pay you.

1600
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,360
That's true.

1601
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,440
I guess I had that wrong.

1602
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,140
They'll probably get their pay reimbursed when they were off on strike.

1603
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,960
What I meant about...

1604
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,120
They probably won't go and reimburse your pay.

1605
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,240
Well, let's cross that bridge when we come to it.

1606
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,100
I think that's a great idea.

1607
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:54,140
Well, the bridge is closed, so we can't even come to it.

1608
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,680
And then what about...

1609
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,620
The bridge is closed too?

1610
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,680
And it's still like that in the...

1611
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,620
The bridge...

1612
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,580
Did they close the bridge too?

1613
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,320
Yeah, oh no, no.

1614
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,680
The bridge to Michael Pepe is closed too.

1615
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,620
Oh yeah, if you've got a car, you can do it, but it's gonna be hard because...

1616
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:10,240
Like if you try to drive from the station to Michael Pepe's, you can't do it directly.

1617
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,820
The bridge to Michael Pepe's heart?

1618
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:12,400
Yeah.

1619
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,700
It's just closed.

1620
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,500
Because of a relationship breakup.

1621
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,520
Yeah, with the whole city.

1622
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:18,600
Yeah.

1623
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:18,600


1624
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:18,600


1625
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:18,600


1626
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:18,600


1627
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:18,600


1628
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:18,600


1629
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:18,600


1630
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:18,600


1631
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,360
And the whole city.

1632
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,980
I'm a rock, I'm an island.

1633
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,100
I said that you...

1634
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,020
You know...

1635
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,580
And a rock feels no pain and an island never dies or cries.

1636
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,340
Cries, yeah.

1637
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:27,620
Cries.

1638
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,760
It never, never cries.

1639
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,380
Never, ever.

1640
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,140
Have you ever seen Hawaii, Oahu cry or Guam cry?

1641
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,240
Yeah, I've never seen them cry.

1642
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,260
Well, it's about the threshold of perception.

1643
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,960
Dr. T, you won't cry.

1644
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:45,020
Dr. Howell has a reason to believe that perhaps they do cry, but it just is of a...

1645
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,040
And they're just too big.

1646
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:48,260
We just can't perceive the crying.

1647
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:48,600
I'm sorry.

1648
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:48,600


1649
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:48,600


1650
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:48,600


1651
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:48,600


1652
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:48,600


1653
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:48,600


1654
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:48,600


1655
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:48,600


1656
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,100
They're tears are like rain.

1657
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:50,980
They're like a big storm.

1658
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,400
Their tears are like...

1659
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,060
They're tears of a clown.

1660
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,860
What about kangaroos?

1661
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,840
When there's no one around.

1662
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,380
Yes, even worse.

1663
00:54:59,000 --> 00:54:59,520
Beavers?

1664
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,480
A pathetic clown crying thing, but on a giant scale.

1665
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,320
I don't think beavers' eyes are big enough to cry.

1666
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,880
They have to produce tears.

1667
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:09,900
Yeah, they do.

1668
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:10,380
They do.

1669
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:14,200
They produce tears, but they're tears for fears and not for folly.

1670
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,280
Beavers do not...

1671
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,660
Because of the cuteness of the little...

1672
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:18,340
Are you next?

1673
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:18,580
...sickle.

1674
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:18,580


1675
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:18,580


1676
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:18,580


1677
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:18,580


1678
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:18,580


1679
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:18,580


1680
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:18,580


1681
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:18,580


1682
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:18,580


1683
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:18,920
They're dead.

1684
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,780
No, nobody in here.

1685
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,460
Just one show.

1686
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:21,780
Beavers cannot cry.

1687
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,260
They missed over.

1688
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:24,500
Just...

1689
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,560
They're thinking about their own little puppy.

1690
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:27,800
Some birds can.

1691
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,060
Crocodiles can.

1692
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:29,980
Elephants...

1693
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:34,160
If a train is too tough to cry, too strong to...

1694
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,680
But does the crocodile become...

1695
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,660
Too old to...

1696
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,140
...of the whole piece...

1697
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:40,280
Too old to cry, too dumb to die.

1698
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:40,880
It's the way of eliminating insults.

1699
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,500
So, Michael Pepe, can you hear the show?

1700
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:42,700
I have a gut.

1701
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,740
Do I have a show?

1702
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:45,680
Can you hear the show?

1703
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,280
Yes, I can.

1704
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,300
How is your fertility?

1705
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:48,560
It's the way of eliminating insults.

1706
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:48,560


1707
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:48,560


1708
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:48,560


1709
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,460
Did you listen to the opening?

1710
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:51,800
Even...

1711
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,400
No, I missed...

1712
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,220
Oh, you missed the best part.

1713
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:55,900
I missed it?

1714
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:56,500
I don't know.

1715
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,800
Because you were in it.

1716
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,280
That was all Michael all the time.

1717
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,640
Yeah, it was a special retro...

1718
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,760
Except the parts where the other guys were there.

1719
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,020
Yeah, it was a retro...

1720
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:05,820
Beloved moment.

1721
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,520
I wish I had been there.

1722
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,740
I was so sad.

1723
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:15,560
It's going to be the basis of a movie and a giant coffee table book, which is a coffee

1724
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,960
table book about coffee table books.

1725
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:18,540
It's called...

1726
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,580
It's called A Pictorial History of Pictorial History.

1727
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:22,320
Hey, wait a minute.

1728
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,360
Featuring Michael Pepe.

1729
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,620
You can't talk about...

1730
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:24,700
Wow.

1731
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,340
That was...

1732
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,140
I was in on that idea.

1733
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:27,760
You can't even carry it home.

1734
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,300
Oh, really?

1735
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,780
You better let me get in on that development.

1736
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,920
Yeah, you need some sidewalk lawyers.

1737
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,460
Oh, I'm not...

1738
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,200
It's not mine.

1739
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,760
I'm just reporting on it here.

1740
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,400
That's the way to the table...

1741
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,220
Because we talked about that.

1742
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,140
We talked about it.

1743
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,680
We don't let Michael Pepe be...

1744
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,260
I'm already working on the coffee table part of that.

1745
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,080
I'm working on...

1746
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:46,660
Hear me over here?

1747
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,520
...her chinko games here so I can...

1748
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:48,540
I'm working on...

1749
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:48,540


1750
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,680
We need to make some money to buy one of those things.

1751
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,160
The coffee table book about coffee tables.

1752
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,360
Bigger than your car.

1753
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,940
...stan on a coffee table.

1754
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,840
I wish I had a coffee table book about coffee tables.

1755
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,460
Get your coffee table constructed.

1756
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:12,280
Then get a couple of coffee table books to try it out.

1757
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:12,920
Okay.

1758
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,240
I'm going to do it.

1759
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,520
I love coffee tables and I won't know how to...

1760
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:18,520


1761
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:18,520


1762
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:18,520


1763
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:18,520


1764
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:18,520


1765
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:18,520


1766
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:18,520


1767
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:18,520


1768
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:18,520


1769
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:18,520


1770
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:18,520


1771
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,720
I love coffee table books.

1772
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,940
That's a match made in heaven.

1773
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,120
And I like coffee.

1774
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,780
So you put the coffee in the metal.

1775
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,960
This will really work.

1776
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,960
You don't want to spill your coffee on your coffee table book.

1777
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:36,560
And if they have enough coffee, they won't misbar.

1778
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:42,100
If you have a coffee table book with coffee spilled on it, that's another reason.

1779
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,180
You can have a sheet of glass.

1780
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,680
You can just wipe the sheet of glass when the coffee is spilled.

1781
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,900
But you can't save the coffee table book.

1782
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,200
But that's why you should have a water.

1783
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,580
Well, you can if you're quick enough.

1784
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,380
Reach out and snatch up the book.

1785
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:55,840
Wave of coffee.

1786
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,840
And the super speed before the coffee hits the book.

1787
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,620
You could be there waiting for it.

1788
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,860
Because of your super speed.

1789
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:08,040
The water has to be boiling just like with any other kind of coffee.

1790
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,200
You've got to get the right number filter, of course.

1791
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:15,980
And share.

1792
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,120
And then you can get the coffee filter table book.

1793
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:19,360
Yeah.

1794
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,720
I've got the filter, but I need it.

1795
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,420
Uh-oh.

1796
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,920
Uh-oh.

1797
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:23,780
Here comes the baby.

1798
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,620
That's the ghost baby crying.

1799
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,780
The Brady Bunch.

1800
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,320
Yeah.

1801
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,180
The Baby Bunch.

1802
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,860
That tells us when the show's about over.

1803
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:31,500
Because it's like being reborn.

1804
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,620
You just feel so good when the show's over.

1805
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:37,280
The next show's going to make you feel good about yourself.

1806
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:37,800
Yeah.

1807
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,460
Not like this.

1808
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,180
Not like this.

1809
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,360
I think we need to talk more about the Brady Bunch and coffee.

1810
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,560
It's the Baby Bunch.

1811
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:46,400
It's new.

1812
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,500
The Baby Bunch.

1813
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,420
5 a.m.

1814
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,420
The Big Baby Bunch.

1815
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:50,860
Yeah.

1816
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,040
That's us.

1817
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,740
The Sissy Baby Bunch.

1818
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,220
After 5 a.m., it's...

1819
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:55,580
Thank you.

1820
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,540
The Cry Baby Bunch.

1821
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,060
It says thank you.

1822
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,200
We'll see you, though.

1823
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,260
Next week.

1824
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:02,840
They'll see you.

1825
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,540
She was not.

1826
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,260
We will love you next week.

1827
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,180
Yes.

1828
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,740
Love you long time.

1829
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,000
And not watch the Brady Bunch.

1830
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,860
Well, who is, uh...

1831
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:13,300
Kiana.

1832
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,140
Florence Henderson.

1833
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,300
Show over now.

1834
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,200
No.

1835
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:17,800
