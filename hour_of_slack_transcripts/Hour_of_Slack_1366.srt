1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Look! I know who it is! I know who it is that doesn't belong among us! I swear, I know who it is!

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,060
It's... it's...

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,300
The Self-Genius Hour of Swag!

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,640
Oh, that's not true!

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,220
At last I have control of your radio tubes!

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,760
Uh, and I do too!

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,200
Good! This is Ren Hoack!

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,200
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show!

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,740
And you're listening to the Hour of Swag!

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,400
Keep listening, you idiot!

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,780
Else I shall kill you!

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,620
My neighbor, welcome again to this neighborhood.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,900
I'd like to show you something.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,480
You know what this is?

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,400
Maybe if I press this button.

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,140
This is a cassette.

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,920
A cassette player with a little cassette in here.

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,760
And there's nothing written on it.

20
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,580
So we'll just have to play it to see what it is.

21
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,640
Do you ever imagine things?

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,740
Are they scary things?

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,960
Do you ever imagine things?

24
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,460
Things you'd like to have?

25
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,020
Did you ever see a cat's eyes in the dark?

26
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,760
And wonder what they were?

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,420
Did you ever pretend about things like that before?

28
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,500
Did you ever throw anything

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,340
in the garden of your mind?

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,940
You can grow ideas

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,140
in the garden of your mind.

32
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,800
It's good to be curious

33
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,380
about many things.

34
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,420
You can think about things and make believe.

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,480
All you have to do is think

36
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,860
and they'll grow.

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,300
Imagine every person that you see

38
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,800
is somewhat different.

39
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,440
From every other person in the world.

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,500
Some can do some things.

41
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,640
Some can do others.

42
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,740
Did you ever think of the many things

43
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,180
you've learned to do?

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,000
Did you ever throw anything

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,840
in the garden of your mind?

46
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,540
You can grow ideas

47
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,660
in the garden of your mind.

48
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,280
It's good to be curious

49
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,080
about many things.

50
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,960
You can think about things and make believe.

51
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,980
All you have to do is think

52
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,360
and they'll grow.

53
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,580
Did you feel like going like that?

54
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,600
Let's give the fish some food.

55
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,580
Mr. McVeigh's late mail.

56
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,700
I didn't order any whistles.

57
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,100
That's what they call a slide whistle.

58
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,260
Did you feel like going like that?

59
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,640
There are so many things

60
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,320
to learn about in this world.

61
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,320
And so many people who can help us learn.

62
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,760
And so many people who can help us learn.

63
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,880
Did you ever throw anything

64
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,720
in the garden of your mind?

65
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,620
In the garden of your mind.

66
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,480
You can grow ideas

67
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,520
in the garden of your mind.

68
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,800
In the garden of your mind.

69
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,200
It's good to be curious

70
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,800
about many things.

71
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,760
You can think about things

72
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,840
and make believe.

73
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,840
All you have to do is think.

74
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,920
You can think about things

75
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,000
and make believe.

76
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,080
All you have to do is think.

77
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,580
And they'll grow.

78
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,820
Ah, yes friends.

79
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,980
That Mr. Rogers mashup,

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,220
Garden of Your Mind,

81
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,360
is from a video that my son

82
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,000
sent me the link to

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,920
on YouTube.

84
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,100
PBS Digital Studios commissioned

85
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,720
John Boswell of Symphony of Science

86
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,320
to do the video in honor of the late

87
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,820
Fred Rogers,

88
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,540
the star of the beloved children's series

89
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,920
Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,

90
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,840
which aired from 1968 to 2001.

91
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,240
Good Lord.

92
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,760
That's 33 years.

93
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,220
How can anybody do a show for 33 years

94
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,300
without going insane?

95
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,060
Oh wait.

96
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,360
How long have I been doing subgenius shows?

97
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,160
Puzzling evidence started in 1982.

98
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,000
This is 2012.

99
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,680
That's 30 years.

100
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,700
Well, I've got three more years.

101
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,900
Anyway, I found that very touching.

102
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,500
Although I was never a big Mr. Rogers fan.

103
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,820
I'm more from the Captain Kangaroo generation.

104
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,800
But my kids liked him.

105
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,080
And he apparently liked everybody.

106
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,280
And certainly he had a calmer approach

107
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,900
than Sesame Street.

108
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,760
If there's anything like that around today,

109
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,100
I sure don't know about it.

110
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,220
This particular hour of Slack,

111
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,780
number 1,366,

112
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,260
is once again composed of other subgenius shows,

113
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,860
from Puzzling Evidence to Ask Dr. Howe

114
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,440
to Radio Synesthesia to Ministry of Slack.

115
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,080
And Phineas Narco of National Cynical

116
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,360
joins Puzzling's show by phone

117
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,500
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave

118
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,120
joins Synesthesia by phone.

119
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,880
And I was there for all of them.

120
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,540
With Dr. Philo Drummond.

121
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,480
X days are coming.

122
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,740
And although we'll record hours

123
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,420
of future shows then,

124
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,640
until those get edited,

125
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,260
my time as show assembler is very limited.

126
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,000
In fact, to tell the truth,

127
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,240
I'm doing these credits

128
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,080
over the swinging love corpses, by the way,

129
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,640
before hearing a lot of this show.

130
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,060
So it may be kind of rough.

131
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,280
It might not go down well

132
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,980
on the polished ears of the liberal

133
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,880
and the modernist,

134
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,860
as old Pastor George said.

135
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,020
Or as Pastor David Epley used to say.

136
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,920
But it's real radio.

137
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,500
Some of it is not new.

138
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
In fact, the next thing I'm playing

139
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,160
and what comes at the end

140
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,760
are from the very earliest days

141
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,060
of Puzzling Evidence,

142
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,640
back when it was still technically

143
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,420
Bob Nelson's show

144
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,880
and Dr. Gary Gubrogfran used to phone in regularly

145
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,640
before he moved to Santa Cruz.

146
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,060
But you'll also hear him phone in to recent shows

147
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,240
now 30 years later.

148
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,640
Jesus, 30 years.

149
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,760
So from the year of 1982,

150
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,020
or maybe 1983,

151
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,520
here's Gary.

152
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,860
We're waiting for someone to call

153
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,520
and ask us about the subgenius religion

154
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,480
where the prophet J.R. Bob Dobbs

155
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,660
is the venerated personality.

156
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,960
This religion is gone.

157
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,540
It's completely undetected

158
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,180
simply through a lack of communication.

159
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,440
But it was a hard thing to get the message out.

160
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,380
The doctors and the doctors in the noise surgery,

161
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,240
the doctors who take apart the instruments

162
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,560
and reassemble the instruments at each one of the sessions

163
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,920
are funny in different order.

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,660
Why they put drum sets back inside guitars

165
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,340
when they go home is throw them in the back of the van

166
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,000
and drive across the bridge as if it didn't matter

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,860
how much they cost.

168
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,900
And you'll be hearing some of that doctor music

169
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,860
in just a little while.

170
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,880
Yes, but first we'd like to,

171
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,100
we'd like to rant just for a moment, if we might.

172
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,620
If we might just take a tiny bit of your time

173
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,260
and try to explain to you how this is important

174
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,980
and critical, this radio show can be in your mind.

175
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,580
All of the doctors talk at once.

176
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,640
And if the doctors of the Bob were here,

177
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,220
they would be able to tell you.

178
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,880
If Sterno or Jane or was here,

179
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,080
they would be able to tell you.

180
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,760
And even if Sterno or J.R. Bob Dobbs

181
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,100
and we were all running in the evening,

182
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,360
and there was a sound,

183
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,220
and the doctors were totally afraid

184
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,200
and great artists,

185
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,440
well, you can ask us about that.

186
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,060
I mean, we can't tell you, because, dear,

187
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,960
Bob Dobbs has not come on this show to tell you,

188
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,140
because he sends us and gives us the checks

189
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,800
so that we can tell you about it.

190
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,700
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

191
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,080
He will not be on this show.

192
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,080
Oh, hello.

193
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:02,820
Hello.

194
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,080
Why Bob Dobbs and not Bob Nelson?

195
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,560
They're two different people.

196
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,740
No, Bob Nelson is the DJ,

197
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,380
and yeah, that's him right there, remember?

198
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,280
Bob Dobbs is a salesman,

199
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,360
and he's over there, remember?

200
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,520
What's a Doug to do?

201
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,580
What's a Doug to do?

202
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,760
He's just, well, Doug,

203
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,460
Doug's got to do what he's got to do.

204
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,420
Yes, Dr. Doole.

205
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,100
Just hope, pray, that he's Doug enough.

206
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,680
Yes, I'm Doug enough,

207
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,420
but it took me years to get here.

208
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,880
Dr. Doole, that's the doctor from Bolivia

209
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,460
that just left.

210
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,140
He's in Miami right now, stuck.

211
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,020
Oh, Dr. Doole.

212
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,160
Oh, Doole, yes, he called several gentlemen

213
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,420
from Bolivia,

214
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,540
and he's stuck in Miami for about five days,

215
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,240
so if you'd like to call Miami right now,

216
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,260
I'm going to hang up, call Miami.

217
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,180
He probably has a lot of things

218
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,980
you really like,

219
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,120
and you could run into him.

220
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,100
You'd probably have a good time.

221
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:45,720
You know what I mean.

222
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,660
Dr. Doole?

223
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,720
Yeah, Dr. Doole.

224
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,220
I know he's just a genius chick.

225
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,400
Dr. Doole.

226
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,260
He's a genius.

227
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:52,520
He's a genius.

228
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:52,740
He's a church.

229
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,600
He's a foundation.

230
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,160
Oh, do you want to talk to Doug Smith?

231
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:55,960
Okay, here he goes.

232
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,140
Yeah, this is Doug here.

233
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,320
Hi, Doug.

234
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,220
Yeah, he'll be here in a minute.

235
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,660
Don't worry.

236
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,040
Well, anyway, what was it that you wanted

237
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,120
to ask us about the church?

238
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,320
Or is this just some kind of display of airtime?

239
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,480
Well, it could be a little bit of both, could it not?

240
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,240
Yeah, well, it could be,

241
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,640
but it's probably a lot more fun for the listeners

242
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,320
if we all start talking real funny.

243
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,900
Talk funny about the church.

244
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,400
Okay.

245
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,400


246
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,400


247
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,400


248
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,120
The church of the sub-genius will take totally normal paints and destroy their lives and

249
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,400
totally alienate them from their parents, but it'll give them like three or four dozen

250
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,280
intimate friends that will send the paints over to them in the mail.

251
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,020
Any good branded narcotics would do the same.

252
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,220
Any good branded narcotics would be the same.

253
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,140
Yeah, but it won't last as long.

254
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:42,860
That's right.

255
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,480
You can't get a book either.

256
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,700
We've got a book.

257
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,160
It's not that expensive.

258
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,660
You've got an expensive book.

259
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,400
And narcotics can't break your tape recorder.

260
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,690
Well, that depends on the gene splice.

261
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,750
It doesn't sound like a gene splice.

262
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,390
No, we just use cassettes.

263
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,450
We don't have to mess with the splicing any longer.

264
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,710
Oh, that's interesting.

265
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,590
That's interesting.

266
00:09:59,770 --> 00:09:59,930
Yeah.

267
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:00,490
Yeah.

268
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,910
Well, I happen to have been called three times in the past lifetime.

269
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,950
You've called this show two or three times in the past lifetime.

270
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,610
Yeah, well, I recognize your voice.

271
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,650
You know, I think you're calling from your car.

272
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,350
Right.

273
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,590
Oh, okay.

274
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,270
Well, you're that guy.

275
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,730
Well, how come you don't know about the Jungle Gentleman from Green Hill?

276
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,410
The Jungle Gentleman from Green Hill is the guy who's been in the show for a long time.

277
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:19,410


278
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:19,410


279
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,890
I think I've been calling him before my time and another time.

280
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,950
Well, do you think you could launch the head?

281
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,630
Launch the head?

282
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,070
Give me about three micros to plow back to 2280.

283
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:29,710
2280.

284
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,650
Oh, well, as the Reverend J.R.

285
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:41,770
Hyperfleet said, he has the pills and the food-like product available from the Bloody

286
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:41,770


287
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:41,790
That's it?

288
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,430
The pills or kill me.

289
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,030
I think you should write the piece and write the Bloody Head.

290
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:46,670
Yeah, hang up.

291
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,950
Or it can be more killed than.

292
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,190
You're hung up, all right, or you wouldn't be calling.

293
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:49,390
You're hung up.

294
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,390


295
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,390


296
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,390


297
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,390


298
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,390


299
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,390


300
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,390


301
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,390


302
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,710
You're hung up.

303
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,390
You didn't know your cover when you dialed 8484425.

304
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,890
The rest of this message can be received on Magnuson.

305
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,630
Adapter number one.

306
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,850
Pick up the sign wave by tuning in to your local SubDF.

307
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:07,810
Bye.

308
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:09,570
SubDF.

309
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,430
Yeah, good night.

310
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,790
See you later.

311
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,290
Well, I would like to answer the most intimate questions of this guy's life.

312
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,370
If he could have called up and said, look, my question is, what do you think of the Jungle

313
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:19,550
Shack?

314
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,390
I mean, I have a girlfriend who doesn't love me.

315
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,210
What should the church tell me to do?

316
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,730
We could call him.

317
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,050
Trying desperately to call.

318
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:26,710
Well, that's all right.

319
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,090
We can't.

320
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,210
Yeah, we can't let that.

321
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,330
Yeah, it'll be mysterious.

322
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,330
Anyway, you know, if you want to know what to do with your money or buy or sell stocks

323
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,930
or any kind of important advice, the church has answers for almost all your problems or

324
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,010
problems for any of your life situations.

325
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,170
Yeah, so I can see the Uberbrown.

326
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,350
That's it.

327
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,350


328
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,350


329
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,350


330
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,350


331
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,350


332
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,350


333
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,350


334
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,070
Now hovering above.

335
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,470
Well, there he goes.

336
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,510
We thought we had the brow here, but I guess he just kind of flowed away.

337
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,250
Well, I have to go get the magic secret music.

338
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,370
Oh, I didn't know this.

339
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,190
For Doctor's Mansion.

340
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,950
And you, the listener, will be invited to sing along, even though you don't know the words and you never have to.

341
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,710
Well, actually, it's real easy to sing the song, though.

342
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:11,690
That's right.

343
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,090
And you probably could really benefit from singing this song.

344
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:19,770
I think a lot of you that listen to the show on a regular basis know about Gary Cabrera's foundation.

345
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,990
I think you should buy the Honk If You Love Cabrera sticker that comes from the Little Rock Garden song.

346
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,490
And through the censor, by the manager, they will say that this is Little Rock Garden's song.

347
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,450
From previous to the new, we'll do it again before the show is over.

348
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,990
Yes, it's true.

349
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,750
The launch of society produces Honk If You Love Cabrera.

350
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:39,890
That's right.

351
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,350
Sanctified, justified, and glorious.

352
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,690
Right to send you the light speed.

353
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,950
And you know, I say it in a kind of a symphonic truth.

354
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:47,970
This is him laying.

355
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,250
I put it on the back of my truck in the window, brother.

356
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,530
Well, back to the head.

357
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,250
This is what R&D is planned for the future.

358
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,230
Where does it coincide with Dobbs' prophecy?

359
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,390
What relation between it and the Doctors for Dobbs exists?

360
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,850
We have our protection on the head now.

361
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,610
Well, let's bring him in here to the studio.

362
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,610
Well, and how will the head figure in your chemical life?

363
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,710
Oh, I don't know.

364
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,570
It should have.

365
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,630
It should have something to do with the dense pack application of some genius music.

366
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,490
Soliciting the, say, three or four different doctor bands at the same time.

367
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,610
That kind of thing.

368
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,210
It would keep me away from my video dental temperament.

369
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:24,850
I agree.

370
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,950
Well, I don't know.

371
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,630
What about these enlightened subgenius who expect or anticipate expiation on the part of the Doctors for Dobbs

372
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,590
in their supposed real slack rantings against proportionate Dobbs rigid textuality?

373
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:43,670
Well, I think if it ever comes down to it, the difference between Doctors for Bob and the Doctors who dare not speak about it,

374
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,210
is that the Doctors who dare not speak their name is Doctors for Bob have the head,

375
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,730
whereas the Doctors who dare not speak their name don't even have a studio to work in.

376
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,050
They don't have anything.

377
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:53,430
Oh, yeah?

378
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,590
No, they make those tapes on the bus.

379
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,950
Wow, I see.

380
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,210
They just kind of travel around.

381
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,290
What city are they in?

382
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,250
They're in Oakland.

383
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,030
They're from Oakland.

384
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,170
They're in Oakland, but they're down from West Oakland, down by the post office.

385
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:04,630
Oh, yeah?

386
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:05,770
Yeah.

387
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,170
What kind of songs do they play?

388
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:07,610
What's in them?

389
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,650
Well, they do a lot of Doctor music, but they mostly mix dub songs.

390
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,730
Yeah, sort of like that.

391
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,150
We're going to revoke about this cult and make a result in our insult because we're a cult,

392
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,350
and that's the result of our tumult, though it is difficult.

393
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:23,450
Yes.

394
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,430
Yes.

395
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,930
Let's go with that cult.

396
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,410
Maybe we could play a Doctor song.

397
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,490
Yeah, maybe.

398
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,290
This is going to be arranged.

399
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,230
You got payola?

400
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,690
Hey?

401
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,570
What do you think this is, eh?

402
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,510
You just walk in here and command the station or something.

403
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:36,790
I know.

404
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:42,050
Why don't we turn all the sound effects off and shut all the DJs up and then...

405
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,670
Well, anyway, let's turn the whole radio station off except for this one little Doctor tape.

406
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:48,990
Okay.

407
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,510
We're all worried.

408
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,470
Pull this lever.

409
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,470
It's, uh...

410
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,510
It's queued up in tape machine number 5,622.

411
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,390
There's so much, but, uh...

412
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,850
It's so much fun here in the morning.

413
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:01,690
Okay.

414
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,010
And listen to me, not the other guy.

415
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:04,610
Not that guy.

416
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,970
All these rec shows from Pacifica is going out all across.

417
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:08,350
I know.

418
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:12,450
There are loads of people who live on little boats in the Berkeley Marina who are listening right now.

419
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:12,890
Yeah.

420
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,430
Let's go.

421
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,470
Exploring the body, we're going to look at the colon.

422
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,990
What exactly does it do?

423
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,650
And how does excremeditation help you get right with Bob?

424
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,550
Surgery and all the green blood had been washed from the floors.

425
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,290
Surgery's done, he said.

426
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,290
Where's my drink?

427
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,950
I need a smoke.

428
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,650
Tape runs out.

429
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,670
Mm-hmm.

430
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,690
In his hopelessness rage, he declared...

431
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,770
Damn you, Chitwood!

432
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,630
The sacred skin mark of Chitwood wears its head again.

433
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,310
It's possible.

434
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,970
I learned how to make a bike out of Passade.

435
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:05,890
It's passable.

436
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,870
It's passable.

437
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,790
I mean, if this was something you were making a bike out of, it'd be passable.

438
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,510
You'd still get pulled over.

439
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,250
You'd get a ticket.

440
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:14,650
No.

441
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,710
But it'd be passable.

442
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,430
You could still say,

443
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,870
No, it's okay.

444
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,350
I made this show.

445
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,650
It's an art project.

446
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,490
It still runs.

447
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,210
As you can see, there's pieces and parts falling off.

448
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,030
That's all part of it.

449
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,170
It's a converted unicycle.

450
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,530
You know, that's what they say about the girls down in San Francisco.

451
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:32,690
What?

452
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,650
They're passable.

453
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,350
They're passable.

454
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,350
Speaking of passable, let's talk about my colonoscopy again.

455
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,210
Keep going.

456
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:41,730
Keep going.

457
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:41,870
Keep going.

458
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,050
Keep going.

459
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:42,550
Keep going.

460
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,550


461
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,610
Keep going.

462
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:42,650
Keep going.

463
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:42,650


464
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,090
Keep going.

465
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:43,190


466
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:43,370


467
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:43,370


468
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:43,650
Keep going.

469
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:43,670
Keep going.

470
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,690
Keep going.

471
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,370
Keep going.

472
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:51,490


473
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:51,490


474
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:51,490


475
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:51,490


476
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:51,490


477
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:51,510


478
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:51,550


479
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:51,550


480
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:51,550


481
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:57,530
And my unborn child.

482
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,670
That's right.

483
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,110
She did knock me up.

484
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:08,790
I got knocked up by Larry Lasker giving me a colonoscopy.

485
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,730
So that film, Juthair, was actually about to do it.

486
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,470
That is some reverse end.

487
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:13,650
That is some reverse end.

488
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,410
engineering right there.

489
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,610
Sitting there, you go in,

490
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,950
get your bottle of J&B,

491
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:22,910
and...

492
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,530
Go fuck yourself.

493
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,710
Turkenduff and Vika Dickin.

494
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,470
Go round and round, round and round.

495
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,970
How dare you invade my reality tunnel?

496
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,770
How dare you?

497
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,550
They're COINTELPRO, and they're trying to use

498
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,110
their MKUltras against us.

499
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,830
I believe we have a newly ordained

500
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,230
minister in our midst now.

501
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,170
Caller, go ahead.

502
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,810
Hey, is it...

503
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:48,630
Can you hear me?

504
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,130
Yes, we can.

505
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,830
You're on the air, caller.

506
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,590
Is it true that you are a

507
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,270
newly ordained minister, sir?

508
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,830
Yes, I just

509
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,510
signed on today.

510
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,350
Well, praise God.

511
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,090
Did you get your package back?

512
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,110
Did you pay your $30?

513
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,170
Sucker!

514
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,710
You have been

515
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,970
duped, my friend.

516
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,710
I just received a message that said

517
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,010
you could fry an egg on your face right now.

518
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,490
Or you could put a sausage on your residual taint.

519
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,370
I'm gonna put it inside of my colon.

520
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,430
There you go.

521
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,290
Oh yeah.

522
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,250
That's hot.

523
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,730
That's a blast for me.

524
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,070
I'm blushing now.

525
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,110
Right?

526
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,410
I'm like, wow, what do you call that?

527
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,450
Oh, so it was just people talking about...

528
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:43,590
Colon?

529
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:43,650


530
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,190
Dicks and colons and vaginas and...

531
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,410
Shit dick, McGee.

532
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,550
Excuse me?

533
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,310
It just came from nowhere.

534
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,510
I don't know why I said that.

535
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,190
He's got a little Tourette's.

536
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,110
Shit, son of a bitch!

537
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,830
But those words sound funny together.

538
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,870
That's what I'm trying to say.

539
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,110
Shit dick, McGee.

540
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,770
Now I'm gonna get punched in the face through the internet.

541
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,330
Here it comes.

542
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,510
So that means on the way to the doctors tomorrow,

543
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,390
in the third time, colon goes down.

544
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,370
He's gonna die.

545
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,370
Because he's Canadian.

546
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,170
It makes him think he's not left.

547
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,610
Hey, that's right, man.

548
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,050
See, Canadians are weak.

549
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,030
Is this a radio show or a flea circus?

550
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,050
What's going on here?

551
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,950
It's a radio circus.

552
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,010
Come one, come all.

553
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,270
Yelta, yelta, yelta.

554
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:38,790
It's the circus, Cooper.

555
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,090
It's the three ring circus.

556
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,250
It's the three ring circus.

557
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:48,250


558
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,670
Well, that was a nice little sober lecture on health

559
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,610
from the Ministry of Slack podcast.

560
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,990
Some of those damn kids weren't even around

561
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,750
when the first Puzzling Evidence show went out on KPFA.

562
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,070
My, how the years do fly by.

563
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,250
In fact, in the following cut,

564
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,950
you'll hear me sounding about 10 years older than I even am

565
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,810
due to a cold,

566
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,250
talking about health-related issues with Princess Wee.

567
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,410
And it's a good thing I'm not running for president,

568
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,130
because I give away a couple of things

569
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,650
that I'm not proud of from my college days

570
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,830
in the 1970s as a young filmmaker.

571
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:29,930
So, lights, roll camera, speed, slate, action.

572
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:36,910
I'm enjoying sipping my new medicinal healing drink

573
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,470
for the car.

574
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:43,250
It is hot water, real lemon juice,

575
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,390
and I'm going to drink it.

576
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:43,690
And I'm going to drink it with a few drops of lemon juice

577
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,670
and cherry Luden's cough drops.

578
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,790
What?

579
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,370
Do you dissolve the cough drop in the drink?

580
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:51,890
Yes.

581
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,850
And it's very good on my throat.

582
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,090
Well, I'll be dang.

583
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,170
So, that's my new miracle cure for the cold

584
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,070
that I'm not allowing into me.

585
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,750
It's not allowed in.

586
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,730
When I was much younger,

587
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,750
I had a miracle cure for health.

588
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:18,250
I discovered that the prescription amphetamines

589
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,090
that this croaker near SMU College in Dallas

590
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,310
would prescribe to students

591
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:28,550
would dissolve completely in a bottle of Thunderbird wine.

592
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,010
Ah.

593
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:34,190
And you could throw two of those speed pills,

594
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,450
they were diet pills, Benzedrine,

595
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,230
into a bottle of Thunderbird wine.

596
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,550
It was 20% alcohol.

597
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,170
So, you'd drink a quarter of the bottle of wine,

598
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,570
you'd be instantly drunk.

599
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,790
And then about 20 minutes later,

600
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,870
you'd feel like Spider-Man.

601
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,650
Then, you know, you'd proceed to work.

602
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,510
In my case, I was editing World of the Future.

603
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:03,330
You'd proceed to work for, you know, two or three hours,

604
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,390
and then you'd start to feel kind of, you know,

605
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,730
your head would hurt from gritting your teeth

606
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,330
and licking your lips repeatedly

607
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,750
and scratching holes in your skin.

608
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,250
And then you'd look down, and by God,

609
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:19,650
there's another three-quarters of a bottle of Thunderbird there.

610
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,990
With another hit and a half of that damn speed.

611
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,950
I put that down and never did it again

612
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,990
when I reached up to grab the little gray film reels

613
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,550
and they all looked like giant gray blood-filled ticks.

614
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,390
Good idea. Good idea.

615
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,190
So, kids, the stories they tell you about speed,

616
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,350
it's true.

617
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,750
Speed kills not immediately,

618
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,530
but slowly and in a really unpleasant way.

619
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,830
So stick with your coffee and I suppose your energy drinks or whatnot.

620
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:00,810
Kids.

621
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:07,070
For people my age, I'm not even, I'm not trying to preach to.

622
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:08,970
Um.

623
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,370
The Alan Arkin character in Little Miss Sunshine covered that pretty well.

624
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,070
Absolutely.

625
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,330
When you're a kid, doing this drugs would be crazy.

626
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,670
If you're my age, you'd be crazy not to.

627
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,930
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

628
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,610
But he ODs before the end of the movie

629
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,830
after teaching the nine-year-old girl to dance like a pole bar stripper.

630
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,370
What a way to go, ODing on heroin.

631
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,590
Just like go to big sleep.

632
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,370
. . .

633
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,010
I wouldn't know.

634
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:46,170
I've never actually touched that stuff because I,

635
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,870
I always read up on things first,

636
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,470
including the stuff the doctor gives me.

637
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:57,930
And, um, education can go a long way.

638
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:01,150
I've never sampled any Harry Owen myself.

639
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,550
I've never sampled anything that, uh,

640
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,810
well, actually I read up on speed before I ever tried it.

641
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,510
But I knew that, that it was going,

642
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,530
by definition, it was going to have to be for a limited time.

643
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,970
And I stuck to my guns.

644
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,610
Also, they made it really hard to find.

645
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,910
That was a long time ago.

646
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,610
It's probably real easy.

647
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:32,510
I've had two, two of my friends who I've watched slowly grind their teeth until they died.

648
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,330
It's sad.

649
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,430
It is sad.

650
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,870
It's a tragedy.

651
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,950
Well, they turned into assholes first.

652
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,310
So in that respect, it wasn't sad.

653
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,230
It was justice.

654
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,290
But it's, it's bad to die before death.

655
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,030
It's bad to be turned into an asshole by drugs.

656
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,250
Um, and, and most stimulants will, well, most of them will do that.

657
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,930
Marijuana won't turn you into an asshole.

658
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:04,310
It will turn you into a lazy, slacker, rewardian, piss-a-bed.

659
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,250
. . .

660
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,430
If, if you're, you know,

661
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,150
some people I might mention.

662
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,350
It's a bit.

663
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:12,490
Ahem.

664
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:19,810
I, that never had that effect on me because I'm sort of a, I'm an emergent tile.

665
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,510
This show seems to be responding.

666
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,350
This is one I didn't get.

667
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,270
What the hell was that thing about?

668
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,410
But it's just, I've been handed a soundtrack of a. . .

669
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:31,930
What the hell was that movie about?

670
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,990
The movie Constantine.

671
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,990
With, uh. . .

672
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,190
Yeah, I saw that.

673
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,230
With Johnny. . .

674
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,670
Keanu Reeves.

675
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,930
Yeah, with Keanu Reeves.

676
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,390
Yeah.

677
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:45,030
Didn't our friend, Piss Baptist John Shirley write, uh, like a sequel or some of the. . .

678
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,030


679
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,030


680
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,790
He wrote the second Constantine novel.

681
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,530
I don't, I don't actually read his novel.

682
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,430
Or did he re, write the novel of that?

683
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,890
He just wrote a. . .

684
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:52,930
A movie.

685
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,410
It was a comic book, then a movie.

686
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,650
And then he wrote like an imagining of other events and things that happened.

687
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,350
First it was a subgenius gag on the, on the show.

688
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,190
Then it was a novel, or comic book.

689
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,450
Then a novel, then a movie, then a novel of the movie.

690
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,150
And then a trailer.

691
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,310
Then a comic book of the novel.

692
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,750
And then a trailer.

693
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,930
And then a poster, a theater poster.

694
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,370
No, actually the poster and the trailer came first.

695
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,390
Yeah, that's right.

696
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,290
Before the sub, the show. . .

697
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:16,390
It's supposed to.

698
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:16,550
. .

699
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:16,930
Joke, actually.

700
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,710
We're not giving credit where credit's. . .

701
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,950
It's kind of like Machete.

702
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:20,970
Yeah.

703
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:21,750
Yeah.

704
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,170
Yeah.

705
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,690
They made a musical out of it.

706
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,050
And it was a pinball machine and. . .

707
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,590
And then your Mattel toy set at McDonald's.

708
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,310
Yeah.

709
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,850
Man, I missed all that.

710
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,270
Little tiny machine.

711
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,310
The little baby Machete and his baby.

712
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,150
The little baby Machete.

713
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:36,430
Yeah.

714
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:36,430


715
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:36,430


716
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:36,430


717
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,590
And then the villains and baby hookers.

718
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:43,490
They were able to buy the Queen of UFOs special seat on the sex goddess thing with those little,

719
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:47,030
with 103 little baby Machete things from McDonald's.

720
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,690
You never know what's going to be valuable later.

721
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:52,250
Exactly.

722
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:56,150
Think if you still had that Pee Wee Herman talking doll.

723
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:00,210
The wind up, the pull the string and he talks Pee Wee doll.

724
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,730
Like the one Paul has in handcuffed facing the corner.

725
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,490
That's funny.

726
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,410
Potter Nostril has one that's. . .

727
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:06,410


728
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,990
That's being serviced by the Little Mermaid.

729
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:16,270
A marionette Pee Wee Herman is being taken care of by the Little Mermaid.

730
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:20,770
I think we should redo Men in Black with Pee Wee Herman as the young guy.

731
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,790
But Machete is now Mad Ass.

732
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,230
Now Machete played by Paul Rubens.

733
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,570
That would be. . .

734
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:29,570


735
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:30,550
Interesting.

736
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,650
That would be different.

737
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,810
I mean the guy's done 30 Rock.

738
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,070
He should be able to do Machete.

739
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,410
Yeah.

740
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:36,410


741
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,050
He's got a lot of experience.

742
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,050


743
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,450
I'll tell you I saw that in a theater.

744
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,030
I went to see the I think the devilette dance.

745
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,090
Young ladies.

746
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:46,850
Very funny.

747
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:47,610
A little dance.

748
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,650
And then. . .

749
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:49,650


750
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,510
It was that those two movies played on a big old screen.

751
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:56,250
So when I saw Planet of Terror or whatever it was.

752
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,930
The first movie was.

753
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,470
It has Machete afterwards as a commercial.

754
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:03,930
It was a quite an experience because it was like sitting in the theater in 1970s again.

755
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,410
With big splices and cigarette burns and the whole.

756
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:06,410


757
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:06,410


758
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:06,410


759
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:06,410


760
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:06,410


761
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:06,410


762
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:06,410


763
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:06,410


764
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:06,410


765
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:06,410


766
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:06,410


767
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:06,410


768
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:06,410


769
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:10,830
And all that stuff that movies had the soundtrack that was off.

770
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:11,970
And. . .

771
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:12,270
They. . .

772
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:12,610
Weep.

773
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,210
With the wrong Mexican.

774
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:14,790
Yeah.

775
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:15,970
Machete.

776
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,130
And things missing.

777
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,810
Coming to theaters near you.

778
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,030
They should have had like the smell of old cigarettes and cheap wine.

779
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:23,470
Well yeah.

780
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:23,810
Yeah.

781
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,050
Yeah.

782
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,470
True.

783
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,490
That comes with the $150 DVD set.

784
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:27,870
That's funny.

785
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,190
There was one thing he had to shorten in real life.

786
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,010
It took a lot longer.

787
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,890
It's when the film would get caught up and the bulb would burn through the. . .

788
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:35,110
The frame.

789
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,390
And in the film. . .

790
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,390


791
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,390


792
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,390


793
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,390


794
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,390


795
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,390


796
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,390


797
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,390


798
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,390


799
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,470
In the movie. . .

800
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,510
In the fake version. . .

801
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,930
It's all fixed in a second or two.

802
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,510
And in real life folks. . .

803
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,090
You used to have to sit there in the theater and yell at the poor people.

804
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:44,410
Right.

805
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,530
Throw popcorn at people.

806
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,090
They hardly was. . .

807
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:46,090


808
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,550
And in fact there's a movie called The Projectionist where it's a. . .

809
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:49,990
Oh. . .

810
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,530
A little. . .

811
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:50,970
Oh that guy.

812
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,610
A little cartoon.

813
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,910
I can just see the. . .

814
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,850
The little. . .

815
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,890
Gerald McBoing Boing cartoon.

816
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,230
And it's running along.

817
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,970
And I'm sitting there in a Navy theater.

818
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,930
When I'm in the Navy.

819
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,230
And thinking. . .

820
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,110
Not another cartoon.

821
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:01,970
God damn it.

822
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,690
And. . .

823
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,890
And then the film goes. . .

824
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,670
Goes off a big white screen. . .

825
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,310
And it's there. . .

826
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:06,470
You know. . .

827
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,070
White screen. . .

828
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,010
Fifteen seconds. . .

829
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:08,810
Thirty seconds. . .

830
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,870
All the guys around me like. . .

831
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,510
And they're throwing stuff at the window. . .

832
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,810
And then slowly the frame gets smaller. . .

833
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,130
And you realize it's on the movie. . .

834
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,530
And you're in a theater where the frame is broken. . .

835
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,690
And all the audiences. . .

836
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,210
You saw The Projectionist in the Navy?

837
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:22,770
Yeah.

838
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,670
It's an old film.

839
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,050
I saw it in. . .

840
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:29,010
I was in film school because I. . .

841
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,030
I had flat feet. . .

842
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,310
Yeah. . .

843
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,050
That was it. . .

844
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:32,910
I was four. . .

845
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,610
That's all. . .

846
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,550
I had flat feet. . .

847
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,250
The Projectionist had such an influence on me. . .

848
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,910
That I made a Projectionist uniform like that. . .

849
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,590
And wore it into combat. . .

850
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,890
And made media barrage cut-ups for the rest of my life. . .

851
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,890
Because I just thought the Projectionist guy was amazing. . .

852
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:50,790
Actually, Gail. . .

853
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,170
I think. . .

854
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,650
Chuck McGann produced and directed that. . .

855
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,130
Yeah. . .

856
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,550
But the woman who did the editing on the black and white horse. . .

857
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,890
Or, you know, the wonderful older man. . .

858
00:29:58,890 --> 00:29:59,890
The awful world of men. . .

859
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:00,910
The media barrage. . .

860
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:01,030
Yeah. . .

861
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,590
World of Tomorrow. . .

862
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,250
Also did J-Men. . .

863
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,430
So now. . .

864
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:04,690
Really? . .

865
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,070
Yeah. . .

866
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,490
Okay. . .

867
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,790
I was watching that. . .

868
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,790
She. . .

869
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,370
Her name. . .

870
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,290
Gail. . .

871
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,070
Yeah. . .

872
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,730
Gail something. . .

873
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:11,870
Gail something. . .

874
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,510
Gail . . .

875
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,430
Gail . . .

876
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,150
And you see it. . .

877
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:14,590
It's like, of course. . .

878
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,150
I saw J-Men Forever at Philo's house. . .

879
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,730
He put on an ancient. . .

880
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,010
Yeah. . .

881
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,950
It was like every night flight. . .

882
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,970
That ancient. . .

883
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:22,130
Yeah. . .

884
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,210
Ancient show that. . .

885
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:23,810
Yeah. . .

886
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,030
How many are there? . .

887
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,130
There were like. . .

888
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,190
It was on for six years or something. . .

889
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,770
I remember getting to the. . .

890
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,410
To the Evil Gary. . .

891
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:32,850
Weep. . .

892
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:33,350
Non. . .

893
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,150
Non show. . .

894
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,010
And Gary took off. . .

895
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,930
And left us in the lurch there. . .

896
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,030
At Philo's house. . .

897
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,590
So we were forced to watch J-Men over and over. . .

898
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,410
On a rainy weekend. . .

899
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:46,450
That was right after the Doc's Doc number two. . .

900
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,870
Oh, brothers. . .

901
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,350
You know. . .

902
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,250
You know what the show doesn't remind me of? . .

903
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:51,470
The show. . .

904
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,210
Any Disney movie I've ever seen. . .

905
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,170
Has they dangled in the wind. . .

906
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:55,170


907
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,010
But I. . .

908
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:56,630
But it's. . .

909
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,050
The show doesn't remind me of any Disney movie I've ever seen. . .

910
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:00,450
Well, we. . .

911
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,590
We are kind of missing a princess. . .

912
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,770
We are definitely missing a princess. . .

913
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,950
Yeah, she's taking care of her mom right now. . .

914
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,250
On the other side of town. . .

915
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:12,150
Actually, I think she's in another show. . .

916
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:16,670
She's having to do another show in another city. . .

917
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,630
Right this minute. . .

918
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,150
How about that? . .

919
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,230
Yeah, I'm missing her. . .

920
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:24,470
It's not one of those, like, podcasts for geriatric people. . .

921
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:29,010
Where, like, they, you know, go in and sing Sinatra songs right in the middle of the. . .

922
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,750
The staying clan is. . .

923
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:30,750


924
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:31,650
All over your video. . .

925
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:35,710
It's some rival anti-religion like the Unitarians. . .

926
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,510
Oh. . .

927
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,330
Like, the. . .

928
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,770
The Connyites have started their own shows and stuff? . .

929
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,070
Yeah, the Connyitarians. . .

930
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,190
No, I really. . .

931
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,250
I have a real serious. . .

932
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:45,250


933
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,350
I have a real serious criticism of the Unitarians. . .

934
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:52,650
You know, they're these people who just have a desperate need for churchiness. . .

935
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,510
Right. . .

936
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,390
But they don't have being brainwashed as an excuse. . .

937
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,950
Right. . .

938
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,750
Didn't the Unitarians start as the Puritans? . .

939
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:00,750


940
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:06,490
And after a really bizarre episode living in America and creating a lot of damage and then being damaged. . .

941
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:11,150
Well, they're also good-hearted. They make me ashamed of myself, and that's why I don't go with my. . .

942
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:15,870
The Unitarian missionaries will knock on your door and just say hi. . .

943
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:22,770
Yeah. They're so polite. They're so nice. I just feel out of place. I feel like a vampire in church. . .

944
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:28,750
Actually, the term Unitarian itself is a term that is in opposition to Trinitarian. . .

945
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,730
They started off as a heretical. . .

946
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,090
. . .

947
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:31,090


948
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:31,090


949
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:31,090


950
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:31,090


951
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:31,090


952
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:31,090


953
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:31,090


954
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:31,090


955
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:31,090


956
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:31,090


957
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:31,090


958
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:34,050
You know, like, the Trinitarian movement in Europe during the Enlightenment who said,

959
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,810
no, the Trinity can't be true. . .

960
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,710
. . .

961
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,670
God has to be one.

962
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,090
. . .

963
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:42,690
You know how many Trinitarians it takes to change a light bulb? . .

964
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,050
. . .

965
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,730
Three, but they're really one.

966
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,210
. .

967
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,950
Okay. . .

968
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,550
. .

969
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,970
And they eventually, there was also another movement called the Universalist Movement,

970
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,430
which believed that everyone goes to heaven.

971
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,450
God saves everybody.

972
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:57,010
It doesn't matter who you are, what you did, what you believe.

973
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:01,610
God couldn't possibly condemn anyone to hell because he's just too loving.

974
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,110
And eventually the Unitarians and the Universalists...

975
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,030
Really? I'm out of here, man. I've got things to do.

976
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,330
And eventually the Unitarians and the Universalists got together,

977
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:12,510
and they are now a quasi-religious organization.

978
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:16,950
Anyway, that's the cult my wife is helping out right now.

979
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,550
What's that?

980
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,370
My wife is involved with the Unitarian cult right now.

981
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,690
That's why she's not here doing some genius work.

982
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,810
I was exposed to that myself as a youngster.

983
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:38,030
In fact, what was really awesome about being exposed to the Unitarian cult as a teenager

984
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,570
is they have Sunday school for everyone K-12.

985
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:46,470
And what they give the 7th graders is sex ed.

986
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:52,070
And, like, they showed us images that I cannot describe over the air.

987
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,090
I'm not kidding.

988
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:58,630
They taught us all about different things that people do.

989
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,010
Yippee!

990
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,570
Nothing to do with sex, I'm sure.

991
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,730
Just things people do.

992
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:13,910
At the school I went to, it was explained to me that female breasts were nothing but modified sweat glands.

993
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:15,910
So what are you boys so excited about?

994
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,670
Well, those sweat glands taste pretty good on a salty Friday morning.

995
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:28,830
Provided, you know, you grease the right palms.

996
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:34,670
I think I found out about some genius through the back of a Fangoria magazine.

997
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,130
Really? Of a what magazine?

998
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,130
Fangoria.

999
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,930
What? Huh.

1000
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,770
Yeah.

1001
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,770
I think that's...

1002
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:47,530
If memory serves, I might have met Dr. Onan Canabal.

1003
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,670
He's a great guy.

1004
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:49,810
He's a great guy.

1005
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,570
I was just thinking I need to put on YouTube at some point pretty soon here.

1006
00:34:53,650 --> 00:35:00,750
The subgenius gathering in Tucson, Arizona, whatever year that was where Jeff Robbins is wheeled up to the amplifier...

1007
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,050
Right in front of an amplifier and left there for the entire show.

1008
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,630
And the power went out.

1009
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:12,990
And out front, I almost got in fight with Hal and locals because they couldn't figure out what BlackRock...

1010
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,450
BlackRock was in Nevada.

1011
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,390
They knew that.

1012
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,530
And my plates were from California.

1013
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,310
They knew that.

1014
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:23,290
And so I was trying to explain that I was a ranger, but only for one moment in the BlackRock.

1015
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,850
And they didn't know that.

1016
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:30,770
And they were so upset that they thought, you know, the tattoos and the tats and everything got to fight now.

1017
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:35,990
And so I had to move my car because I was worried they would beat up my poor little car.

1018
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,350
And then we go to show and all the power goes out.

1019
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,670
Probably because of something Chicken John did when he arrived with the bus full of folks.

1020
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:47,330
All I remember is Nikki and her special S&M.

1021
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,010
And I remember that.

1022
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,330
Yeah, I should remember that.

1023
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,650
Maybe I was too overwhelming to look.

1024
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,230
That's all I can remember.

1025
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,410
And the giant talking flaming mouth Dobbs head.

1026
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,450
I am the great and powerful Bob Dobbs.

1027
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,810
Hal was doing the voice.

1028
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:14,630
And Moguloid had made a giant Dobbs head out of paper mache that actually belched flame and had flame coming from its pipe.

1029
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:15,530
And when it...

1030
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,510
And it's voice...

1031
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:16,870
You could...

1032
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,470
You could...

1033
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:26,190
With a really hard tug of a rope, you could pull the thing's jaws up and down and make it speak in Hal's voice.

1034
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:29,190
So I could ask him questions.

1035
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:33,090
I am the great and powerful Dobbs.

1036
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:33,550
Yeah.

1037
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,350
Yeah, I like that.

1038
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:40,210
Hal later did that with a giant buttock at Burning Man, I think.

1039
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,210
Or maybe it was before.

1040
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:41,870
That was very funny.

1041
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,790
Yeah, I'm not sure where it fits in the timeline.

1042
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,630
I think it's later.

1043
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,070
But Chicken John made a giant really...

1044
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,050
You couldn't even tell it was a butt.

1045
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,770
It was just a giant thing of polyester, of the trash bag polyester.

1046
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:55,350
And then the people of the fire department came by and said, you can't do this.

1047
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,650
And so Chicken John said, you're right, and burned it down.

1048
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:03,590
So the flecks of little plastic flying across the playa, like a million trash cans on fire.

1049
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:10,630
Now, I heard that Moguloid's talking Dobbs head that was like six, seven feet tall at least.

1050
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:10,950
Yeah, it is.

1051
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,110
Yeah.

1052
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:12,910
Was...

1053
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:18,650
It ended up being left in Tucson and somebody said, I'll take it and put it on my front lawn.

1054
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,110
And they live next to the main freeway through town.

1055
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:26,110
So everybody driving to work has to look at that horrible face down there on somebody's lawn.

1056
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:26,690
Nice.

1057
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,210
That's the way to do it.

1058
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,030
See, this guy knows.

1059
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,590
Yeah.

1060
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:35,030
I just remember wandering around naked in Burning Man.

1061
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,250
What?

1062
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,890
Somebody said naked?

1063
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,130
What?

1064
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:40,070
Oh, was that you that I saw wandering around naked at Burning Man?

1065
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,570
Well, that must have been me.

1066
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:42,410
Yeah.

1067
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,910
You're right.

1068
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:43,910


1069
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,470
Are you like 80 years old?

1070
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,870
Because that's how you looked at the time.

1071
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,690
Did you ever see Trash Humpers?

1072
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,410
Which?

1073
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,050
Trash Humpers.

1074
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:53,930
No.

1075
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,130
Oh, you must see Trash Humpers.

1076
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:02,250
I just saw a movie called Pig that Lagim gave me a link to.

1077
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,690
You could only download it.

1078
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:04,550
It's so violent.

1079
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:04,850
Trash Humpers.

1080
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,010
And horrible.

1081
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:11,430
It makes everything look clean and nice.

1082
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:12,890
It's a battlefield of a great war on air.

1083
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:12,890


1084
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:12,890


1085
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:12,890


1086
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,770
Trash Humpers is very so genius.

1087
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,050
But it's shot on videotape.

1088
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:21,290
Like, like old VHS videotape.

1089
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:21,990
Huh.

1090
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,310
But it was made a couple years ago.

1091
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,090
I beat the, I beat the socks off of that.

1092
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,410
Trash Humpers.

1093
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,070
Yes, you must see that.

1094
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,610
Another must see on the endless list.

1095
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,450
Endless must sees.

1096
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,730
Keeps growing.

1097
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,130
The sea of must sees.

1098
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,570
Growing for a veritable ocean.

1099
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,630
Longer than our lives.

1100
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,670
More must sees.

1101
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,430
Must see.

1102
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:42,870
The socks.

1103
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:42,870


1104
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:42,870


1105
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:42,870


1106
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:42,870


1107
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:42,870


1108
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:42,870


1109
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:42,870


1110
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:42,870


1111
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,150
Typing them in now.

1112
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,010
We must see.

1113
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,830
The must see sea of must see movies.

1114
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,670
Um, who else?

1115
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,890
Oh, Stang?

1116
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:56,010
I know someone who will remind you of you 30 years ago.

1117
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,030
And I'm going to introduce you to him hopefully this coming X day.

1118
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,550
I hate it when that happens.

1119
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,570
I know.

1120
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,390
Well, um, he's not one of your clones.

1121
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:11,350
But, you know, he's probably someone who, if he fell through a crack in the space time

1122
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:11,650
detail.

1123
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:12,670
He's not a true clone.

1124
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:12,850
Oh, Johnny, I'm sorry.

1125
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:12,850


1126
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:12,850


1127
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:12,850


1128
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:12,850


1129
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:12,850


1130
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:12,850


1131
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:12,850


1132
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:12,850


1133
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:12,850


1134
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:12,850


1135
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:12,850


1136
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:12,850


1137
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,670
I know who you're talking about.

1138
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:14,310
Johnny Depp.

1139
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,330
You're going to bring Johnny Depp.

1140
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,170
He's not a true clone.

1141
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:16,390
Yeah, I know.

1142
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:16,670
Sure.

1143
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,930
He's not a true clone.

1144
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:18,830
But he's close enough.

1145
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,930
He looks just like me.

1146
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,710
He's not a true clone.

1147
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,150
But he's close enough that he, uh, that his organs can be used.

1148
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,110
Johnny Depp is playing me in the movie.

1149
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,430
I think he's going for your look.

1150
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,070
Yeah.

1151
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:29,450
Well, um.

1152
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,250
Osama bin Laden was going for my look.

1153
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,330
It turned out that.

1154
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,890
He runs a website that gets like 3 million hits a month.

1155
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,230
So, uh.

1156
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,290
Cinema snob.

1157
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,350
Brad Jones.

1158
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,450
Burt Reynolds is coming out of retirement.

1159
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:42,830
Oh, yeah.

1160
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:42,830


1161
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:42,830


1162
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:42,830


1163
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:42,830


1164
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:42,830


1165
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:49,850
I mean, he's going to animate Burt Reynolds' corpse.

1166
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,730
No, Harry House is still alive.

1167
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:56,230
But when he does die, somebody's going to animate him.

1168
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:56,690
I guarantee it.

1169
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,670
Uh, we're not taking, uh, calls, ladies and gentlemen.

1170
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,430
Uh, so please stop trying to call.

1171
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,770
Please don't call.

1172
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,230
I can tell you.

1173
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:12,750
I can visualize myself editing that Pete Goldie call volume.

1174
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:12,810
Uh.

1175
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,910
It could be done.

1176
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:15,430
That's going to be quite a challenge.

1177
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:19,490
And he had much to tell us about this man, Newt Gingrich.

1178
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:24,090
Well, you, I'm sure that there would have been a better way to, to deal with it.

1179
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:27,870
But I was speaking to him and, uh, no one could hear his voice.

1180
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:28,950
I could hear him.

1181
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,710
Oh, you could?

1182
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,710
When you held it up to the.

1183
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,170
Oh, well, yes.

1184
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,350
After I held it up.

1185
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,690
That's why I held it up.

1186
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,170
You see.

1187
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,750
That's the old school way of radio.

1188
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,510
Old school, eh?

1189
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:39,130
It's pure.

1190
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,030
It's pure radio.

1191
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,570
It's not your mix of.

1192
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:42,770
Remember George Novo?

1193
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:42,810
Yeah.

1194
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:42,810


1195
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,130
George Nolan.

1196
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,470
Clear ch-channel.

1197
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,350
The executive.

1198
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:45,970
The mother of invention.

1199
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,490
The silly suit man.

1200
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,330
You remember George Nolan?

1201
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,910
This is really hippies.

1202
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,870
Remember George Nolan, Reverend Stang?

1203
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:53,270
George.

1204
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,910
I can barely hear you.

1205
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,950
Remember George Nolan, Reverend Stang?

1206
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:57,350
Yeah.

1207
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,590
Yeah, George Nolan.

1208
00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:59,710
He was the first.

1209
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,390
The first.

1210
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,570
Well, second guy to interview us on the radio.

1211
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:03,130
Yeah.

1212
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,290
George Nolan.

1213
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:04,950
After he.

1214
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:05,550
Mr. Opinion.

1215
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,210
Mr. Opinion.

1216
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,270
Was filling in for George Nolan and had us on twice.

1217
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:09,850
Right.

1218
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,310
Because he could get away with it.

1219
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,730
And George Nolan liked us.

1220
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:12,810
He liked us.

1221
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:12,810


1222
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:12,810


1223
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:12,810


1224
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:12,810


1225
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:13,250
And had us.

1226
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:13,430
Yeah.

1227
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,530
Had us come back.

1228
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:14,890
Yeah.

1229
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,870
He had a really good radio voice.

1230
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,330
He was a nice guy.

1231
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,290
He was real funny.

1232
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,130
He didn't.

1233
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,790
He didn't mock us for being cultists.

1234
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,510
He was really interested in Bob.

1235
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,650
But then the rock and roll.

1236
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,470
John Rhody came after that.

1237
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:34,510
The rock and roll DJs and the drive time shows where they.

1238
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,830
This guy actually believes in this Bob guy.

1239
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:38,610
Yeah.

1240
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:42,490
He started to make fun of us and we didn't respond like.

1241
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:42,790
Gentlemen.

1242
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:42,810
Gentlemen.

1243
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:42,810


1244
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:42,810


1245
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:42,810


1246
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:42,810


1247
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:42,810


1248
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:42,810


1249
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:42,810


1250
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:42,810


1251
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:42,810


1252
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:42,810


1253
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:42,810


1254
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:42,810


1255
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:42,990
Gentlemen.

1256
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:43,510
Gentlemen.

1257
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:43,950
Gentlemen.

1258
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,130
Is that a caller?

1259
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,430
Asking a question?

1260
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,370
That's a robo caller.

1261
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:47,650
Yeah.

1262
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:49,630
Went back to the Custer battleground.

1263
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:52,070
I thought I heard a faint Phineas.

1264
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:52,370
Far.

1265
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:52,830
Far.

1266
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:53,110
Away.

1267
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,350
Phineas has been producing special songs.

1268
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:59,730
The archaeological discoveries there found a Stuart tank on the Custer battlefield.

1269
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,230
A rib stang.

1270
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,230


1271
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:00,770
Rib stang.

1272
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:01,470
With three rubber stangs.

1273
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,470
There's Michael Pepe.

1274
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,010
Yeah.

1275
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,770
Michael Pepe is talking about rib stang.

1276
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:04,890
Is that Pope.

1277
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,770
Imho Pep III.

1278
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:11,670
Are you saying that Lee Harvey Oswald is Frank Pobucker?

1279
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:12,350
No.

1280
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:12,830
No, no, no.

1281
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:13,930
Crank Pobucker.

1282
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:14,370
Crank Pobucker.

1283
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,470
Who, Frank?

1284
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,470
Lived across the street from the subgenius headquarters.

1285
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:23,010
He was so named because he was an early methamphetamine experimenter.

1286
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:23,610
Really?

1287
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,090
Yeah.

1288
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,310
And he was a Pobucker.

1289
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,850
And the saying would take his children to school.

1290
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,990
And they grew up and they didn't have birth defects?

1291
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:33,730
No, they're really nice.

1292
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:37,190
Well, he didn't start the crank until after the kids were born.

1293
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,330
Oh, I see.

1294
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:38,790
Okay.

1295
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:38,970
Okay.

1296
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:43,130
But he evidently is Lee Harvey Roswell.

1297
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,170
Roswell.

1298
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,210
Lee Harvey Roswell.

1299
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,190
That's from the movie.

1300
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:50,850
You know, there's so many subgeniuses with the name Lee Harvey Roswell.

1301
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,690
It's gotten out of hand.

1302
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:58,130
It's like you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a Lee Harvey Roswell.

1303
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,330
Do me a favor.

1304
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,470
Swing it hard.

1305
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,070
All right.

1306
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:04,530
But, I mean, that must be exciting to a movie.

1307
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:04,930
What movie?

1308
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:05,650
Swing it hard.

1309
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:07,750
All right.

1310
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,150
All right.

1311
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:08,230
All right.

1312
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,670
Let's try to keep some civility here.

1313
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,590
Now, Michael Pepe is coming and going.

1314
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:13,230
Yeah.

1315
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,650
Well, he ain't the only one.

1316
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,410
Well, that's true.

1317
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,390
I've come, but I'm going to go soon.

1318
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,610
Are you talking about that prostitute with diarrhea?

1319
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,770
The headphones that are blasting my ears and then withdrawing.

1320
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:27,090
The prostitute with diarrhea that was coming and going at the same time?

1321
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:28,390
The very one.

1322
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,870
One of the rules was no vulgarity.

1323
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,110
Oh, my God.

1324
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,930
Obscenity is all right, but not vulgarity.

1325
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,170
It's the opposite of normal.

1326
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:37,930
It's a show of rules now.

1327
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,090
But I want to do...

1328
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:39,950
We have a lot of new...

1329
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,050
Philo and I came up with these rules.

1330
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:43,090
Each and every one of you.

1331
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:43,950
The other committee.

1332
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,190
Because, yeah, they are...

1333
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,770
It's a coup.

1334
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,790
How worried should we be about carpenter ants?

1335
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,330
Now, Dad, remember...

1336
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,550
No, we covered that pre-show.

1337
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,150
Carpenter ants are big, fat red ants.

1338
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:54,790
Yeah, the whole area.

1339
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,830
Carpenter ants are large and polymorphic.

1340
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:57,570
John Carpenter ants.

1341
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:58,370
They're talking about...

1342
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,370
Workers are several sizes.

1343
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,510
They're black, reddish brown, red and black.

1344
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:04,210
That's why the colonies fall apart, because they're all directors.

1345
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:05,190
Yes.

1346
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,310
They all got rules.

1347
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,030
More rules.

1348
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:07,930
Note the thorax.

1349
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,710
That's my rules now.

1350
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,010
Evenly confess when viewed from the side.

1351
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:11,810
Yes.

1352
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:13,110
Hope him, hope him.

1353
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,350
Can we say B part sucks?

1354
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:15,210
Which also belongs...

1355
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,150
But here you see...

1356
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,590
The what?

1357
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:17,290
Indentation.

1358
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,650
Can we say B part sucks?

1359
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:19,510
Yes.

1360
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:20,670
Indented thorax.

1361
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:21,210
We can't.

1362
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:21,510
Okay.

1363
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:22,270
You can't.

1364
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:22,610
You can't.

1365
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:23,650
On this show, you can't.

1366
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,710
And what about the beetles?

1367
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,050
Can we say the beetles suck?

1368
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:26,810
Oh, you have to.

1369
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:27,570
Oh, okay.

1370
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,350
And you have to say Bob sucks first.

1371
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:30,710
Even though you don't believe it.

1372
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,210
Oh, I...

1373
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,230
First you have to say Bob sucks three times.

1374
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,690
Then you can say anything sucks.

1375
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,030
And then you say yog sa sa sa fa.

1376
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:42,190
Oh, three times while you're looking in the basement trap door.

1377
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,010
Because that's the ultimate.

1378
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:45,250
It doesn't say Bob sucks.

1379
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,930
And that has a kind of magical effect.

1380
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,530
It must drive away the evil spirit.

1381
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,590
It wasn't boxers when we have to...

1382
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:52,310
Right.

1383
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,290
I threw it away.

1384
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:56,570
Because you have blasphemed the ultimate blasphemy.

1385
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:57,350
Right.

1386
00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:59,170
That kind of...

1387
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:02,490
It ironically enough protects you.

1388
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:02,910
Yeah.

1389
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,310
Using the power of irony.

1390
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:05,110
Exactly.

1391
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:07,270
Corny irony in this case.

1392
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:07,950
Corn bomb.

1393
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,410
So, wow.

1394
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,250
Bob sucks, Bob sucks, Bob sucks.

1395
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:12,790
Corniest...

1396
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:14,130
Okay, you're accepted.

1397
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:14,970
Next.

1398
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:19,350
And now don't forget to fork over $35.

1399
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:20,330
How much is it?

1400
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:20,450
That's right.

1401
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,390
We can't say that on the air.

1402
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:23,250
We can't say that on the air.

1403
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:24,390
It has nothing to do with this show.

1404
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:25,390
No, no, no, no.

1405
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,250
You misunderstand.

1406
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:26,910
Yes.

1407
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,150
I'm talking about the doldrums.

1408
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:30,530
Yeah.

1409
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:31,750
The slow part.

1410
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,370
You will be free, Michael.

1411
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:37,370
And the whole show comes to a halt in a Sargasso sea of...

1412
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:38,010
Yes.

1413
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:38,130
Yes.

1414
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,470
It stops.

1415
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:38,810
It stops.

1416
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:39,610
It stops.

1417
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:42,410
Like a painted ship upon a painted ocean.

1418
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,330
A little paint chip.

1419
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,670
35 years in the doldrums.

1420
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:47,910
Floating along in the air.

1421
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:52,350
The crabs crawling along the stinking algal mat of floating sea.

1422
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,870
Straight out Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1423
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:54,490
Oh, yeah?

1424
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:55,210
Oh, yeah.

1425
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:55,510
I see.

1426
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,370
But that's the only way you can...

1427
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:57,830
You can't...

1428
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:59,050
You can't stop it.

1429
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,090
Can you be inducted into the church of the 17th?

1430
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:01,710
No, the show is like that.

1431
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:04,030
Once you start that first hit of the show, you can't stop.

1432
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,110
35 years in the doldrums.

1433
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:05,250
Forever.

1434
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,690
From PR News in Washington.

1435
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:10,070
Unmarked by scandals and economic decline.

1436
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:12,730
President Obama has formally resigned.

1437
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:13,570
Hallelujah!

1438
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:14,610
Hallelujah!

1439
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:15,730
Hallelujah!

1440
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:16,930
Hallelujah!

1441
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:21,430
An unprecedented power concentrated in one individual.

1442
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:22,450
Tainted by corruption.

1443
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:23,850
Plagued by sex scandals.

1444
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:24,990
Frequenting minors.

1445
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:27,270
Paying for sex with an underage prostitute.

1446
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:28,330
His wife left him.

1447
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:29,990
He also controlled all of broadcasting.

1448
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,210
But his close friend, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin,

1449
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:35,410
had words of praise for PR News.

1450
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,170
PR's punished.

1451
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,790
Punished longtime coach Joe Paterno.

1452
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:45,330
Well, that was a nice long stretch of uncut cuts from PR News by Cosmic Cabri.

1453
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:49,370
A puzzling evidence show with Michael Pepe calling in and Phineas Narco.

1454
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,570
Ask Dr. Howell's podcast on Radio Valencia.

1455
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,170
WCSB Cleveland's Radio Synesthesia.

1456
00:46:55,390 --> 00:47:00,010
In fact, the only thing missing is Reverend Susie the Flusie's show from WREK Atlanta.

1457
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:03,430
But that'll be on next in Major Markets.

1458
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:06,190
The next thing I'm going to play, all the way to the end,

1459
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:07,150
is both old...

1460
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,050
and new.

1461
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:11,830
It's how Puzzling Evidence starts his two-hour shows

1462
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:16,910
with a half hour of rather loose collage mixing old Puzzling Evidence shows

1463
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:20,170
with new collages he makes for movie soundtracks and stuff.

1464
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:23,550
And in this case, poor little Princess Wee,

1465
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,470
who called in only to be left alone with the tapes.

1466
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:29,250
So you can hear her trying to make the best of it

1467
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,630
and pretend to join the conversation of recorded conversations.

1468
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:36,030
I guess the rest of us were still on the way to the station

1469
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,510
and Puzzling had rocketed away somewhere.

1470
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:43,370
I have it edited down because some of it hurts your ears and brain

1471
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:46,230
even more than most such 4 a.m. recordings.

1472
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:51,550
Yeah, it's 4 a.m. in Berkeley and poor Wee is sitting inside a parked car

1473
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:55,610
in the cold in Fremont because she didn't want to wake up her family

1474
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,930
as they slept all warm inside.

1475
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:03,590
And trying so hard to join the show that isn't even really there.

1476
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,010
However, it starts with an idea.

1477
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,390
It's an oldie by some band.

1478
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:08,290
I forget their name.

1479
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:45,110
I don't know if I should be English.

1480
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:46,550
Help

1481
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:08,430
Tell you what you want me to make you

1482
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,090
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you

1483
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:19,730
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer

1484
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:22,770
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

1485
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:25,330
Look out!

1486
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:26,750
Help the skeleton

1487
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:29,750
Help the skeleton

1488
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:32,490
Help the skeleton

1489
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,070
Look out!

1490
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:40,430
This is how

1491
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:57,470
When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide

1492
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:00,270
When I stop and I turn and I don't move right

1493
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:02,910
Then I get to the bottom and I see you again

1494
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:05,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1495
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:05,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1496
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:35,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1497
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:38,790
Yes, yes, of course, at once

1498
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:39,870
Oh, no

1499
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,710
I want to take the phone off the hook and not answer the door

1500
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:44,250
We'll have to do better than that

1501
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,130
You don't know this thing

1502
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:53,710
Patrick, what can I do for you?

1503
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,790
You left your case behind when you came to see me

1504
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:56,270
Nothing at all

1505
00:50:58,370 --> 00:50:59,510
Hold on, Patrick

1506
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,990
For heaven's sake, don't nag me

1507
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,530
You are a madman

1508
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:10,310
Hello Peter

1509
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:11,910
Oh, hello darling

1510
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,710
Yeah, I wish you could've come

1511
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:14,450
So do I

1512
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:15,450
Ste acquired me helped

1513
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:21,450
My wish, I could've come

1514
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:23,330
I wish you fell asleep

1515
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,430
Step on stepped myself

1516
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,230
Then I crashed

1517
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:26,210
I grab you

1518
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:27,570
So whilebushes for a night

1519
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:33,650
You promised you in hundred sort you want and then ate your soup with me

1520
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:34,290
When I die?

1521
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:35,330
I die.

1522
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,290
The politicians, they don't even care.

1523
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:40,050
It's a system.

1524
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:41,150
Phones ringing.

1525
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:42,630
Phone rings all the time.

1526
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:43,310
No, Eli.

1527
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:43,870
Yeah.

1528
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:44,990
But the phones are here.

1529
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:48,210
Yes, that's because we are dogs.

1530
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:49,550
Comdec 3.

1531
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:50,010
Calling.

1532
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:50,450
Calling.

1533
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:51,930
Yes, sir.

1534
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:53,370
We're on them, sir.

1535
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:54,910
But they're not here yet.

1536
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:55,710
Roger, I understand.

1537
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:57,230
No, we won't make a move until you get here.

1538
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:03,810
Get Pedro and Wilson here right now.

1539
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:06,130
How can anything be so much?

1540
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,750
I just, I don't understand.

1541
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:09,850
Yes, sir.

1542
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:10,370
Who is this?

1543
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:13,030
It's the all-scratchy show.

1544
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:18,210
It's the show full of high-end scratchiness.

1545
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:20,170
What kind of show is this?

1546
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:21,670
What kind of show is this?

1547
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:23,070
What kind of show is this?

1548
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:23,490
What kind of show is this?

1549
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:27,210
What kind of show is this?

1550
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,950
This is the intense phone-in show.

1551
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:30,990
I said now.

1552
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:31,890
Now.

1553
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:37,410
Hello?

1554
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,010
Hi.

1555
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:39,710
Hello?

1556
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:43,610
How do you know if there's anybody really here?

1557
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:46,750
How do you know if there's anybody really here?

1558
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,510
It could be just fake phone calls.

1559
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:49,350
You're there, aren't you?

1560
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:50,450
I don't know.

1561
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:51,090
Why?

1562
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:52,510
How do you know if anybody's here?

1563
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,410
I have no idea.

1564
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,890
This is the negative question.

1565
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:58,290
Yes.

1566
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:02,570
You're saying that the gospel's had a soothing, so you mean...

1567
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:03,850
Father?

1568
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:04,930
Yes.

1569
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,550
Wait a minute, I lost it.

1570
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:11,430
Mary, you need to forgive if I went back to you.

1571
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:19,210
Like a party all by myself.

1572
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:22,430
Oh, my God.

1573
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:25,170
God.

1574
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:27,650
Hello?

1575
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:28,630
Oh, my God.

1576
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:28,870
Julia?

1577
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:29,190
Oh, my God.

1578
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:30,510
Oh, my God.

1579
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:30,510


1580
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:31,030
I'm sorry, darling.

1581
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:31,550
Hello?

1582
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:31,670
I'm sorry.

1583
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:32,470
I'm sorry.

1584
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:32,770
I'm sorry.

1585
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:33,290
Hello?

1586
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:34,250
Why?

1587
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:34,870
Is it Andrew?

1588
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:35,230
Hello?

1589
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:35,630
No, no, no.

1590
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:36,330
It's the bloody office.

1591
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:37,550
Oh, John.

1592
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:38,270
You can say hello.

1593
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:39,270
So am I.

1594
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:39,830
Hello.

1595
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:40,030
Hello.

1596
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:41,810
I'll call you tomorrow, all right?

1597
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:42,350
All right.

1598
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:42,890
I'll call you tomorrow.

1599
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:43,110
Bye.

1600
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:43,790
Bye.

1601
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:44,030


1602
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:44,050
Bye.

1603
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:44,050


1604
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:45,950
Bye.

1605
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:45,950


1606
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:46,830
Do you want me to hold your phone?

1607
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:47,110
Yeah.

1608
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:48,690
Hold my calls and call the show tomorrow.

1609
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:49,530
No.

1610
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:50,350
If you ever...

1611
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:51,030
How do you know it's real?

1612
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:57,370
What?

1613
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:57,810
No.

1614
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:58,730
No.

1615
00:53:58,770 --> 00:53:59,830
You grab the microphone.

1616
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:00,590
No, I...

1617
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:01,030
Well, I...

1618
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:01,650
Yeah, I have to.

1619
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:02,210
It's my show.

1620
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:04,670
No, I can't grab the microphone.

1621
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:06,190
You're not talking to a human.

1622
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:07,190
I'm not in the studio.

1623
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,130
There's nobody here.

1624
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:10,270
The show's just tape.

1625
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,970
The show's scary again.

1626
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:18,110
It's scary.

1627
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:19,930
It is scary again.

1628
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,390
The show is scary again.

1629
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:21,850
It's going to be very scary.

1630
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:23,510
For the billionth time, it's scary.

1631
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:25,050
We'll just do a pencil and write down this address.

1632
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:25,410
Okay.

1633
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:26,850
81 Lavender Lane.

1634
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:27,210
Okay.

1635
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:27,610
Got it.

1636
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:30,510
I've got a dead body and a suspect in the area, and I would appreciate some backup.

1637
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:31,450
What are you talking about?

1638
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:32,750
You're not even on duty.

1639
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:35,190
Don't tell me what I already know.

1640
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:36,230
Just do it.

1641
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,870
That dead body didn't even know.

1642
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:39,270
Scratchiness.

1643
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:40,010
You wish.

1644
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:40,470
It's raw.

1645
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,370
I can't hear that caller hardly.

1646
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:43,990
They've just got a bad phone connection.

1647
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:45,430
Did you listen to the show on the way in?

1648
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:45,970
Yeah.

1649
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:47,330
You didn't even notice.

1650
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:50,130
I want to discuss a little business proposition...

1651
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:52,110
It sounded just fine on the way over.

1652
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:52,310
...with you and your wife.

1653
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:53,050
You must be mistaken.

1654
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:54,170
Yeah, you must be mistaken.

1655
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:55,570
I listened to it, and it's scratchy.

1656
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:56,430
And then I'm going to the point...

1657
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:57,090
High-end's all...

1658
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:58,630
...you bring your wife.

1659
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:01,430
That's the way everything sounds to me all the time anyway.

1660
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:04,010
So, it's kind of a mood...

1661
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:04,690
I didn't notice.

1662
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,470
It's the circuit.

1663
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:09,990
Yeah.

1664
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:14,150
Everything sounds like this show to me all the time, Doctor.

1665
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:15,930
Can you help me?

1666
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:19,190
Doctor, there's something waiting for you on the...

1667
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,070
...on the Mussolini balcony.

1668
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:26,870
There's something waiting for you on the memorial...

1669
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:28,030
...Mussolini balcony.

1670
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,550
I mean the Mussolini memorial balcony.

1671
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,030
Oh, yeah.

1672
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:34,990
Who's got the bomb?

1673
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:35,570
That's the question.

1674
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:39,550
How many times this week have you muttered to yourself...

1675
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:40,210
I'll have the chicken and waffles.

1676
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:40,770
...I'm so bored.

1677
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:40,970
I forgot to kill myself.

1678
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,090
I'll have the chicken and waffles, too.

1679
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:45,030
We're going to go get some chicken and waffles, so call back in about ten minutes.

1680
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:47,250
I forgot to take you just exactly how...

1681
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,610
Yes, how much was I able to take, Doug?

1682
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:53,390
Yes, how much was I able to take, Doug?

1683
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,850
Yes, and now you both realize it'll take me...

1684
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:56,850


1685
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:02,070
...much, much more than simply tying the girls up to get those demons to show up anyhow.

1686
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:08,210
Marching to the tune of profits coexistent with entertainment marches tunelessly onward.

1687
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:19,690
No, no, ask any of their audiences or former friends that you can merely demand a new luxurious suede vinyl-covered dock tape without first terminating your reluctance to embrace racial tabloids.

1688
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:25,490
Well, eat hot non-existence, pink boy, because you're not in the same ballpark as church band material.

1689
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,330
Probably never will be without our help.

1690
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:36,470
That's the number of our telephone, the atomic telephone.

1691
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:38,450
Oh, the atomic telephone.

1692
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:43,330
The one you can talk to the 700-foot-tall Bob Jesus.

1693
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:48,910
Oh, yeah. Well, they've got one of those guys at the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer Launcher Society.

1694
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:53,370
I know they had this incredibly huge Jesus there.

1695
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:56,170
It was so big they couldn't launch it.

1696
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,190
In fact, it's still there.

1697
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:00,510
...an individual can do about this code disaster.

1698
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:03,450
Nuclear death overpopulation of someone.

1699
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:05,110
Thank you, Rondell.

1700
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:09,030
A little fast train is about to be leaving you or anyone else...

1701
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:15,890
This invention is devised by a precise mathematical formula in the universe of the sphere you have called the Mantis cult.

1702
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:21,570
...ever wonder about the launching habits of others or how often other humans launch?

1703
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:23,650
Or where and when they launch?

1704
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:29,610
Perhaps you wonder if most people launch alone or do they engage in launching with a partner or group?

1705
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:32,170
Tribal situations? It's the Church of the Moon.

1706
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:33,550
It's the Church of the Angel.

1707
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:38,670
...a foundation that lashed itself on everybody else because nobody knows what's going on.

1708
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:45,070
Yes, even if you were listening to this show, even if the slim possibility that you were awake at 4.30 a.m. on Saturday morning

1709
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:49,690
and could spend the time listening to our show, we doubt if you'd understand it.

1710
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:52,790
Because the speaker is more important, probably.

1711
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:57,030
Well, yes, Bob. The stupider it is, the more important it probably is.

1712
00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:01,810
But there are probably only 20 people in the entire country that can understand this game.

1713
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:03,650
There are probably only 20 people in...

1714
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:04,450
And are you one of them?

1715
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:06,090
Hell no.

1716
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:13,630
Well, it goes to show you that these people that sit up all night waiting for this show, they don't even know about the end joke.

1717
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:15,890
There it is.

1718
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:17,230
That's right.

1719
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:19,510
They can get it if you'll just call it.

1720
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:21,250
Now if you throw throw throw...

1721
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:21,250


1722
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:29,590
We'll tell you all the secrets of the church and many of the stories that were related to us late at night by the green gentleman from...

1723
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:32,070
from some hell.

1724
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:38,050
Ah, some green hell that's available for just a small amount of money.

1725
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:41,490
You can write Arkansas, you can write Texas, you'll get the same answer.

1726
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,510
You can write Oakland...

1727
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:44,670
Or you can write Cleveland.

1728
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:50,690
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1729
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:55,410
Or look under contacts at subgenius.com.

1730
00:58:55,770 --> 00:59:02,750
Uh, yes, that old bit we just heard was from maybe 1982 or so, and they were reading from the damny fine times.

1731
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:07,990
The newsletter of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer's Launchers Society.

1732
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:13,010
By Pope Sternodocs of Little Rock, because that was pretty much the whole church back then.

1733
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:15,970
Those shows and the pamphlets and the Arkansas boys.

1734
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:17,590
Me and Philo.

1735
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:21,230
And we'll all be doing new shows live at X Day Drift.

1736
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,170
Phil, 15 by the time you hear this.

1737
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:25,750
That's subgenius.com.

1738
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:28,250
I hope your ears will be okay after this.

1739
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:30,930
For me, it's kind of a moot point.

1740
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:34,210
Good night, and praise Bob.

1741
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:44,890
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1742
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:51,130
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1743
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:56,250
And not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1744
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:03,350
But if you truly love Bob, and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1745
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:10,850
you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages,

1746
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:14,170
and help out financially as best you can.

1747
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:18,530
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1748
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:21,230
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own subgeniuses.

1749
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:22,170
We want to make situations worse.

1750
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:25,150
But some of you still have jobs.

1751
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:32,010
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1752
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:34,390
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1753
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:37,750
All we're saying is that

1754
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:43,210
blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1755
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:49,650
We also take checks and money orders to subgeniusfoundation.com.

1756
01:00:49,650 --> 01:01:01,150
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1757
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:06,330
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
