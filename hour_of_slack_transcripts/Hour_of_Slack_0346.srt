1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,200
Oh, oh, I hug myself till my arms turn blue, and then I close my eye till I cry and cry till the tears come down and I can taste them.

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,820
I love to taste my tears.

3
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,080
I am special.

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,860
I am special.

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,140
I am special.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,980
Please, God, please.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,860
Don't let me be normal.

8
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:51,700
Oh, yes, dear friends, and welcome to the subgenius radio.

High Epoch, living avatar of black, overlord of the 12 super universes, saint of sails, and deflowerer of cony.

Thirteen apostles of Bob.

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,340
Brought to you by Bulldata Time Control Laboratories.

16
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,380
A subsidiary of the First Orthodox Stangian Megapest Temple Lodge of the People's Covenant Church of the Wrath of Dobbs.

17
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,980
Yet he resurrected.

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,640
Post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

19
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,380
That's correct.

20
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,180
Yeah.

21
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,440
Yeah.

22
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,440


23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,000
And they...

24
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,660
And they...

25
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:02,100
Said, as ye hath the pipe, so shall ye smoke it.

26
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:15,120
And lo, it was smoked, and it was good and pure, and all the world smoked with him.

27
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:23,260
And welcome, dear friends, to Hour of Slack number three.

28
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,740
Three hundred and forty-six, I believe it is this time.

29
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,580
And we've got a special guest once again.

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,480
A very, very special guest today, since it's Father's Day.

31
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,980
I'd like to bring to you the civet, the civetmeister, the civetzilla.

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,260
Civetmeister.

33
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:50,260


34
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,840
The Tevinet.

35
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,140
Teviniter.

36
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,380
Dear friends.

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,580
Hey, all you kids out there.

38
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,360
I know what's wrong.

39
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,500
I can help.

40
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,620
I know what to do.

41
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,120
You are spending entirely too much money on your father.

42
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,760
You are spending completely too much time with him.

43
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:19,980
Get out.

44
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,080
You are free.

45
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,840
Bob is setting you free.

46
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,100
Oh, praise Bob.

47
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,920
Praise Bob.

48
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,000
Hey, wait a minute.

49
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,380
Wait a minute.

50
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,100
What am I saying?

51
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,820
What?

52
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,720
I don't know.

53
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,440
It was Father's Day.

54
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:48,900
I thought Bob was supposed to make sure the fathers got more time from their sweet daughters.

55
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,320
Yeah.

56
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,400
Sometimes it's Slack liberation.

57
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,960
It's a little bit.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,960
I think some people maybe take it just a bit too far.

59
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:08,580
I mean, you know, why, holy shite and Bob gobbly, or I'll be gobs of gully gushing.

60
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,080
Better puke your peat on full throttle poke teat.

61
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,320
Elsewise, your wants will be a wagon down on Mammy's hind nanny.

62
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,840
Because there's a case of slaves and slackers.

63
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,120
Black robbers out to chop your slobber.

64
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,480
Pinks and dinks licking the inky slinky off your tongue.

65
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,780
Just when you're ripen to throw them the loaf, slap back them and bomb at them.

66
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,880
They, they, they, dear friends, don't want your bone to be.

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:52,560
And if you got the cleft in stealth, Mammy-o, oh, they'll hate your worth eight ways worse.

68
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:02,840
So, why can't your peaser pop a squeezer when the gushers are going all normal and anti-right-like?

69
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,580
I mean, crotch you don't no-dacious sense in your sneezing chamber?

70
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,760
Hushed in a empty platterer in your bean bag, boy?

71
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,380
Where's your rollerballs, eh?

72
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,740
I can't grok me no love grow on these moo-joo, moo-joo logo bags.

73
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,920
They cut your jet purse and water your creamery coming and going.

74
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:36,720
And the slums of lovin' won't beat heat your oven, cause the slacky tacks of the grinning

75
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,540
sinner be their flaw to flee.

76
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:46,380
The odd dogs'll do ya, but you are, are, are lettin' em bang down the barn doors.

77
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,580
And your cows are, are gettin' it and out.

78
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,840
You gonna let them get you?

79
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:53,840


80
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,660
You gonna moon the man?

81
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:02,640
Or folly em mooin' to the slafter house like good baby's butter butt?

82
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:03,780
Or not?

83
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,500
You're gonna have to spreech ingress, Jake.

84
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,740
Get right with your muscle snake snunk monkey.

85
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,160
Quit spritzin' your blizzerer lessen its snowin' light lute juice.

86
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,820
Elsewise, you're pleadin' for a drink.

87
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,580
You're bleedin' bleeders blowin' hot water.

88
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,760
You go blind or please your neither tryin' not to.

89
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,000
Either way, you're gettin' up on the wrong side orbit for this kind of freed-peed needin'

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,660
side trade.

91
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,640
Well, won't yer gon' yer stand there like a dammy nickel slug?

92
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,560
Or you gonna puss your plimperer in a righteous hargany?

93
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,980
Pee-boy, you got weeny rivers in your fluter tubes.

94
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,780
Join gumption's with the true and the seed-brain.

95
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:53,820
You're gonna get a good time.

96
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,120
What's the use of a

97
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,920
wave and peepfer bob, man?

98
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,180
It's sin.

99
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,240
Your genes.

100
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,980
Buy out the gland owners with what you earned with your skinny, peelin' face of pain.

101
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,360
Lisa piece of the fine assed and have a fuzzy big ballock.

102
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,400
Strike your heart best blow for the left cord of the rocket racket.

103
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,800
This space outer belongs to your horrid shit.

104
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,920
in the crutch of your choice toys.

105
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,460
And I've been bonging the flush lugging her peers

106
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,840
to let them stank you know who's coming.

107
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,940
Them cans ain't keen to hob on no Bobby, no sir ma'am.

108
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,620
You just art and ugum good.

109
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,520
And they'll be some gone bygones, baby.

110
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,840
This has been your re-enunciator.

111
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,760
Thank me.

112
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,200
Thank you.

113
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,440
Hello, friends, and welcome.

114
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:22,660
The sermon tonight is entitled Break Out.

115
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,620
Yes, friends, break out.

116
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,600
You see, the human animal is just like any other animal,

117
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,000
given the bare necessities, and it becomes complacent.

118
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,720
You go to the zoo, and what do you see?

119
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,620
Cage after cage of animals,

120
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,700
contented being owned by someone else,

121
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
all in exchange for little food, shelter,

122
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,600
and perhaps a company of members from the opposite sex.

123
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,920
That's all it takes, friends, and they're satisfied.

124
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,200
But most of them become tame,

125
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,000
and the zoo, if any, ever even try to escape.

126
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,260
Hard to believe, isn't it?

127
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,660
But true.

128
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,040
When was the last time you heard of a zoo revolt?

129
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,760
Or a zoo breakout?

130
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,800
Taking hostages and making demands for better treatment?

131
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,920
It doesn't happen.

132
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,820
Animals have no determination for self-determination.

133
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,240
They eventually stop struggling and give up.

134
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,560
And you know what, friends?

135
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,400
So do humans.

136
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,800
The moron majority are deprived of their freedom.

137
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,840
Each and every day.

138
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,760
Yet they work and pay taxes to the same occupational government

139
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,900
that has kept them in spiritual chains all these years.

140
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,160
At least the animals don't have to go to work.

141
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,380
Or Brown knows the boss.

142
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,140
At least the animals were free at one time.

143
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,620
At least they resisted being captured in the first place

144
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,080
and struggled to get away.

145
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,020
That's better than their human counterparts

146
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,180
that never fought at all.

147
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,760
Nay, the humans pay to be oppressed.

148
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,840
They vote to be oppressed.

149
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,660
They elect new masters every few years

150
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,560
and even allow them pay increases.

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,080
Oh, sure, the public pisses and moans

152
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,240
about how terrible everything is.

153
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,100
But come election time, they re-elect 99%

154
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,820
of the same self-proclaimed leaders.

155
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,060
It's called the conspiracy, friends.

156
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,100
And you support it every time you buy their products,

157
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,120
respect their authority, pay their taxes,

158
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,340
or live their life.

159
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,520
So tell me this.

160
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,780
Which animal do you think is the one with the brain?

161
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,540
The one in the zoo?

162
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,120
Or the domesticated human variety?

163
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,140
If you're going to be a prisoner, friends,

164
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,120
you might as well be an unproductive one in a cage

165
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,900
rather than a working stiff locked in some office

166
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,220
with fluorescent lights and recycled air.

167
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,520
There's no way to be a free man

168
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,860
because there's no freedom.

169
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,560
They claim it's a jungle out there,

170
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,580
but let's face it, that's only wishful thinking.

171
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,300
It's a cage.

172
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,360
One giant cage.

173
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,940
Some of it is landscaped and skyscraped,

174
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,880
but most of it's concrete glass and bars.

175
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,640
Remember, stone walls do not imprison men.

176
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,420
Obedience does.

177
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,700
And everyone in our society must obey.

178
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,040
If you don't, you're sent to a small living room.

179
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,320
Another cage.

180
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,680
A telephone booth type cell

181
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,320
where you'll stay until you learn to obey.

182
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,220
It all seems so hopeless now, doesn't it?

183
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,420
And yet, dear friends, there is an alternative.

184
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,920
There is a way to disobey.

185
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,140
You can join the underground resistance league

186
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,520
that fights to be free.

187
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,900
Guerilla soldiers that pretend to obey by day

188
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,220
but disobey by night.

189
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,020
These freedom fighters won't sell their obedience

190
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,700
for nice cars, VCRs, furlough vacation trips,

191
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,080
or fantasy entertainment.

192
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,940
Nor will they trade it in for a warm cage

193
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,300
and three square meals.

194
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,240
No, sir.

195
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,900
They, that is to say we, continue to fight

196
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,660
for what we had taken away so long ago.

197
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:08,840
Freedom.

198
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,260
Freedom of choice.

199
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,560
Freedom of thought.

200
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,700
Freedom of speech.

201
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,780
Freedom of sex, drugs, rock and roll, and religion.

202
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,060
Our religion.

203
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,340
The church to the subgenius.

204
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,260
The only one world, one true religion,

205
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,780
made up exclusively of mercenaries who kill for Bob.

206
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,440
While the subservient Christians are content

207
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,380
to drink the symbolic blood of the lamb,

208
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,700
we, the subgenies, demand the real thing.

209
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,340
Hot human blood.

210
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,000
And guess whose blood it is?

211
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Oh, yes, the normals say we have no honor,

212
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,320
for we attack the devil.

213
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,440
We attack at night and blend in during the day.

214
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,420
But do they have honor by collaborating with the enemy

215
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,520
24 hours a day and night?

216
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,480
Let's to wonder, we're unafraid of reprisals.

217
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,160
The conspiracy could try to shoot as many of us as they want,

218
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,160
but they'll probably kill more normals than the crossfire,

219
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,660
and that just saves us bullets to use on somebody else.

220
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,060
Give us liberty or give us death.

221
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,460
Better yet, we'll give death,

222
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,980
and we'll take liberty.

223
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,580
After all, we've nothing to lose.

224
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,320
If they catch us, it's off to the little cage we go.

225
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,460
At least then we won't have to work for a living.

226
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,940
And besides, it's only a few years

227
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,860
until we storm the Bastille anyway.

228
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,060
The worst they can do is kill us,

229
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,300
and yet by doing so, they grant us the spiritual freedom

230
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,020
that we've lusted for so long.

231
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,120
We prefer a quick execution to a slow society death

232
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,440
via conformity, coercion, and violence.

233
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,700
That's why they're Campus

234
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,800
The people are glued to the cor marker.

235
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,840
they struggle longer,

236
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,440
and И Frage

237
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,920
why They Always

238
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:03,920


239
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,160
And Arthur

240
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,080
wantdon't

241
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,840
did not

242
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,800
predeceive

243
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,120
,

244
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,480
What are you sponge

245
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,440
this

246
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,460
'd

247
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:25,960
gaping wound. Try to stop us if you can, but remember this, we're going to remember who

248
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:32,680
the collaborators are after the invasion, and no amount of conspiracy clout or money

249
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:39,660
is worth the pain and suffering the traitors will have in store for them. D-Day is X-Day

250
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:47,660
1998, and B-Day is payback day for the poor bastards that played it safe during the occupation.

251
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:55,600
Fight now or flee later, because there's no neutrals in this war. You're either one of us

252
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,120
or you're one of them, and if you're one of them, beware, because we've got your number.

253
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,460
Better enjoy that conspiracy sports car while you still have hands to dry, or relish that new

254
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:15,840
track house while you still got soft feet to pitter-patter around on the conspiracy wall-to-wall

255
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,500
carpets.

256
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,420
The interest you need to know is that we're going to be back in the game.

257
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,920
The money you pay on your mortgage will be interesting indeed to the grand inquisitors

258
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,960
of our around-the-clock collaborator courts. If you think you've got a good life now, you're

259
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:36,820
right, especially when compared to the last miserable moments you'll experience floating

260
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:45,320
upside down in the excess acid bath chambers. As the liquid melts the eyelids from your face,

261
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,400
you may glimpse the distorted image of the world.

262
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,060
The world is full of spectators watching you from outside your plexiglass tube. You may even notice

263
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,980
that we chant something in unison, though your ears will be too dissolved to hear it. So allow

264
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:07,880
us to say now what you won't be able to appreciate until then. We told you so, we told you so,

265
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,820
we told you so. Here into the world of our praise, Bob. Amen.

266
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,900
Oh, praise Bob and amen.

267
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:29,080
Thank you, thank you, Father Joe Mama, the incredible Father Joe Mama. And now, dear friends, for the new laws of the week.

268
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:47,240
Welcome to Crazy Laws by The Tevinator. The new laws of the 90s is this is why we are not allowed to play Hour of Slack

269
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,380
in the 90s.

270
00:16:48,400 --> 00:17:09,720
Some of the laws may not be legal, but Seanっと and Matt, as we're here with the Carry The

271
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,100
Radical Actors Association, should not be allowed to play the next time we take some

272
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,100


273
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,200
Today, I will almost absolutely虐ne you no more.

274
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,700
Thank you to you.

275
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,740
Take care.

276
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:16,740


277
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,200
Bye-bye.

278
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,340
Oh, thank you, The Tevinator.

279
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,000
That's our new weekly feature.

280
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:33,120
Like all the weekly features we announce every few shows that you never, ever hear again.

281
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,920
Ah, yes, dear friends.

282
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,300
Well, Doctors for Bob are jamming away in the background, I believe, doing the mighty song,

283
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,980
P-Dog Strut.

284
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:51,000
And that inspires me to read to you here just some loose notes from the word of Bob,

285
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,580
Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon.

286
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,040
Did you know, this was new to me.

287
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:09,460
Now, as far as the universal father and or mother, the giant it, is concerned,

288
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,780
the universe is non-existent.

289
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,960
Because it...

290
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,300
It deals with personalities.

291
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,260
It's an animist.

292
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,880
It believes in an animistic universe.

293
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:25,920
And it keeps all its universes localized under the joint rule of its sons and daughters

294
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,460
and the creative spirits, you see, which is a huge hierarchy.

295
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,760
And this is where the Church of the Subgenius begins to sound like other religions.

296
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:41,920
In that, for instance, we load all these facts and figures on you.

297
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,460
But these are scientific religious facts, unlike those of our rival cults.

298
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:55,200
For instance, this hierarchy of universes under the universal giganto creator it thing,

299
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,960
you've got seven super universes.

300
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,240
Not to be confused with supra-universes, which is a whole different thing.

301
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:10,660
And within each of those super universes, you've got 70 major sectors and 7,000 minor sectors,

302
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,900
700 major sectors, and 7,000 minor sectors.

303
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,440
And in each of those 100,000 local universes, 70 million constellations, 7 billion local stars,

304
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,600
and 7 trillion local inhabited planets.

305
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,580
And on not one of those inhabited planets, dear friends, is their intelligent life.

306
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,740
How about them apples?

307
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,260
Actually, those facts and figures come from the Urantia book, which is a whole different,

308
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:40,500
ridiculous fake cult, no relation to the Church of the Subgenius.

309
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,600
We'll change all of this.

310
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:41,880
7 billion local stars.

311
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,040
I'm sure there will be sevens there to eights.

312
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,260
You see?

313
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,120
And there will be.

314
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:52,760
You see, because the ancestors of all universes really are the pyroflatulations of God.

315
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,080
But you start talking about that, you don't know what you're talking about.

316
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:05,200
Now, there is, however, and these are the people Bob has to deal with.

317
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,200
There is a bureaucracy of angels.

318
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,420
There are recording angels who are helping us right now.

319
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,220
although we probably don't have the very best recording angels.

320
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,780
There are broadcasting angels, 50,000 watts in this case they're helping out on.

321
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:30,880
And the fifth group of the superior super seraphim are headquartered on a planet called Greasington

322
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,980
and serve as space transversers to and from the headquarters of the local universities.

323
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:42,600
You know, it gets really boring, and that's why we have to throw in so many strip shows

324
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,540
and nakedness into the Church of the Subgenius, because if we left that out,

325
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,700
it might as well be the damn Bible or something,

326
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:56,240
with this endless list of recording clerk angels and secretary angels.

327
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,080
And think of the...

328
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,800
You see, because some of these other people, oh, the Christians,

329
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,800
and the Muslims, they like to speak in tongues, tongers, as they call, some of them call each other.

330
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,480
But the subgenius thinks in tongues, acts in tongues.

331
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:21,040
It can actually, in spasmodicisms of divine intervention, dear friends,

332
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,660
because our spouting is a refined form of speaking in tongues.

333
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,020
That's what we do, we spout.

334
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,680
They just speak in tongues.

335
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,080
They go,

336
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,620
And, you know, it doesn't really mean anything.

337
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,860
They say it's the ancient.

338
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,440
It's the ancient language of the recording angels, but they're...

339
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,000
You know, they're just making it up off the top of their heads.

340
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,320
They use the same phrases over and over again anyway.

341
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,080
But the spouting of the subgenius, such as I'm doing now,

342
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,160
while it doesn't make much sense, at least it's in English,

343
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,340
and it is a divine spasmodicism.

344
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,560
Tilton, the great...

345
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,200
pastor, Bob,

346
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,460
Tilton.

347
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,600
I'm waiting for the music to end in the back,

348
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,320
or to pick up again in the background.

349
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:19,120
The great Robert Tilton speaks of the spirit man, his spirit man.

350
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,580
What he's talking about is the subgenius concept of the mental life,

351
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,980
not mental life.

352
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,320
And mental life doesn't have anything to do with, like,

353
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,400
a brain-damaged pronunciation of the word mental life.

354
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,700
Your mental life is what...

355
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,020
It's what the others call a soul.

356
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,480
Only this particular part of your soul can die with the body.

357
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,240
At least we like to hope so.

358
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,480
When they don't, it causes problems.

359
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,480
You know, they shuffle around asking for their...

360
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,340
triple their money back around the subgenius foundation and so forth.

361
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,120
But that's what we're trying to bring you, friends.

362
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,280
Just some real soul,

363
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,940
so that your soul will smell good to Bob,

364
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,260
and to the excess when the end of the world comes,

365
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,320
and it's time, yes, for the harvest.

366
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,020
The harvest.

367
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,000
You know, and you subgeniuses out there should quit feeling guilty.

368
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,400
For having to live in disguise as a pink.

369
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,480
We all have to do it sometimes, you know.

370
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,300
Excuse me, this is a cork in the background.

371
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,000
Yeah, I mean, I know some subgeniuses, they come up to me and they go,

372
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,120
Reverend Stang, man, I'm embarrassed.

373
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,240
I'm giving you this 50 bucks here for these videos,

374
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,520
these new videos of yours, but I don't...

375
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:04,920
I don't...

376
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,840
I just feel like I have to confess.

377
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,300
I made this money on a conspiracy job.

378
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,920
You see, I'm a lawyer or something, you know.

379
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,480
Or I actually work on a construction line.

380
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,240
I'm sorry, man.

381
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,220
And we understand.

382
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:28,200
Some people don't even work conspiracy jobs just for the money.

383
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,920
Some subgeniuses actually work conspiracy jobs because...

384
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,740
Well, because they need a...

385
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,820
They need a certain organization in certain aspects of their lives.

386
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:38,980
Me thinks.

387
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,500
They just...

388
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,180
Hey, what happened to my lovely background music?

389
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,440
I need security in my life, in certain aspects of my life, man.

390
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,720
Oh, well.

391
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,600
I'm not going to wait for...

392
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,220
Oh, that's so much prettier.

393
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,840
As I was saying...

394
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,680
You may...

395
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:01,860
Many...

396
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,900
Even subgeniuses may need...

397
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,980
The security of the steady paycheck, a house, as a counterbalance of the psyche.

398
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,960
Because it forces the brain, you see, to make its horrible leaps of desperation into the realms of...

399
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,880
Yes, the unknown.

400
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
And, uh...

401
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,880
How you have to be Dr. Jekyll sometimes.

402
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,140
Or Mr. Hyde won't exist either.

403
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,640
And, I mean, we're...

404
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,260
Of course, we're all...

405
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:30,740
We like...

406
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,500
We like the part where you turn into Mr. Hyde.

407
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:33,780
In fact...

408
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,760
Some people like...

409
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,460
They like the changing.

410
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,660
That's what they get off on is the...

411
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,060
Is the part that hurts so bad when you change over.

412
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,120
And, of course, you know, the stereotypical subgenius would...

413
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,940
He'd want to be Mr. Hyde all the time.

414
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,040
But remember...

415
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,540
Remember who came first.

416
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,640
You're going to have to allow that Dr. Jekyll in.

417
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,320
Because people who try to be Mr. Hyde all the time...

418
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,720
The real bad, crazy subgeniuses...

419
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,920
You know which ones I'm talking about.

420
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,140
You all know one or two.

421
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,800
Just another escapism.

422
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,140
A way of hiding from the world.

423
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,340
And we...

424
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,820
We don't hide from the world, dear friends.

425
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,420
Do we?

426
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,480
No.

427
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,180
But...

428
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,320
Look what crept in.

429
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,900
Oh, no.

430
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,380
But that...

431
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,620
That little...

432
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,340
It looks sort of like a worm.

433
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,200
A worm with glasses.

434
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,580
No!

435
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,120
No!

436
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,880
Stay away from me!

437
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,640
What are you doing?

438
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:28,900
No!

439
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,900
You're tickling me!

440
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,260
Oh!

441
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:30,880
Oh!

442
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,180
Oh!

443
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:31,560
Oh!

444
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:31,940
Oh!

445
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,460
Oh!

446
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:32,540
Oh!

447
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,060
Oh!

448
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,100
Oh!

449
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,200
Oh!

450
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,200


451
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,360
Oh!

452
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,340
Oh!

453
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:43,780


454
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:44,300


455
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:45,520


456
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:45,760


457
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,100


458
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:49,360


459
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:49,580


460
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:49,580


461
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,220
That's what the audience is waiting to see.

462
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,360
When I can stop doing pratfalls like this,

463
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,660
then this show will have advanced to a kind of adult level.

464
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,340
I'm going to go home now and nurse my broken hip.

465
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,560
Thanks, all you callers, for listening,

466
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,500
and maybe next week I won't have to pull this lame, fool, banana stunt.

467
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,440
Probably just some kind of cheap publicity trick, you know?

468
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,800
Anyway, from the control cockpit of the orbiting velocipede,

469
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,520
Robot Rocket 77,

470
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,580
this is Dr. Howell saying goodbye, goodnight, and sayonara.

471
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,600
All you little rocket rookies and etherettes,

472
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,840
and we'll be back with you again next week

473
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,540
on an all-new puzzling evidence subgenius show.

474
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,280
So long.

475
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,820
Who will save his life?

476
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,300
Come on!

477
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,680
He's got kids!

478
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,100
This is supposed to be funny.

479
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,860
Stop it!

480
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,940
I didn't know you were that way.

481
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,280
All right, 720!

482
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,240
The subgenius...

483
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,320
Mr. S, five minutes left to live!

484
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:10,900
Wait a minute!

485
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,320
Uncle Howell, what's happening down there on the floor?

486
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,440
It looks like a wrestling match.

487
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,660
Oh, the whole thing's just gone to...

488
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,880
But you know, Doug, the fact is,

489
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,300
I'm glad I signed off,

490
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,720
because I sure would hate for the listeners to hear any of this chaos.

491
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,100
They'd be totally turned off.

492
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,680
They'd never listen to the subgenius show.

493
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,180
Hey, that red light's on.

494
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,100
You want to see Uncle Howell?

495
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,460
Phew!

496
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,980
My face is red.

497
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,000
He's leaving the revolving door at the hotel,

498
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,460
getting ready to go to the show.

499
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,080
It's time for another show.

500
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,020
Taxi!

501
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,800
And the taxi comes immediately, of course,

502
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,540
and only costs $1.08.

503
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,620
My most embarrassing moment.

504
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,920
You know, in Tokyo,

505
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,680
when you're hailing a taxi,

506
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,620
if you stick out two fingers...

507
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:55,940
Oh, here comes one.

508
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,040
What do we do, Uncle Howell?

509
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,180
Well, if you stick out two fingers,

510
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,400
the driver knows that means that you'll pay him twice as much.

511
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,300
And so he'll stop for you,

512
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,560
and if you stick out three fingers,

513
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,440
he knows you'll pay him three times as much.

514
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,980
If you stick out five fingers,

515
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,940
you'll pay five times as much,

516
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,740
because taxis are rare in Tokyo,

517
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,820
and they're expensive like everything else over there.

518
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,200
So, you know, I stuck out my hand.

519
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,100
I didn't know any of this,

520
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,400
and I was just wiggling my fingers,

521
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,860
so this guy named Yak stopped.

522
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,300
Yakuza, I think he was called.

523
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,700
And when I tipped him a shiny 50-cent piece,

524
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,740
well, he grew a little angry,

525
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,060
and that's why I'm here,

526
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,540
and I'd like you to send me some money

527
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,260
so they'll stop torturing me.

528
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,840
Oh, yes, dear friends,

529
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,280
we do need to send Dr. Howell as much money as possible

530
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,200
so they'll stop torturing him.

531
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,960
Or we could send other people more money

532
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,040
so they'd continue torturing him.

533
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,500
Ah, decisions, decisions, decisions.

534
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,200
Uh, Tevinator, did you have something to say?

535
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,440
I love you, Daddy.

536
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,840
Happy Father's Day.

537
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,160
Ah.

538
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,640
I'm speechless.

539
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,080
This is a happy Father's Day.

540
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,680
To have, and friends,

541
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,720
if I could only show you the picture

542
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,680
that the Tevinator gave me of herself.

543
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,560
That was my Father's Day present.

544
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,760
She gave me a picture of herself

545
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,300
that was taken two days after she was born.

546
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,800
She looked so hideous.

547
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,200
It's one of my very favorite pictures of her.

548
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:32,940
And, uh,

549
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,280
I have to say,

550
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,960
Happy Father's Day to all you dads out there.

551
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,340
There's, uh, even dads that run this show.

552
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,140
Dad's New Slacks.

553
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,280
They're in Portland, Maine,

554
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,760
playing this show.

555
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,940
Happy Father's Day, Dad,

556
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,980
even though it'll be, you know,

557
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,980
July by the time you guys get around

558
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,580
and playing after I get around.

559
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,220
Sending these tapes out,

560
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,060
oh, to the far-flung stations,

561
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,600
the daring, strange college stations

562
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,680
that dare to play

563
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,720
the subgenius radio ministry.

564
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,960
Hour of Slack.

565
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,680
Ah, yes.

566
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,460
And, uh, praise Bob.

567
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,900
And so, that was what happened to Dr. Howell

568
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,660
in the foreign office

569
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,500
I don't believe it.

570
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,060
That's the corniest thing I've...

571
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,600
in the service of his country and church party.

572
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,020
You gotta send him some money.

573
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,440
I only regret that I have but one wife,

574
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,600
life, to give to my country.

575
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,120
Well, he speaks the truth there for once in his life.

576
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,080
So spake nung Nathan Naylor.

577
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,680
A hailer.

578
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,800
A hail and hearty sailor.

579
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,860
I mean, a partisan member of the old country.

580
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
This country, I mean.

581
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,020
An old time side.

582
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,620
He's got one wife to give.

583
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,160
One wife on the floor.

584
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,700
He put her in a pumpkin shell and, uh,

585
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,360
well, we can't say what he did the rest of the time.

586
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,720
But, uh, aside from these unsavory incidents

587
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,520
which mar our colonial history,

588
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,300
the record of the radical Americans

589
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,900
of the American Revolution,

590
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,740
is not one to scorn.

591
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,920
Yes, the radicalism of the American Revolution

592
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,020
has been consistently underestimated

593
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,080
by what has become a conservative country.

594
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,320
But, in fact,

595
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,940
the American adventure was an unprecedented leap

596
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,880
into the dark.

597
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,660
Atomic warheads don't.

598
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,560
I don't know.

599
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,040
Why?

600
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,080
I only know that it will signal the end of time.

601
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,540
Why?

602
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,680
Well, I don't know.

603
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,300
Bang.

604
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:27,780
Oh.

605
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,880
You know, we're gonna land with a bang

606
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,100
if we don't get, uh, past this blizzard out.

607
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,720
The future is sure.

608
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,720
Three more of these modules here

609
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,900
or the, uh, reaction can't start

610
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,600
and the ship will come down so hard

611
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,100
we're gonna...

612
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,400
30 years ago I warned of it.

613
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,300
20 years ago I warned of it.

614
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:44,720
It's here today.

615
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,840
20 years ago we could have known

616
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,980
and cried and listened to this.

617
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,280
Get that radioactive rabbit up here.

618
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,580
We need some more fuel pellets.

619
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,020
Radioactive rabbits falling out of the top of the...

620
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,640
It was the age of rabbits.

621
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,380
It was the age of despair.

622
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,580
It was the worst of times.

623
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,000
It was the salami of times.

624
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,600
It was the age of ignorance.

625
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,100
It was the age of piggies.

626
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,420
It was the age of ignorance.

627
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,020
And what happened to the rest of these modules?

628
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,080
It's looking pretty poor here.

629
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,420
So Sidney's face was on a milk carton

630
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,320
and, uh, then he got his head chopped off

631
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,940
and he said it is a far, far better thing

632
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,220
one giant step for mankind.

633
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:18,700
Miserly ways...

634
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,480
I can't. I'm afraid.

635
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,360
Nothing, nothing.

636
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,280
Broadway rhythms got me.

637
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,320
Everybody dance.

638
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:27,820
Ha ha ha.

639
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,600
Ha ha ha.

640
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,700
You don't care that much.

641
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,920
Okay, I don't care that much.

642
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,940
Bow by the way.

643
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,960
Did you hear me?

644
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,660
No, I didn't.

645
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:34,800
Okay.

646
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,140
You see, the color of the English crowd

647
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,380
by the emptiness of ages in his face

648
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,420
and on his back, nothing.

649
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,900
...the burden of the world.

650
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,020
And so it came to pass.

651
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:51,780
Yeah.

652
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,980
It was like space and everything.

653
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,220
It was really neat, man.

654
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,360
Yeah, I wish you could have been here to see it,

655
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,860
but, um, you know, it just flew by so fast

656
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,260
that I'm sure a lot of our callers actually missed it.

657
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,860
It's sad, and, and customer service never called.

658
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,360
But, you know, I want to talk to you,

659
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,820
that poor little shut-in I mentioned.

660
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,380
Remember, sweetheart, there's a bright blue sky overhead.

661
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,000
Birds will be singing tomorrow.

662
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,740
You can take my word for that.

663
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,600
And pretty soon, if you just wait one week,

664
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,360
there'll be a whole other subgenius show.

665
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,180
So remember, we're there.

666
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,100
Always.

667
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,100
Always, always at this time.

668
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,520
You can tune us in.

669
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,320
So get a grin upon your chin.

670
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,060
Don't be glum, chum.

671
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,280
It's right that it should be so.

672
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,780
Boost her up and make her go.

673
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,700
The preceding was a Methodist message

674
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,080
from the Internet.

675
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:08,900
International monetary conspiracy coin production company.

676
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,620
And a paid political announcement, too.

677
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,720
Do I have to tell them that?

678
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,440
Oh, and it was a paid political announcement

679
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,640
for the Citizens for Puzzling Evidence.

680
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,880
Ah, yeah, he let that one off easy.

681
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,820
What happened to the rest of them modules?

682
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,240
There's supposed to be nine modules here,

683
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,020
and there are only six.

684
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,480
Oh, you can't keep the help

685
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,800
from running off with these modules.

686
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,460
Hey, come back here with that.

687
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,880
with the silver and the lead,

688
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,220
and they're running off with the paintings

689
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,280
and the TV and the auto money.

690
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,540
And Bob's the singer.

691
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,840
The Bob's the singer.

692
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,720
Bob's your uncle.

693
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,000
And did Bob take you home?

694
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,720
Did Bob take you home on that occasion?

695
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,420
Did Bob take you home on that occasion?

696
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,680
Bob took you home on that occasion.

697
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,420
Let me out.

698
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:57,660
Let me out.

699
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:57,860
Let me out.

700
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:58,360


701
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,840
I didn't take you home.

702
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:02,840


703
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:02,840


704
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:02,840


705
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:02,840


706
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:02,840


707
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:02,840


708
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,740
I know that means we've been watching.

709
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,080
We have the taste to perfect the faith.

710
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,840
It was good.

711
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,760
It was good.

712
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,600
I couldn't take the chance

713
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,860
that you might destroy our team.

714
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,360
Our team's ended.

715
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,640
Just like the Lawrence Welk show used to be.

716
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,660
On the air.

717
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,020
And erase me.

718
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,980
Record right over my show.

719
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,560
Yee-haw.

720
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,140
I think I could take one more hot buttered rum martini.

721
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,840
On the air.

722
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,380
And stand in line.

723
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,800
Begin rewind procedure now.

724
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,360
I really think the Church of the Subgenius is...

725
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,820
Yeah, who are you?

726
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,200
Is this some real person?

727
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,600
Oh!

728
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,420
Who?

729
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,520
Now, let's go over that again.

730
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,360
Yeah, Hal, he said he saw a monster.

731
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,140
Relives.

732
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,660
And enjoys.

733
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,560
Uh-oh, watch out.

734
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,720
Is this mission control?

735
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,060
I'm not getting a clear signal.

736
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,920
Go, go, go, go!

737
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,620
You say you saw...

738
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,240
Sir!

739
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,140
Sir, you say you saw some saucer.

740
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:16,940
Sir!

741
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:17,580
Sir!

742
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,400
The saucer you say you saw.

743
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,080
Sir!

744
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,140
Sir!

745
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:30,140
Oh, well, we had someone here who, believe it or not, claimed he saw, well, a flying saucer.

746
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,620
And I figure any guy who shot Bob can't be bad.

747
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:35,860
America?

748
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,580
Kill me!

749
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,440
Wake up.

750
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,520
And smell the music.

751
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,060
I mean, I.

752
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,300
Six modules have I, six I see.

753
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,760
But nine I need to then be free.

754
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,540
Give me my four modules.

755
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,520
I mean, three modules.

756
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,100
I mean...

757
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,460
It was a dark and stormy night outside the kitchen.

758
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,040
Oh, yeah, no kidding.

759
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,960
Oh, thank you, Dr. Howell.

760
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,200
Oh, I don't want to, uh...

761
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,440
Let me pull that tape a little back, because I want to start that up again later on,

762
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,660
so you can hear about that dark and stormy night routine,

763
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,440
which the evil Dr. Howell does indeed get into.

764
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,440
But have you noticed, dear friends, have you ever noticed how the conspiracy will suddenly announce

765
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,140
in the media the most obvious common sense things in the world as a new discovery?

766
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:37,860
Like...

767
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:37,980
Like...

768
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:43,700
An instance might be, you know, children do better in school if they have a full night's sleep.

769
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:52,860
Because this huge study with endless funding that kept hundreds of bureaucrats sitting on their tokeses

770
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,320
has allowed them, finally, you know, after millions of dollars of taxpayers' money,

771
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,300
has allowed them to finally figure out this thing that you could have told them anyway.

772
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,680
You know, that your grandma's been saying for a hundred years.

773
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,940
And it's not just...

774
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:14,640
It's the commies, the pinkos, the homos, the environmentalists, the feminists,

775
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,460
the animal rights activists and earth-firsters,

776
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:24,900
and the fundamentalists and the prigs and the prudes and the fascists and the republicans and the...

777
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:32,180
Those are all just tiny pimples upon a great heaving sea of victims, dear friends.

778
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:37,440
Victims and crybabyisms and self-denial of any responsibility,

779
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,240
for their situation,

780
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:45,320
and denial of the fact that even within their society of codependent cross-victimization,

781
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:50,300
it actually remains dog-eat-dog.

782
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,340
It's kind of like, who can out-victim who at this point?

783
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:02,920
The conspiracy just sits back and laughs as its opponents kill each other off.

784
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,560
The overman must be an objectivist.

785
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,680
You see.

786
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,340
Or the ovary man.

787
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,620
Sir ma'am.

788
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,600
An objectivist.

789
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:19,920
Because you have to realize, you just would naturally realize,

790
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:26,940
that a natural sequence of events must have brought this terrible, disgusting world situation about.

791
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,040
It's just like in economics.

792
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,460
It's a huge operating system that you can't control.

793
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,840
You can only ride the waves of it.

794
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,020
The best thing you could do within...

795
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,020
this system is to be the most successful unit in that system.

796
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,140
To create more phylos of slack.

797
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,640
Which improves the whole system, when you get more phylos of slack.

798
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,860
You might as well, you know, because you're stuck in it.

799
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,320
We don't mean the conspiracy system.

800
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,580
We mean the entire system of human and subgenius social interaction.

801
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,000
And at times, perhaps, troublemakers are the most valuable...

802
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,840
units of that system.

803
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:17,520
And you can generate more phylos by transferring your stangs of pain...

804
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,060
to a lower order within the system, which is better adjusted to running on them.

805
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:26,760
Such as a lower order of humanoid, who expects nothing but stangs anyway.

806
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,960
You know, pass your troubles on to them, dear friends.

807
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,340
It's just like evolution.

808
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,280
It's the most natural thing in the world.

809
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,940
There's no magic superstition.

810
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,840
None of this...

811
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,020
ethical, moral...

812
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,680
baloney based on thousand-year-old fairy tales.

813
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,080
It's just simply the way things are.

814
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,780
And it took Bob to come out and just say the common sense things...

815
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,740
and all the other religions just dance around.

816
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:58,880
In fact, all the other religions are nothing but ways to get around acknowledging these things.

817
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,440
So what is the truth?

818
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,520
The truth is...

819
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,820
that's just the way it is, pal.

820
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,340
And if you don't like it...

821
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,200
you got two choices.

822
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,300
Live it...

823
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,360
or lump it.

824
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,880
These are not right-wing ideas.

825
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:14,920
Nay.

826
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,840
This great system transcends politics.

827
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,340
It's bigger than man.

828
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,280
This is scientific!

829
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,940
It's a collective interaction like a beehive.

830
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,600
You can dig up a whole sheet of bees when they're dormant...

831
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,240
out of a beehive...

832
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,520
and they'll awaken.

833
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,980
They'll swarm a certain way simultaneously, like one unit.

834
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,760
And the conspiracy's great sin...

835
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,260
is to try to organize that swarm of bees...

836
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,580
which is humanity...

837
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,020
which can never be done.

838
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,700
The conspiracy tries to explain things...

839
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,860
and all they end up doing is over-complicating everything...

840
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,960
and run around like a bunch of ninnies...

841
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,240
just signifying...

842
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,280
just signifying...

843
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,320
when they should be providing for their families.

844
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,380
Only we, who have made it to this pinnacle...

845
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,920
of what they consider the ethical scale...

846
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,360
are obliged to share our signifying.

847
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,880
The overman...

848
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,720
an over...

849
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,840
ovaryman...

850
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,940
or uberfem...

851
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,980
wants state...

852
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,280
state sovereignty.

853
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,580
It wants yard sovereignty, for that matter.

854
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,940
Each yard should become a separate nation.

855
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,240
That would be a good start.

856
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,660
I mean, the Soviet Union broke up?

857
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,480
Well, by God, it's time for the U.S. to break up...

858
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,020
into the...

859
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,260
the disunited states...

860
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,420
the Commonwealth of Independent American States...

861
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,800
then the Commonwealth of Independent American Yards.

862
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,320
I mean, in Russia, when they had a coup...

863
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,300
the Russians didn't put up with it.

864
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,920
In America, they didn't even notice when our coup happened...

865
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,140
because they're too busy blaming everything on Lee Harvey Oswald.

866
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,020
Oh, friends, so many conspiracies of fanatics...

867
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,500
with their false explanations for reality...

868
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,780
and because they have explanations, period...

869
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,680
that they expect others to adhere to.

870
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,960
Just as the subgenius accepts its responsibility...

871
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,120
for its abnormality...

872
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,300
it expects others to do the same.

873
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,020
And if they infringe upon our rights...

874
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,480
then we must...

875
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,580
infringe upon theirs.

876
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,140
Ah, yes, praise Bob...

877
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,760
and doctors for Bob...

878
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,240
heard in the background.

879
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:34,800
Phew!

880
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,240
Damn!

881
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,420
I hate this job...

882
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,700
to work in this dump...

883
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,960
you gotta be a snob.

884
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,880
Everybody gets on my nerves in this place...

885
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,620
I think I'll take the afternoon off...

886
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,700
from the rat race.

887
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,520
An exciting career...

888
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,360
don't amount to much...

889
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,720
but a pain in the rear.

890
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,620
I bust my ass all day for a dollar...

891
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:25,940
and then I go home...

892
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,400
and listen to the killtower.

893
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,120
Devoted spouse waiting in the den...

894
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,020
Wazza hit me upside the head with a rolling pin.

895
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,020
Ha ha ha!

896
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,240
Does that ring a bell?

897
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,020
A daily routine...

898
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,900
we all know well.

899
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,200
I'm making more...

900
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,640
but enjoying it less.

901
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:43,220
The good life's mainly causing me stress.

902
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,220
Making a change is difficult but...

903
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,700
I gotta try to get out of this rut.

904
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,360
But fear seems to be holding me back.

905
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,940
Courage is a principal trait I lack.

906
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,900
I gotta calm my nerves so I can think.

907
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,700
I pour myself a nice stiff drink...

908
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,160
and another.

909
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,420
This is my usual mode...

910
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,720
one for the money...

911
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,080
and gin for the road.

912
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:05,540
Ah!

913
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,620
Now everything is clear.

914
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,140
I gotta get the hell out of here.

915
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,340
Yes, now...

916
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,040
my mission is plain.

917
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,680
A Big Mac is calling my name.

918
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,500
I gotta sample some of Ronald's cooking...

919
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,400
so I raid my wife's purse...

920
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,260
when she's not looking.

921
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,780
Pondering the wonderful thing called marriage.

922
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:27,000
I accidentally back the car into a piggy carriage.

923
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,140
Excuse me ma'am...

924
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,540
I love to stay in chat...

925
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,820
but watch where you're going next time you're back.

926
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,540
I hit the gas...

927
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,760
and zoom down the block.

928
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,300
Lever in the dust...

929
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,380
yelling for the cops.

930
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,000
Swiping round the corner...

931
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,900
trying to steer.

932
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,300
I get so excited...

933
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,860
I almost spill my beer.

934
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,380
My neighborhood dog...

935
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,600
is yapping in my bumper...

936
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,060
so I dial on the brakes...

937
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,200
and I hear a big thump.

938
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,680
I jump the curb...

939
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,940
and land up on a lawn.

940
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,260
Then I finish my beer...

941
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,400
and turn the radio on.

942
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,480
Some idiot's going on...

943
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,500
about rehab.

944
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:57,900
I grab a brew...

945
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,440
and me and he gonna pro-tab.

946
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,080
Here comes a little old lady...

947
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,800
with a shot of vodka...

948
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:01,800


949
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:01,800


950
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:01,800


951
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:01,800


952
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:01,800


953
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,860
I put the pedal to the metal...

954
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,640
and she runs...

955
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,840
Hanging on my wall...

956
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,060
for a driving power.

957
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,780
I do a donut in a bed of flowers.

958
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,280
Gonna jerk the wheel...

959
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,640
a little too hard.

960
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,640
The car rolls over and over...

961
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,840
on and out of the yard.

962
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,820
Call them of construction.

963
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,360
Call them...

964
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:20,680
Call them of construction...

965
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:20,680


966
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,580
of W-W-W-W-W..

967
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,740
Call them of construction...

968
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,460
on and on and on.

969
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,780
And how you doing ma'am...

970
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:31,780


971
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:31,780


972
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:31,780


973
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:31,780


974
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:31,780


975
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:31,780


976
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:31,780


977
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:31,780


978
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:31,780


979
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:31,780


980
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:31,780


981
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,820
of empty beer cans rattling at my feet.

982
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,840
Staring in the window as a nosy

983
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,740
little brat. I look him in the eyes

984
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,860
and say I meant to do that. And I notice

985
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,820
my watch says I'm overdue

986
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:13,900
for my paid appointment at the local

987
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,820
drive-thru. I do a number

988
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,720
on an accelerator and I'm

989
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,960
cutting in line about 30 seconds later.

990
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,480
What do you think this is?

991
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,620
Some kind of joke? Give me 10 big

992
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,400
mics and a small diet coke.

993
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,500
I pull up to the window with my radio

994
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,760
playing. I grab the bag and leave

995
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,480
without paying. I

996
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,480
weave down the road for a block

997
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,800
juggling a beer and a styrofoam

998
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,740
box. Pull into a parking lot

999
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,700
and kill the motor. Presently

1000
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,440
I notice a peculiar odor.

1001
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,600
A little black smoke is rising

1002
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,640
from the hood. Something's gonna happen

1003
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,580
and it's probably not good. I open

1004
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,520
the door, grab my stuff and go.

1005
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,620
Just in time to watch the whole

1006
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,400
thing grow. The car explodes

1007
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,720
with a bang and a hiss. Oh boy

1008
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,720
my wife is gonna really like this.

1009
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,520
I can't believe this is

1010
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,240
happening to me. This piece of

1011
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,220
jilt going back to the factory.

1012
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,340
This was a blatant attempt on my

1013
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,600
life. Everyone I fought for that

1014
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,660
except my wife.

1015
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,180
A way of playing begins to emerge.

1016
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,500
I suddenly have an overwhelming

1017
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,660
urge to spend the night in the

1018
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,220
great outdoors. My suburban

1019
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,180
lifestyle has become a bore.

1020
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,400
I'll build me a fire and finish

1021
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,640
my burgers while my wife don't

1022
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,660
know no murder. I'll leave

1023
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,160
the scene of the unhappy event

1024
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,500
resolved to make the most of the

1025
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,520
moment. A few yards

1026
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,700
away I feel better. I know

1027
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,560
I'll write her a letter.

1028
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,580
Or better yet, I'll ransom

1029
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,380
the man. Got your husband

1030
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,520
some money in his hands or else

1031
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,600
we'll send his head home in a jar.

1032
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,520
Yes! Sorry

1033
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,540
about the car. Dad, now that

1034
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,520
ought to really do the trick. I'll be getting

1035
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,520
on the hook and she'll be worried sick.

1036
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,580
But really, I'm gonna make it up

1037
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,580
to you, honey. I'll buy you a new car

1038
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,780
with your own damn money. I'll walk

1039
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,340
a while into the sunset.

1040
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,660
On land, at peace with the world.

1041
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,660
You bet. Nothing can diminish

1042
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,600
my total enjoyment. Except

1043
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,680
when I pass my place of employment.

1044
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,600
Damn! I hate

1045
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,700
this job. To work in this dump

1046
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,220
you gotta be a snob.

1047
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,700
Everybody gets on my nerves in this place.

1048
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,340
I think I'll take the afternoon

1049
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,140
off for a wrap race.

1050
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,220
Hard like a criminal.

1051
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,180
Hard like a

1052
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:25,800
criminal.

1053
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,300
Hard like a criminal.

1054
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,940
Hard like a

1055
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:32,500
criminal.

1056
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,720
Criminal.

1057
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,720
Whoa!

1058
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,640
A beautiful, beautiful

1059
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,200
little piece there

1060
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:45,480
by

1061
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,840
MC 900

1062
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,140
Foot Jesus.

1063
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,640
First time we've ever played a

1064
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,480
I don't usually play super famous

1065
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,100
bands like MC 900

1066
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,060
Foot Jesus.

1067
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,380
I don't believe that's

1068
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,340
a local

1069
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,620
phenomenon.

1070
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,700
900 Foot Jesus, if I recall

1071
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,940
correctly. Dear friends,

1072
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:10,900
I just thought I'd

1073
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,780
break in right about here

1074
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,160
and reveal to you that you are

1075
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,480
listening to the Subgenius

1076
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,740
Radio Ministry

1077
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,040
Hour of Slack.

1078
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,140
The voice of the church

1079
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,060
of the subgenius, the most

1080
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,400
disorganized religion,

1081
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,240
and

1082
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:29,360
most disorganized

1083
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:29,360


1084
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,040
And if you'd like to know more

1085
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,520
about, actually there is a lot

1086
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,140
more to know about the church.

1087
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,000
There's a lot we can't tell you on the radio

1088
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,420
for reasons that some of which you can imagine,

1089
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,280
some you'd think of and say,

1090
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,540
oh, well, no, that's just,

1091
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,060
I'm just letting my imagination run wild.

1092
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,180
And that would be accurate.

1093
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,800
They would apply as well.

1094
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,180
And then of course, there are those things we do

1095
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,380
that you cannot imagine.

1096
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,480
And we can reveal that to you.

1097
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:00,600
For free.

1098
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,980
We send you free information,

1099
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,480
catalogs and stuff.

1100
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,640
If you'll just drop us a postcard,

1101
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:07,900
tell us where to send it.

1102
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,120
Here's the number to write to.

1103
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:14,020
You get that pen or pencil or that,

1104
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,620
if you don't have a pen or pencil,

1105
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,540
I bet you can find something sharp

1106
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,700
and extract a dark colored liquid

1107
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,960
from your own body and write this on your wall.

1108
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,160
Write in blood the name,

1109
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:28,540
Bob.

1110
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,760
That's spelled,

1111
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:31,740
B

1112
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,200
O

1113
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,540
B,

1114
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:37,160
Now write,

1115
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,980
P. O. Box

1116
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,580
1 4 0 3 0 6.

1117
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,520
That's it, that's very good.

1118
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,580
Now keep that, don't don't let that

1119
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,280
clot up yet,

1120
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,860
don't let that little cut clot up.

1121
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,340
That's better.

1122
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:11,380
40306 Dallas Texas 75214 yes 75214 that's a zip code you send that and say

1123
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:16,800

1124
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:24,300
either I will or the will of God who is here as always answering your calls and

1125
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:30,820
what he tells him is what I just told you dear dear friends but we have a

1126
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:33,660
secret we're going to reveal right now

1127
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:38,340
absolutely continuing power

1128
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:43,780
you know that stuff we always tell people like turn down your radio it doesn't really matter

1129
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,860
turn down your radio I can't understand you

1130
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:51,440
we just make it up because it sounds so radio insensitive

1131
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,640
hey are you taping the show

1132
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,160
you bet I am

1133
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,060
uh oh I forgot the rotation

1134
00:53:58,900 --> 00:53:59,960
SIPPROC 46

1135
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,080
check 22

1136
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,140
SIPPROC 46 text

1137
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,520
4-5-P 14 and upscope

1138
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,340
4-5-P I have the car awakened the man servant

1139
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,060
4-5-P the man servant has awakened

1140
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,680
4-5-P and

1141
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,740
SIPPROC 6 lock on and launch

1142
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,160
14 and launch

1143
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,160
and launch

1144
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,180
do we have mouth open

1145
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,540
what's the matter with the launch tube

1146
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,020
the launch the launch

1147
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,980
the collar is going to blow the collar is going to blow

1148
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,940
get him out of here it's getting too hot

1149
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,540
it's getting too hot

1150
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,620
Jesus we lost him

1151
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:41,340
that that that wasn't close

1152
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,440
oh my god

1153
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,840
that was really close

1154
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,100
it was like a delayed reaction

1155
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:50,160
when that plasma started getting up inside of there you know I mean

1156
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,840
all the little dots in his face

1157
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,820
Woh

1158
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:17,000
He just got stacks every time

1159
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,020
so computer

1160
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:20,120
pack

1161
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:20,840
dead

1162
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,240
kinda take your panties off

1163
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,500
kinda take your panties off

1164
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,600
kinda take your panties off

1165
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,720
everybody take your panties off

1166
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,240
well

1167
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:07,220
till hell

1168
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,840
Amazing, dear friends.

1169
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,360
That was the world premiere of the Baba Hula

1170
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:21,040
by Reverend Mike Dugans in, I believe, North Carolina.

1171
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,260
He's a good artist, too.

1172
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:28,460
And, friends, you also heard a little bit of the KHSU subgenius show

1173
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,140
there out of Arcata, the Grassy Knoll Project.

1174
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,720
But, you know, the grandpappy of all shows

1175
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,300
right here on Grandpappy's Day

1176
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,920
when he keels over after seeing his own shadow

1177
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,660
is, of course, the puzzling evidence in Dr. Howell's

1178
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,500
more than an hour, less than a show, show.

1179
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,740
It was a dark and stormy night outside the gates of Paris.

1180
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,060
I, being the challenged party,

1181
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,580
drew my rusty trustsy pistol.

1182
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,800
I fired, he fell.

1183
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,880
We rushed to a nearby inn

1184
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,880
where I met a tall, dark, and handsome man

1185
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,480
who said,

1186
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,560
it was a dark and stormy night

1187
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,000
outside the gates of Paris.

1188
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,120
I, being the challenged party,

1189
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,800
drew my rusty trustsy pistol.

1190
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,300
I fired, he fell.

1191
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,780
We rushed to a nearby cafe

1192
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,720
where I met a short, fat, and dumpy woman

1193
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,120
who said,

1194
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,680
it was a dark and stormy night

1195
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,520
outside the gates of Paris.

1196
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,760
I didn't even tell him

1197
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,280
what he felt.

1198
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,740
I fired, he fell.

1199
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:49,080
Who calls Dr. Howell at this hour?

1200
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:56,080
Who rends the air with notes so sour and dares to threaten Dr. Howell's power?

1201
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:01,480
Oh, Babs. Oh, well, all right, you can threaten it, but not anybody else.

1202
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,380
Is anybody listening at all?

1203
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,940
I've only got eight modules here. That's what's wrong. Where's the ninth module?

1204
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,320
Call 348-844-8888.

1205
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,960
You can't give this number out on the radio.

1206
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,560
Failure to do so may result in prosecution for criminal drug evasion.

1207
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:22,560
Oh, how do they know that? I'd better drop up now.

1208
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,200
I mean, that is, I mean, I need to salute the flag. That's what we call it.

1209
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,940
Yeah, yeah, I got to go up and salute.

1210
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,240
I've to salute the flag as many times as my arm can take it.

1211
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,160
Oh, my God, that guy's had too much.

1212
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,000
Get him some air.

1213
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,520
That's kind of really the bottom line.

1214
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,480
Meantime, you may not have anything to lose.

1215
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:47,720
Where's the extra module? I need it. I can't go. I can't move without it.

1216
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,880
Give me my module. Give it to me now.

1217
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:58,180
Folks, this program is a module broadcast of an emergency module system.

1218
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:01,620
This had been a real program and not just a module.

1219
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:04,260
You would have heard the actual unrehearsed live,

1220
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:08,000
brought by us from puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell.

1221
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:13,820
As it was, what you heard is an amazing scientific phenomenon called the multi-indexed memory bank,

1222
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,980
which mimics, though some scientists still prefer to use the word imitate,

1223
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,840
a full-fledged, full-blown subgenius show.

1224
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,320
We want numbers.

1225
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,720
No rossin' rossin'.

1226
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:29,260
You want color? We got color. You want action? We got action.

1227
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,120
You want excitement? We got excitement.

1228
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,700
You want, uh, thrills?

1229
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,140
Well, we don't exactly have thrills.

1230
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:42,000
You want widescreen, Cinerama, Tardeo, Smell-O-Vision, Sense Around?

1231
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,760
Well, we don't have any of those things either.

1232
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,960
No, actually, we don't even have any popcorn.

1233
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,920
The lobby's out and the projector hasn't been working for years.

1234
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:54,360
You know, the youth gangs have taken over this theater.

1235
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,880
It's worth your life to come in here.

1236
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,700
You know, you ask them to shut up, they'll drill you with their guns.

1237
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,100
It's terrible, isn't it?

1238
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:01,100


1239
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,360
The place reeks of stench.

1240
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,140
It's overwhelming.

1241
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:07,600
If I could only get out of here, I feel like I've spent my life in this movie theater.

1242
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,060
Oh, I'll have one of those.

1243
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,840
Let me have a hot buttered rum martini.

1244
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,920
And Coke machine isn't working again.

1245
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,680
Great! Great, just great.

1246
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,160
Oh, come on.

1247
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,920
Hold it, lady.

1248
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:21,920
I didn't mean you.

1249
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,940
I meant that it's just this theater.

1250
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,860
Here, here, here, you can have mine.

1251
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:26,400
Drink mine.

1252
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:27,480
I don't care. I'll give it away.

1253
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,640
I really hate the Church of the Subgenius.

1254
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,380
Oh, come on.

1255
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,120
Give me another chance.

1256
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,580
Oh, look, I made a bad impression.

1257
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,900
I made the Church of the Subgenius look bad.

1258
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:36,940
Boy, am I embarrassed.

1259
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,280
It's my countenance grinsing.

1260
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,200
How the heck could you do that, Dr. L?

1261
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:42,940
Well, it just slipped out of me.

1262
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,400
I was in a crowded elevator and I, well, I betrayed all of them.

1263
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:48,900
You're making me hot.

1264
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:49,720
Uh-oh.

1265
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:52,240
Well, I didn't realize it would have that effect, ma'am.

1266
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,980
Here, I'll just drink my hot buttered rum martini.

1267
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,380
He's talking about inside the crowded elevator.

1268
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:58,580
Oh, golly gee.

1269
01:00:58,580 --> 01:00:59,380
He's just a script.

1270
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,360
This is a happy ending.

1271
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:00,880
Happy New Year's.

1272
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:01,880
You think about this, stuff.

1273
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,340
Puzzling.

1274
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,080
Yeah!

1275
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,740
Oh, better.

1276
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,800
Well, if I...
