1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,020
We don't have no time for that All we want is an hour of slack

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,740
Do you know where it's at? All you need is an hour of slack

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,660
Everyone needs a straitjacket Pull it tight, let's all slack it

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,400
Everyone needs a straitjacket Hold on tight, let's all slack it

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,200
All we want is an hour of slack

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:47,680
Do you know where it's at? All you need is an hour of slack

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,440
Everyone needs a straitjacket Pull it tight, let's all slack it

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,260
Everyone needs a straitjacket Pull it tight, let's all slack it

9
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:55,440
All we want is an hour of slack

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,800
All we want is an hour of slack

11
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:15,660
All we want is an hour of slack

12
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,940
Let's all slack it

13
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:26,100
All we want is an hour of slack

14
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,560
Pull it tight, let's all slack it

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,980
All we want is an hour of slack

16
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


17
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:37,940
Oh, let's tell my world you may die

18
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,420
Fuck them if they can't take a chance

19
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,960
Too much is always the case

20
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:49,740
Too much is always the case

21
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:56,060
When the world will release

22
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,920
Too much is always the case

23
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,440
겨어� kry

24
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,080
Oh, my God.

25
00:03:47,280 --> 00:04:03,900
Oh, my God.

26
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,560
Russian voters says Russia has been stockpiling Russians.

27
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:16,880
Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, backed by Russia, has been carrying out an offensive Turkey news in the city center.

28
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,940
City center.

29
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,100
Johnson visited his troops by a tank and destroyed buildings.

30
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,120
Turkish fighters now say they've taken control.

31
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,620
On Twitter today, President Trump says 200 people have some PR.

32
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,040
Trump tweets the PR reports were probably made at 11.

33
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,940
Later date to further their agendas.

34
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,540
PR News.

35
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,980
The second fashion reports.

36
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,480
Only 3.6463.

37
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,620
Officials in Florida say they believe all PR News.

38
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,780
PR News.

39
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,600
Ta-ta.

40
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,680
Are we spangled?

41
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,560
Are we spangled?

42
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:56,920
Are we spangled?

43
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,000
This music in the background is spangled.

44
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,560
And what have we been playing?

45
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,640
Well, PR News is back from Fernanda Nandi-Lemur.

46
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,620
That's real good news.

47
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,240
In fact, it's PR News, even though it's spelled with a G.

48
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,440
Good news.

49
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,520
That beautiful instrumental was the bishop, who we haven't heard from in a while.

50
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,840
Although I think he did the titles in one of the recent shows.

51
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,240
Oh.

52
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,340
Oh.

53
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,140
Kind of older recording.

54
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,240
Onward Slackful Soldiers is the name of that instrumental tune.

55
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,920
I do have a subgenius science essay I can read here.

56
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,960
By Joshua Scott Hodgkin.

57
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,680
I don't know if he's actually a subgenius minister or not.

58
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,400
And this was something he wrote on his blog.

59
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,100
It's very well written.

60
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,500
And I don't actually agree with it at all myself.

61
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,700
Subgenius Science.

62
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,580
The Unified Theory of Slack.

63
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:23,540
Although Slack is definitively undefinable, can we come any closer to understanding it using science?

64
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,640
No, pink lord, we cannot.

65
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,100
This is not going to have anything to do with science except to remind you that if you take that method on,

66
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,960
as a singular worldview, you're about as far away from achieving slack as you can possibly be.

67
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,040
Science has become the new authority on all matters.

68
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,480
And those who cling to it as holy gospel are addicted to the possibility of power that their mythical certainties and absolutes suggest.

69
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,160
Only Bob can be certain about anything.

70
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,200
So the only thing you should even consider being certain about is Bob.

71
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,000
Absolutes and certainties are like,

72
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,620
anchors.

73
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:08,100
They tether your mind to only the narrow field of experiences which validate whatever it is you're so damn sure of.

74
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,380
The only prevention for this sickness is to make damn sure that you aren't damn sure of anything.

75
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:23,120
And the only way to achieve that is to abandon the pervasive and perverse notion of modern thought known in philosophy as realism.

76
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:31,080
Realism is the belief that the junk going on inside your head must also be going on outside of you.

77
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:45,340
So you can't likely

78
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:51,680
organize your mind around anything.

79
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
You practice Robert Bacon's science,

80
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,820
or the UCSRS,

81
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,080


82
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:07,000
experience has an objectivity value of zero, you can add and multiply them

83
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,560
infinitely and the sum would still be zero. Consensus is an unreliable

84
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,820
verification tool. We do not even know that our experiences are the same, just

85
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:23,420
that we use similar language to describe phenomena. You cannot verify the contents

86
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,660
of another mind because the only person that has access to them is the

87
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,780
individual. It is possible that we are all experiencing radically different

88
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,060
realities, but that language allows us to believe we're all on the same page.

89
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,320
Realists also appeal to induction and abduction, both of which sidestep direct

90
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,800
observations, the measurement and testing, and rely on circular logic. Just because

91
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,140
a phenomenon repeats does not mean it always will,

92
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,640
and that is not the case.

93
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,840
And just because some belief is justifiable does not make it an objective fact.

94
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,960
It takes leaps of faith to build your premises on abstractions and some

95
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:11,220
seriously willful ignorance to fail to acknowledge the frailty of your starting

96
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,220
assumptions. Finally, the realists will rest their case on pragmatism.

97
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,260
This stuff works, dammit, so it must be real.

98
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,400
But placebos work.

99
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,380
Geocentric maps of the cosmos were flawed, but provided working models

100
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:26,640
of reality.

101
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,700
The realists are not the only ones to be able to make the most of the

102
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,180
knowledge of the world.

103
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,740
There are a lot of things that are not supposed to work, but do so very well.

104
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,460
The appeal to pragmatism is an idiot's brag of lacking an imagination.

105
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,320
I see subgenii making realist claims all the time.

106
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,360
That probably means me.

107
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:54,820
I suppose they think that their realism is in opposition to the old religions and is a form of rebellion.

108
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,640
This is an incredible thing.

109
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,660
This is an incredibly misguided falsehood.

110
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,100
Not only is modern science and the realist worldview a direct descendant of protestant philosophy,

111
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,300
but all the old religions themselves are incredibly realist.

112
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:16,500
The many marks of Abraham all believe in a literal creation of a literal universe that is literally run by absolutes and certainties.

113
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:24,920
Realism is the single most pervasive norm of the modern world and it provides the shackles from which the subgenius seeks their slack.

114
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:26,720
Ha!

115
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,940
The alternative is philosophical idealism.

116
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,880
The belief that all phenomena are mental phenomena.

117
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,200
That we are minds.

118
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,520
That the contents of our minds are our experiences and that the products of experiences are personal knowledge.

119
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,860
Idealism says no more than that.

120
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,700
It doesn't tell us how the world really is and therefore you're not supposed to behave accordingly.

121
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,520
There are no solid purchases for attaching our chains to.

122
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,620
It is not a self-jsutian.

123
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:56,620


124
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:56,620


125
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:56,620


126
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:56,620


127
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:56,620


128
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:56,620


129
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:56,620


130
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:56,620


131
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:56,620


132
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,320
It's pure fucking slack.

133
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,240
I'm already groaning at the idiotic but highly anticipated scripted responses realists will offer.

134
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,760
But let me make it clear.

135
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,480
I don't give a fuck.

136
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,420
I have worn your silly-ass worldview and freed myself from it.

137
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,740
It's not an inability to understand that separates me from realists,

138
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,160
but a rejection of something I understood all too well for far too long.

139
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,980
There is no need to defend your normative realist beliefs

140
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,500
because they have already infected everything in the world with pink identity.

141
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,160
Realism is winning and winning hard,

142
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,880
so you can take your Bobby Boy bullshit elsewhere

143
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,980
and you can keep your naive, literalist, authoritarian delusions to yourself.

144
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,040
And you can take my slack when you pry it from the cold, dead mind

145
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
of the second-person experience

146
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,820
of my idealized form.

147
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,980
Praise Bob.

148
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,000
I thought that was a beautifully written unified theory of slack,

149
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,740
subgenius science,

150
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,380
by Joshua Scott Hotchkin.

151
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,720
And now this.

152
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,840
Are you spangled?

153
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,240
I am spangled.

154
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,480
You are spangled.

155
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,320
Yes, I am.

156
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,400
We have spangle in the background.

157
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,900
Spangle?

158
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,760
Spangle.

159
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,880
Spangle.

160
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,020


161
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,560
Spangle.

162
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,680
It's a band.

163
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,860
It's a band.

164
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,380
A band.

165
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,420
A band.

166
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,980
It's a partner nostril told us about and gave us a bunch of CDs.

167
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,180
Are you spangled?

168
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes, I'm spangled.

169
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,880
Are you spangled?

170
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,100
Yes.

171
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,840
Oh, by the way, I've already decided the name of this show,

172
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,120
the theme of this episode in advance.

173
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes, it was a sentence that we said earlier.

174
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,060
Okay.

175
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,260
And the sentence was,

176
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,500
he might have peed while we weren't looking.

177
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,740
He might have peed while we weren't looking.

178
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,140
He speaks everything on the planet right now,

179
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,880
all the way from the politics of the potus

180
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,000
to maximum other misreadings, so to speak.

181
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,240
Well, you know, the time of pee,

182
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,000
spelled a certain way,

183
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,880
is a major doctrine in Church of Subgenius.

184
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,660
The way it's spelled was with a capital P,

185
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,380
a lowercase e, and then a capital E.

186
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,640
So it's more holy that way.

187
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,020
It's not just pee, it's more P-E.

188
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,960
Right.

189
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,580
The mighty time of pee.

190
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,460
Do you like to pee?

191
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,320
Why would I remember such a thing like that?

192
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,540
It makes no relevance to me whatsoever.

193
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,900
Yet, of all the doctrines, I remember that one.

194
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,760
If you like to urinate,

195
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,020
then you're sure to be interested in...

196
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,320
In this.

197
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,920
That's what it was.

198
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,460
I'm interested in urinating.

199
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,160
Just like those people saying,

200
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,360
hey, you like money?

201
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,440
You like freedom?

202
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,100
Well, call Freedom National Money Incorporated.

203
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,040
A man named Doug or Jim or Terrence

204
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,580
in St. Louis, Missouri,

205
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,600
is waiting for a $24,000 check.

206
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,440
They're dividing a billion dollars

207
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,020
and they're going to give it to you right now.

208
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,000
Have you heard that?

209
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,460
I haven't heard that.

210
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,020
Sounds like spam to me.

211
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,680
Sounds like...

212
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,180
Fresh sliced spam.

213
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,380
Yeah, but it's on the air,

214
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,180
so you'd have to call it

215
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,220
stinky spam with over cheese.

216
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,220
Okay.

217
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,300
Stinky spam with uber cheese.

218
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,500
Oh, I didn't tell you guys.

219
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,740
I got an email the other day

220
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,960
that says I have a million bucks

221
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,180
waiting for me in a bank

222
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,820
in some African country.

223
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,540
Really?

224
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,440
Oh, well, you do.

225
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,020
It's just you can't collect it.

226
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,180
Oh, I'm going to click on...

227
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,860
Some other person.

228
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,860
I'm going to click right on that little link there.

229
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,960
I can't wait.

230
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,320
I can't wait to click on that link

231
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,800
that said I could get a million bucks.

232
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,420
Donate your entire family savings

233
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,220
to somebody who claims to be a prince

234
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,560
in a country where there are no...

235
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,980
haven't been any princes in 500 years either.

236
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,180
Oh, spongered.

237
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,480
He is spongered.

238
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,660
If you're eager enough to do that,

239
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,120
you're eager enough to be ripped off.

240
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,920
That's what he said,

241
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,220
but he thought he was a Jesus freak.

242
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,580
Meaning, I guess,

243
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,180
I don't know how he put this,

244
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,700
but he wanted to get freaky

245
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,840
with our Lord and Master.

246
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,440
He what?

247
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,380
He was freaky.

248
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,440
You know, he, you know, you know...

249
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,440
Getting jiggy with it?

250
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:30,820
Not Lord was.

251
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah.

252
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,100
I'm having more trouble

253
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,540
following this conversation

254
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,720
than I usually do.

255
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,220
Well, it's baseless to begin with,

256
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,720
so don't worry about it

257
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,340
because it has no moral foundation.

258
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,640
It just, like, goes out into the night

259
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,820
and the first vampire settler it finds

260
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,300
it will recombine

261
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,500
and bring back to the gallery.

262
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,760
I can't wait.

263
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,700
It could happen at any moment right now.

264
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,380
Now, the listeners might be vaguely able

265
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,840
to hear the injured dog back here

266
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,060
gnawing on his rawhide sheet.

267
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,840
It kind of clicks in his mouth here.

268
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,900
Let's turn the spongo off.

269
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,220
He's crunching away.

270
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,900
Buddy, stop your crunching

271
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,940
and just give it a few minutes.

272
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,280
He might have peed

273
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,680
while we weren't watching.

274
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,940
I've been so delighted to see him chewing

275
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:36,220
because now I think our little canine unit

276
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,240
is recovering to see him chew like that.

277
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,140
Listeners, I know that not all of you

278
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,320
care about our dog,

279
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,840
but he is the official guard dog

280
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,880
of the Subgenius Foundation headquarters,

281
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,720
the Mega Fist Temple.

282
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,580
And yesterday he got too much of a good thing.

283
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,760
We let him off the leash

284
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,860
so he could go out and hunt in the woods

285
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,760
and be a farm dog.

286
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,320
But unfortunately he decided to hunt in the woods

287
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,260
a mile south of here on somebody else's ranch,

288
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,460
among many other places.

289
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,300
And he ran from what we can tell

290
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,420
from my GPS tracking device.

291
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,560
He ran back and forth all over creation

292
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,700
for four hours.

293
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:22,920
Four hours.

294
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,280
Yesterday.

295
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,300
Then he did it again a couple hours later, Chase.

296
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,220
Started off chasing a squirrel.

297
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,880
For two more hours.

298
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,440
Yes.

299
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,220
And then he was fine when he came back,

300
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,500
we thought.

301
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,680
But this morning,

302
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,860
the little dog couldn't walk.

303
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,340
Hardly.

304
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,820
I mean, he can barely limp.

305
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,400
Yes, he's severely damaged the pads of his little paws.

306
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,580
Yeah, yeah.

307
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,220
He's hurting all over.

308
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,200
He's recovering.

309
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,580
He's got a dose of child psychology.

310
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,700
For all I know, he ran straight...

311
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,300
He got to eat it.

312
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,400
My example,

313
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,760
that would be my grandfather one time said,

314
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,420
you like apple cider?

315
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,360
And in your house with your parents and everything,

316
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,220
you have to share it with your sister and your mom and dad

317
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,540
and everything.

318
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,260
For my present to you,

319
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,840
I'm going to give you all the cider you want to drink.

320
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,620
So he got three gallons of cider, you know?

321
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,540
So I drank them all and I got the hives.

322
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,560
That's all you got?

323
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,040
You mean you didn't get the runs too?

324
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,740
My goodness.

325
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,100
Three gallons of cider?

326
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,140
Well, naturally the runs, but also the hives,

327
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,420
which I'd never seen before.

328
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,340
Good lord.

329
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,200
I spotted like two, two messences on my skin.

330
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,420
Two messences?

331
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,260
Yes.

332
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,040
He said two messences on his skin.

333
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,320
Two messences, yes.

334
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,560
Too much, man.

335
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,080
Too much two messences.

336
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,200
Too much two messences.

337
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,960
So I think, I think Buddy's going to like look out the window wishfully for, for another

338
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,480
day.

339
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,180
But I don't think he will.

340
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,800
I don't know.

341
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,300
Well, we'll take him to the vet tomorrow and have his little pads looked at.

342
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,000
We've been treating him with something.

343
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,640
Something like bag balm and, and, and, and just rest and relaxation.

344
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:08,820
But we, as far as we know, he has not actually peed all day unless he somehow did it when

345
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,500
we weren't looking.

346
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,080
Eh, it's possible.

347
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,840
It's possible, but it's so difficult for him to walk.

348
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,500
It's, it's hard to imagine him peeing actually.

349
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,940
Yeah, we need to get a little catheter or hospital urinal.

350
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,620
But I guess he might.

351
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,980
It's possible.

352
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,000
It's possible that he might have peed when we weren't looking.

353
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,300
We could hold him over the balcony and spray with, with him and see if he would spray while

354
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,020
we held him.

355
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,460
No, no.

356
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,460
Pointing outwards.

357
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:32,800
No, no, no.

358
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,560
Little boy wouldn't, he wouldn't spray like that.

359
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,580
It's the time, but the time of pee, that's really important.

360
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,960
It's the most important thing.

361
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,580
Well, he's going to pee.

362
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:42,580


363
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,680
He's a dog and he did what he was supposed to and now he knows he can't go outside and

364
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,220
go pee pee.

365
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,920
No, you know, I can logically.

366
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,960
He can't get up and do what he wants so he's not going to pee pee on the floor.

367
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:51,960


368
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,800
He's just going to hold it until he explodes.

369
00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:00,260
What's more important to you, eating and drinking or, or peeing?

370
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,620
Which one can you go without doing for the longest, Dave?

371
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,800
I think they're all equally important because without the little sunshine, there is no rain.

372
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,680
Meaning if you have to urinate when you're a little child and you're dancing around in

373
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,600
the rain and you pee your pants and you make everybody else think it's from walking through

374
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,060
puddles.

375
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,100
Dave, Dave, this is not, this is, it's not time for true confessions.

376
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,500
Okay.

377
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,560
I understand that, that, you know, you had an embarrassing childhood and that there's

378
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:37,300
certain traumatizing things caused you to be the way you are now, but let's not dwell

379
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,600
on these sorted, soaking subjects.

380
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,560
I've come back though in an eloquent way.

381
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,620
I'm making sense, aren't I?

382
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,260
Kind of.

383
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,820
In a lonesome cowboy, Dave way.

384
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,380
Yes.

385
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,380
Boy, I got the most, speaking of lonesome cowboy, Dave way, your wonderful book, neighbor

386
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:05,600
world was, is, is excellent and wonderful, but I got a detailed letter from a devoted

387
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,100
reader of that book that detail, he found a bunch of mistakes.

388
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,120
They weren't spelling mistakes or even typos.

389
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,820
Most of them, they were M dash.

390
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,680
They were amateurish M dashes.

391
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:21,940
Oh, yeah.

392
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,540
They were.

393
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:22,700


394
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,000
Two, two normal dashes instead of a proper M dash.

395
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:32,040
And inconsistent spacing between certain things.

396
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,080
Little layout things.

397
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:34,720
Wow.

398
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,700
Like where sentences appeared in the middle of the page instead of flush left.

399
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,780
He said, he showed me where to flush.

400
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:50,600
So I have to do a slightly different printing, nobody but this guy and would really notice

401
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,540
that sort of thing, but it's sort of subliminal.

402
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:00,060
You know, you have a person who reads a lot can tell, they may not even notice what it

403
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,260
is.

404
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,260
There's something a little amateurish about it.

405
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,120
I caught the cover typo on the back cover.

406
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,280
That's right.

407
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,960
I caught a cold.

408
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,320
I caught a cold too.

409
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,260
South by Southwest.

410
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,980
But I'm hopefully it's going to go away.

411
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,220
So what should I do then?

412
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,160
Because it's, most people are liking it despite the fact that it does have those things in

413
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,420
there.

414
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:20,580
Yeah.

415
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:20,580


416
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:20,580


417
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:20,580


418
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:20,580


419
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:20,580


420
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:20,580


421
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:20,580


422
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,320
Oh, nobody would never notice that.

423
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,120
I mean, they're not the kind of mistakes that any of us noticed.

424
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:25,620
Right.

425
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,800
I was in too big of a hurry to even think about it.

426
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,840
Anyway.

427
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,460
But the M dash is, don't you think?

428
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,480
Oh, it's easy enough to fix.

429
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,820
This guy has already found all the spots.

430
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,600
I'm sure he didn't miss a one.

431
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,460
It was so unbelievably thorough.

432
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,100
I mean, it was really, really nuts.

433
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,860
Oh, speak about nuts and really thorough.

434
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,400
Fernando.

435
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:54,340
Fernando Nandy Lee Merr sent me a link to a video on Vimeo, which I'm going to play

436
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:03,280
because it's well, this, this video was an hour and a half long, which is the length

437
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,580
of the original movie.

438
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:10,200
It was edited from the wizard of Oz, the classic wizard of Oz movie.

439
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:17,300
But this one is called Oz of the wizard or something because it's all in alphabetical

440
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:17,800
order.

441
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,640
Every time someone said the word a that's at the very beginning of the movie.

442
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:32,400
I, I, I, I, it goes alphabetically up to, and you know, and there's plenty of those.

443
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,880
It goes up to, oh, brains is a really good section.

444
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,420
If you can imagine they, they refer to brains a lot.

445
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:40,860
Yes.

446
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,240
And, uh, yeah, yeah.

447
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:45,400


448
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,200
I it's impossible.

449
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:47,280


450
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,400
That's not possible to imagine from my description.

451
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,400
So I'm.

452
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,860
Playing a little chunk of it right now actually doesn't show up.

453
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,460
Also, I'm playing aaby this show that I was playing and I said people have made early

454
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,620
let's show you what the pick up line, the escalator run, right?

455
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:01,620


456
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,500

And that was...

493
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,600
I'll have to insert the name of the piece.

494
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:19,020
It's called Of Oz the Wizard by Matt Busi, spelled B-U-C-Y.

495
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:30,020
If you Google or search Vimeo Of Oz the Wizard, it'll pop right up.

496
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,580
It's a movie, but it sounds insane.

497
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,980
You'll see what I mean.

498
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:36,760
It's the most...

499
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,500
I mean, I thought that I've done some...

500
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,740
really OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder-type editing.

501
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,580
And I thought Susie the Flusie had beat me a billion times over.

502
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,980
This is the most OCD thing in the universe

503
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,180
and actually proves that obsessive-compulsive disorder is,

504
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,720
as I've been saying, not a disorder, but in fact a superpower.

505
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,700
A superpower.

506
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,260
Yes.

507
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,280
I thought he was saying it was like a Fidendish underpower.

508
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,760
When the Flash hit me and said,

509
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,740
now, what was your superpower?

510
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,700
I said obsessive-compulsive talent.

511
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,400
And then I said it a hundred times more.

512
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:15,980
OCT.

513
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,540
And that's what sold her.

514
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,840
No, this was the Flash that I said.

515
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,900
Oh, I thought it was the last branding attempt

516
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,520
when you were sending out all them goofy-looking flyers

517
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,300
and you went online with that old separate site.

518
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:30,980
What was it called?

519
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,180
Church of the...

520
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,420
Church of the...

521
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,800
Church of the...

522
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:37,360


523
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,780
Church of the...

524
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,020
Church of the...

525
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,020
Church of the...

526
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,020
Church of the...

527
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,320
Church of the...

528
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,600
Church of the...

529
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,580
Church of the Cinnabon.

530
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,900
I bet there is one.

531
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,000
I bet there's Cinnabar and them golden hills of New Asia

532
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,520
where we all get neuralgitis and so forth

533
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,700
and have many kinds of, you know,

534
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,160
terrible, terrible psychological disorders

535
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,620
nowadays the way things are.

536
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,360
Or maybe they're not that way, but they still are.

537
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,400
Cinnabar and the...

538
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,880
They're them, they're him.

539
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:17,220
Like what if you were just like having a regular day and you were going to your school or something and the vampire appeared?

540
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,000
The grand pirate?

541
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,580
The grand pirate, Henry Lascaux.

542
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,480
He was, well, he resembled a Nartichoke.

543
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,080
Yeah, a Nartichoke.

544
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,860
Hey, buddy, the crippled dog got up and he's limping.

545
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,460
Over to you.

546
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,920
He's limping, you know, he's limping away from us, wagging his tail.

547
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
It may be time.

548
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,860
It may be the mighty time of pee.

549
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,600
It might be the time of pee.

550
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,020
Princess Wee, maybe you better go check it out.

551
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,540
I will follow him.

552
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,740
I'd hate to put all of the listeners on pause for all that dead air that would take if we both had to go out there.

553
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,960
You two carry on.

554
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,300
Yeah.

555
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,520
All of Captain Hoare.

556
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:56,940
Yes.

557
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,180
Well, I'll try not to carry on, but I think that's a good sign that old buddy's getting up there and he wants to go explore it a little bit.

558
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,900
His feet are feeling a little better.

559
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,500
He's knowing how to react properly, not jumping up around and ripping his pads.

560
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,680
And I think that's just, that's your business, man.

561
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,740
It has nothing to do with me.

562
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:32,780
I'm afraid that if she doesn't take him out there on a leash, it's possible that if he sees a squirrel, he'll forget, or any night varmint, more likely it'd be a raccoon or an armadillo, he would instantly forget his pain.

563
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,860
Until he had his...

564
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,220
He could taste the blood of that varmint.

565
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,320
Because he's the opposite of Bob.

566
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,020
Are you sure you're not being a little poetic?

567
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,120
You've got to think of...

568
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,980
I hope I am.

569
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,060
...children and less like, you know, Ulysses and the voyage of Sinbad and stuff like that.

570
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,340
Oh, I don't know.

571
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,420
No, you haven't seen this dog hunt.

572
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,800
He's ferocious.

573
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,660
He wants to rip the throats out of them varmints, I think.

574
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,580
Actually, I'm not sure if he even knows what he's supposed to do with it.

575
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,740
But he is a sub...

576
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,640
As I said, he is a subgenius dog.

577
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:27,240
And now my friend, the Rudy Schwartz Project, told me that his sister-in-law's dog was almost eaten by a coyote just last week, less than 100 miles from where I live.

578
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,280
I've got to ask, how do you get almost eaten?

579
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,840
How much of you is eaten before...

580
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,340
Before you're basically eaten?

581
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,580
I mean, and what happens to you when you're only partially eaten?

582
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,980
Well, one of my son's dogs was bit by a coyote.

583
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,440
And he's been on the leg and they had to go to the vet.

584
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,920
They got the coyote out of there.

585
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,640
But he had taken a little...

586
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,140
A little chew and he managed to escape somehow.

587
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:58,760
I don't know.

588
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:04,240
Well, you know, the thing is, it's risky to let Buddy...

589
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,940
Run around unsupervised out in this ranch land.

590
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,820
There's all kinds of dangers.

591
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:20,040
Snakes, coyotes, traps, feral hogs, mean rednecks, you name it.

592
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,300
Or cops.

593
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,940
I thought those were interchangeable.

594
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,660
Feral hogs and mean rednecks.

595
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,200
Feral redneck cops.

596
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,680
All kinds of terrible things.

597
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,280
And...

598
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,620
But...

599
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,940
Do I really...

600
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,660
Really want to...

601
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,420
Deny this hunting dog who was bred to hunt?

602
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,320
Deny him the thing that is in his blood?

603
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,720
It would be like telling a subgenius,

604
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,780
No, you must not have slack.

605
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,900
It really would.

606
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,720
It's like it takes away...

607
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,200
It might take away my slack if he lost a leg or his life.

608
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,940
But keeping him prisoner would...

609
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,860
It seems like would be even worse.

610
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,800
Given the circumstances.

611
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,620
Now, if he was a city dog, it wouldn't even come up.

612
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,480
But...

613
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,020
My father had a dozen dogs over the centuries that ran around loose.

614
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,460
And...

615
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,400
Well, now come to think of it, one time...

616
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,460
Old Dammit came back after two days with scars around his neck because he'd been in a trap.

617
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,880
Gus died of a rattlesnake bite.

618
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,220
But most of them did okay.

619
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,300
Skunks.

620
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,140
One of these days.

621
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,460
But he's going to come back stinking.

622
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,820
You're going to need the tomato juice then.

623
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,700
I heard that too.

624
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,820
And rub it in and then wash it all out.

625
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,820
Because the skunk spray is oily.

626
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,840
It doesn't just wash off with normal water.

627
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:01,960
Yeah.

628
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,460
That was what I...

629
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:04,720
I heard.

630
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,440
See, I'm just...

631
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,220
I'm just learning.

632
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,120
I heard that one too.

633
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,580
I heard that Dawn is not only a lovely dishwashing display.

634
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,720
It's also an eloquent way for dogs to have their skunk removed.

635
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,860
And it makes the...

636
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:22,080
If it's the Dawn liquid that's made in Mexico as opposed to the United States,

637
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,560
it's the best stuff for blowing bubbles.

638
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,560
And I was told that by the Naked Bubble Man at Starwood.

639
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,900
Who would run around professionally blowing bubbles while naked.

640
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,020
So...

641
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,760
Well, that's rather childish.

642
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,020
There you go.

643
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:43,460
We just did a product placement for Mexican-made bottles of Dawn detergent.

644
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,900
And by the way, I'm not a shareholder, so it's okay.

645
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,760
And also, you're not looking for a Mexican maid,

646
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,540
so you're not a pathological liar or a socialistic pariah.

647
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,740
I can't afford a maid of any kind.

648
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,500
I've had quite a few people ask if they could be our maid or help us out here.

649
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,360
And it's like, well...

650
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,240
You mean you want to get paid, right?

651
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:06,680
Well, yeah.

652
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,840
I don't need much.

653
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,600
Well, I'm not getting paid much.

654
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,300
So I'm doing it.

655
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm the maid.

656
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,660
You're not going to take away my job?

657
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,640
You're just too bad about the rubber diesels and all that stuff.

658
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:18,980
Yeah, man.

659
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,400
I'm a self-made man.

660
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,880
I made myself lunch at one point.

661
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,100
I'm a subgenius.

662
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,600
I live independently as much as I can.

663
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,580
Although I prefer it when Princess Wee...

664
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,440
Cooks a great big omelette, of course.

665
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,780
Does she bake them?

666
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,820
I thought it was just kind of a whim and a fancy

667
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,380
that she put together like a third novel about the neurologist getting married again.

668
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,760
Her every omelette is completely different from every other omelette that she made.

669
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,360
That's what we say in philosophy class, too.

670
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,780
It's, yeah, it's scientific.

671
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,340
Make the omelette different every single time.

672
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,340
I mean, at least you can prove it.

673
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,540
When you have the old er-ca-ga-do, er-ga-do, some con-con-regationer.

674
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,280
Hey, I don't want to talk religion, man.

675
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,180
Sillyism.

676
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,680
I don't want to talk about religion on this.

677
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,540
I don't want to talk about your religion on this religious show.

678
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,520
We only talk about our religion.

679
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,760
Our shared religion, Church of the Subgenius.

680
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,520
That's the only one we ever talk about.

681
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,520
Because all the rest of them are stupid.

682
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,620
Because they believe all kinds of silly stuff.

683
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:34,340
And they don't know that the exes are going to arrive from Planet X on July 5th.

684
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:34,940
1998.

685
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:40,720
Destroy the world except for the dues paying, uh, sub-faithful subgeniuses under Bob.

686
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,640
But it sometimes always happens.

687
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,240
And other times it never happens, but it's still happening.

688
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:53,040
So that's why the most of fashion is spaghetti like, um, what they call string theory.

689
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,640
Of the whole con- conglagery.

690
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,900
Gets together and makes the Church of the Subgenius your, your very best buy when it comes to, um, uh, what is it again?

691
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:14,160
I don't trust the string theory ver- uh, version of Slack because, I mean, it might be correct and everything, but I'm just taking their word for it.

692
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,200
I can't do that math.

693
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,920
I never will be able to do that math.

694
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,840
I'll always just be taking their word for that stuff.

695
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,500
And I don't, you see, necessarily.

696
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,720
Yeah, me, me, I understand.

697
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:30,940
I should never pose the question, but I thought if I was going to pose naked, at least you should hear about it.

698
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,180
While blowing bubbles, yeah.

699
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,340
Yeah.

700
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,340
If you don't pose naked.

701
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:34,340


702
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,800
If you don't pose naked, unless you're blowing bubbles.

703
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,080
With Mexican Dawn dishwasher.

704
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,380
You're scared of your own body, but, um, I don't know.

705
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,920
I don't know.

706
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,280
Being bare naked all the time can be cold.

707
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,560
Well, it depends on where you are.

708
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,080
Well, I mean, I'm not talking about the Arctic Circle.

709
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,480
I'm talking about, like, uh, Cuba Libre, Francois.

710
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,220
Now, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, does it change the way you are thinking of?

711
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,440
Yes, it does.

712
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,020
Yeah, I think it does change the way you're saying it.

713
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:20,320
Since when did everything whas so complicated?...

714
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,700
Oh, that is up to you, Mr. S.

715
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,760
So I guess I mean, the more than agora you're older.

716
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:32,060
The more than I remember now is the same offers from the �ittCh south Pacific Sindh,

717
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,300
the Simtsos.

718
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:34,300


719
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:34,300


720
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,340
Its awesome.

721
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,280
It's un-ponged me.

722
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:42,360
I went ahead and shaved my neck as well.

723
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,880
Well, it's good if you want to expose the bite marks,

724
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:52,080
but I think a person in your renal condition of being, once again, a midnight vampire,

725
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,440
to have four bite marks on your neck that are clearly visible, all red and skanky looking,

726
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:05,220
does not speak to the absurdum or belie the aborigine of...

727
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,220
You know what I mean?

728
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,400
Yes, what you said.

729
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,040
I agree completely.

730
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,060
I couldn't have said it better.

731
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,760
I don't care.

732
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:25,080
But seriously, does it change the way you, the listener, or Dave, think about me,

733
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,220
knowing that I might be sitting here?

734
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,280
Just dangling in the wind, as it were.

735
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,160
Well, I would hope that it would liberate many of our listening audience

736
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:43,780
and get them up to do what the young kids did in the end of March,

737
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,940
whatever that was this year,

738
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,960
when they marched on the Washington, on the snake house there.

739
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,220
And I think that's the same feeling of ferocious...

740
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,860
Was that the take away our guns march?

741
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,880
Yeah, that was the take away our guns march.

742
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,680
Oh, man.

743
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,280
Well, at least that's what I've been calling for.

744
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,340
You know, they were threatening my life.

745
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,100
They said, if you ever say anything about guns,

746
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,500
other than they're a lot of fun to play with,

747
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,020
we would kill you.

748
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,460
So I said, well, guns are a lot of fun to play with.

749
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,640
They are.

750
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,200
Although I haven't really been doing much.

751
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,280
Princess, we played with a gun more recently than I did.

752
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,140
But, listener, let me ask you this, listener Dave.

753
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,460
How does it change the way you think of the show if I tell you,

754
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,980
no, I was lying.

755
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,700
I always put on armor as soon as I get out of bed.

756
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,260
I'm armored up within seconds after...

757
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,380
My feet have never touched the ground, essentially.

758
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,800
They're shod before I ever leave the bed.

759
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,040
You wear large metallic boots, you're saying?

760
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,600
But here's the important part.

761
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,560
Princess, we.

762
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,940
Is always nude when she does the show.

763
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,560
Oh, well, I was hoping for somebody.

764
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,440
Remember when I said that before?

765
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,900
I was hoping at least one of you had the audacity

766
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,480
and the cruel nervous nerve power

767
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,280
to just rip off all those embodiments of Western Euro-civilization

768
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,400
and be a Paleolithic person who we assume

769
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,380
because all we ever see are illustrations and books and stuff

770
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,880
because we can't really see what a Paleolithic person looks like.

771
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,240
But we can imagine them, you know, like stabbing a huge mammoth with a stick.

772
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,640
Well, they basically look like Princess We looks right now.

773
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,760
Hey, was it the tawn?

774
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,300
It was the mighty tawn.

775
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,240
It was?

776
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:41,880
Yes.

777
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,560
Oh, good.

778
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,540
Yes, he came for about one full minute.

779
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,700
Uh-huh.

780
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,440
He was packing a mean load, that dog was.

781
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,860
Friends, I don't know if you could hear Princess We,

782
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,940
but I know this is important to our radio listeners,

783
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,480
but...

784
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,420
Come on.

785
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,420


786
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,420


787
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,420


788
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,420


789
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,420


790
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,420


791
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,420


792
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,420


793
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,420


794
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,420


795
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,420


796
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,420


797
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,420


798
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,420


799
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,420


800
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,340
Buddy, the limping dog who had too much of a good thing,

801
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:02,920
has peed.

802
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,500
And we don't mean Buddy Rich, the world-famous drummer and asinine DJ.

803
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,340
That means we can sleep a lot more easily tonight.

804
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,220
Or you can just crawl into a corner somewhere

805
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,040
and get into an argument with a baby scorpion.

806
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,180
Well, we know...

807
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,520
Oh, that happens every day here in Texas.

808
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,020
I got in an argument with a wasp today.

809
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,120
For the first time...

810
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,600
Possibly ever.

811
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,900
I'm not sure if I've ever been stung by the big red wasps that we get.

812
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And when I say big, they're damn big.

813
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,160
They are damn big.

814
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:42,940
They're over...

815
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,580
About an inch long.

816
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,640
Oh, no.

817
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,540
They're more like two inches.

818
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,220
I wouldn't say...

819
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,840
From the bottom of their little feet.

820
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,120
Across their wings, maybe.

821
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,680
But wings, you know...

822
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,300
They're huge.

823
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,020
These things fly around my face all the time.

824
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,160
And they never bother me.

825
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,560
And I know I've never bothered them.

826
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:05,720
But today, one was perched on a doorknob on the underneath.

827
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,820
And I didn't see it.

828
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,860
And my hand touched the doorknob and the wasp.

829
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,440
And he stung my thumb.

830
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,660
And it hurt for about five minutes.

831
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,220
And then it kind of went away.

832
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,320
But you know what, Princess Wee?

833
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,200
I think he left a little part of his stinger.

834
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:20,600
Yeah.

835
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,700
Which makes me feel terrible.

836
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:27,100
I hope he doesn't die just because he had to attack me.

837
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,760
I hope he doesn't die, too.

838
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,720
Some bugs do.

839
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,300
For some insects, stinging is a suicide.

840
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:34,980
Yes.

841
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,600
Comma causa.

842
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,820
They rip their asses off when they're going after you.

843
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,560
Oh, man.

844
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,020
I'll tell you, the government's been ripping my ass off my whole life.

845
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,620
Which government stings?

846
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,680
They're all stinging all the time.

847
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,520
And all it does is just rips my ass off.

848
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,960
Which government?

849
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,460
Are you talking about Peru or Bolivia or...

850
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:56,820
Peru.

851
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,320
Norway?

852
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,160
The Perot government.

853
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,560
Why can't they all be from Norway?

854
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,360
The...

855
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:01,760
Yeah.

856
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,760
H. Ross Perot.

857
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,640
The guy who's been president for the last 35 years, man.

858
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,180
He likes Norway, too.

859
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,920
President for life, Perot.

860
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,580
The general, we call him.

861
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,020
The dictator.

862
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,540
El jefe.

863
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,420
El original.

864
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,240
We'd be a lot better off if that had happened, actually.

865
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,200
At least he had some sense.

866
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,680
His science museum in Dallas is...

867
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:27,320
Excellent.

868
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,400
It's excellent.

869
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,320
It's a little more excellent if you work for oil companies because it just has the most

870
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,640
glowing room full of the wonders of fracking.

871
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,380
Yes.

872
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,820
And there's even a cowboy singing about how fracking is great, but it worries some folks

873
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,380
too much.

874
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,700
Yes, it's a museum with a bit of an agenda.

875
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:55,620
Well, but it has better fossils than we have, but not as good as the Texas Memorial Museum.

876
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,280
Dave.

877
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:03,680
When we went to Austin to help with the movie a little bit and coincidentally go to parties

878
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:12,760
and hide from a mad bomber and catch a cold, we went to the Texas Memorial Museum on the

879
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:19,620
University of Texas campus, which has a huge collection of marine fossils from Texas, which

880
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:25,400
is the most boring subject for many people in the world because most Texas fossils are

881
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,260
actually taken.

882
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:26,780
Tiny.

883
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,560
But not for us.

884
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,320
We were excited.

885
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:37,120
Oh, it was like, well, I had to clean up at one point.

886
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,680
It was just so thrilling.

887
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:43,400
They had five drawers labeled Glen Rose Formation.

888
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,960
That doesn't mean they were gathered in Glen Rose or named.

889
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:54,500
It's a level of fossiliciousness that's strewn across Texas that is named after our area.

890
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,260
Oh, my God.

891
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:56,260


892
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:56,360
Oh, my God.

893
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,880
But you can find them all over.

894
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,300
Geological standard.

895
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,600
They are boring.

896
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,120
Standard meaning.

897
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,120
It's like these are what we're mostly talking about when I say fossils.

898
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,520
They're casts of snails and clams and corals and stuff.

899
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,880
Stuff that's actually still around in the ocean.

900
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,180
How boring.

901
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,180
Texas is supposed to be famous for everything being big, right?

902
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,600
Well, you know what's not big?

903
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,600
The deer.

904
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,760
They're about the size of Buddy.

905
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:25,740
They're tiny.

906
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,720
They're like a white-tailed deer.

907
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,800
They're really small.

908
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,540
They are small.

909
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,180
And the fossils.

910
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,920
I mean, sure, there's a few dinosaur fossils.

911
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:38,700
There's actually been quite a few excellent giant dinosaur fossils found in Texas and

912
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,540
lots of mammoths.

913
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,480
But most of them are smaller than your thumb.

914
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,540
Of course, I have a kind of a thing about life forms that are really small because they're

915
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,380
monsters too.

916
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,920
There are still monsters.

917
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,200
I thought you were ashamed of your thumb or something like that.

918
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,380
Isn't that the story you tried to tell me one time?

919
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:03,320
Back when you were a vampire hookup girl, you said you had like your thumb looked like it

920
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,040
was like one of Buddy's paws or something like that.

921
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,440
Yeah, it bends the wrong way.

922
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,760
It bends the opposite of the way it's supposed to bend.

923
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,480
It bends back.

924
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,280
Yeah, it bends back instead of forwards, which makes it...

925
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,800
That's why I throw like a girl and other things.

926
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,020
What does a girl throw like?

927
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:23,420
Me.

928
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,520
Oh, okay.

929
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,200
Yeah, I masturbate like a girl.

930
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,440
Not like a baseball pitcher.

931
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:31,460
Well, I masturbate like a baseball pitcher too.

932
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,300
It won't be the first time.

933
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,660
Others masturbate like a basketball player.

934
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,960
That's a little faster and more active.

935
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,620
Yeah, that's what I was hoping for, but I was only 9'5".

936
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:48,500
There's ones that do it like a soccer player and they only use their feet and head.

937
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,720
Yeah, and they're like 5'9".

938
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,500
We don't really need to get into that.

939
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:54,500


940
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:54,500


941
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,340
We're going to do a measuring contest.

942
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,020
Yeah, never mind that.

943
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,980
See, like I said, this is a religious show, Church Is So Genius.

944
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:05,560
We got to remember to talk about Bob, our guru, our leader.

945
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,320
You know, the guy that said all that wise stuff we kind of forgot.

946
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,240
Pipeface.

947
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,580
Yeah, Pipeface.

948
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,500
Old Pipeface.

949
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,340
Bob makes no claims on divinity, does he, whatsoever.

950
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,700
He's just like an avatar for one particular period of time.

951
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:20,380
Oh, no.

952
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,560
Well, he's buddies with all the true gods.

953
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,500
The old gods as well as the new gods.

954
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,460
The vanda gods.

955
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,460
You know, he wheels and deals with them.

956
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,080
He's a glad hander, you know.

957
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:38,620
He's like, in fact, except for the pipe, the omnipresent and ubiquitous pipe, one might

958
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:42,260
say that he is very much like our current Pete POTUS.

959
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:43,680
What?

960
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,520
Is he like our...

961
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:52,160
Well, you know, Pete, there's a huge difference between Bob and President Trump.

962
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,620
Okay, they're both stupid.

963
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,320
What?

964
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,260
Oh, yeah.

965
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,020
Okay, right.

966
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,540
You know, a lot of people have said, well, Trump's just like Bob.

967
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,080
I mean, he's the stupidest guy in the whole world.

968
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,300
No, actually, Bob is.

969
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:07,320
And he's totally lucky because he never had to do a lick of work his whole life and just

970
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,460
everything comes to him.

971
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:16,420
I'm not sure that the way his attitude projects sounds lucky to me.

972
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:24,300
It sounds to me like he lives in a petty prison of bitterness and vindictiveness.

973
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,560
And no slack at all.

974
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,220
Who, Dobbs or Trump?

975
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,440
Trump.

976
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:40,620
False slack is not really better than true slack because it's not slack at all.

977
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:47,160
And I don't detect any slack radiating from Donald Trump.

978
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,500
Just the opposite.

979
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,600
Whereas Bob glows with the power of slack.

980
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,000
He's keeping it all for himself, but still he's an inspiration and he's smiling.

981
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:57,620
Yes.

982
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,300
That's a really big difference.

983
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,540
He doesn't have a puckered rectum for a mouth.

984
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,340
He has a great big wide mouth with a big pipe in it.

985
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:15,480
And crinkly eyes from grinning madly all the time.

986
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,240
Yes.

987
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,660
That'll never make up for the rectum part there.

988
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,580
So, Bob Dobbs for Work.

989
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,420
World Overlord.

990
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,240
Don't stop it, President.

991
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,760
Actually, you know, we were selling a button.

992
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:37,260
We sell a button that says, that Leamer invented, that says, don't blame me, I voted for Bob.

993
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:37,760
Yes.

994
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:42,680
Well, this was one of those elections where if you voted for Bob, I do blame you.

995
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,160
Yeah.

996
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,380
Di acquerto, signore.

997
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,520
I'm with you.

998
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,520
Blame is important.

999
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:52,560


1000
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,260
Blame is important, of course.

1001
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,840
Blame is what makes the world go round.

1002
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,120
Blame is what keeps people joining religions.

1003
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:02,340
They always have somebody else to blame besides themselves.

1004
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:09,820
Yeah, but humans are always comparing themselves to perfection and it doesn't exist, at least

1005
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,960
as far as their own perceptions of perfection go.

1006
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:19,000
There's no such thing as perfection, except for the perfect slack of Bob.

1007
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:20,460
Right.

1008
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,500
That's what I meant all along.

1009
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,080
Yeah, I know you did.

1010
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,200
Sure you did.

1011
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:31,420
I was just reaching for a compliment, mostly, but that's pretty much the psychological underpinning

1012
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,500
of what I was trying to say.

1013
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,240
P, T, Z.

1014
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,160
Now, there is perfect pipe placement.

1015
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,780
That was some hard P's on this.

1016
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,800
It is a time of P when you use these microphones that way.

1017
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,480
I have trouble keeping my P's, P's off the microphone.

1018
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,440
Thanks, P's.

1019
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1020
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1021
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1022
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1023
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1024
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1025
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1026
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1027
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1028
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1029
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1030
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1031
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1032
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1033
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1034
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,440


1035
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,280
Way to go, P's.

1036
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,400
Oh, he's going to hear this show, Reverend P's going to hear this show and think it's

1037
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:56,960
all about him.

1038
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,860
I say it's my time of P's.

1039
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,460
Well, it is all about him.

1040
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,320
I haven't noticed any post-its coming out of my rear end for the last half an hour, so

1041
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,620
I don't know what you're talking about.

1042
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:18,980
Hey, the movie folks got in touch with Reverend Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller, who eagerly

1043
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,420
told them that he'd love to be a director.

1044
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:20,460
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1045
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:20,460


1046
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:20,460


1047
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,020
Well, he wanted to talk on camera with us.

1048
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:28,940
He wanted me and Philo there, so I guess we're going to get a trip to Las Vegas.

1049
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,360
That'll be great.

1050
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,980
Of course, all I care about is the Science Museum and Death Valley, Valley of Fire.

1051
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,240
I thought you were going to say the Sloth Fiend.

1052
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:45,360
Well, I don't mind talking to TV stars that I super admire, speaking of which.

1053
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,420
I don't agree with that.

1054
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:57,080
I don't agree with Penn about everything, but he has tricked me so many times and then

1055
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,940
came clean about it.

1056
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:07,940
Just by using that show they did, that show, Bullshit, the one I'll have to censor for

1057
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,920
college radio of all things.

1058
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,040
Of all things?

1059
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,080
Yeah, college radio.

1060
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,120
In colleges, did you know they aren't allowed to cuss, but they have to talk about Karl

1061
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:18,500
Marx?

1062
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,600
That's what every class in every college is about.

1063
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:28,780
Now, I don't remember it ever being mentioned anywhere in any college classes I was in,

1064
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,600
but that was a long time ago.

1065
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:36,000
Nor do I, although I did take a Soviet studies class one time to see what all the big hubdub

1066
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:42,720
was about, and I was chased around by a rumor's pair of nurse-like LPN ants for the last 25

1067
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:43,960
foot years.

1068
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,860
What college was that?

1069
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,160
How much does it cost to get in?

1070
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,520
I want to do that.

1071
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,220
It's Hemstron.

1072
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,340
You've heard of Hofstra, of course, I'm sure.

1073
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,200
Hofstra?

1074
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,380
It's called Hemstron.

1075
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,480
Hemstron.

1076
00:51:53,620 --> 00:52:00,600
And it's the product of a nervous basement, a couple of ultra-Freudian and Jungian psychotherapists,

1077
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:09,400
both of whom are now deceased, who've become ubermensch.

1078
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,060
I know nothing of this Hemstron.

1079
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,180
Well, of course you couldn't.

1080
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,480
Because you just made it up just off the top of your head.

1081
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,700
You did not.

1082
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,860
He's telling us facts.

1083
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:21,340
I did.

1084
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:21,940
She did.

1085
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,400
Dave traffics in alternative facts.

1086
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,760
Not like me.

1087
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,940
The forbidden scientist clown.

1088
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,840
I think we're both fake news philanderers.

1089
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:36,880
I think we all are.

1090
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:41,980
Because everything is, you know, the re-kerneling of truth.

1091
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,980
Everything that we believe in is what we believe in, you know?

1092
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,760
No, man.

1093
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,100
No, science is true.

1094
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:48,460
No, man.

1095
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1096
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1097
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1098
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1099
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1100
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1101
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1102
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1103
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1104
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1105
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1106
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1107
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1108
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1109
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1110
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:48,460


1111
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:48,900
No, man.

1112
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:49,420
No, man.

1113
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:55,180
I just read a rant by a subgenius, maybe on this show, maybe not, I don't know, depends,

1114
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:04,540
that was about the problems with science and how it steals slack from you.

1115
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,680
It was beautifully written.

1116
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:15,040
I completely disagree with almost every single sentence in it for the very reasons he's griping about.

1117
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,120
Objective realism.

1118
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:18,460
Which is?

1119
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,640
Which I'm kind of hooked on.

1120
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,320
Because I know it.

1121
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,180
You see?

1122
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,760
Now, see, he thinks that's...

1123
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,220
Unknown caller.

1124
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,500
Unknown caller?

1125
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:27,600
No.

1126
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,360
No, how do I...

1127
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,360
There's somebody trying to interrupt me.

1128
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,580
Do I hold and accept or do I end?

1129
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,700
I'll end and accept.

1130
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,240
No, I'll send a voicemail.

1131
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:38,600
That's it.

1132
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,340
So nobody ever calls me.

1133
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,420
I don't know how to handle stuff like when I'm already talking to one person.

1134
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,640
It's the telemarketers thing.

1135
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,520
We all have them.

1136
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,440
So just relax and pull your pants up.

1137
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:48,440


1138
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:48,440


1139
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:48,440


1140
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:48,440


1141
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:48,440


1142
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:48,440


1143
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,060
Pull your pants down and turn around the other way.

1144
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,100
I mean, that almost never happens.

1145
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,240
I'm on the phone to somebody.

1146
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,640
I'm not on the phone much.

1147
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,320
I'm completely deaf.

1148
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,360
Well, could you be wrong number?

1149
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,360
Listeners, if you ever wondered why this show seems to not make much sense...

1150
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,400
When that happens to me, I just hang up the call.

1151
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,200
Call declined.

1152
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,220
Call declined, yes.

1153
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,640
Well, it didn't say your number.

1154
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,300
I usually wait a while and leave them in with some spurious banter.

1155
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,420
And then I burst out.

1156
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:18,420


1157
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:18,420


1158
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:18,420


1159
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:18,420


1160
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:18,420


1161
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:18,420


1162
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:18,420


1163
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,600
I burp real loud and chuckle and hang up on them.

1164
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,700
Hey, speaking of serious banter, I think it's time for this part of the show to end.

1165
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:28,760
Well, that's a serious banter.

1166
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,620
It seems like we just started with Dave.

1167
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,280
Where's the spurious banter?

1168
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,240
No, we didn't just start with Dave, actually.

1169
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,540
I've been recording for 41 minutes, although he...

1170
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:42,420
And that started when Dave came back from getting his chair.

1171
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:47,180
That doesn't include Dave going to get his chair or you going to get your watch.

1172
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,340
Which only took two minutes.

1173
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,460
At the last minute.

1174
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,960
Which we automatically assumed it took 22 minutes.

1175
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:56,340
Or me doing that guy's rant when I was supposed to be calling Dave.

1176
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:01,520
It's almost like subgeniuses can't stick to a schedule or something.

1177
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,360
Something like that.

1178
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,100
Well, our little dog does stick to a schedule and when he has the time, the big time of

1179
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,740
pee, he does go and pee.

1180
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,100
Well, don't we, most of us do that?

1181
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,880
One way or another.

1182
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:22,880
Now, if you're at a concert, you got to wait in line for five hours after 10 beers.

1183
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,660
That's pretty serious.

1184
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,360
Yeah, it looks so smelly in there and stuff and people urinate on the floor.

1185
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,520
They never shake twice.

1186
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,120
They just like walk away.

1187
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,700
Oh, you've been to the Euclid Tavern.

1188
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:32,840
Yeah.

1189
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:33,420
Yeah.

1190
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:33,980
Perfect.

1191
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:37,620
It's just that our little canine unit hadn't gone for over 24 hours.

1192
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,180
That's all.

1193
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,700
The Euclid Tavern was sad though.

1194
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,480
It was so bad.

1195
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:42,960
It was.

1196
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,940
Oh, it was the worst.

1197
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,040
Are they going to close these people down?

1198
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:47,860
Oh, they are.

1199
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:47,860


1200
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:47,860


1201
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:47,860


1202
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:47,860


1203
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:47,860


1204
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:47,860


1205
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:53,480
It was closed down a long time ago because the guy who inherited it kind of forgot to

1206
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,160
renew the liquor license over and over again.

1207
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,680
That's what I heard.

1208
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,720
Well, that's important when you have a bar.

1209
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,480
You got to make sure you forget to-

1210
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,660
That was a shame because, I mean, Einstein's Secret Orchestra, the band you were in, played

1211
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,480
there a lot and I ranted there too.

1212
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,940
Oh, they weren't the only ones.

1213
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,400
That was a great place to go.

1214
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:12,720
Yeah.

1215
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,820
Yeah, they shot that movie, The Light of Day, there too.

1216
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:16,420
Remember that?

1217
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,240
Yes.

1218
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,780
I don't know anything of it.

1219
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,420
Pat Benatar.

1220
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,220
Actually, I think Howard the Duck may have been shot in there, partly.

1221
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:23,820
Partly.

1222
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,160
No.

1223
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,260
It was shot in Sacramento.

1224
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:28,640
Sacramento?

1225
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:29,700
Playing Cleveland?

1226
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,780
That's fake news.

1227
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:31,800
I know.

1228
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,320
How dare they?

1229
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,380
And the lake they had there, instead of being like a real great lake, it's like this

1230
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:38,420
pond that the average person would think of as a lake and stuff.

1231
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:44,340
And they showed these real like jack in the box, I'm advertising, never mind that.

1232
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,860
But they played all these, showed all these L.A. movies.

1233
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:47,860


1234
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,100
And I mean, they became a thing.

1235
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:48,100


1236
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:53,440
scenes, and it's like California scenes and they're supposed to be Cleveland or something.

1237
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:58,440
Well now, you know, they use Cleveland for New York and Washington and D.C. all the time.

1238
00:56:58,580 --> 00:56:58,800
Indeed.

1239
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:04,040
Those Marvel movies, the action street scenes are all shot in Cleveland because it's so

1240
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:04,500
old.

1241
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:05,800
Yeah.

1242
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,120
And looks like New York in a few places.

1243
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:13,460
And it's much, much cheaper to fill them in because it's full of starving Ohioans.

1244
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,040
Yes, that's the story.

1245
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:21,640
You know, I was watching Captain America.

1246
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,040
He was telling somebody, oh, this is a secret lab here.

1247
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:25,980
It's like, no, it's not.

1248
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,260
That's the dam over at Lakeview Cemetery.

1249
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,840
He's trying to kill.

1250
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:35,160
And Captain Kirk's running around going, oh, we're inside the engine room of the Enterprise.

1251
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,980
No, that's an abandoned brewery in Cleveland.

1252
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,380
That's not the Batcave.

1253
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:46,140
That's another abandoned brewery in Cleveland.

1254
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:46,520
God.

1255
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,840
Which movie was this in now?

1256
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,140
All of them.

1257
00:57:51,480 --> 00:58:00,100
When they have to make Cleveland look like New York, they have to add more buildings in the background digitally.

1258
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,700
And when they have to make it look like Washington, D.C., they have to take them away.

1259
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:14,220
Because nothing is allowed to be a bigger, well, let's say a penis than the Washington Monument or something.

1260
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,560
Everything has to be shorter than the President's pipe.

1261
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,680
Are you accusing or confusing?

1262
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:27,060
Are you somehow adhering that the National Monument of our four fingers is a large penis?

1263
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,320
They're all fake.

1264
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:32,220
And they're all a bunch of big dicks.

1265
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,160
Fake phalluses.

1266
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,140
I know.

1267
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,460
I'm going to have to edit some.

1268
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,540
You just couldn't help it, could you?

1269
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:44,960
Well, you know, I know that I have to edit that for the broadcast radio.

1270
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,820
But I have a special plan for how to edit it, you see.

1271
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,380
Two places at once.

1272
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,040
Yeah.

1273
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:59,040
Like a furniture salesman disguising himself as a marine lieutenant or a biologist of some kind.

1274
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,800
You know.

1275
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,840
Okay, man, we got to go.

1276
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:04,600
It's like.

1277
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,760
Because anything else we would record would just be extra that ends after the show.

1278
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,120
So.

1279
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,760
Okay, that's the end of the show.

1280
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:13,280
Bye, Dave.

1281
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:13,520
Bye.

1282
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:14,780
See you, Dave.

1283
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,420
We'll see you next time, man.

1284
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,220
Okay, now it's part of the show that's.

1285
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,460
Do you hang up again?

1286
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,220
Yeah.

1287
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,460
He doesn't get it.

1288
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,980
I was going to blabber on and on about all the stuff you can buy from Church of the Subgenius.

1289
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:30,180
How is that?

1290
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:31,860
Like that membership pack.

1291
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,180
Now, friends.

1292
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:39,720
The Church of the Subgenius might get popular after this movie comes out.

1293
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,320
And it won't be cool anymore after that.

1294
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:48,800
You want to be able to say, I joined the Church of the Subgenius before it was cool.

1295
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:53,000
Because once it's cool, it by definition is not cool anymore.

1296
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:56,260
It's only cool as long as it's not cool.

1297
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:01,140
In some ways, the band Devo had that problem, too.

1298
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,380
Still does.

1299
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:09,080
But yeah, friend, you want to be cool and thrifty.

1300
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,640
Because the price for the minister pack is going to go up.

1301
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,220
It's not just a piece of paper gimmick.

1302
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,560
It's a whole bunch of pieces of paper.

1303
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,680
Some of them are stapled together in little books.

1304
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:24,380
And there's great big giant pieces of paper you put on your wall.

1305
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:28,280
And there's a little tiny cardboard thing that makes you into a minister.

1306
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,960
And you can marry people and do ministerial type things.

1307
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,500
If you want to.

1308
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:38,460
And you can meet other subgeniuses if you want to.

1309
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,420
But that's not an option if you're not a member.

1310
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,500
I mean, you may run into a bunch of other gimme bobs like yourself.

1311
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:49,300
That get on Facebook, can't spell Bob's first name right.

1312
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,420
Which is a lot of them.

1313
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,840
And there's a lot more lately.

1314
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:58,140
Because that TV star Nick Offerman from Parks and Recreation.

1315
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:02,100
He met us at that party and he started bragging it up.

1316
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,160
On his Twitter.

1317
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,160
And we suddenly got orders.

1318
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:09,600
I've mailed out five memberships a day for about a week.

1319
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,740
For us, that's a lot.

1320
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,640
I had to print Dobbs heads again.

1321
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,420
I ran out of Dobbs heads.

1322
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,540
I had to quit making membership packs.

1323
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:20,780
I ran out of Dobbs heads.

1324
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:22,200
Good lord, man.

1325
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,420
You get a decal of Bob's face.

1326
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:28,060
Along with an 8.5 by 11 frameable portrait.

1327
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:33,140
And a shiny metal button with his beautiful face.

1328
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,000
That shiny metal button is why it has to be mailed as a large package.

1329
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,860
And not as flat mail.

1330
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:39,260
Oh.

1331
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:43,640
Yeah, it's too thick to be mailed as paper.

1332
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,620
It's not just paper.

1333
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,720
It's full of cool stuff.

1334
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,020
And it's only 35 bucks.

1335
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,660
And it's going to be 45 next time I reprint.

1336
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,560
I'll bet you.

1337
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:51,820
Mmm.

1338
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,560
But that's not all.

1339
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,400
We have the book of the subgenius is still in print.

1340
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:01,380
We sell it.

1341
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:02,960
They're all autographed by me.

1342
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,380
When you buy them from me.

1343
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,180
We've got Dave's book, Neighbor World.

1344
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:07,920
Um.

1345
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,980
The little metal closing A-pin.

1346
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,200
That's our second best selling item.

1347
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:17,420
And we have about a hundred audio CDs.

1348
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:21,840
And a dozen or more DVDs.

1349
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,420
That are mostly anthology collections of shorts.

1350
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:29,340
But one is a feature film, Arise.

1351
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:31,980
Arise, friend.

1352
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:33,980
Arise.

1353
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,100
And all these things are not.

1354
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:37,200
The book of the subgenius is 22 bucks.

1355
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:38,680
21 bucks now, I think.

1356
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,300
And don't.

1357
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,480
Just ignore the Kindle version.

1358
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,740
Don't go there.

1359
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:47,140
They don't handle the graphics right at all.

1360
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:47,860
Not at all.

1361
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,080
I disapprove of it.

1362
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,280
Although I did get a little royalty check for it recently.

1363
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:52,780
Nice.

1364
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,220
And so, no.

1365
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,860
It wasn't very all that nice.

1366
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,320
They're not that big.

1367
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,600
And I'm supposed to.

1368
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:00,900
I have to split them.

1369
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,940
But even a little bitty royalty check.

1370
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,000
Is better than none.

1371
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:07,200
So friends, all you have to do is go to subgenius.com.

1372
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,180
And I'll also give you our post office box.

1373
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,340
For those of you in prison.

1374
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:17,420
It's subgenius at Box 807.

1375
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,940
Glen Rose, Texas.

1376
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:23,680
That's pretty short.

1377
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,000
Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas.

1378
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:30,620
76043.

1379
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,640
And yeah.

1380
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:38,160
Yeah, it's great.

1381
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,160
Oh, and another thing happened this week.

1382
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:40,920
That we didn't.

1383
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,160
I don't think we told Dave about.

1384
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,860
We met a Glen Rose subgenius.

1385
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,460
Someone in Glen Rose who's not related to me.

1386
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:48,700
Actually joined the church.

1387
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,140
After 10 years of curiosity, she said.

1388
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:52,600
Right.

1389
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:56,260
And she came over.

1390
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,300
And we met her.

1391
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,380
And she was really fun.

1392
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,420
She's real cute, too.

1393
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:00,600
She's a little bit of a weirdo.

1394
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:00,600


1395
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:00,600


1396
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:00,600


1397
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:00,600


1398
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:00,600


1399
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:00,880
Uh-huh.

1400
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:03,740
And devilish.

1401
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,760
She's a smart aleck.

1402
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,360
Yes, she's a smart aleck.

1403
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:09,560
Yeah.

1404
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,640
And she's never heard this show.

1405
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,380
And I'll bet you.

1406
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,860
This would serve her right if she listens to the first part of this show.

1407
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,840
And goes, it's just too confusing.

1408
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:20,740
I can't follow it.

1409
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:21,740
Never hears this part.

1410
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,000
Where we're talking about her.

1411
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,300
So that's what happens.

1412
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,080
You turn off your hour of slack too early.

1413
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,960
And don't listen to the ads section at the end.

1414
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:30,580
The ads section at the end is where we can find.

1415
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,680
Talk about stuff that we wouldn't.

1416
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:40,420
Well, we can't on the public supported airwaves of the college stations that we love so much.

1417
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,260
But it's where personal.

1418
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:42,660
And free.

1419
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:44,680
They're not all college stations, actually.

1420
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,940
But indie stations.

1421
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:48,740
Public supported.

1422
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:50,940
Not commercial stations.

1423
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,540
So that means we can't be commercial.

1424
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:56,840
But the internet, for another couple of years, nobody gives.

1425
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:57,960
We can get away with anything.

1426
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:00,140
Oh, I'm sure.

1427
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:04,320
You'll have to have a license to have a website soon enough.

1428
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:06,180
I know.

1429
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,100
You've been saying that for a long, long time.

1430
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,680
And I believe you're true and right.

1431
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:11,980
Yeah.

1432
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:12,920
When I figured.

1433
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:16,540
When Philo forced me to understand what the internet was around 1994.

1434
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:21,300
I thought to myself, this is going to change everything for a while.

1435
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,860
It's going to be a free for all.

1436
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:24,880
It's going to be great.

1437
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,480
And we better take advantage of it.

1438
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,000
And in every way we can.

1439
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,380
Before they turn it into television.

1440
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:35,480
Which is basically kind of what it is now.

1441
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:42,300
So, friends, this commercial has been brought to you by the Church of the Subgenius.

1442
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,540
At subgenius.com.

1443
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:48,340
True slack.

1444
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,520
Whatever that is for you.

1445
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:00,660
We'll see you next time.
