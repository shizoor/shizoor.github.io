1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
What about all the historical figures who didn't give a fuck about anything?

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:03,680
Yes.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,220
The Self-Genius Hour of Self-Worship.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,500
Eating, Medication, and Listening to a Radio.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,040
Thank you, brothers and sisters.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,700
It is a fine evening that I come before you this evening,

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,880
having been imbibed by the smoke and frop of dogs.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,780
I've come before you because I want to share a vision of the future.

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,380
A future that is less than 36 hours away,

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,080
and we're hoping like hell.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,980
It's going to be July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,540
We're going to see a skyload fucking full of spaceships.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,380
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have a nightmare.

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,480
I have a nightmare to share with you that we're going to be out here

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,580
killing pinks and flying spaceships and blasting shit

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,240
with fucking ray guns and blasters and just destroying shit.

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,060
Congress?

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,740
Hey, man, that's my target, bitches.

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,460
Stay away.

20
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,080
I want all them Republican dickheads dead.

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,440
I've never seen such a waste of my fucking time in this nation's time

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,720
and any fucking time in all my life.

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,140
Everything's backwards.

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,800
But fuck all that.

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,560
Who cares?

26
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,180
We'll just destroy it.

27
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,340
I don't give a shit.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,520
Yes, friends, I have a nightmare.

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,980
I have a nightmare.

30
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,240
Tiny little baby children.

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,900
They're in the air and frying.

32
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,620
Why?

33
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,120
Because they're just too pink to live.

34
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,740
I want to spew my hate all over everything.

35
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:46,940
Just like I was masturbating like a madman and blowing my wad on a wall.

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,400
Then wiping the mess up with the curtains.

37
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,620
Yes, dear friends, X days are coming and we're going to get the hell out of here.

38
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,340
And leave a smoking wreck behind.

39
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,120
I'm done.

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,340
Fuck all of it.

41
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:04,680
Bye.

42
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:10,820
Fuck.

43
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,320
Fuck, fuck,

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,440
fuck.

45
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,260
Fuck, fuck,

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,580
fuck,

47
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:12,880
fuck,

48
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,040


49
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,100


50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,600
FUCK!

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,060
Well, bless my soul, what's wrong with me?

52
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,880
I took some crank and some LSD

53
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,980
I drank poor wine from a big brown jug

54
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,120
I'm on drugs, I'm all fucked up

55
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,100
Well, my hands are shaky and my knees are weak

56
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,980
The smack I shot is about to peak

57
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,940
I think I need to have my stomach pumped

58
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,960
I'm on drugs, I'm all fucked up

59
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,720
Well, please don't ask me what I hear and see

60
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,720
Cause there's a big brown sausage and it's talking to me

61
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,680
When I sweat and I think if I forget to breathe

62
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,700
My heart will stop and all my fans will grieve

63
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,620
Well, it took 12 pills so I could come on down

64
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,580
I even drank a six-pack of Royal Crown

65
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,520
And then I ate a Reese's peanut butter cup

66
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:26,920
But I'm on drugs, I'm all fucked up

67
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,560
I took drugs, I'm all fucked up

68
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,380
Well, my tongue gets swollen and my eyes bug out

69
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,180
I don't even know what the hell I'm talking about

70
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,280
There's only one cure that'll ease my mind

71
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,220
I'm gonna take a big crap on that epocillinamine

72
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,160
Well, the touch of my butt and what a chill I got

73
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,140
My heart seized up from an old blood clot

74
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,060
Who'd ever have thought that this is where I'd drop

75
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,900
I took drugs, I'm all fucked up

76
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,900
Thanks for watching!

Bye bye!

80
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,640
Bye bye!

81
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,020
I gotta get back to work!

82
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:25,860
I gotta get back to work!

83
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,560
I got a head full of rat shit

84
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,780
I wanna sleep here

85
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,700
You're the cutest motherfucker

86
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,420
Touch me

87
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,660
Suppose it's my fault

88
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,540
I guess I'm kinda nasty

89
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,120
I like to do things

90
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,300
I wanna shave your goddamn beard

91
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Head full of rat shit

92
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,580
Head full of rat shit

93
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,880
Head full of rat shit

94
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,060
Head full of rat shit

95
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,700
I seen you dancing

96
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,180
I know you're in love now

97
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,320
Body in the harness

98
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,300
Eyeballs

99
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,060
My balls

100
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,200
Not on the proven anyway

101
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,600
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme

102
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,380
Or I could eat your butt

103
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,500
Right now

104
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,040
Head full of rat shit

105
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,200
Head full of rat shit

106
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,540
Head full of rat shit

107
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,020
Head full of rat shit

108
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,020


109
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,560
Shit

110
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,880
Screw kaboom

111
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,300
What's boy remind you of?

112
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,120
What's boy remind you of coax?

113
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,640
You got your ass to the core

114
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,320
Look like a oklan

115
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,480
But it's not like

116
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,480


117
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,480


118
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,480


119
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,480


120
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,480


121
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,580
You gotta

122
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,040
Saidтор

123
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,040


124
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:30,040
was the band known as Reagan's Polyp, which has recently re-released a lot of their classic

125
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,400
works from the 90s and the aughts for a new audience, and you should Google them, Reagan's

126
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:44,000
Polyp. Before that, Reverend Phineas Narco of National Cynical Radio, singing All Fucked

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,100
Up. Before that, some Lemurian collage, and Reverend Eggplant from the 17X Day Drill.

128
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,380
And as you may have gathered, this is one of our internet-only, triple-X rated episodes,

129
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:06,400
specifically number 1493.5XXX. And I really like doing these because, first off, I don't have to

130
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,840
do any fuck-cutting, and secondly, because it doesn't have to be just exactly under one hour.

131
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,600
Much easier to do. But it won't be mailed to any of the broadcast stations either. No sir ma'am.

132
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,640
Friends can't afford the FCC fines. Now anyway, we have more Reagan's Polyp coming up. Their

133
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:33,000
songs tend to be short, friends. And we have more from last July's Subgenius Festival at

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,680
Wisteria Campground, 17X Day Drill, in this case, Priestess Pisces.

135
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:50,860
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Some of you may be on some sort of depressing

136
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:59,160
chemical. You were a little bit behind. So let's try that again. Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

137
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:10,400
There's always one motherfucker, isn't there? All right, let's try the next one. Fuck the

138
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,960
Peaks! Fuck the Peaks! Fuck the Peaks! Wait, I thought it was Don't Fuck the Peaks! Exactly!

139
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,860
Yeah, I don't want to say Fuck the Peaks! No, no, no, no, it's not the... Right, let's look.

140
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,740
Come on, you guys. Get it together, get it together. Come on.

141
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:33,000
Subgenius, damn it! Convert the Peaks! Here's the thing I said. So! Here's a little more difficult.

142
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:43,520
You ready? The Subgenius must have slack. The Subgenius must have slack! Slack! Slack! Slack!

143
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,040
That was really sloppy. I'm going to try this one more time.

144
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:56,460
get it together guys come on you can do it the subgenius must have slack

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:18,540
I know it's early I know it's early the third oh yeah we're going hold on do you do that to

146
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:28,840
your girlfriend too all right since somebody's over here premature prematurely ejaculating with

147
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:40,720
the mouth let's go ahead and try this fuck them if they can't take a joke all right we're working

148
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,880
come on baby

149
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,260
I'll bring you some

150
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,360
baby

151
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,180
baby

152
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
I'll bring you some

153
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,380
baby

154
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,200
you say

155
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,320
but first

156
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,240
friends I shall tell you the story of good

157
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,040
King

158
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,180
King

159
00:10:48,200 --> 00:11:01,860
Stag whose queen was renowned as the finest hoon tang all across the land ten thousand miles around

160
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:09,920
none match the beauty of the babe with the crown now among those who admired the bounteous princess

161
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,140
we was one low-life bastard they called Chris Lee

162
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,920
Chris

163
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,180
Lee

164
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,200
, thought to diddle the fang that he knew good and well belonged to King Stag

165
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:32,940
now we've seen fuckheads, assholes, shitheads, and turds geeks, glorts, ninnies, and nerds

166
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:40,380
but the sorriest morphidite you ever did see was that jive-ass beatnik they called Reverend Chris Lee

167
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:48,160
Chris Lee saw his chance at the X-Day drills while the king's brain was muddled on potions and wine

168
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,340
and pills

169
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,000
now most faithful bobbies

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,300
Stag was loath to disparage

171
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,940
but that skunk married we in the short duration marriage

172
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,860
this brash move so raised King Stag's ire

173
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,020
that he resolved to have Lee punished by torture and fire

174
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,540
first he'd have Lee tied to a cigarro cactus steak

175
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,700
then in a giant microwave oven

176
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,960
Chris Lee's ass he would bake

177
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,260
in Lee's rump Stag would roast a corn on the cob

178
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,240
he'd serve some to Nege but he'd butter some for Bob

179
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,020
but even at the trial Chris Lee showed such sass

180
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,540
that he vulgarly winked at weed as if to make a coarse pass

181
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:46,180
seeing this made Stag so furiously mad it almost blew out the one royal nag

182
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,940
and the kingdom was in a state of shock and terror

183
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,280
heard Stag yell

184
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,580
that Chris Lee will pay or shut up like hell

185
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,580
his lily white ass I will churn like butter

186
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,380
until at polite apology I do hear him utter

187
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,520
so untie his feet and untie his hand

188
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,940
cause I'm gonna whip that motherfucker man to man

189
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,680
friends they fought like devils and not like men

190
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:17,920
they fought like devils and not like men

191
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:17,920


192
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,820
they gouged and they bit and they kicked

193
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,900
but then something dreadful happened

194
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,120
before the battle was done

195
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,580
that left all the kingdom and even King Stag stunned

196
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,880
for while they fought each other

197
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,840
into the setting sun

198
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:41,400
that fine princess weed off with Dr. Philo Drummond had run

199
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,360
friends I should give a little tip of the hat to the great Rudy Raymore

200
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,780
Ptolemy who inspired that

201
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,820
I met a man a very strange and magic man

202
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,620
his name was Ivan Stang

203
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,740
and he had wandered many lands many seas

204
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,460
and this he said to me

205
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,540
the greatest thing

206
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,760
you'll ever learn

207
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,460
is just

208
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,560
to love Bob

209
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,720
and get fucked in return

210
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,600
I don't wanna fuck you

211
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,820
I don't wanna fuck you

212
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,020
I don't wanna fuck you

213
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,860
son of a bitch

214
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,320
I don't wanna fuck you

215
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,420
I don't wanna fuck you

216
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,580
I don't wanna fuck you

217
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,620
son of a bitch

218
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,360
more Reagan's polyp there

219
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,480
Pope Sterno docs of Doctors for Bob was in that band sometime

220
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:47,520
I don't know if you've heard of it

221
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,560
Philemon should have listen to it

222
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:50,560


223
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:50,560


224
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:50,560


225
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:50,920
cookbook

226
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,920


227
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,640
G Gordon Gordon

228
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,020
and the young yours truly

229
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,120
that Dave

230
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,040
in my case doing an homage to

231
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,280
at one of the Indianapolis

232
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,340
but ten years ago

233
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,600
back to

234
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,940
seventeen x day is a dream

235
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,140
a mosquito bite on my shoulder

236
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:21,460
when I came down here the other day and I saw a mosquito on the bite, fucking the bite hole.

237
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,360
A mosquito getting sloppy seconds off another mosquito bite.

238
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,620
I've been wanting to read certain people's rants on the Hour of Slack for a long time,

239
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:39,400
but it would kind of be rude to Dave. And so this is a good chance. And they're not by me.

240
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,960
There's one by the good Reverend Roger that's kind of long.

241
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:57,240
And one by the newer guy, Reverend Henry H. McFuckface. That would be one way to pronounce it.

242
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,280
Hey, he lives close to the Scrapple factory. Don't make fun of him.

243
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,100
How do you pronounce that name? Henry H. McFuckface?

244
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,320
McFrakus.

245
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,560
McFrakus.

246
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,860
I thought it was McFrakus.

247
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,380
McFrakus.

248
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:09,380


249
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:09,380


250
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:09,380


251
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:16,620
Well, it's spelled McFackfus, which in a way that could be said McFockface.

252
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:24,480
I kind of like McFuckface. And he's married to Lady Vajayjay or something, right?

253
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:24,980
Vajayna.

254
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,360
Vajayna. That's right. Lady Vajayna.

255
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,440
I'm sure they're really nice folks. They have nice kids and nice dogs.

256
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,580
And a lot of sex.

257
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,380
And Henry H. McFuckface.

258
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,300
McFuckface Jr. posted a rant that said,

259
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,540
I'm not as good as you, but I'm still better than you.

260
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,020
That's right. Better.

261
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,700
So what if I can't do something as well as you?

262
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,680
So what if I'm not as pretty as you?

263
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,400
Not as smart or talented as you?

264
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,640
Fuck you!

265
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,120
Who the fuck are you?

266
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,240
Just another pink boy.

267
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,380
And believe me, come July 5th, 1998, you'll see what I'm like.

268
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,380


269
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,380


270
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,260
But that gets you.

271
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,560
So you have a degree?

272
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,580
Fuck you!

273
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,960
I have a doctorate.

274
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,900
So you have a clean record?

275
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,200
Fuck you!

276
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,480
I have a divine excuse.

277
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,440
So you have a Mercedes?

278
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,920
Fuck you!

279
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,400
I have a pleasure saucer.

280
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,900
So you have a 401k plan?

281
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,320
Fuck you!

282
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,580
I have eternal slack.

283
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,000
So you have a 14 inch cock?

284
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,240
Well, you got me there.

285
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,360
Fuck you!

286
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,940
See how many girls let you stick that in their pooper?

287
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,700
You want to know the real reason I'm better than you?

288
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,420
Because I'm not you!

289
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,280
Hell, I'm not even me.

290
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,620
I'm a subgenius.

291
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,960
Not because I was told to be, not because I have to be, and certainly not because it's

292
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,560
hip to be, but because I paid to be.

293
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,100
I'm Reverend Funny Name.

294
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,940
Wise man and wise ass.

295
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,780
Mad doctor and silly bastard.

296
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,340
A holy man who knows the universal secrets are really cosmic jokes.

297
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,640
But as far as you're concerned, I'm Joe Schmoe.

298
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,900
Occasionally employed nerdy loser.

299
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:29,440
Vastly inferior because I don't make as much money, or have as much expensive crap, or

300
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,020
as many Facebook friends.

301
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,760
Because I don't have 50,000 YouTube plays, or I suck at Call of Duty online.

302
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,760
Shut up.

303
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,520
Shunned.

304
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,240
Because I don't follow every other trend that the conspiracy tells me I should.

305
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,620
Looked down on because I'm not just another khaki on the outside, pink on the inside,

306
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,420
cookie cutter clone of what they say is normal.

307
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,460
Fuck that!

308
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,020
I'm a subgenius.

309
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,960
I make my own slack and that's what makes it true slack.

310
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:06,720
I don't need false slack sold to me, pre-packaged and ship free if I combine orders.

311
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,760
I don't need an order.

312
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,020
I don't need a small expense paid adventure vacation cruise.

313
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,860
My life is an adventure.

314
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,660
And it is fraught with peril.

315
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,600
Fighting off ace souls and coops and just trying to have a good time.

316
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:30,340
Because I'm a fucking yeti and you can cover my fur with a suit and tie but you can't cover

317
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,100
my pfff stench with Old Spice.

318
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,040
I am a subgenius.

319
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,740
And you will follow my path.

320
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,580
I will follow your path off a cliff before I follow yours to the slaughterhouse.

321
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,880
And I mean that literally.

322
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,380
Because that's where you're all headed.

323
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,480
Because as far as the government's concerned we're all just social security numbers and

324
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,900
statistics to be taxed and tallied.

325
00:19:54,260 --> 00:20:02,620
But to the horrible things that control them, we are something much worse.

326
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:08,720
Khaki on the outside, pink on the inside, farm raised organic meat treats to be chewed.

327
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:08,720


328
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,380
Chewed up and spit out by the con.

329
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,400
Haven't you noticed all the fields are being filled up with housing developments?

330
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,240
What you don't realize is they're still farming those fields.

331
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,540
Free range long pig.

332
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,160
The subgenius is like a weed in that field.

333
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,760
But fucking with the rest of the crop, making the pigs sick, sucking up all the fertilizer,

334
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,280
or slack.

335
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,700
That makes us subgenius.

336
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,760
They just watch tasty little meat snacks for the con.

337
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:48,160
And they just love sinking their teeth into a subgenius because like any good weed, we

338
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,020
get them high.

339
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,820
And unlike all the pink pigs, slopped with pasteurized hydrogenated GMO false slack,

340
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,040
we have true slack that are that much sweeter.

341
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,060
So fuck you, I'm not only better than you, I'm more delicious than you.

342
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,600
Price Bob, a rant written by Henry.

343
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,240
Henry H. McFuckfuss Jr.

344
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,500
McFuckus.

345
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,360
McFuckus.

346
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,660
That kind of reminds me of the old joke about Johnny Fucker Faster.

347
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,520
But...

348
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,340
When I went to the planet of vampire bitches.

349
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,920
In the galaxy of pleasure.

350
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,680
An endless terrain of ever-changing beauty.

351
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:38,680


352
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:38,680


353
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,220
Emerald green cushions.

354
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,920
Voluptuous women lounging obscenely.

355
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:52,800
The swollen nipples stroked by the mechanical hands of the Javanese gamelan wrecking cyborg

356
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,340
with the voice of Jerry Lewis.

357
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,820
Oh baby, baby, baby.

358
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,560
Monorails swerve by on tracks set hundreds of feet from the artificial voyeur's lens.

359
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:08,660


360
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:08,660


361
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,040
The landscape.

362
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,420
I sampled exotic delights.

363
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,500
The nectar I tasted.

364
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,140
The melon crashing down on my head up in the bell tower.

365
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:29,240
And my ermine haven crowned the diabolo tingle up in the tree hive of the fertile soil.

366
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,240
The flower picker isolated from the window.

367
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,260
So what enormous panties.

368
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,200
I'm nine years old and a genius.

369
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,960
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.

370
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,340
Fuck me, fuck me.

371
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,940
Fuck me, fuck me.

372
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,840
Fuck me, fuck me.

373
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,040
Fuck me, fuck me.

374
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,400
Fuck me, fuck me.

375
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,360
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.

376
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,580
Fuck me, fuck me.

377
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:45,580


378
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:45,580


379
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:46,800
Fuck me, fuck me.

380
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,840
And I want to kind of touch on something he said and I've brought this up in the past

381
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,300
because he's actually took my advice whether he knows it or not.

382
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:01,880
One of the things that I see that's a problem is fucking pinks.

383
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,260
And I don't mean as in those fucking pinks.

384
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,940
I mean you can have a pink.

385
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:16,520
guys fucking pinks um it's it's it generally doesn't work but what banks did is he took

386
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:25,780
someone who was initially a fucking pink and before fucking the fucking pink he converted them

387
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:33,600
to a subgenius thus taking out the fucking of the fucking pinks that's too much work

388
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:39,080
so here's what i want to say and i know that you know we we're all weirdos and one of the

389
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,540
big problems and staying is touched on this is that you know we we don't really work well in

390
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:52,080
the meat market of the bars and dating sites but fuck don't fucking fuck a fucking pink

391
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,120
did i say fucking out there let me try that again

392
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,320
all right well then let me say

393
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,700
and ant penises

394
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,980
i understand that sometimes the fucking pink is hung like a clyde's tail and i know that sometimes

395
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:16,660
that she has a snatch that snaps back and wraps around you like a boa constrictor i understand

396
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:24,300
brothers and sisters that pink may have the nicest set of tits this side of silicone valley

397
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:32,040
but the thing is is while you are fucking that pink you need to convert them and i'm going to

398
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,340
add this and i will let the next

399
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:33,580
random person know that i'm not a fucking pink

400
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,060
and i'm going to add this and i will let the next random person know that i'm not a fucking pink

401
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:39,560
this is something important i need to share with you because i was a fucking pink and how i found

402
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:48,360
the church of the subgenius is i was a fucking pink who was subgenius fucked and then converted me

403
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:55,240
so in the sense of fucking fucking pinks you can fuck a fucking pink one night stands are fine if

404
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:01,960
they give you slack and i know they give a lot of us but don't keep fucking a fucking pink convert

405
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,580
them in fact that's the way i do it i'm not a fucking pink i'm a fucking pink i'm a fucking pink

406
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,200
i'm a fucking pink i'm a fucking pink i'm a fucking pink i'm a fucking pink i'm a fucking pink i'm a fucking pink

407
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,040
i joined the church i was uh banging this dude for a while and we do we had a ritual was uh

408
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:15,360

409
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,280
house we'd smoke some frop and we'd fuck and then one day i went over to his house and he didn't

410
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:33,560

411
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,860

412
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:43,220
this bob guy and he's like they're smoking some frop and he's like yeah you got to check out this

417
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,820

418
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:22,400
subcite and i paid what was then my 30 bucks because i wanted to get laid and i wanted him

419
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:30,560
to shut the fuck up about bob i was like man i felt a little bit like a john with a hooker

420
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,560
except for i don't know who the hooker was in that video

421

424
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:55,580

425
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:02,120
fucking pink turn him on to bob manx has done it correctly and i just wanted to add that because

426
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:09,320
i've talked about this before and he he got the message you may not find you're not going to walk

427
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,560
out the door and find the perfect overman or uberfim tomorrow that's not how it works they're

428
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:21,360
not sitting there waiting at your mailbox when you get the mail what you may have to find is

429
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:30,020
find the perfect latent unpaid subgenius that your dick or pussy can convince

430
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,560
to pay their 35 bucks

431
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,600
and that's that's a bit of a message now i will let the next come on up here i believe it's uh

432
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,800
give a shit said something he wanted to share

433
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,980
what did the booth say

434
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,860
okay give a shit so i'll have to give us a moment this is the track moment if you

435
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,940
if those of you those of you who have watched live hour slack and staying does this this is

436
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:02,620
the point where nothing is being recorded so uh you can say you want to say whatever we want i

437
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,500
never can think of anything

438
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,220
to say when nothing you know it's like what do you say different when nothing's being recorded

439
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,660
you can say penis penis you can say fuck

440
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:21,180
you know stang has told me one time he said that that the uberfims are actually worse for the fuck

441
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:29,200
cuttings that the overmen don't say fuck is nearly as much as the uberfims do and it makes it a

442
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,360
little bit more difficult when he has to go through and uh

443
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,720
cut the fucks and shits

444
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:45,120

I want to run by you.

469
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,920
I don't really know.

470
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,920
We're trying to figure out how we can get some motherfucker who's in a wheelchair up here.

471
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,540
No, no, I'm speaking simple.

472
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
What are you waiting for?

473
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:13,920
I'm a fucking liar.

474
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,160
What?

475
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,920
That's our job.

476
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,440
Right.

477
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,120
My drunken voice carries.

478
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,540
You can drag him here.

479
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,260
My people?

480
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,160
Just yell the word.

481
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,800
I need no lecture.

482
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,860
You need nothing.

483
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,160
No, well, I get that.

484
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,680
I get that.

485
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,280
I'm wondering, could we get him?

486
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,100
The problem is, is this Sam?

487
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,600
My rights are staying on.

488
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,440
We can hear him.

489
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,960
You are intoxicated.

490
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,620
Rigs for Bob.

491
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,300
Rigs for Bob.

492
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,700
No, no, listen.

493
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,120
Listen, children.

494
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,840
Children, listen.

495
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:45,960
Listen.

496
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,320
Introduce him.

497
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,200
When I was a young man.

498
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,020
No, no, please.

499
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,480
My father's a dick.

500
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,540
Half off.

501
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,760
Full blooded.

502
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,600
Chocked out Indian.

503
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,220
Now listen.

504
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,920
Papaw used to tell a story.

505
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,700
About hot chow.

506
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,900
Hot chow.

507
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,420
Now hot chow.

508
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,140
He was a chocked out Indian.

509
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,220
You know, they think they come from like North Carolina.

510
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:11,880
So I don't know.

511
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,920
Some of them fucking redneck states down southeast.

512
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,900
Where it's like sweaty and neat.

513
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,960
But, but.

514
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,120
The story Papaw told me.

515
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,040
Was about a hot chow.

516
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,100
Now one day.

517
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,420
Hot chow.

518
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,480
Was walking through the woods.

519
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,780
Now they call them skunk apes down south.

520
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,740
Some people call them sasquatch, bigfoot, yeti.

521
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,940
Don't goddamn matter.

522
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,480
Same goddamn species.

523
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,080
And those beasts.

524
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,640
We don't know why.

525
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,180
But they like to take a shit.

526
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,960
On the past people walk on.

527
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,560
Maybe it's like a three stooges wipeout thing.

528
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,200
Oh, you know, wipe out in some yeti shit.

529
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,700
I don't know.

530
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,620
Who the hell knows.

531
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,180
But they like to do it.

532
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,660
But.

533
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,240
The main thing is.

534
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,440
For the Choctaw people.

535
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,760
Is that certain mushrooms would grow in that crap.

536
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,280
Now hot chow.

537
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,380
It's.

538
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,440
It's like kind of into schmuck.

539
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,460
Or schmo.

540
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,400
It's kind of like a.

541
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,640
Like a nice guy.

542
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,680
He's got good intentions.

543
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,780
He's kind of an idiot.

544
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,600
And well hot chow.

545
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,420
You know, he's walking.

546
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,740
Oh, he's walking down.

547
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,920
He's looking for those mushrooms.

548
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,920
He doesn't know this.

549
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,360
But.

550
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,420
Well.

551
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,960
Our lord and savior Bob.

552
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,700
Happens to really enjoy nature.

553
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,800
Bob when he enjoys nature.

554
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,040
Doesn't really like to wear clothes though.

555
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,520
And when a male of the species.

556
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,040
Doesn't wear clothes.

557
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,340
And enjoys something.

558
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,700
It's called an erection.

559
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,260
Now hot chow.

560
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,840
Was sitting there.

561
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,300
Trying to find out.

562
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:52,700
Okay.

563
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,600
What did this.

564
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,240
You know.

565
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,480
Skunk ape.

566
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,100
Or yeti.

567
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,440
Or whatever.

568
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,400
Eat that day.

569
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,800
That was so nice.

570
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,780
That it made the mushrooms.

571
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,080
That grew out of its feces.

572
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,580
Tell them.

573
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:05,820
You know.

574
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,720
I'm probably going to get.

575
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,480
Well honestly.

576
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,000
You know.

577
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,480
I mean.

578
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,040
We can talk about all the spiritual shit.

579
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:11,600
But you know.

580
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,420
Fucked up.

581
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,680
Is what he was looking for.

582
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,640
You know.

583
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,620
They didn't have PBR.

584
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,520
They didn't.

585
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:17,820
You know.

586
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,280
They just.

587
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:18,800
They got.

588
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,840
They got the shit.

589
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,880
That they got from nature.

590
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,620
And so he's looking at that.

591
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,300
As he's been over.

592
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:23,980
And of course.

593
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,800
As we know.

594
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,560
From any Hollywood film.

595
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,080
They wear loincloths.

596
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,300
They don't wear suits.

597
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:29,780
And pants.

598
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:30,760
All.

599
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,440
Native American men.

600
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,520
Only.

601
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,240
Apparently.

602
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,220
Wear loincloths.

603
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,600
So he's bending over.

604
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,460
And you know what happens.

605
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:37,960
You bend over.

606
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,520
Little loincloth.

607
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,120
A little bit of show in there.

608
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:40,700
Well.

609
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,040
You know.

610
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,760
You got Bob.

611
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,500
Walking through the woods.

612
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,240
With a heart on.

613
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,120
Looking at the leaves.

614
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:46,700
Of the trees.

615
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,160
Maybe.

616
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:47,480
The.

617
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:47,960
You know.

618
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,520
Fucking.

619
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:49,840
Biscuitos.

620
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,220
Or ticks.

621
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:53,320
Or whatever.

622
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:53,320


623
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,600
He's basically.

624
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,360
Almost.

625
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,000
Just above retarded.

626
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,420
So he's just kind of wandering through.

627
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,060
Doing that.

628
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,140
With a bone on.

629
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:01,720
Well.

630
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,100
There's a certain thing that happens on trails.

631
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,640
Trails.

632
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,540
Are these open spaces.

633
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,760
Where other plants don't grow.

634
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,260
So.

635
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,520
The roots.

636
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,660
Of the big trees.

637
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,760
End up.

638
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,560
Kind of.

639
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,060
You know.

640
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,100
Being like little steps.

641
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,040
Or stairs on that.

642
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,900
And it's easy to trip over them.

643
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,180
What does.

644
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:23,720
Dobbs do.

645
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,260
Well.

646
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,860
Of course.

647
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,980
He does a Dobbs.

648
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,340
He does a Bob.

649
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,260
He trips.

650
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,660
Where does his penis go.

651
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,640
We all know.

652
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,780
Right up.

653
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,260
Hot shows.

654
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,080
You know.

655
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:33,740
What.

656
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:34,820
And.

657
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,300
It's an accidental.

658
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:36,880
On purpose.

659
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,520
Rape.

660
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,640
But.

661
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,360
What.

662
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,320
Who wins.

663
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,360
Bob always wins.

664
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:43,980
No matter what.

665
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:44,900
You know.

666
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,600
Bob can have the most.

667
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,180
Terrible diarrhea.

668
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:48,980
But he wins.

669
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,260
And.

670
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:50,780
It's.

671
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,140
It's.

672
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,820
Any kind of.

673
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,060
Of.

674
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:53,840
Bacteria.

675
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,680
He gets in his system.

676
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,760
Bob absorbs.

677
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,500
He just happens to enjoy the diarrhea.

678
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,160
He gets from it.

679
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,460
Now.

680
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,460
For an ever.

681
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,640
Average.

682
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:02,980
Everyday.

683
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,860
Human being.

684
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,460
You know.

685
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,220
We all pretend to be yetis.

686
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,420
But we all have to admit.

687
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,340
We're.

688
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,420
Got too much.

689
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,340
Human DNA.

690
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,760
To actually make it work.

691
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,880
So.

692
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,300
Therefore.

693
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,200
When Bob stumbles in the woods.

694
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,120
That goes into this.

695
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,740
The result.

696
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,020
Is not pleasant.

697
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,360
And.

698
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,180
It's.

699
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,520
You know.

700
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,180
Like I said.

701
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,880
An accidental.

702
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,940
On purpose.

703
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,400
Rape.

704
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,560
But.

705
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,960
What do we learn from that?

706
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:29,880
We learn from that.

707
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,760
That.

708
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,380
A.

709
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,420
Hemorrhoids.

710
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:32,780
That.

711
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,700
Result from that.

712
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,180
Suck.

713
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,660
And they're not pleasant.

714
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,440
But.

715
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,420
But.

716
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,960
But we learn.

717
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,740
And no pun intended.

718
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:41,840
That.

719
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,120
Dobbs.

720
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,840
In this old.

721
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:45,980
Chalked out story.

722
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,660
Didn't have the intention to hurt us.

723
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:50,900
We.

724
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,000
We.

725
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,000


726
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,540
We got hurt.

727
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:51,980
Because.

728
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,900
We were in the wrong place.

729
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,560
At the right time.

730
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,600
We.

731
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,740
Were.

732
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,140
In the wrong place.

733
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,840
At the right time.

734
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,960
We were in the wrong place.

735
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,540
At the right time.

736
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,380
Which I'll tell you.

737
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,960
Means this.

738
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,120
That meant.

739
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:06,980
Ha Chow.

740
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,760
He didn't go hunting after that.

741
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,500
Man.

742
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,120
He was laying in his fucking teepee.

743
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,360
Going.

744
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:11,740
Oh.

745
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,320
Jesus.

746
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,220
Christ.

747
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,120
Let me shit without bleeding.

748
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,340
Jesus Christ.

749
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,520
I don't want to be afraid to go out in the woods.

750
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:20,980
Or.

751
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:20,980


752
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:20,980


753
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:20,980


754
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:20,980


755
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,220
Where.

756
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:21,600
A.

757
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,900
Not only do I find the deer that I.

758
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,160
I don't like to kill.

759
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,760
But I have to kill to feed my family.

760
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,200
But I find the nice little plants that make me feel better about life.

761
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,780
But now suddenly.

762
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,400
I'm afraid to do anything that's good for myself.

763
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,620
Why.

764
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,340
Because.

765
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:37,940
Bob.

766
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,900
Accidentally raped.

767
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:39,880
But.

768
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,560
He learned.

769
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,220
While laying in that teepee.

770
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,400
Whining about his fucking life.

771
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,780
He learned this.

772
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,260
Bob would have raped me anyways.

773
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,960
I might as well have been.

774
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,840
Out in the woods.

775
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,460
And gotten raped by Bob.

776
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,580
Accidentally.

777
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,200
You know.

778
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,080
On purpose.

779
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,680
I might as well have been out there.

780
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,240
When that happened.

781
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,220
I might as well have been doing what I enjoy to do.

782
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,300
Because it's going to happen to you.

783
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:03,840
Anyway.

784
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,680
So give up.

785
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,120
Don't give a fuck.

786
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,240
And basically.

787
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,220
It's a giant prison.

788
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,380
And we are all skinny little white boys.

789
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,180
If I can't whoop it.

790
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,520
I'm going to go.

791
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,760
And they actually said that.

792
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,920
The Chucked Out said that.

793
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,460
Before the white man came.

794
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,820
So it's a prophecy.

795
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,500
Like the Mayans.

796
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,760
Praise Jesus.

797
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,720
Praise Jesus.

798
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,100
That's how you broke your foot?

799
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,720
Apparently the lesson from this is Bob.

800
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:36,860
No.

801
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,260
Some idiot with a fucking.

802
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,060
Smile and a pipe.

803
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,660
Sold me.

804
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:40,980
This.

805
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,660
Really nice aluminum ladder.

806
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,680
Apparently it didn't work really well.

807
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,440
Bob was fucking the ladder.

808
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,440
Well actually I gave him a blowjob.

809
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,440


810
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,440


811
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,440


812
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,440


813
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,440


814
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,440


815
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,440


816
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,440


817
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,440


818
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,440


819
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,440


820
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,440


821
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,440


822
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,940
I was a guy in a car and I got that.

823
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,240
Everybody give Teeters a round of applause.

824
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,120
Yeah Teeters.

825
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,900
I got a better one for tomorrow.

826
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,740
And I got a cool way to go along with it.

827
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,520
Alright.

828
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,320
Alright.

829
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,020
We are still taking ranchers.

830
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,880
And if anyone brought gear.

831
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,480
Like amps and things.

832
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,160
You can come up.

833
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,020
We can also go into jamming later.

834
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,000
Who is next up to rant?

835
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,420
I'm going to go with.

836
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:20,420


837
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:20,420


838
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:20,420


839
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:20,420


840
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:20,420


841
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:20,420


842
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:20,420


843
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:20,420


844
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:20,420


845
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,860
I can do the rest of good Reverend Rogers thing.

846
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:27,560
Alright.

847
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,020
I'm ready.

848
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:39,160
Oh the most horrifying Bob one liner came out of Jessie who is one of the cops here

849
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,940
at Wisteria.

850
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:40,460
Uh oh.

851
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:47,080
She and I had been going back and forth about how to make.

852
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,060
We should encourage the subgeniuses.

853
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,240
To have incest like the Amish.

854
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,840
The Amish try not to.

855
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,720
The Amish now have to kind of screw around outside of marriage because they've got too

856
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,000
much inbreeding going on.

857
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:06,840
The subgeniuses on the other hand would be seeking inbreeding right?

858
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,620
Creating new mutants.

859
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,900
Creating more subgeniuses.

860
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,340
The real X-Men.

861
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,580
Sure most of the time you might get somebody with what we would call a birth defect.

862
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,280
But every now and then you get one that's like Magneto.

863
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,140
So.

864
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,280
The final line was.

865
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,320
I gotta do it right because she really worked on it.

866
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,040
I wrote it down.

867
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,680
What a coincidence.

868
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,020
Mutate.

869
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,820
Yeah here it is.

870
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:35,840
Here's the new subgenius one liner and it's really very politically incorrect.

871
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,320
Mutate your children.

872
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,520
Fuck your sisters.

873
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,140
And who came up with this?

874
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,420
A nice young lady named Jessie.

875
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,660
Who runs.

876
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,000
Uh.

877
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,740
Some security around here.

878
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,660
You know that's always been kind of a rural people's solution.

879
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,020
Mutate your children.

880
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,400
Fuck your sisters.

881
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,500
Uh huh.

882
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,160
Hmm.

883
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:00,980
Now.

884
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,200
Well these are actually perhaps desirable traits that the inbreeding preserves like the

885
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,000
Habsburg lip and so forth.

886
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,280
Right.

887
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,740
Or the Dobbs Twitch.

888
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,660
Yes.

889
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,980
The Dobbs Lek Twitch.

890
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:19,340
One of my most vivid recollections of Dobbs was one evening in Dobbstown.

891
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:19,740
We were.

892
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:28,120
We'd been out at a pretty good rat shoot out at the Malaysian dump on the Shun side of

893
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:34,020
Dobbstown where our really nasty garbage went and the rats were large, feral and very agile.

894
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,500
It had been pretty successful and Bob and I were in his limo on the way back.

895
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:47,940
I was smoking a cigar, a frop and Bob of course was as usual puffing on his pipe and I thought

896
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,600
it was time to bring up to Bob.

897
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:55,320
Some things I had been hearing lately and I said, Bob, you know, there's something I

898
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,220
need to talk to you about.

899
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,520
And he goes, well, well, sure, Gordon, what is it?

900
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:04,480
I said, Bob, some of the people in the church have been questioning whether, uh, well, whether

901
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,560
you've been handling the, uh, very large and substantial church funds properly.

902
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,280
He puffed on his pipe and looked at me and he said, Gordon, what are you talking about?

903
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,700
I said, Bob.

904
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,340
A lot of people think.

905
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,580
There's something.

906
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,440
Funny going on with the money.

907
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,140
And they don't like that.

908
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,560
Well, no, Bob, they don't like the idea of something funny going on with their money.

909
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,540
He puffed his pipe.

910
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:40,120
Well, Gordon, he said, all I can say is fuck them if they can't take a joke.

911
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,580
Yeah, that was an illuminating moment.

912
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,560
One day, some fishermen were out of the lake.

913
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:49,560


914
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:49,560


915
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,060
The sea of Galilee trying their luck.

916
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,160
Andrew, John, Peter, Phillip, and Nathaniel.

917
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,720
They had been out in their boat all night.

918
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,020
Well, they've caught nothing.

919
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,740
As they headed into shore, they saw Jesus standing on the beach.

920
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,620
Jesus looked at him and said, well, how was the luck?

921
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,400
Eh, it was bad, said Peter.

922
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,840
We were out all night.

923
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,840
Not one stinking fish.

924
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,860
Jesus said unto them, take me out into the middle of the sea.

925
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,420
So they took Jesus on board and headed out to sea.

926
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,940
When they were out of sight of land, Jesus turned to them and said, I shall make you

927
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,020
buggerers of men.

928
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,500
Andrew shrugged and said, well, you're a little late for that.

929
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,340
Yeah, said John.

930
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,480
We've been buggering each other for years now.

931
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,900
That's kind of part of the reason why we can't catch any fish.

932
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,460
The buggering scares them away.

933
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,120
Cast your nets overboard, commanded Jesus.

934
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,840
So the fishermen did cast their nets.

935
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,460
And as they pulled in their nets, they were astonished to find it full of queers.

936
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,200
Richard Simmons, Joel Grey, Rock Hudson, Boy George, George Michael, even Liberace.

937
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,620
And when Simon saw this, he was struck with wonder.

938
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:08,840
Holy mother of God, fuck me up the ass and call me Betty, Jesus said to Bob.

939
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:15,840
And while the fishermen and their catch were buggering away for days, Jesus walked over

940
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,980
to the shore where J.R.

941
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,820
Bob Dobbs was waiting.

942
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,480
Jesus said to Bob, wow, they did exactly what you said they did.

943
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,800
Bob and just smiled.

944
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,240
And he said to Jesus, you're learning it, kiddo.

945
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,920
But you forgot to get their money again.

946
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,040
That's the whole point of this religion thing.

947
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,840
You know, Jesus sighed and looked really forlorn.

948
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,680
Bob patted Jesus on the back.

949
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,340
He said, it's okay, kid.

950
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,400
There's plenty of more suckers where those guys came from.

951
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,820
That was a long time ago.

952
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:47,820


953
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:55,400
was Pisces reading a parable by Reverend Richard Scull. Before that, G. Gordon Gordon. To close the

954
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:05,420
show, which emits from subgenius.com, by the way, we'll hear a slightly speeded up mix by Suds

955
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:14,940
of the dual brags. That is, my old brag of the subgenius from 1977 being hollered by Reverend

956
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:23,280
Eggplant mixed with the former Reverend Batrix's brag of the female subgenius hollered by Reverend

957
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:30,120
Rachel Weirdigan, who was quite pregnant at the time. Praise Bob. All right, folks, I want to hear

958
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:44,460
some fucking noise. Please, let's hear it. I picked the goddamn terror of the fucking gods out of my nose.

959
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:50,720
Pardon my language, but let the sons of God and man bear witness, even in the belly of the

960
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,520
Thunderbird, I've been casting out the false prophets. I'm busting a gut and blowing my

961
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,800
o-ring and ripe to throw a loaf. I am the infrared woman. I've got the beast of the abyss between my

962
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,100
legs. I'm tighter than a constipated scotland in a pay toilet. I've got muscles in my snacks that

963
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:09,620
haven't even evolved yet. I make the Virgin Mary look like the Grand Canyon. You can run deep,

964
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:14,320
but with me, you can't run silent. I'll make you howl so loud, there'll be green light on the moon.

965
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:20,860
For I speak only the fucking truth, and never in my days have I spoken other than. For my every

966
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:24,980
utterance is a lie, including this very one you hear. I say, fuck them if they can't take a joke

967
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:31,260
by God anything for a laugh. I say I am the last remaining homo correctus. I am the goddamn man of

968
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:37,600
the future. I'll drive a mile so as to not walk a foot. I'm a human being of the first goddamn water.

969
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:42,840
Yes, I am the Hamelina humping donkey that jumped the men from Mars. The new age was invented just

970
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,660
for me. I wore the old one.

971
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,160
Out! I put the magic in sex magic. I shocked Aleister Crowley and made the last ten poems

972
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,940
give up their vows. Who do you think Sappho wrote all those poems to? I am so good. I made the

973
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:58,780
Great Stone Face cup three times, and he doesn't even exist the next down. I make Linda Loveless

974
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,260
look like the store window dummy with lockjaw.

975
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:06,380
I drank the devil under seven tables. I am too intense to die. I'm insured for acts of God and

976
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:12,680
Satan. I was shanghaied by bodiless beans and alien Jews from a corporate galaxy and got away

977
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,920
with their hubcaps. I cannot be tracked on my own. I'm a human being. I'm a human being. I'm a human being.

978
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:15,640
I'm a human being. I'm a human being. I'm a human being. I'm a human being. I'm a human being.

979
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,340
I wear nothing uniform. I wear no goddamn uniform.

980
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,400
Come on and give me AIDS, baby. I've recombined with my own e-chylide plastide and turned it into

981
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,860
venereal mescaline. I sweat nectar and menstruate ambrosia. I pee milk and honey and I shit cakes

982
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,940
of light. When I take off my clothes, this light's break out all over Mount Olympus. I've got more

983
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,600
swing in my hips than the San Francisco earthquake.

984
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:39,640
Yes, baby, I'm 23 feet tall and I have 13 rows of tits. I was suckled by a triaxerotops. I gave

985
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,780
the anti-version a high-protein tonsil wash. I'm a bacteriological weapon. I'm armed and loaded.

986
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:50,300
I'm a fission reactor of fart plutonium. Our plants are fueled by the sweat from my brow.

987
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:55,300
When they plug me in, the lights go out and honk, honk. I weigh 666 pounds in zero gravity.

988
00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:01,080
Come and get me. I'm bitchy. I'm shrill. I'm nasty. I'm a real shrew. Mad rapist runs screaming,

989
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,640
screaming for help to the race crisis center when they see me coming. I gave the anti-bop back his

990
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,460
own BD and turned him into a radical feminist. When I'm in heat, they come from miles around

991
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:14,700
for a try at me. Dogs, cats, wolves, bears, randy goats, 12-point bucks, pterodactyls,

992
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,240
and swallowtail butterflies right alongside the men. I do it with bath lists.

993
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:23,540
I'm sired, retarded space bastards across the cosmos. I cook and eat my dead.

994
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,980
I'm the unshaven thorn tree of the Atlantis Zoo. I pay no taxes. The devil's hands are my ideal

995
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:34,000
playground. I hold the seven-bladed wing breaker. The wheels that turn are behind me. I think

996
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,820
backwards. I do it for fun. My imagination is a fucking cancer. I'll pork it before it porks me.

997
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:43,180
They say godzillion is the highest number there might be. Well, by God, I count to godzillion and

998
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:43,320
one.

999
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,940
Frodo beat the shit out of Dopey, Sneezy, and Doc just so he could get to my flower garden.

1000
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,120
They'll never stick this cunt in the kitchen unless that's where it wants to be. I never pay

1001
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,580
taxes. The government pays me to wear out the workforce. I don't charge money for it, honey.

1002
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,420
I charge slack. When they call me a bitch, I just bark right back at them. I created time control,

1003
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,880
darling. If I've got five minutes, I'll give you the eon of sheer ecstasy. Nuclear power plants

1004
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,260
hide in shame when I go by. My snatch blows in the broad daylight.

1005
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:12,940
Yes, I am the purple flower of hell county. Give me the wide berth. When I drop my drawers,

1006
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:13,260
mother.

1007
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:18,560
I use a python for a prophylactic. I'm thicker, harder, and meaner than the Alaskan pipeline

1008
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:24,180
and carry more spew. I'll freeze your seed before it hits the bathroom tile. I kidnapped

1009
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:28,760
the future and ransomed it for the past. I make time wait up for me to bleed my lizard.

1010
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,860
I'm the reason Cuban supermen were invented. I made the premiere of the USSR sing,

1011
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,040
America is all right, and mean it. I fucked the devil into heaven and St. Peter into hell.

1012
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:41,360
I took on the flaming sword of the archangel Michael and put it out. The fighting Jesus

1013
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,120
gave up fighting to have one more go with me.

1014
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,320
The blob got hard as a rock thick as a brick and stiff as steel. It's a mere sight of my sweet

1015
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,400
thing. You heard the exes are coming. Well, I'm the reason, darling. I'm a fusion reactor, baby.

1016
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:57,000
Let's fuse. I'm so hot, I fart pure ambergris and I piss champagne. How 9,000 blue is used is all

1017
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,200
over me. And I made the bad Bob said, please and thank you. My infernal breath wilts the tree of

1018
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,240
life. Left my score on the rock of ages who will tear flesh with me, who will spill their jutes.

1019
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:12,680
Who will gouge with me? Whose candle will I fart out? I'm ready, so step aside, all you butt-lipped

1020
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,060
neurotic.

1021
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,620
Secure, be spectacled. Slabs of wimp meat. I'm a crime-fighting master criminal. I am

1022
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:24,420
not insane. I am a screamer and a laugher. I make a spectacle of myself. I am a sight.

1023
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,600
My physical type cannot be classified by science. My familiar is a pterodactyl and I feed it

1024
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,140
dipshits.

1025
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,460
I made an honest fan out of Richard Nixon and then put horns on him with Harry Kissinger.

1026
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:37,680
I'm the reason Elvis is God. And who do you think pulled Howdy Doody strings, hmm? I put

1027
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,860
the starch on Pyre plus Pecker. Elijah Muhammad found Dobbs, the star of the Clench in Cincinnati,

1028
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,100
after one night with me.

1029
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,980
I blow the tops out of thermometers. I make tachymeters run backwards. You heard of black

1030
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,640
holes? Well, come up and see me sometime, sweetheart, and I'll show you the naked singularity.

1031
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:54,840
I put the collapsing collapsers. I give green stamps. I don't shave under my armpits. I

1032
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,420
mow. And then I don't braid.

1033
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:01,360
I communicate without wires or strings. I am a thuggy. I am feared in the tongues. I

1034
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,460
have the evil eye of hair in the mojo bag. I swam the Bermuda Triangle. I didn't get wet.

1035
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:11,720
I circumcise dinosaurs with my teeth. And I make them leave a tip. I charge tires with

1036
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,680
my tongue and my tool.

1037
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,280
Every night I hock up a longer and extinguish the sun. I'm the big-footed devil of level

1038
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,400
14. Who will try to bring me down?

1039
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,780
I left my nectar on the Washington Monument and douched with the Mississippi River. I

1040
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,060
don't catch crabs. I catch mountain lions. So step aside, all you slab-sided, prune-faced,

1041
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:31,260
way-fleshed, dish-racked punnies, androphobic, gynophobic, sarcrophobic, biophobic, plant-covered,

1042
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:35,800
latex-armored, beehive-haired dude, pinch-browed, antiseptic, chemical-spent, stilt-hilled,

1043
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:41,400
pucker-butted, gutty-saxed, weasel-jerky. I can out-fick, out-wit, out-joke, and out-fuck

1044
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,120
any 50 men and any 500.

1045
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:48,300
I fold, staple, spindle, and mutilate whole bureaucracies. I don't just holler and yell.

1046
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,820
I break windows and shatter chandeliers 20 counties upwind when I start feeling good.

1047
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:58,400
I've packed the brownies of the gods. I leak the plague from my neither regions. Opiates

1048
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,240
are the mass of my religion. I take drugs. Yes, I may rip, snort, or I cram coca leaves

1049
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,840
right into my armpits before they're picked off the tree. Space monsters cringe at my

1050
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:11,380
tread. I wipe the pyramids off my shoes before I enter my house. I'm too ejected. I'll live

1051
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,620
forever and remember it afterwards.

1052
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,160
I'm immune. I'm radioactive. Come on and give me cancer. I'll spit up the tumor and

1053
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:22,220
butter my bread with the juice. I'm supernatural. I bend crowbars with my meat axe. End of thought.

1054
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:26,860
I make a fool of myself with style. I set trends. I have senators for familiars. The

1055
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:30,620
American Academy for Advancement of Science made telepathy illegal and declared psychokinesis

1056
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:34,340
a mortal sin thanks to me. I don't just have the evil eye. I've got evil in places you've

1057
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,660
never heard of. I put the mo in mojo and then took it out again. When I pass by, deltines

1058
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:43,080
turn back into stallions and stairs go after locomotives. I invented sin, honey. I'm the

1059
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:43,300
reason you're here. I'm the reason you're here. I'm the reason you're here. I'm the

1060
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,060
reason you're here. I'm the reason you're here. I'm the reason you're here. I'm the

1061
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:49,520
When the Incredible Hulk butt-fucked me, I pyro-flatulated him into the next county.

1062
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:55,340
I'm quadruple-jointed. I make octopi look arthritic. Real men pay to catch DD from

1063
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:59,920
me. I don't get zits. I break out in bonbons and eclairs. I leak elixir vital from the

1064
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,660
gallon. You heard that Hitler had only one ball? Guess why.

1065
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,200
My droppings pour through the earth and erupt volcanoes in China. Yes, I can drink more

1066
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,220
wine and stay more sober than all the heathen Hindus in Asia. Woo-hoo-hoo! Yee-haw! Go!

1067
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,920
Cut blood, I'm a mori-eel, a komodo dragon, a killer whale bereft of its pup.

1068
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,080
I have a triple backbone and was sired by the wolfman.

1069
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,200
Give me all your slack.

1070
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,860
Bend all the spoons you want, honey.

1071
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,860
I straighten your regaler's tool with my unaided ESP.

1072
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,020
And stoked off the Dalai Lama was what I thought.

1073
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,260
When I bat my eyelashes, monks spew and lay their last chances in heaven.

1074
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,000
Nuns and junkies give me up their habits for me.

1075
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,860
I built the Horde of Babylon out of business.

1076
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,460
Astar invented Aphrodite just to keep up with me.

1077
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,620
I am a meek in heat.

1078
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,780
I am a Tyrannosaurus Regina on the make.

1079
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,660
I make jaws look like a smallmouth bass.

1080
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,600
A black hole is convex compared to me.

1081
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,460
And once you try me, you'll think the Big Bang is nothing but a wet firecracker.

1082
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,900
I've been in places most women don't even have.

1083
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,820
I am walking, talking, strutting, bowling volcano.

1084
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,980
I told Jesus I wouldn't go to church and he shook my hand.

1085
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,920
I have my own personal saviors and change them every hour.

1086
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,880
I don't give a fuck if there's life after death.

1087
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,660
I want to know if there's even any fucking slack after death.

1088
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:07,560
I am a goddamn visionary.

1089
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,080
I see the future in the past in comic books and wine bottles.

1090
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:11,580
I eat black holes for breakfast.

1091
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:15,020
I bend my jeans and whittle my DNA with the sheer force of my mighty will.

1092
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,700
I steer my own goddamn devolution.

1093
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,860
I ran him out of heaven and sold it to hell for a profit.

1094
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,720
I preempted Our Lady of Fatima.

1095
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,780
UFOs fight to see which gets one close encounter with me.

1096
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,940
Prophets give up their visions for just one look at me.

1097
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,420
John the Baptist came back to life to give me his head.

1098
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,840
I created DNA.

1099
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,720
Where do you think Calvin Klein got his genes?

1100
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:33,840
You think you're illuminated?

1101
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,860
I make thermonuclear blasts look like the inside of a dark room.

1102
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,200
I eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil for a between meals snack.

1103
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,760
They had to invent a whole new story.

1104
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,940
There's no sign in the Zodiac just for me.

1105
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,340
Clitus, the pornogram.

1106
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,660
You wouldn't believe the aspects of my nose, darling.

1107
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,000
My charts got all the angles.

1108
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,280
I'm enlightened.

1109
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,980
I achieve nirvana and take it all with me.

1110
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:51,460
Yep, yep.

1111
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:51,980
Woo!

1112
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,720
I'm so ugly, the speed of light can't even slow me down and gravity won't take up my cuts.

1113
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,560
When the rupture comes, I'll make them wait.

1114
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,820
They'll never clean out my cage now.

1115
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,660
Heisenberg came up with the uncertainty principle after he made me.

1116
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,260
I made Derek, Paulie, and Einstein get physical.

1117
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,760
They had to invent non-Euclidean geometry just to describe my curves.

1118
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,460
Where do you think the camel got its hump?

1119
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,180
I'm the reason for the billy goat's horn.

1120
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,340
I'm the one who fucks them when they can't take a joke and makes them smile again.

1121
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,580
I'm so weird.

1122
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,480
The Discordians joined the Republican Party in sheer self-defense.

1123
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,500
I put the libertine into libertarian.

1124
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,840
I make Elvis look dull.

1125
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,860
I'm the reason the Second Coming has taken so long.

1126
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,740
Jesus hasn't recuperated from his first one with me.

1127
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:26,400
Yet.

1128
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,960
I am the queen of heaven, the dark lady of space, the lovely black star of the sea.

1129
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,760
I am on the cave walls of the Temple of Karnak, on the walls of Pompeii, and the Cathedral of Notre Dame.

1130
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:34,940
I am the pre-scriptors.

1131
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,640
Jehovah One burns incense to me.

1132
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:36,940
I'm...

1133
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,020
Alright, give a round of applause for Rachel Weird again.

1134
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,940
And Reverend Eggplant's dueling brags.

1135
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:44,860
Woo!

1136
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,000
Yeah!

1137
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,980
For Sire, there is no more money.

1138
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,440
We gotta get some money!

1139
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:03,420
That dirty, perky, sharkaback, flackin', wharton, filibunkabarton, perkaluma, burton, dirt and buster, I don't want!

1140
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,760
B-O-B.

1141
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:08,160
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1142
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,580
And we're even more glad that some listeners

1143
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:14,500
have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1144
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:19,520
And not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1145
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,080
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1146
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:26,600
But if you truly love Bob, and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1147
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:34,120
you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages,

1148
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,420
and help out financially as best you can.

1149
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,560
Now, we know what it's like to be on the board.

1150
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:40,560


1151
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:45,460
We're in the brink of total poverty, and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1152
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,460
But some of you still have jobs.

1153
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:55,280
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1154
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,700
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1155
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,000
All we're saying is that

1156
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:06,480
blowjobs could go the way of Stevejobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1157
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,220
We also take checks and money orders to...

1158
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,940
Subgenius Foundation.

1159
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:24,420
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1160
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,640
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1161
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,620
一勿これ

1162
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,400
一斷削除

1163
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:00,800
一起

1164
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:00,800


1165
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,500
一起

1166
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,020
一一

1167
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:02,020


1168
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:02,140
一起

1169
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:02,140


1170
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:02,140


1171
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:02,140


1172
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:02,640
一起

1173
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,320
一起

1174
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:03,320


1175
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:03,760
一起

1176
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,840
一起

1177
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:04,840


1178
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:04,980
一起

1179
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,320
一起

1180
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:09,920
一起

1181
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:09,960
一起

1182
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,000
一起

1183
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,040
一起

1184
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:10,140
一起

1185
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:10,180
一起

1186
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:10,240
一起

1187
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:10,500
一起
