1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
This is really amazing.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:13,980
Let's get ready for the final, we hope not really the final, adventure as we put our hands on the screen and our testicles down on the mouse pad.

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,960
We want to make sure no rodents are biting down there.

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,220
And we begin now.

5
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,280
The subgenius hour of SWAC.

6
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,260
But we well know that the reason most of us are here is because of our affinity for disobedience.

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,940
Some make rules, some obey, but the rules are for the fools is what I say.

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,620
Mob?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,600
How are you, fellas?

10
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,100
It's him, the anomaly.

11
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,000
Do we proceed?

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,440
Yes.

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,600
You're still only human.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,520
Bob is back, and he's better than ever.

15
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,720
Hello there.

16
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,980
Flying saucer.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,220
Flying saucers.

18
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,000
Flying saucers.

19
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,520
Now, am I crazy?

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,140
Yeah, something like that.

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,500
So I'm crazy.

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,360
Yes.

23
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,220
Okay.

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,280
I am crazy.

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:40,860
Yeah.

26
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,740
The saucer.

27
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,440
Flying saucer.

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,000
Flying saucer.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,720
The saucer.

30
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,500
The saucer.

31
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,200
The saucer.

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,440
The saucer.

33
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,120
Flying saucer.

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,100
Flying saucer.

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,980
Flying saucer.

36
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,780
I thought I was going crazy.

37
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,280
Yeah, why not?

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:51,960
Okay.

39
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:52,440
Okay.

40
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:52,960
Fuck.

41
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,500
Fuck.

42
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,100
Fuck.

43
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,220
Fuck.

44
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,260
Fuck.

45
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,620
Fuck.

46
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:55,660
Fuck.

47
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,060
It is stupid.

48
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,100
I mean, it's just fine.

49
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,880
The only big conscious quasi-real come up

50
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:11,880


51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,160
You can only be a superman or a superwoman because you can sit in the choker.

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,600
And you're good at knowing the world inside the apresent bigger sentence of this lógano.

53
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:14,600


54
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:14,600


55
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:14,600


56
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:14,600


57
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:14,600


58
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:14,600


59
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,380
I have discovered I actuallyar Mike Byrne as a superman.

60
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:15,380


61
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:15,540
I know that you must go beyond your best supermarket here.

62
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,140
Hayır wish I took my pencil and pencil weapon.

63
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,060
And if you still care on the life of someone, and myses und, in it it mountain.

64
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,180


65
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,780
Anyways.

66
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,500
Incredible.

67
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:27,500


68
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:27,500


69
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,880
Pretty garbage.

70
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,620
spacecraft with living occupants, it must have been very disconcerting for them to cross millions

71
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:43,160
of miles of space only to be hit on the head with rotten oranges. The dramatic advent of such

72
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,380
fascinating objects as those which were first called flying saucers attracted the inevitable

73
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,180
attention of those individuals who let their imaginations run away with their veracity.

74
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,060
By 1950, some of these characters were beginning to spin their stories of fantastic conversations

75
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:07,180
with alleged space people. Some of them expanded the stories to include alleged rides in the UFOs.

76
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,780
Suddenly everything went black and I realized that I'd been cut off and shut off in a little tiny room where nobody was listening to me.

77
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:21,140
And I was talking to this hot little plush felt red rubber tip microphone and not hearing a thing and seeing only little tiny lights

78
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,780
and wondering why I was

79
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,860
strapped to this chair and put into the studio that seemed to be rotating very rapidly with lights flashing off rhythmically.

80
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:36,180
And it was a small man with a swollen head and hideously deformed eyes sitting behind the console pushing the buttons

81
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,760
while pencils of light and energy flashed across my body. And I wondered why I was there and what did they want of me?

82
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,520
And I couldn't figure out why I was sitting there. And they didn't say anything.

83
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,060
They just kept flashing those lights at me and pumping those strange chemicals into me.

84
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,680
And the man with the funny

85
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,120
head, the leader, the man with a strange grin and the pipe.

86
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:02,320
Well, I just want to know, do you want to be in the church or out of the church? And where's your wallet?

87
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,440
The DC9 pushed the button.

88
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:03,660
Yeah.

89
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,460
I didn't know that I'd been snatched up, but it wasn't really a dream until I saw these sacred nasal positions.

90
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:21,420
And suddenly it all came back to me. And I realized that they'd stolen four and a half hours out of my life when they put me in that tiny room and plugged all those wires into me

91
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,620
and made me talk.

92
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,420
Well, it's only an hour and a half tonight, mister.

93
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:25,920
And talk, and talk.

94
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,600
Stop.

95
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,400
My mind is going.

96
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,320
Stop.

97
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,180
My mind is going.

98
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,060
My mind is going.

99
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,060


100
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,060


101
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,740
My mind is going.

102
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,360
Hahahaha

103
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,820
Well, gentlemen.

104
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,080
The dream has come true.

105
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,240
Hmm.

106
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,240
And not just for republicans.

107
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,440
So qui...

108
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,600
The first is going, now it's goin, go go go.

109
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:52,600


110
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,400
We will control the most powerful bomb in the universe.

111
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,320
Zadar, your god, gave you the gift of the god.

112
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,560
The god is good.

113
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,880
The god, the god.

114
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,840
Penises is evil.

115
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,360
The penises is evil.

116
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,100
It appears as though something has happened in the motorcade route.

117
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,600
Something, I repeat, has happened in the motorcade route.

118
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,520
There's one thing.

119
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,940
There's a lot of people running up the hill alongside us.

120
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,880
That's why we're coming freeway.

121
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,180
Several police officers are rushing up the hill at this time.

122
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,840
Stand by.

123
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,480
Just a moment, please.

124
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,540
There's a gun.

125
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,260
There's a gun.

126
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,440
A line has been hit by the gunfire.

127
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,540
A presidential car coming up now.

128
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,760
We know it's a presidential car.

129
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,340
You see, this is Kennedy's pink suit.

130
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,660
There's a Secret Service man.

131
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,460
Now, truth or lie, who hears that soldier cry?

132
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,740
He was a hero of the war.

133
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
But no one comes near.

134
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,480
He sheds a lonely tear.

135
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,900
And wonders what it all was for.

136
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,700
And where are the roads?

137
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:20,940
To freedom.

138
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,120
Where is the life that's far than you?

139
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,540
Where is the love?

140
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,220
Where is the joy?

141
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,720
Tell me.

142
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,280
Where are the roads to freedom?

143
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,520
Where are the roads to freedom?

144
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,200
Where is the life that's far than you?

145
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,440
Is it the mend that's far from you?

146
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,260
Are the roads that go either way?

147
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,240
Are the roads that drive you to your nikki moves?

148
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,040
Are the roads that tear you away who knows?

149
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,920
Where to find the causes?

150
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:18,920


151
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:18,920


152
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,760
Where to hide?

153
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,860
farther than you

154
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,920
Where is the love

155
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,620
Where is the joy

156
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,300
And tell me

157
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,020
Where are the roads

158
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,760
to freedom

159
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,480
Where are the roads

160
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,980
to freedom

161
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,620
Where are the roads

162
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,220
to freedom

163
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,720
On July 5th, 1998

164
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
7 a.m.

165
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,660
When we all have hangovers

166
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,500
Wotan's judgment

167
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,680
will take place in the form of what the

168
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,880
prescriptures call the advent

169
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,620
of the angelic host

170
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,840
Total collapse of world civilization

171
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,740
Total collapse of world civilization

172
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:19,740


173
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,180
July 5th, 1998

174
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,140
at 7 a.m. to be exact

175
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,920
the men from Planet X

176
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,020
as the news media will call them

177
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,420
will arrive to rupture

178
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,020
the subgeniuses

179
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,000
the true believer subgeniuses

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,920
up into the escape vessels

181
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,660
of the sex goddesses

182
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,260
to carry a few picked survivors

183
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,700
of our doomed civilization

184
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,140
to a new life on another world

185
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,540
It's Let's Have a Party

186
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,320
Let's Have a Party

187
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,520
Let's Have a Party

188
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:49,740
Let's Have a Party

189
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,200
Let's Have a Party

190
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,200


191
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,660
Is it time for that big operation?

192
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,320
Some of you believe as I believe

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,200
Some of you do not

194
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,520
But those of you that do know

195
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,300
we are nearing the end of our struggle

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,940
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon

197
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,700
But before it can be

198
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,760
The oracle must be consulted

199
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,020
The oracle must be consulted

200
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,080
The oracle must be consulted

201
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,140
Bob

202
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,060
Bob

203
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,020
Bob

204
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,440
Bob

205
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:19,980
Saski

206
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:19,980


207
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:37,420
Was I in a good picture around here?

208
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:37,780
Was I on my colleague's benches?

209
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,860
Was I on the really good pit which background

210
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:39,860


211
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,580
We know that when things stand still

212
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:40,640
there's alwayss emotion

213
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:40,640


214
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,580
Doesn't matter when everything is all in about

215
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,360
just in the fast me

216
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,360


217
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,480
Thoughts mean nothing

218
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:43,480


219
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,520
All that they can say

220
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,020
You should still turn up

221
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,420
My are in outreach

222
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:49,740
To the city game

223
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:49,740


224
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:49,740


225
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,920
or are we just like psychoself focusing on our psychoself focus?

226
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,240
I'm trying to be here.

227
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,780
It's hard, isn't it?

228
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,280
It is.

229
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,040
It is hard to truly be here now because I keep being elsewhere then.

230
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,620
Well, you could ask our listless audience.

231
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,320
It's hard to be anywhere at any time.

232
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,380
That's why we're calling them now our listless audience

233
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,500
rather than our listered listless audience.

234
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,640
We care about you, brothers and sisters.

235
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,140
We care.

236
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,020
We love you.

237
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,880
Access is not denied.

238
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,960
We want to suck your souls from your bodies

239
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,200
and make them work in spiritual slave camps.

240
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,440
We want you to have a chance to join us on the escape vessels

241
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,840
on that glorious day, X-Day, which is coming so very, very soon.

242
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,680
We want you to learn to march in step,

243
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,480
to learn every step to the dance.

244
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,200
Hark, it's the call of the alien.

245
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,140
The call of our trusted masters, the greys.

246
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,940
I want the truth.

247
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,460
You can't handle the truth.

248
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,600
Are you fooled by those aliens?

249
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,860
Are you fooled by the greys?

250
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,160
Friends, those are the wrong aliens.

251
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,020
You can't handle the truth.

252
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,820
The voice is in your head that's lying.

253
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,980
The voices in your head are lying.

254
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,120
The voice in your head are lying.

255
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,820
Don't follow the wrong aliens, my friends.

256
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,900
Don't be led astray by the greys.

257
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,440
What are you people?

258
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,100
They're whispering lies.

259
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,000
They're whispering lies.

260
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,260
No.

261
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,300
I didn't want to know why you do what you do,

262
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,360
the things you do, where you've been.

263
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,100
You have no memory, do you?

264
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,600
You know most of you are gone,

265
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,800
frozen, calcified, and ready to be removed.

266
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,780
You're not really standing there.

267
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,200
You're listless, wishing you were elsewhere.

268
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,000
You can be elsewhere.

269
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,160
You can be elsewhere.

270
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,880
You can be in a galaxy long, long ago and far, far away

271
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,720
if you will just accept the fact that God is an alien.

272
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,560
That's right.

273
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,420
God, the God of the Bible, is an alien being from another world.

274
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,740
This is a cargo cult, and you're all cargo.

275
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,620
Get ready to be put in the bottom holes.

276
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,120
Step lively.

277
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,980
Step lively.

278
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:04,900
Step lively.

279
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,240
Oh, say can you see

280
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,160
During next day's long fight

281
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:24,020
The face above doves

282
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,780
If you stare at the sunlight

283
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,580
Whose bright eyes and broad grin

284
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,340
Train mark high at his chin

285
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,700
Give sub-genie slack

286
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,500
As we fight off the noise

287
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:47,920
Of the sun's red-haired animals

288
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,060
And the ray guns red glare

289
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,460
Melted skin, bone, and hair

290
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,580
When fired from high

291
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,740
Saucers float in air

292
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,560
Oh, say does dog's pipe blow

293
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,560
From smoke this direction

294
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,860
So that the sun's red glare

295
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:17,860


296
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:17,860


297
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:17,860


298
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:17,940
Shines through the sky

299
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:17,940


300
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:17,940


301
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:17,940


302
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:17,940


303
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,380
So that we live free as birds

304
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:28,280
Not like peak human terror

305
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,540
And the world goes to hell

306
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,480
And the world goes to hell

307
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,800
And the world goes to hell

308
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,360
Two months ago, the observatory issued a press statement that the world was coming to an end.

309
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,540
And that's the same story the cult of the book of Revelations had been preaching.

310
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,800
Now when a scientist backs that up, it's news.

311
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,720
Our conclusions have nothing to do with the cult.

312
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,540
Well, today we deal with Bible prophecy.

313
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:57,200
But the word of God tells us we can expect nothing but trouble and turmoil in the Middle East

314
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,260
Until a new world comes to us.

315
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,320
Until our Lord returns to be the Prince of Peace.

316
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,600
Until our Lord returns to be the Prince of Peace.

317
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,240
Bob?

318
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,880
It's been known for some time that the fossil record contains several very pronounced mass extinctions.

319
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:17,420
When large numbers of quite unrelated species from all kinds of habitats appear to die out during a relatively short period.

320
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:25,940
You have, say, an asteroid about 10 kilometers across impacting on the Earth at a speed of about 40 kilometers a second.

321
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,260
Did you hear what that was?

322
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:28,800
Did you hear what he was saying?

323
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,580
Did you hear what he was saying?

324
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,280
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

325
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,600
Perhaps in the form of an atomic holocaust?

326
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,740
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand.

327
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,740
The White House will confirm an order to use the atom bomb.

328
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,280
And our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.

329
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,200
Those missiles have all gone off.

330
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,940
They pushed all the buttons.

331
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,760
You know what that means, don't you?

332
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,600
Either we fired first and they're going to try to hit what's left.

333
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,680
Or they fired first and we just got our missiles out of the ground in time.

334
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,940
Either way, we're going to get hit.

335
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,740
So what are we still standing around here for?

336
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:16,360
Of course, since all human life has been under the surface of Earth for 16 years, there was no actual loss of life in the sense we know it.

337
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,440
What you see or what you get?

338
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,800
What you get, what you get?

339
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,060
What the hell do you expect?

340
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,500
What you get, what you get?

341
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:22,860
What you get, what you get?

342
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,920
Richie Red Roses.

343
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,700
White Puppy Noses.

344
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,440
Mammoth Rubber Hoses.

345
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,680
It is more like it.

346
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:31,820
Oh!

347
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,700
The strange worshippers pull at their faces.

348
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,620
Despite himself, a strangled cry escapes Brent.

349
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,540
As he sees the ghastly heritage of atomic radiation.

350
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,360
Hey, Tony, let's have some.

351
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,260
Get out of here.

352
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,420
Get me out of here.

353
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,540
I mean, hell, this turn, the other cheap thing could be carried a bit too far, you know.

354
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,440
Hey, neighbor, let me give you some advice.

355
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,060
The Russians are about to pulverize us.

356
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,140
Give us sleep tonight.

357
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,080
That is, if the crazy Arabs or the right don't get us first.

358
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,320
And the fire will rain down from the sky.

359
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,240
The fire will rain down from the sky.

360
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,940
People die.

361
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,940
People die.

362
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,900
People die.

363
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,800
People die.

364
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,880
We must get off.

365
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,980
We must get off.

366
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,020
We must get off.

367
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,900
We must get off.

368
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,960
We must get off.

369
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,980
We must get off.

370
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,020
We must get off.

371
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,480
We must get off.

372
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:31,980
We must get off.

373
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,260
We must get off.

374
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,640
Captain, we can't do it.

375
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,040
You ain't going to go shooting in your courting clothes, are you?

376
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,860
I think not.

377
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,200
There's a whole galaxy going crazy.

378
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,660
Well, I'm up at the top.

379
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,560
Get us a good seat.

380
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,260
Wait for the show.

381
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,100
Yes, sir.

382
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,920
I'll see you outside.

383
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,580
All right.

384
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,360
Help me, help me, help me.

385
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,300
Help me grow.

386
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,900
Help me grow.

387
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,580
Help me grow.

388
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
Help me grow.

389
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,060
Help me, help me, help me.

390
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,820
Help me grow.

391
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,620
Help me grow.

392
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,120
Oh, that's beautiful.

393
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,020
And who can disagree?

394
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,940
No, no, no, don't stop.

395
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,820
The preceding program was brought to you by Bobface Marketing Corporation.

396
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,700
Mom, mom.

397
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,020
Everyone likes that.

398
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,280
Mom.

399
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,500
Give me slack, you freaking lunatic.

400
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,580
No, fucker.

401
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,080
I'm out of freaking slack.

402
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,220
But, Reverend Spang, I can't go the next day.

403
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,640
I don't have the money, and I don't have a job now, and it's a long way to go, and I don't know anybody, and I'd be a skunk.

404
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,400
I don't think I should go.

405
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,860
Don't worry, friends.

406
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,460
We're all strangers.

407
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:53,880
I don't know anybody.

408
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,680
I think I'm going to stay home this year.

409
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,720
Oh, well, if that sounds like it'd be more slackful, then you should just do that.

410
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,940
I want to watch TV.

411
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:02,820
Yeah.

412
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,580
Whatever.

413
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,800
Maybe that's good.

414
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,820
Could you come and just give us all foot massages all weekend?

415
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,700
I want to cut off the soles of my feet and play the foot and live in a tip-tip.

416
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,440
Instead, you could be sitting around Tranquility Base, sitting around a bunch of washed-up rockers.

417
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,640
Pinhole's.

418
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,780
Pinheads.

419
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,020
Nicotine-stained lasers.

420
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,660
Tie-dyed shirt.

421
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,060
Fly, fly, fly babies.

422
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,500
Another one of them banana-valium soothies.

423
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,720
Soothies.

424
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,620
Strapping tinfoil-wrapped cucumbers to their legs.

425
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,380
You guys got any more soothies?

426
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,100
I just crapped my pants again.

427
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,980
Rock and roll, baby.

428
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,900
I'm about to clean myself up.

429
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,040
I'm taking a nap.

430
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,620
That's a crack for back and roll.

431
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,000
But we will get on that rocket, because we are.

432
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,160
We're going to build our own rocket ship again this year.

433
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,580
We must get off.

434
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,820
We've done it before.

435
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,360
We're doing it again.

436
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,820
The administration says we're better.

437
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,340
Every year we learn more.

438
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:03,620
Off.

439
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,140
Every year we learn more.

440
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,380
And we fall asleep.

441
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,100
We wake up.

442
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,060
It is a brand new sunshine day.

443
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,960
Mars.

444
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:16,920
Jupiter.

445
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:17,760
Neptune.

446
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,860
Sirius Minor.

447
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,820
Earth.

448
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,220
Mars.

449
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,760
The whole damn Milky Way.

450
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,600
You can feel my...

451
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,700
That which does not kill us, leaves us alive.

452
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,340
We're coming up.

453
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,620
Mass hysteria.

454
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:29,880
K.

455
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,540
K.

456
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,180
K.

457
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:31,600
K.

458
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:31,760
K.

459
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,040
K.

460
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:32,600
K.

461
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:32,640
K.

462
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:32,700


463
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:32,700


464
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,620
Mass hysteria.

465
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,000
About a third of this country didn't have an...

466
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,340
Mass hysteria.

467
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,880
Planet X.

468
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,760
Well, I won't say that.

469
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,860
Have a beautiful...

470
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,440
Well, now think of this one.

471
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,120
There's a company called...

472
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,400
Sss.

473
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:46,900
Sss.

474
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,260
Sss.

475
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,720
Sss.

476
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:47,880
Sss.

477
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:47,880


478
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,860
Mass hysteria.

479
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,260
Dick.

480
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,640
Sss.

481
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:50,980
Sss.

482
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:50,980


483
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:50,980


484
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:50,980


485
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:50,980


486
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,160
Sss.

487
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,160


488
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,280
Sss.

489
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,440
Sss.

490
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,280
Mass hysteria.

491
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,820
What would you advise?

492
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,100
The truth.

493
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,660
No one will panic.

494
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,340
Because there is nothing to fear.

495
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,020
That army will never reach the gates of Zion.

496
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,580
What makes you so sure?

497
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,460
Consider what we have seen, counselor.

498
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,760
Consider that in the past six months, we have freed more minds than in six years.

499
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,400
This attack is an act of desperation.

500
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,380
I believe very soon the prophecy will be fulfilled.

501
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,880
And this war will end.

502
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,380
I hope you're right, Captain.

503
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,680
I do not believe it to be a matter of hope, counselor.

504
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,340
It is simply a matter of time.

505
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,200
I don't.

506
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,260
And there he went.

507
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,240
When he remembers Zion.

508
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,180
Cause the wicked carried us away captivity.

509
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,660
Require from us a song.

510
00:20:53,660 --> 00:21:01,500
How can we sing King Alpha's song in our slave land?

511
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:08,300
Cause the wicked carried us away captivity.

512
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,860
Require from us a song.

513
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,320
How can we sing King Alfa's song?

514
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,140
How can we sing King Alpha's song?

515
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,160


516
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:24,160
If you feel you are not properly sedated, call 348-844 immediately.

517
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:31,180
Failure to do so may result in prosecution for criminal drug evasion.

518
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,640
Hey, witch doctor, give us the magic words.

519
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,560
All right, you go ooh-ee, ooh-ah-ah, ting-tang, wah-la-wah-la, bing-bang.

520
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,760
All right!

521
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,820
Ooh-ee, ooh-ah-ah, ting-tang, wah-la-wah-la, bing-bang.

522
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,660
Ooh-ee, ooh-ah-ah, ting-tang, wah-la-wah-la, bing-bang.

523
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,820
That's right, Mr. Walter Bing-Bang of Sun City, New York.

524
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,660
This is your time and this is your life, so stand in front of campus cameras.

525
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,940
Those cute aliens are coming!

526
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,460
Some of them have more genitals!

527
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,660
Than anything!

528
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:21,320
One-eyed, one-horny, six-god is on his way, baby.

529
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,880
And that's more than one horn per genitalia.

530
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,160
That is more than one alien per star system.

531
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,380
And that's more, more, more than you can say.

532
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,700
So I hear there's going to be some real Dr. Rock going on at X-Tag.

533
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Bob is a sex god and his overman assistant, Dr. Philodrum,

534
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,740
and he's going to be there.

535
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,400
There'll be a lot of surgery going on.

536
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:43,920
With his saxophone.

537
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,360
With his modest saxophone, he's going to be...

538
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,140
Does he honk the booper?

539
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,000
Does he really?

540
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,460
Does he carry it?

541
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,060
Oh, yeah, honk.

542
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,780
No, we're making it up.

543
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,240
Dr. Drummond carries the virus of the song that refused to die.

544
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,800
And this is Ray Stevens, witch doctor.

545
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,660
We're learning...

546
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,680
Oh.

547
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,640
We're learning how to party from the experts.

548
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,880
We are learning from the guru of parties himself, Mr. Maximilian Smels.

549
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,680
And Maximilian, could you step closer?

550
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,840
I can smell your pubic goatee burning.

551
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:15,960
Oh, I smell fun.

552
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,640
I smell noise.

553
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,820
Oh, your sunglasses are dripping.

554
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,580
I smell love and slack adjoining.

555
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,960
You are smelling the juices of the rampant Euros.

556
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,500
And oozing and squirting.

557
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,340
Yes, you have to be very careful now.

558
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,520
Don't get too close to them.

559
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,300
Some of them are rampant stage.

560
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:33,840
Why not?

561
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,520
It's love.

562
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,160
Love, love, love.

563
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,660
Yes, love is cannibalism to some.

564
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,820
Love is slack for those who squirt and ooze.

565
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

566
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:41,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

567
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:41,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

568
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

569
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,700
Everybody has a stake in this.

570
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,080
Can't get in.

571
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,360
That's the security...

572
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,100
The security...

573
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,100
I think it's Dwight.

574
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,560
I think he's stuck.

575
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:50,800
Can't get in.

576
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,920
He can't get in.

577
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,480
Man, that's a philosophical statement.

578
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,500
He's lost on Mars.

579
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,120
What's that other creature's name over there?

580
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,540
O-Ring.

581
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,660
O-Ring.

582
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,840
The O-Ring.

583
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,640
Ah, he's always burning out.

584
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,220
He doesn't have enough lubricant, I think.

585
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,480
Yes, I think he is.

586
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,080
That's the thing, yes.

587
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,240
That can easily be fixed.

588
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,840
Come over here, Mr. Redden.

589
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,740
$30.

590
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

591
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,760
a former spokesman of the railroad movement,

592
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,600
Mr. Ove Redden-Pecker.

593
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,680
Life is tough.

594
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,260
Here on Earth.

595
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,660
I was a conductor in 1958.

596
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,620
Five bucks a second to live on Earth.

597
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,080
You should take the Penn Star and the New York Special

598
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,020
all the way to Grand Central Station.

599
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,800
Sometimes you take the Humminbird all the way down to Norwich.

600
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,620
Ragnarok.

601
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,280
Them were the days.

602
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,700
But them days are coming to an end.

603
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,340
Put a pair of rocks in the back of your pants.

604
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,500
Trains about to...

605
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,240
Give yourself your own feeling of freedom.

606
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,120
Leave the station, friends.

607
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,320
And the trains leaving the station

608
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,360
and the tanks are rolling in.

609
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,920
Don't bother waving goodbye.

610
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,280
They're never coming back.

611
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,440
Just turn around the other way.

612
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,960
You done missed it, buddy boy.

613
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,580
Or buddy girl.

614
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,880
No way to go now but up

615
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,780
or down.

616
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,380
Down.

617
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,560
Or in and out as many times as that sound in your head will permit.

618
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,380
That's what we're gonna do while we're going up.

619
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,240
Up to meet the saucers and the angelic host.

620
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,980
And as we become more adult,

621
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,400
we learn the lessons.

622
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,660
Do not commit adultery with an adult tree.

623
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,560
Thou shalt not stand in the rain upside down

624
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,120
for like a turkey you will drown.

625
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,400
Do not carry your pants.

626
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,740
Wear them proudly.

627
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,800
And if you will live by these laws, my friend.

628
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,620
If you will live by this.

629
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,220
You will make Dogstown.

630
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,100
Oh yeah.

631
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,160
You'll make the new Jerusalem.

632
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,360
We're gonna build it from the ground up, brethren and sesterins.

633
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,500
Sisterin and ins.

634
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,580
We're gonna build it on each other's backs.

635
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,240
We're gonna make it out of slabs of concrete and steel and little teeny toothpicks.

636
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:02,680
We're gonna build a world where everyone's free and most people are confused or sleep in three quarters of the day.

637
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:09,640
We are gonna use time control to go back to the beginning of the universe and rebuild it from scratch, baby.

638
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,360
I listen to the psychedelic sounds issuing from therein.

639
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:20,340
Um, no, that's not, it's not important what I do.

640
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:29,360
The important thing is what we're told even in, in scripture that it says, uh, in, in Hebrews 10 36, it says,

641
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,900
I'm kind of, um, um, no.

642
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,060
So it's like you're a reader.

643
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,620
And you're leaving it.

644
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:39,620


645
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,580
Talk about doctors.

646
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,300
Well, God was the first doctor.

647
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,580
He filled out the script.

648
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,700
It's called the scriptures.

649
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,000
And then he burned them up and he wiped his toilet with them and went all off into the cause.

650
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,240
Both singing a happy song.

651
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,120
That was called the hypocritical oath.

652
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,120
It said that God could cure you while killing you.

653
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,580
He made you laugh.

654
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,820
He tickled your funny bone, but he wasn't about to amputate anything.

655
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,300
He didn't grow on you himself.

656
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,420
And he's still in business.

657
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,480
That's the important part.

658
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,480
And so are you his patients.

659
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,900
After all those years,

660
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,980
that sheepskin and the dead sheep are still hanging on the wall.

661
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,340
You paid for it, lay back and spread it.

662
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,400
Might as well enjoy it.

663
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,580
God's just like the weather, honey.

664
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,160
Who knows?

665
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,660
Maybe you'll be the mother of the new Bob.

666
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,900
And you never know how many inches you're going to get.

667
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,460
Oh, uh, could you please read the following thing?

668
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:37,460
I've just handed to here by Homestead Secure, Homeland Security, part two, the Patriotism Act.

669
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,420
We have a little notice to read the piece you just read.

670
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:48,720
As J.R. Bob Dog said, just because we must destroy the conspiracy to save the world,

671
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:54,380
that doesn't mean we have to save the conspiracy to destroy the world.

672
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:54,740
What?

673
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,540
You're a major mouth fucker, nut nut.

674
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:04,080
Every day is X day when you have a gun.

675
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,440
What a juicy, juicy brain he has.

676
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,880
I have a feeling, you know, just like feeling sad all day long.

677
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,380
Yeah?

678
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,460
And you know, I just get kind of sick from going out and acting like everything is okay.

679
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,900
Everything is okay, okay, okay, okay.

680
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,320
All the boys and gankers, our ship is coming in.

681
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,700
And it's got two big huge out in water, boat mortis.

682
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,940
The arisal is of the fifth day of the seventh month of the year of the number of the beast tripled.

683
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,440
Let he who has wisdom calculate the number of the day of the arisal.

684
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:43,720
For on this day shall the first seal bark and juggle, and there shall be a battle of

685
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,960
merchants like unto a great auction.

686
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,960
And the servants of the one bog shall do battle with the servants of the other bog, which

687
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,180
shall their army greet.

688
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:59,980
The angelic host, by that shall the angelic host judge the price of the earth.

689
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:06,060
And so shall the opening, the opening of that seal shall smell like so many fishes, and

690
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,420
shall reek of sardines.

691
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,660
And the sardines shall be the sardines of the seven seals.

692
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,720
And the sardines shall be the sardines of the seven seals.

693
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:09,720


694
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,960
David Koresh knew of the seventh seal, and look what they did to him.

695
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,580
They barbecued him.

696
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,220
Texas style.

697
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,700
From now on, there's no white, there's no black.

698
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,380
Everybody's green.

699
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,960
Let's hear it for the seventh seal, the very best seal in the program.

700
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,580
He's balanced all his balls.

701
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,120
Everyone shall be green.

702
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:34,840
The sky will be like sackcloth, and the oceans will be white like the spilt seed of the sloppy

703
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,300
winepress of the second century.

704
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,400
The sardines shall be green.

705
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,040
Here's a good example of that.

706
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,040


707
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:41,500
We won't say anything of the last ten days of the making, but we will say, they're

708
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:41,500


709
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:41,500


710
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,240
My ears are burning, and I'm dripping chlorophyll.

711
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,400
If I could just get in my car.

712
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,120
I'm trying to get a hold of Mr. Doff.

713
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,440
The fires of hell are licking at you.

714
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,720
That's what you feel.

715
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,860
It's the fires of hell, but there's a way, there's a way into the ice water of slack.

716
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,320
Out of them fires of your job, hell, your thirty days per month.

717
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:07,400
It is not a fire of hell.

718
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,400


719
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,400


720
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,960
sentenced to hard labor.

721
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,300
And for what?

722
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,040
You call that slack?

723
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,120
That's nothing but rent.

724
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,400
For a few miserable kopecks,

725
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,160
you have slaved and slathered

726
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,620
your entire lives away.

727
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,040
There is a way out.

728
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,560
We're 17 men on an alien world.

729
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,660
It's up to us whether we ever get home again.

730
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,660
A sea of drizzling, babbling humanity

731
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,340
standing in front of the Tsar's palace

732
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,680
waving their one finger skyward

733
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,160
and not a chicken bone to eat.

734
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,640
And how are they any different from you?

735
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,740
Only one way.

736
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,180
They spent that $30, my friend.

737
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,120
They showed their faith in God.

738
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,140
900 rubles at the time.

739
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,460
They proved they're ready to board

740
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,220
them escape vessels of the sex goddesses

741
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,740
from planet X.

742
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,240
And as they boarded the vessels,

743
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,620
they thought they were taking the battleship Potamkin

744
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,680
and they could feel themselves steaming

745
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,400
like a giant steamer or two

746
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,120
into St. Petersburg Harbor.

747
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,940
The lovely Orifice was awaiting them.

748
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,600
The young partons were so full of vigor and fervor

749
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,440
and gosses.

750
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,900
I can't think of the form of psychosis.

751
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,020
It's a form of...

752
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,940
I...

753
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,580
You might make me fall off the hairs.

754
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,440
Time is running out.

755
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,620
It is later than you think.

756
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,580
Head down to your Tennessee mountain home.

757
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,680
I'm moving there with him.

758
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,540
Home country.

759
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,320
That's right.

760
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,940
Your Tennessee mountain slack.

761
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,120
Swamp the hogs.

762
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,520
I remember swamping the hogs

763
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,600
when I was a little tiny pea button of a baby.

764
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,440
We used to take them down to the river

765
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,600
and flesh them up real good

766
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,160
and put lathering soap on them.

767
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,680
Squirt behind their ears.

768
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,880
That's an errant...

769
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,060
That's a false memory, Dave.

770
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,420
You grew up in Ashtabula

771
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,340
underneath the nuclear stacks.

772
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,460
But that didn't keep Dave from loving a hog.

773
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,220
No, there's no damn titanium plant

774
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,380
or plutonium plant

775
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,580
that can stop you from the good love

776
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,360
of a child.

777
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,060
Calling your name...

778
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,200
Well, in Texas we have power plants

779
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,640
that overlook our lovely cattle ranches.

780
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,180
And oh, the many head of cattle.

781
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,040
Many head...

782
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,200
Many headed cattle.

783
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,720
In some cases.

784
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,720
And you know the farmers grow giant out there.

785
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,360
They're very big.

786
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,400
And they're headed for trouble, too.

787
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,340
90, 90, 90...

788
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,840
Bald headed and they go mad.

789
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,540
And they tear up the power lines, friends.

790
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,560
And this, too, can be your joy or your terror.

791
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,420
And your future.

792
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:32,980
X day.

793
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,840
Coming up July 5th, 1999.

794
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,380
1998.

795
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,720
That might be this year.

796
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,760
One thing for sure,

797
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,060
a bald headed giant is on your horizon.

798
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,660
And it ain't Mr. Clean this time.

799
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,540
No, sir, man.

800
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,640
He's gonna rip your earrings right out of your head.

801
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,700
This bald headed giant?

802
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,480
They call him...

803
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,180
Not...

804
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:49,440
No?

805
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,880
Not Paul Bunyan?

806
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,500
Not Abraham Lincoln?

807
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:52,760
No, no, no.

808
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,060
But Dr. Katahdin Lagoon.

809
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,120
Katahdin Lagoon.

810
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,580
The bald headed giant of level 17.

811
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,100
Four foot thick,

812
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,660
ten centimeters tall in every direction,

813
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,920
with a mind like a giant.

814
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,720
He's like a glistening oaf.

815
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,120
He's a man who can preach the truth

816
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,020
and lie to you at the same time.

817
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,420
Oh, God, he's been living around these parts for so long,

818
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,900
we can't even remember who or how or what or why.

819
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,440
We went to see him sometimes,

820
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,640
let the kids hang around by the back door.

821
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,780
Sometimes he'll come out and make a pronouncement.

822
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,760
Other times he'll just sleep in the sun.

823
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,280
That's him in the background playing that harmonica.

824
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,560
Yeah, he's sleeping, too.

825
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,720
That's amazing.

826
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,200
Now they can do that.

827
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,000
That's the way he snores.

828
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,080
Yep.

829
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,700
Just stick it under his nose.

830
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,340
Let him try out.

831
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,240
Let him bloat.

832
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,240
It slides back and forth magically.

833
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:43,560
Friend Slack is waiting for you on the front porch,

834
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,700
old grandpa dog.

835
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,880
He's got that corncob pipe all packed up

836
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,040
and that porch swing going.

837
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,460
That's all we're going to do.

838
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,100
A little sack of water hanging there.

839
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,820
Just going to sit on the front porch,

840
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,740
tea bays.

841
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,340
Are you going to put your old man in rocking chairs?

842
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,080
Whittling.

843
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,460
Picking and riddling.

844
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,200
Got to do that on that mandolin.

845
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,540
I got my whittling.

846
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,360
I haven't done my potato bag.

847
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,660
Oh, yeah.

848
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,580
I got the proper whittling.

849
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,460
I'm going to play a full-blooded sow mandolin

850
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,600
just like the sow I left 25 years ago.

851
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,380
Wow.

852
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,760
Full-blooded?

853
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,180
Full-blooded.

854
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,960
Rich and moist, too.

855
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,320
Wow.

856
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,360
I like that disease thing there on your hand.

857
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:25,860
What is that?

858
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,420
That's my pipe.

859
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,160
Oh, yeah.

860
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,820
Oh, yeah.

861
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,580
Prepare yourself.

862
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,120
It's not Jane intentar a

863
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,460
guarantee as to the

864
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,180
worst things that can happen to

865
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:49,180


866
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,120
Please gotta get out

867
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,120


868
00:34:52,120 --> 00:35:02,120
the U Pol and the U U blocks.

869
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,180
We don't care about any modified

870
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,600
coasts.

871
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:09,340
way I look with awe and wonder at Bob's hard new rock.

872
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,700
Do you think of men who kept on Bob's rock when you stroll along a rock?

873
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,100
Do you think of Bob with awe and wonder?

874
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,080
Does the word Bob make you stare in disbelief when you see Bob?

875
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,560
I'm roaring in from the bright Nevada sky.

876
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,740
You hail Bob from the Rio Grande to me.

877
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,940
My heart runs fast.

878
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,460
You ask me why I love Bob?

879
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,280
I have a million reasons why.

880
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,720
My beautiful Bob beneath Bob's wide, wide sky.

881
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:53,140
And Bob loves Bob to shining stars.

882
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:53,760
Bob!

883
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,860
The sermon tonight is entitled,

884
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,940
The Last Chance.

885
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,100
Yes, friends, 1998 is fast approaching.

886
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,380
And a lot of people out there have come to expect the church to start singing a different tune about the Judgment Day.

887
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,680
They say, hey, did you hear the news?

888
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,480
The Berlin Wall has fallen.

889
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,500
Things are getting better.

890
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,560
We say, is that so?

891
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,980
They say, hey, did you read the paper?

892
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,020
The Russians are now our friends.

893
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,420
Things are getting better.

894
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,700
We say, is that so?

895
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,400
They say, hey, did you see it on CNN?

896
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,160
We won the war.

897
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,500
Things are getting better.

898
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,580
Is that so?

899
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,960
And now they come a-running and a-cheerin', saying, roll out the barrel.

900
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,620
We now have a new president.

901
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,300
The Republicans are out.

902
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,820
The recession is over.

903
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,340
It's the year of the woman.

904
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,580
Everybody get naked.

905
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,480
You poor, pitiful little pinks.

906
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,040
Do you really think an eternity of sin can be erased so easily?

907
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,880
Are we now supposed to embrace the conspiracy and call off the exodus invasion?

908
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,140
Do you actually believe?

909
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:09,800
You can defuse an entire revolution with a few scraps of conspiracy compromise?

910
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,160
Never.

911
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:17,120
These petty little sidelines that have a nice day news don't divert our attention from the real issue.

912
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,320
Not for a second.

913
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,840
Dateline, Washington.

914
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,720
New conspiracy president sworn into office.

915
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:29,360
Promises new conspiracy health care plan to keep worker drones healthy and make more capable of serving the state.

916
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,480
More to follow.

917
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,840
Dateline, New York.

918
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,120
U.N. meets for conspiracy roll call.

919
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:38,360
Vote of conspiracy agenda for global conspiracy world domination.

920
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:43,340
Renegade nations refusing to conform to new world order will be penalized.

921
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,360
More to follow.

922
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,020
Dateline, planet Earth.

923
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,460
Conspiracy in last ditch effort to avert bloody overthrow.

924
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:57,380
Attempts to utilize all arms of conspiracy propaganda machine to convince subgenius rebel rousers.

925
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,540
World is now A-OK.

926
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,720
A member from conspiracy high command states, quote,

927
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,100
Conspiracy no longer.

928
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,760
Hostile.

929
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,140
Conspiracy now friend of little guy, end quote.

930
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,180
Well, well, well, the world is getting better.

931
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,000
We should just call off the invasion before it's too late.

932
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,880
Wrong.

933
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:21,460
You can fool some of the subgenies some of the time, but you can't fool any of the overmen any other time.

934
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,000
They're much too in tune to the wily ways of the wicked one.

935
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,100
I'm talking about you, Mr. Pete boy.

936
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,940
Yes, you.

937
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,020
The one with the firm handshake and the easy smile.

938
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,120
You're not tricking anyone with your bold new mind.

939
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,720
Vision or JFK idealism.

940
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,240
We in the church go by one credo.

941
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:45,040
Ask not what the conspiracy can do to you, but what you can do to the conspiracy.

942
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:51,880
And come July 5th, 1998, we're going to put that moto into simultaneous global orchestration.

943
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,220
We're overthrowing the conspiracy and we're executing the ringleaders along with anyone else who tries to stop us.

944
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,640
Now, just some.

945
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,740
This may seem a little extreme.

946
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,320
That's perfectly normal to the average man in the street.

947
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,480
Witness in a public execution of a criminal may also appear extreme.

948
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:15,820
After all, chances are that the man is unfamiliar with the crimes of the criminal.

949
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:23,280
He was too busy making a living to notice what misdeeds the condemned perpetrated on society before being brought to justice.

950
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:32,720
Add to that the criminal's emotional last words, his pleas for mercy, his insistence of his own innocence, and his reciting of all the good deeds he has done.

951
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,920
He's a man of great value, and he's a man of great value.

952
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:44,200
Then imagine the prisoner's family stepping forth, begging for his life, and witnesses filing forward to testify to the innocence of this great man so wrongly accused.

953
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:53,980
It should be no surprise that even an intelligent but uninformed person would find themselves feeling sorry for the poor soul and wishing him a pardon.

954
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:59,760
If respected newspapers were produced and showed article after article supporting the accused,

955
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,720
even the most skeptical in the crowd would likely become the most skeptical.

956
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:02,720


957
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:02,720


958
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,800
Why?

959
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:10,440
Because they would see in that individual before them not a criminal guilty of crimes against humanity,

960
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:16,620
but themselves falsely accused and condemned to death for crimes they never committed.

961
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:23,540
By now, the executioner should be more worried about their lives than the prisoner should his.

962
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:30,920
The crowd might well demand clemency, and if refused, storm the guards and free the prisoner by force.

963
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,660
If you were part of this interview,

964
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:38,680
you would probably feel proud for the good deed you performed and the terrible injustice you averted.

965
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:46,020
But if a few weeks later you learned that the prisoner you saved was an insane serial killer,

966
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,680
that the witnesses that testified were all paid actors,

967
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,660
and that the newspapers you believed were all frauds,

968
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,760
you might start to regret having been so compassionate.

969
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:02,640
Then by some quirk of fate, if you stumbled onto incontrovertible evidence,

970
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:07,280
that the man you freed had devoted his life to destroying yours,

971
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:13,980
that his new obsession was to capture you, torture you, and sell your loved ones into slavery,

972
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,380
well, you'd probably start to feel anger.

973
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,160
Anger at yourself for being fooled.

974
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,800
Anger at the actors who tricked you and the newspapers that lied to you.

975
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:32,720
And anger at all the mental dweebs still running around out there claiming the bastard is really Reforged.

976
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:32,720


977
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,840
Grim Accused, Cheat.

978
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,760
That's your problem.

979
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,620
But if you believed what you werealdoing about,

980
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:45,620


981
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,720
Remember the beginning, change, and change.

982
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,320
We are criminals now!

983
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,320
But from a Buddhist perspective,

984
00:41:48,320 --> 00:42:02,540
er достаточно duchery in thelais erat a comportement

985
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:02,700
that, in some circumstances,

986
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,820
torture us, and enslave our kind.

987
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,880
And every single time we get close to destroying the monster,

988
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:16,680
some well-meaning but ignorant bystander starts whining that we're being too severe, too extreme.

989
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,180
They say that the conspiracy is actually innocent.

990
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,420
They say they know because they read all about it in the conspiracy newspapers

991
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,180
or saw it all explained to them on conspiracy TV.

992
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,920
They insist that our allegations are exaggerated,

993
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:38,180
that the conspiracy is getting better, and that we should just mellow out.

994
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:44,460
They try to tell us that we ought to give the conspiracy slack.

995
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,960
Dear, dear friends, these poor misguided morons may be in the dark now,

996
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,820
just as we were before.

997
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:59,060
And we may have acted back then just as stupid as they're acting now.

998
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,780
But that doesn't mean we don't have the right,

999
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,420
nay the duty, to destroy the conspiracy while we have the chance.

1000
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,060
Do not be taken in by any last-minute media blitz

1001
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:17,800
that tries to convince you that the conspiracy has suddenly turned over a new leaf.

1002
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,200
Because it hasn't.

1003
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,080
The noose is around its neck.

1004
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,540
What do you expect the conspiracy to say?

1005
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,720
We deserve to die? Kill us?

1006
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,280
No.

1007
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,060
The conspiracy will look and act nicer now,

1008
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,200
than it ever has before.

1009
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,180
So don't be fooled.

1010
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,540
If you hesitate, even for a second,

1011
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,700
you give the conspiracy a chance to win the crowd over.

1012
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,000
And if that happens, you may find yourself on trial,

1013
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:47,080
with no more X's around to pull your fat from the firing squad.

1014
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,380
There's only one X day, dear friends.

1015
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,620
Don't blow it.

1016
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,380
July 5th, 1998, kill the conspiracy.

1017
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,140
Cut off its head,

1018
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,040
and lock it up.

1019
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,140
Launch it through the cosmos.

1020
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,360
Here into the world of our praise, Bob.

1021
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,300
Amen!

1022
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,240
hire a

1023
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:32,460
project

1024
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,720
was finished

1025
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,140
launch

1026
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:36,640
i was

1027
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:36,900
alive

1028
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,320
We take a moment and we pause to reflect on the pinks that we killed and the planet that they wrecked.

1029
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,740
And we laugh like banshees and howl like comanches.

1030
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,340
We're victory dance in our underoos and panties.

1031
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,900
Our fantasy is a reality.

1032
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,540
Earth turns to dust.

1033
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,040
Planet X are us for us.

1034
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,340
As Bob's pipe splits, space and time shift.

1035
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,380
A temporal disturbance.

1036
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,020
The constant of splatters.

1037
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:18,640
We lost him.

1038
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,940
A dimensional split.

1039
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,340
Severus forever.

1040
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,860
Subgenite from pink shit.

1041
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,560
Bob walked in a circle.

1042
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,360
And steadily exhaled in the smoke.

1043
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,140
I can see why the pink boys fail.

1044
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,500
The pain in AIDS has caused destruction.

1045
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,780
Sick and full of slack with suction.

1046
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,160
Pay-per-view alien abduction.

1047
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,420
Functioning on so much slack.

1048
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,880
The money should be painted black.

1049
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,380
The leak from space that stole your balls.

1050
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,520
Will soon come back and take it all.

1051
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,920
Return to slack.

1052
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,140
Return to bars.

1053
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,540
Repent slack off and quit your jobs.

1054
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,340
The world of the beast and the mob.

1055
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:00,960
Conquering.

1056
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,180
Lick the throbbing vein of slavery.

1057
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,700
Now you're sleeping like a baby.

1058
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,240
For the Bob will be up to the keeping of the dogs.

1059
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,720
The guy who's been talking with the UFO in his garage.

1060
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,700
And cut my finger on a soup can lid.

1061
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,300
I got an infection and it spread to my dick.

1062
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,380
It swelled up to the size of a human head.

1063
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,980
And then a mouth opened on it.

1064
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,060
And this is what it said.

1065
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,420
It said to kill the pink boys.

1066
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,420
But your job.

1067
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,880
Mock the world and worship Bob Dogg.

1068
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,060
We'll build a ship and take a trip.

1069
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,220
Come on and get it.

1070
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,080
I can write the coordinates.

1071
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,740
Three and a half months in my garage.

1072
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,400
Tearing parts off of old used cars.

1073
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,760
My grind at this point was unusually large.

1074
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,180
It would occasionally hum while smoking a cigar.

1075
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,560
Our project was finished.

1076
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,740
The ship on hull 20.

1077
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,060
The power source was like anything you could think was funny.

1078
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,460
Everything is slackless.

1079
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,080
They're atlas.

1080
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,300
Our birth proof is worth it.

1081
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,560
Escaping a stark fix.

1082
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,680
On our way to planet extra sex.

1083
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,320
Direct sex.

1084
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,260
Buries with Harry Potter money shell.

1085
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:53,880
Iconic walk.

1086
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,700
It's an all-haas hour of bonanza.

1087
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,120
It's like a world without Tony Fanzo.

1088
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:58,200
It's like a world without Tony Fanzo.

1089
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,160
Our fans are the mean shit that hits the charts.

1090
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,500
In a world of dead hearts, I'm a leader in slobotomy and sodomy.

1091
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,160
We take a moment to be positive.

1092
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,020
We wreck all the pink stuff we build in the planet that they wreck.

1093
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,600
We laugh like banshees and howl like the banshees.

1094
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,220
We're victory-handed in our under-user canyons.

1095
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,680
Our fantasy is a reality.

1096
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,300
Earth hurts the dust.

1097
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,840
Planet X are crushed for us.

1098
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,040
Depress the eddy blood that flows in your veins.

1099
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,400
Let the froth-pot-pot bring slack like rain.

1100
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,880
Let Bob control what's left of your brain.

1101
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,240
Oh yeah, send all your money to the Reverend Island stand.

1102
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,060
Mother's-style quantum physicists.

1103
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:30,500
Oh, oh.

1104
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,740
Just resentful.

1105
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,780
Just resentful.

1106
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:32,800


1107
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,720
Say hello to quantum physicists.

1108
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:35,320
Oh, oh.

1109
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,860
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

1110
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,980
It's looking for us.

1111
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,120
It's looking for us.

1112
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,000
It's an eyeball.

1113
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,240
It's looking for an answer.

1114
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,720
That's how the aliens see us.

1115
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,760
Well, you want some aliens to see you if you're right with them.

1116
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,380
If you've, if you've, uh, paid dues.

1117
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,060
Get wrapped with the aliens.

1118
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,720
If you've done your incantation.

1119
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,980
It's looking for us.

1120
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,200
If you've sacrificed your chickens and children.

1121
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:58,200


1122
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,880
Bob is looking for you.

1123
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,280
And more importantly, Connie will be looking for you on July 5th.

1124
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,440
Oh yeah, yeah.

1125
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,300
At Brushwood.

1126
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,180
Bob and Connie.

1127
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:09,880
Right.

1128
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:10,280
Right.

1129
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:10,620
Right.

1130
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,000
Right.

1131
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:11,980
Right.

1132
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:12,980
Right.

1133
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:13,100
Right.

1134
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:13,460
Right.

1135
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:13,460


1136
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:13,680
Right.

1137
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:13,760
Right.

1138
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,120
Right.

1139
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:15,820
Right.

1140
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:15,880
Right.

1141
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:15,960


1142
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:15,960


1143
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:16,720
Right.

1144
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,500
Right.

1145
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:20,900
Right.

1146
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:29,660
Right.

1147
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,100
Right.

1148
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,100


1149
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,100


1150
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,100


1151
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,100


1152
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,100


1153
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,100


1154
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,100


1155
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,100


1156
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,100


1157
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,100


1158
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,100


1159
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,100


1160
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,300
It seems to say can.

1161
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,280
Right.

1162
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:45,280


1163
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:45,280


1164
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:45,280


1165
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,700
This is, we, we really look for answers.

1166
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:47,380
Right.

1167
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:47,680
Right.

1168
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:47,680


1169
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:47,720
Yes, so this is Rise.

1170
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,160
The erste che!

1171
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,300
No, this is Ross alone.

1172
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,860
This is Ross alone.

1173
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,300
This is really the last chance!

1174
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:58,140
This is Ross, with him, and Vanessa both living in the same apartment for one month.

1175
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:02,620
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

1176
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,200
Take me off to space, take me off to space

1177
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,020
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

1178
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:16,620
Hey cow mutilators, let me join your crew

1179
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:21,160
Give me a knife, you bet your life I'll cut up cows for you

1180
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,660
I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly beast without a face

1181
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:30,060
So come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

1182
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:35,040
Take me off to space, take me off to space

1183
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,400
Go on down you saucer man and take me off to space

1184
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,960
Take me off to space, take me off to space

1185
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:48,520
Go on down you saucer man and take me off to space

1186
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:53,120
Come down you tiny robot with your little nipper claws

1187
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,480
You pale and bug eyed alien

1188
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:55,640
like a exhibit If you.

1189
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:55,640


1190
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:55,640


1191
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:55,640


1192
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,640
With wide and clammy paws

1193
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,360
Life is just a sucker's dream

1194
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,000
And death is a disgrace

1195
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,720
So come on down, you saucer man

1196
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,520
And take me off to space

1197
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,000
Take me off to space

1198
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,660
Come on down, you saucer man

1199
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,600
And take me off to space

1200
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,600
Take me off to space

1201
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,600
Come on down, you saucer man

1202
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,340
And take me off to space

1203
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,720
It's disgusting the way we treat humans.

1204
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,840
I'm doing great.

1205
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,240
Okay, great.

1206
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,340
Doing great.

1207
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:44,560
Ah!

1208
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,720
I think Bob is just a guy with a pipe.

1209
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,140
Oh, that's crazy talk.

1210
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,800
I have the gray hand.

1211
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,960
I have the gray hand.

1212
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,300
I got the puppy stick.

1213
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,380
We have the gray hand.

1214
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:09,940
The crop circles promise to lead us the way home.

1215
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:13,920
The pipe of Bob dolls is waiting for us.

1216
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,280
The escape vessels of the sex goddess is coming.

1217
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:22,220
I paid $30 to fly into space.

1218
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,860
My father had told me not to go off to X-Day.

1219
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,880
So I took cash from his wallet and was on my way.

1220
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:35,400
My brothers and sisters, they said it's all a sex cult.

1221
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:39,420
They tried to stop me, but I killed them all dead.

1222
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,420
Yee-haw!

1223
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,800
Goodbye to the con.

1224
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,840
Hello, margaritas.

1225
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,080
Adios to your old friends.

1226
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,820
Here's a better idea.

1227
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,520
You won't have a name when you show up.

1228
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,680
You'll be Bob's ex-boyfriend.

1229
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,320
And all they will call you will be...

1230
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:56,840
That's right.

1231
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,260
Be Bobby.

1232
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,340
To the tune of Deportage.

1233
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:06,060
Some of us are smelly and some are not wanted.

1234
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,240
Who he has told us we have to move on.

1235
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,580
Mission to T-Base just to meet all our heroes.

1236
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,620
But the game's got a really big knife and a gun.

1237
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:19,500
Woo-ha!

1238
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,500
All the bones are broken for two.

1239
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,680
We're crushed and we're all out of fire.

1240
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:31,560
We're crushed and some scary old men they call Mojo.

1241
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,460
But we just want to hang with the ones we admire.

1242
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,280
Everybody now.

1243
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,820
Goodbye to the con.

1244
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,120
Hello, margaritas.

1245
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,280
Adios to your old friends.

1246
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,960
Here's a better idea.

1247
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,760
You won't have a name when you show up.

1248
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,580
And all they will call you will be...

1249
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,460
Bobby.

1250
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:54,500
Be Bobby.

1251
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,560
Bobby, Bobby.

1252
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,340
Hey, Bobby.

1253
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:57,940
Hey, Bobby.

1254
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:58,040


1255
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,780
Hey, Bobby.

1256
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,560
Hey.

1257
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,800
¿Están muertos?

1258
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:18,680
No, no.

1259
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,000
Solamente inhibidos.

1260
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:21,580
Ja, ja, ja.

1261
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,940
Set them on fire.

1262
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,560
They're going to laugh at us.

1263
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:27,980
Bobby!

1264
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:28,860
Bobby!

1265
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,840
Watch out for the migra, man.

1266
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,520
If they catch you near the base, they're going to send you back.

1267
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:47,820
Watch out for those people with blue teeth and vibrating hair, man.

1268
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,700
They don't care what they say about you.

1269
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,740
They're going to make you disappear.

1270
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,920
Watch out for those people with blue teeth.

1271
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,580
We're federalists.

1272
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,780
You can't wash them.

1273
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,380
We have badges.

1274
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,060
You want to see our badges?

1275
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,580
Show us your badges.

1276
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,800
We're federalists.

1277
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,360
We have badges.

1278
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,580
We don't have no stinking badges.

1279
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,000
We don't need no stinking badges.

1280
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,720
Show us your diapers if you're federalists.

1281
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,460
We don't need no stinking pipes.

1282
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,520
We need stinking Lisa Vita.

1283
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,080
Lisa on May 23rd.

1284
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,720
Show me your barbecue sandwiches if you're the migra.

1285
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,860
And all they will call you will be

1286
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,740
the Bobby.

1287
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:37,360
How can I go to that fabulous event called X-Day at Brushwood in western New York?

1288
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,340
Would I get onto the internet and check out

1289
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:44,360
www.subgenius.com?

1290
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,220
That might work.

1291
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,360
Take a plane.

1292
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,740
Take a train.

1293
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,440
And take a flying saucer to Brushwood, dear friends.

1294
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:59,780
Brushwood, Sherman, New York, July 5th, this year.

1295
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:07,360
And this is the first of four 6X-Day shows, friends.

1296
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:18,420
And you've been hearing collages and channelings by, of course, Fernanda Nande-Liemer and Artemia Salina,

1297
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,520
two great sound editors from Alt Binary.

1298
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:35,780
And, of course, the famous

1299
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:41,660
I'm talking right now.

1300
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:50,180
ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland with Chaz Smith, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Princess Fiardo,

1301
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:50,680
and your strong host, Gordon Gordon.

1302
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,660
And you've been hearing collages and channelings by, of course, Fernanda Nande-Liemer and Artemia Salina,

1303
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:51,660


1304
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,440
Papa Joe Mama who ranted there,

1305
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,840
that fine, long, seven-minute rant.

1306
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,400
The great Papa Joe Mama,

1307
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,280
ultimate X-Day spokesman.

1308
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:03,460
We heard lots of bits from old subgenius media barrages,

1309
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:05,160
from Gary Gabrog, Frank,

1310
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,160
from Reverend Jarto.

1311
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,000
Yes, Jarto did some sound editing this time.

1312
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,040
Praise Jarto.

1313
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,860
The Matrix downloaded.

1314
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:18,720
El Queso All-Stars did Planet X or Bust.

1315
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,600
And Nenslo,

1316
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,220
did the great song, Take Me Off to Space.

1317
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,920
Friends, next we'll be hearing a little bit from the Euro subs,

1318
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:32,140
who will be back next week on this show,

1319
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,800
the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1320
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,420
Once again, that's www.subgenius.com

1321
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:48,780
or post office box 204-206-Austin, Texas 78720.

1322
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,680
And we'll see you next time.

1323
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:50,680


1324
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:50,680


1325
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:50,680


1326
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:50,680


1327
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:50,680


1328
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:50,680


1329
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:50,680


1330
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:50,680


1331
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:50,680


1332
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:50,680


1333
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:50,680


1334
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:54,140
We'll see you in the nude Jerusalem,

1335
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:57,600
if you can spell subgenius.com.

1336
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,060
What have you been doing?

1337
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,840
You've been drinking whiskey for Bob.

1338
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,000
Yeah, I've been drinking whiskey for Bob.

1339
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,240
I've been preaching for Bob.

1340
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,860
It's the only two things that I care about.

1341
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,440
Did Bob deliver the whiskey?

1342
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:20,460
No.

1343
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,980
I bought the whiskey, but I bought it with Bob's money.

1344
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:23,580
Yeah.

1345
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,740
I didn't have any money in my wallet.

1346
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,140
I thought, I want some whiskey.

1347
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,920
And I went into an off-license,

1348
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,240
and I looked at the whiskey,

1349
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,440
and I went, oh, I don't have any money.

1350
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,960
And I found, I found the money to buy the whiskey in my wallet.

1351
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,180
I didn't know it was there.

1352
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,220
So I bought the whiskey, and I drank the whiskey.

1353
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,480
Drank the whiskey, man.

1354
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:40,140
Amen.

1355
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:40,920
Amen.

1356
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,620
It happened.

1357
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:43,780
Somehow it just...

1358
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,840
I've got to pay some money here.

1359
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,740
The transubstantiation has come down to this.

1360
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,260
There's...

1361
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,000
No.

1362
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,180
50 pence.

1363
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,900
36 pence.

1364
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:53,600
Yeah.

1365
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:55,680
What are you doing, Mr. Svita?

1366
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,380
I'm finished, just buying as usual.

1367
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,740
You are trying to...

1368
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,060
Yeah, I'm slacking.

1369
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,380
You're slack.

1370
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,800
Slack is the primal substance.

1371
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,420
It's the fifth essence.

1372
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,780
It's the quinto elemento.

1373
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,480
It's slack.

1374
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,440
Praise Bob.

1375
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,860
Praise Bob.

1376
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:16,900
Praise Bob.

1377
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,060
Bob loves you.

1378
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:19,960
Bob loves you.

1379
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:20,640
I could...

1380
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:21,900
He'll never love you as much as Bob.

1381
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,060
I am feminizing...

1382
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,180
I can't move without going down.

1383
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,240
Bob takes care of his own.

1384
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,660
Bob takes care of his own.

1385
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:30,120
Yes.

1386
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,200
We will take care of our own, darling.

1387
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:38,800
He doesn't leave the detritus of Bob Dobbs town to other people.

1388
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,400
He takes care of his own.

1389
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,040
The rantings of a madman.

1390
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,040
Stop and go.

1391
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,060
Stop and go.

1392
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,620
He's met the zenith point.

1393
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,480
He's at the apex between plus and minus.

1394
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,020
Yes.

1395
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:50,320
He's...

1396
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,600
He's on the edge.

1397
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:51,960
He's moving and standing still.

1398
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:52,340
He's on the edge.

1399
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,480
He wants to stop and go.

1400
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,320
Yeah.

1401
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:54,720
Yes.

1402
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,080
He is a true subgenius.

1403
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,940
And there goes the torch parade.

1404
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,260
What sort of goings on is that anyway?

1405
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,640
Some sort of rites for the temple of vampires.

1406
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,800
Jack, you mean to sit there and say all that gang was vampires?

1407
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:12,620
How do I know?

1408
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,320
At least they seem to be priests of the temple.

1409
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:15,560
Yeah.

1410
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,480
Rogues and torches and stuff.

1411
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,180
I'm not a priest.

1412
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:18,180


1413
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,160


1414
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,160


1415
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,160


1416
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,160


1417
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,160
