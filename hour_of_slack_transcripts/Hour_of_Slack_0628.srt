1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
You're swimming in a sea of Bob's Pills right now.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,700
You're up here, man!

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,580
You're choking on Bob's Pills,

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,120
but you're just too blind to have the dumb taste them to death,

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,440
to taste them, to know they're there.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,480
You've just got to open your eyes,

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,820
open your throat, not still crying.

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,720
We've got the technology,

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,440
we've got the fan,

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,780
we've got the pills,

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,520
and we've got the authorization

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,160
for only $30, friends.

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,460
We'll be there.

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,720
Try not only to try to open the top of your head,

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,340
strike back the brain cells you don't need,

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,580
replace them with what's in Bob's head,

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,140
what's inside his little tiny pill,

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,520
what's inside his potion, my God,

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,840
and what's inside his potion

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,460
could be what's inside your head.

21
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,880
Useless, destroyed, washed.

22
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,380
You could be as mindless as Bob Bob,

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:55,760
but you're not.

24
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,620
You could be as handsome as Bob Bob,

25
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,260
you could be as black as Bob Bob.

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,160
Well, actually, that's a lie, nobody can,

27
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,480
but you know what I'm saying, friends?

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,180
You can get slapped.

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,500
The subgenius must get slapped.

30
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,720
The subgenius will get slapped,

31
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,200
and I can tell you exactly how soon

32
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,500
he will get slapped.

33
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,800
In 83 days,

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,680
the subgenius will have slapped.

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,860
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

36
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,580
which reaches from the inner mind to...

37
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,480
The subgenius.

38
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,540
Power of Slash.

39
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,200
Bloods.

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,800
What a great mic arm.

41
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:54,240
This is the most comfortable radio station in the whole world.

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,120
With the coolest mic arm.

43
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,820
I can just lean back in this easy chair.

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,720
And there's an arm that...

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,960
It's a mic stand with an arm that's adjustable.

46
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,040
It's a real biotic arm, too.

47
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,740
It's got blood in it and everything.

48
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,300
We have the technology.

49
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,280
Yeah, I noticed if you scrape the side of the mic stand,

50
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,240
it bleeds and it kind of rides.

51
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,200
It's like a...

52
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,760
It's just similar to the Bob Stick monitor or the Arnold.

53
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,320
It doesn't have a brain or anything.

54
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,680
It's just a bone and...

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,220
Well, it does have a brain. It's just a bone and...

56
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,820
You can't just lash it and have to cheat it.

57
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,920
I think there's...

58
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,240
When they did the clone mix,

59
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,160
they just put a little bit of brain cells in there

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,880
so it would be, you know, like a smart arm.

61
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:32,580
Oh.

62
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,300
Yeah.

63
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,720
So you can just kind of get...

64
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,660
Oh, is that what sort of follows my mouth around?

65
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,300
Yeah.

66
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,520
Some of them...

67
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,460
But some of them get...

68
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,780
What are they gonna think of that?

69
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,460
They get a little rebellious sometimes.

70
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,300
Oh, yeah?

71
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,400
Then they'll bother you while you're talking.

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,660
They'll grab you right around the throat.

73
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,200
You're kidding.

74
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,960
If they don't like what you're saying, man, it's weird.

75
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,040
Oh, should I pet it?

76
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,260
Oh, it's getting...

77
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:52,880
Yeah.

78
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,100
They'll get bigger.

79
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,240
They'll get bigger.

80
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,480
All right.

81
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,300
Yeah, I...

82
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,300
I think I'll leave that alone.

83
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,060
Yeah, you don't want it to be too friendly.

84
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,640
Uh...

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,880
Oh, it's so comfortable in this...

86
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,080
This basement radio station that Chaz has.

87
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,800
Yeah, the FCCIA was gonna try and bust them last week.

88
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,980
I don't blame them.

89
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,020
I can't believe that you can get this behind the counter.

90
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,540
I guess the Eglise Pentecostal down the street...

91
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,060
I mean, over the counter.

92
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,900
...had their own...

93
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,860
Huh?

94
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:29,960
The Eglise Pentecostal, you know, the church down the street there where they all shake

95
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,140
up the tambourines on Sunday.

96
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,420
I guess they had their own radio station.

97
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,820
And Chaz was just jamming it out.

98
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,520
Yeah.

99
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,200
And the FCCIA came by.

100
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,960
You gotta go for it, man.

101
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,860
You gotta like...

102
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,840
And it goes...

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,380
You gotta just pretend that microphone is a woman, which is not easy with that bony

104
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,260
arm holding...

105
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,600
Well, I guess they do have the microphones now that actually are, well, you know, part

106
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,180
of a woman.

107
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,640
They do?

108
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,300
Yeah.

109
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:55,820
I mean...

110
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,340
Well, how come we're not using those?

111
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,260
No more deep-beating prayer scripts for you.

112
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,820
You just be...

113
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,940
You'll be talking in a microphone all the time, man.

114
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,900
Because you're so much...

115
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,340
You'll be mouthing the microphone is what you mean.

116
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:06,760
Mm-hmm.

117
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,260
I'm...

118
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,600
I like this.

119
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,320
Oh, this is such a great studio.

120
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,120
In my studio, the mics are just mics that...

121
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,740
They're just cheap radio shit, plastic and...

122
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,600
And your basement, I guess, is like three feet of water under it.

123
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,160
We don't have any.

124
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,160


125
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,160


126
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,160


127
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,160


128
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,160


129
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,160


130
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,160


131
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,460
We don't have basements in Texas.

132
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh, that's right.

133
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,600
We have penthouses.

134
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,000
I work up on the very top of the skyscraper, but the...

135
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,260
I have my actual studio, my mics are hanging from strings from uncured boards.

136
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,320
It's called Tarzan's Radio Station because it's out of a penthouse.

137
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,400
It's in the garden.

138
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,720
It's in a treehouse.

139
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,820
I knew the hour's light from a treehouse.

140
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,500
I thought you knew that.

141
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,100
No, I didn't know that.

142
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,720
Everything's like from Vines.

143
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,460
I knew you were pretty far up in the air.

144
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,400
We could be really high-tech, but I insist...

145
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,140
Bob has a lot of experience.

146
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,140


147
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,140


148
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,140


149
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,380
I always insisted that we produce the hour of slack on the kind of equipment that any

150
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:04,840
poverty-stricken shut-in could afford, which means two cheap Radio Shack decks and bad

151
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,280
volume equalizer.

152
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,600
Wait a minute.

153
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,420
You mean that Polaroid you sent me with that treehouse that had hour of slack written

154
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,720
on it like H-O-W-E-R and then slack, the S was backwards?

155
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,200
I thought that was like a kid's treehouse and they were just sticking on your name and

156
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
that's the studio?

157
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,680
No, that is actually where we do that.

158
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,120
That's the...

159
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,060
That's the real studio.

160
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,740
With the little picnic table sitting up there on the treehouse.

161
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,780
It's a pretty sturdy treehouse and the mics really do hang from Vines because they're

162
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:38,320
such cheap mics that if anything touches the cord of the mic, you can hear it all the way

163
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,280
just as if...

164
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,840
Here, listen.

165
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,360
Hear that?

166
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,680
...you touch the front of the mic.

167
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,000
You see?

168
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,860
These new womanly, manly mics, these gene spliced mic arms that Chaz and you guys have

169
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,240
here in outer space...

170
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,400
Well, those mics...

171
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:52,920
Well, friends...

172
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,120
...are the ones that are the best.

173
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,120


174
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,620
...and they're so much better than...

175
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:53,980
That's right.

176
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,960
I'm back here.

177
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,300
That was a tape.

178
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,280
That was actually just only a tape of the...

179
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:10,680
Of my last visit to Einstein's secret studio there and I'm not drunk right now.

180
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,180
The reason I may sound a little mush mouth is I...

181
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:20,140
When I was at that studio a few days ago in Cleveland, we went out for burgers at Burger

182
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:20,460
King.

183
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,020
I remember that name, Burger King.

184
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,100
I remember that name, Burger King.

185
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:31,940
I got me a damn burger and bit into it just as heartily as hell and there was a rock,

186
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,600
some kind of a little hard thing.

187
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,040
I don't know what it was because I swallowed it and it broke my tooth and I had a broken

188
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,380
tooth.

189
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:45,180
And about two hours ago, I got into the dentist office back here at home in Dallas and she

190
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,380
ground up my old tooth and put in a brand new tooth but my mouth is still really numb.

191
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,100
And I mean, the whole bottom half, the right side of my mouth is just dead, completely

192
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,940
dead and my brain, the right side of my brain is dead.

193
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,800
I can only be logical and the logical thing to do now I think would be for me to go back

194
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,420
to the tapes.

195
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:14,260
First, oh, and man, we had a great show in Cleveland at the Euclid Tavern.

196
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,480
It was very well recorded.

197
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,160
Praise the sound man, Mike.

198
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,960
God, I'm starting to spit.

199
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,220
I'm drooling, friends.

200
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,620
Novocaine, what a trip.

201
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:32,900
Anyway, it was just myself and Einstein's Secret Orchestra, Chaz Smith, Lonesome Cowboy

202
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,320
Dave, and special guest Princess Wiardo.

203
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:43,400
And Michelle Smith, the Hendrix of the electric violin and the drummer, Bob.

204
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,620
And we got some excellent recordings from that show.

205
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,860
I'm going to be playing some of that.

206
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,380
We did a lot of extra recording in the studio.

207
00:07:53,460 --> 00:08:01,780
But before we go into that, I also discovered, sort of rediscovered this band or artist named

208
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,080
James Kochalka.

209
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,300
Okay.

210
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,420
James Kochalka, superstar.

211
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,920
WFMU sent the CD of his album Monkey vs. Robot.

212
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,980
And I played something off of it about a year ago and then it got lost in the shuffle.

213
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,800
But Princess Wi asked me to bring to Cleveland, she said, bring some of that weird cartoony

214
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,280
music that people send to you in the mail instead of all your electric guitars.

215
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:35,300


216
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:35,300


217
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,720
And I went, oh, well, okay.

218
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,260
And I grabbed a whole bunch of cartoony CDs.

219
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:49,660
And while re-listening to Monkey vs. Robot, I realized what a treasure trove it was.

220
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,580
And so here's the soundcheck of love from Monkey vs. Robot by James Kochalka, superstar.

221
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,420
Hello?

222
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,120
Hello?

223
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,280
Hello?

224
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,280


225
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,280


226
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,280


227
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,280


228
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,280


229
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:35,300


230
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,240
I love you.

231
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,340
Hey, is this thing on?

232
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,040
Where has our love gone?

233
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,300
There's something wrong with this microphone.

234
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,340
Is it worn out and getting old?

235
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,640
I don't want to start a fight.

236
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,060
But the sound guy's not too bright.

237
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,920
Check one.

238
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,500
Check two.

239
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,420
I love you.

240
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:03,680
Hey.

241
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,600
Is this thing on?

242
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,640
Where has our love gone?

243
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,360
Monkey play in the jungle.

244
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,180
Robot work in the factory.

245
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,920
They will have a giant rumble.

246
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,120
Monkey vs. Robot.

247
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,080
Robot vs. Robot

248
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,380
Monkey hate technology

249
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,340
Robot hate the monkey

250
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,400
They will fight eternally

251
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,540
Monkey vs. Robot

252
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,460
Monkey vs. Robot

253
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,540
Monkey mates in the jungle

254
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,200
Robot replicate in factory

255
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,840
They both love their mother

256
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,340
Why must they hate each other?

257
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,560
Why can't we all get along?

258
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,300
Would that be oh so wrong?

259
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,080
Why can't we all love each other?

260
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,400
Monkey and a robot brother

261
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,040
Monkey vs. Robot

262
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,120
Monkey vs. Robot

263
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,520
Monkey vs. Robot

264
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,640
Monkey vs. Robot

265
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,080
Monkey vs. Robot

266
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,680
Monkey vs. Robot

267
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,360
M-O-N-K-E-Y

268
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,740
R-O-T-R-O-T-R-O-T

269
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:49,740


270
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,100
M-O-N-K-E-Y

271
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,440
Monkey

272
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,520
R-O-T-R-O-T-R-O-T

273
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:58,460
Monkey vs. Robot

274
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,820
Monkey vs. Robot

275
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,040
Monkey vs. Robot

276
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,680
Monkey vs. Robot

277
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:05,880
Monkey vs. Robot

278
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,820
Monkey vs. Robot

279
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,980
Monkey vs. Bat

280
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,360
Monkey vs. Robot

281
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,580
Monkey vs. Robot

282
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,040
Monkey vs. Robot

283
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,060
Monkey vs. Robot

284
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,560
Monkey vs. Robot

285
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,680
Monkey vs. Robot

286
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,500
Monkey vs. Robot

287
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,720
Monkey vs. Robot

288
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:45,440
And certainly the monkey versus robot theme is a common to not only Devo, the Devonian philosophy, but of course also the Church of the Subgenius, seen here on track three. Thank you.

289
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:58,100
What kind of a god is it who has to be defended by little old illiterate redneck ladies and geeks against assholes like me?

290
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,200
What kind of a god is that, I ask you?

291
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:14,680
And we are so disgusted with this pussy, sissy god who has to have dumb rednecks in Arkansas defended against idiots like me.

292
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,420
Thank you.

293
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:15,420


294
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:15,420


295
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:25,140
We, the Church of the Subgenius, in the name of Bob Dobbs, as of this moment tonight, herewith declare war on God!

296
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,940
War on God!

297
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,340
We are not going to let him push us around like this.

298
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,820
We're not going to take it anymore.

299
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,280
Not from that kind of god, anyway.

300
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,720
What kind of a god is that, I ask you?

301
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,160
What kind of a god is that, I ask you?

302
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,700
Praise God!

303
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,280
Ill-Pretty!

304
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,120
Well, you know, it's easy to pick on the Christians.

305
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,680
But really, they just happen to be the ones who are in our face in this country more.

306
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:57,100
The, um, I personally would like to kill all the New Agers and Muslims and damn you.

307
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:04,360
Actually, friends, actually, as an evangelical subgenius, I'm kind of a pacifist.

308
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,820
I'm not, I'm not into killing the pigs.

309
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:15,340
I'm into enslaving them, certainly, putting them to work, buying and sub-trading them, breeding them, using them.

310
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,900
You know, why waste a natural resource?

311
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:25,940
If you, hey listen, folks, if you're the bloodthirsty kind of subgenius that wants to kill all the pigs,

312
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:33,220
there's a section of the church, Dr. Legumes, Holocaustals, you're welcome to join the Holocaustals.

313
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,180
All they want to do is fight and kill and everything.

314
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,080
Or you can join us humble evangelicals.

315
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,120
Not my turn, friends.

316
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,220
Somebody else named it that.

317
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,080
Um, whatever, you know, take it if you want to, if you'd rather kill pigs.

318
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,800
Join the Holocaustals if you want the love of Bob Doves, friends,

319
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,920
and the fierce, frictional interface between Bob and Connie Doves.

320
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,160
Man.

321
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,040
Because, friends, you know, we're just like every other religion.

322
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:11,260
This whole thing is based on hating everyone who's not like us.

323
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,240
The big difference between us and the Christians is,

324
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,420
at least we can't kill.

325
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,260
We can't come out and admit it.

326
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:22,880
And on top of that, not only do we hate everybody who's not like us, that includes all of us.

327
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,400
Because none of us, the only thing that we as subgeniuses have in common is that we have

328
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,780
nothing at all in common with the conspiracy of the common normal.

329
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,760
Otherwise, that's all we have in common.

330
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,820
The only thing we have in common, friends, is we're all kind of queer for Bob.

331
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,400
But, you know, we're all kind of queer for Bob.

332
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,260
Not necessarily.

333
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,680
I don't know if I'd put it that way.

334
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,060
But, you know, we're, as we've said, we've tried to tell you, folks, we're bisexual.

335
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,500
When you buy subgenius T-shirts, we come.

336
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,580
It's a bunch.

337
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,460
It's a beautiful thing.

338
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:12,000
And, you know, I'd like to take this opportunity, personally, to thank Bob Doves, wherever Bob is.

339
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,420
Bob?

340
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:13,900
Bob?

341
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,040
Bob?

342
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,620
You hear me?

343
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,120
Danny, you listen, Bob.

344
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,520
Bob, I want to thank you for giving me slack the last two years.

345
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,320
Bob!

346
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,820
Bob, I want you to know that your promise rings true.

347
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,340
Bob!

348
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:35,840
These people out here have been wondering about, am I, as a subgenius, ever going to get the perfect sex hurt?

349
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,800
The ultimate ooze squirt?

350
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,580
Am I ever going to find my true yeti mate and find true love?

351
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:46,120
And, friends, all I can do is tell you that, in my case, it goddamn worked.

352
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:52,460
Praise Bob and help honey, I've been getting more pussy and better pussy than I ever got in my entire life.

353
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,420
And I happen to like pussy.

354
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,260
Some people may take that a little way.

355
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,120
And, praise Bob, I've been married for 25 years.

356
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,880
I should have about 25 new wives tonight, I hope.

357
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,820
Oh, yes, friends.

358
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:18,020
And you can say, you come up after this show like the drunks often do, and say, whoever's saying, where's my slack?

359
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,260
I thought you were going to give me slack.

360
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:27,760
And that's when I get to say, if you think that anybody else is going to give you slack, then this message has been lost on you.

361
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,280
You have not heard anything Bob has said to you.

362
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,160
Because only you, you and you, can make your own slack.

363
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,620
And that's all there is to it, my friends.

364
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,260
Praise Bob.

365
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,300
That's the greatest gift he made.

366
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:40,900
Praise Bob.

367
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,640
Yes, friends, and it's true.

368
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,680
Sure, we're trying to sell you something for nothing.

369
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,200
But this is the one religion where you really can get something for nothing.

370
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,840
Because you're going to get that slack.

371
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,620
If we finally convince you to do it yourself, you're going to get that slack.

372
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,660
And what did you spend?

373
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,640
Nothing but money.

374
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,360
And what is money really worth?

375
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,580
Ask Michael Jackson.

376
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,300
Ask Elvis Presley.

377
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,320
Ask Madonna.

378
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,360
They've got all the money in the world.

379
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:24,840
And they're obviously miserable, fucked up wretches who have, do desperately need Bob Dobson, some kind of slack in their lives so that they can finally fucking laugh at themselves.

380
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,280
And friends, you know, you may, and here's another miracle, Bob.

381
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,900
Now a lot of you folks are not very rich.

382
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,780
Some of you live in poverty.

383
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,240
Some of you are diseased, not very healthy.

384
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,080
Some of you have mental illness or depression.

385
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:57,360
Some of you are just plain kind of funny looking or too fat or too skinny or socially inept, kind of clumsy and shy.

386
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,680
Hey, I'm not making fun.

387
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:04,280
I have been all of those things myself and hope to again someday.

388
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,200
But you know what?

389
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:14,880
And if you're honest with yourself, you didn't really join the church because you wanted to meet a bunch of new sub-genius friends.

390
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,260
It's not a fan club like that.

391
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,660
In fact, chances are you'd just as soon be left to fucking alone.

392
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:27,640
And friends, you can be alone with Bob.

393
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,380
All those other personal saviors demand, oh, they want so much from you.

394
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,180
They're breathing down your neck going, Bob.

395
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,360
Did you pay your taxes on time?

396
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,100
Do you make enough money?

397
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,700
Are you going to get laid?

398
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,360
Did you do the right thing?

399
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,040
Have you kissed my ass enough?

400
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,800
Bob Dobbs doesn't care about any of that crap.

401
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,440
He doesn't care about your sins.

402
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,460
He doesn't give a shit about your sins.

403
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:58,500
Because Bob came and comes again and again to justify your sins, to rationalize your sins, my friends.

404
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,180
And you know, with all the despite and the hate, I'm not going to say anything.

405
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,620
I'm going to say that Bob is a conspiracy and an invisible monster.

406
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:23,160
And the fact that they hate us all so much because we, oh, might be promiscuous or we might cuss or we might think our own thoughts or one of those awful kind of things, you know.

407
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:34,060
As much as they hate us, friends, we can hate them so, so much more.

408
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,720
And you know why?

409
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,420
It's as simple as that.

410
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,440
It's because we've got Bob and they don't.

411
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,300
And for that, we can hate them.

412
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,080
Hate them.

413
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,920
Hate them.

414
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,580
Hate.

415
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,260
Hate.

416
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,080
Hate.

417
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,820
God, they're just going to creep.

418
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:59,180
In some ways, it's beautiful to hear a big crowd of fascist subgeniuses chatting hate.

419
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,660
But at the same time, it kind of makes me sick.

420
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:03,740
It makes me feel like I'm going to be a bad guy.

421
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,560
It makes me feel like I'm going to be a bad guy.

422
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,120
Oh, friends, I almost forgot.

423
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,580
We have a special guest tonight.

424
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,620
It's What's Inside Your Brain, actually.

425
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,860
Hold on.

426
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,640
Hold on just a second.

427
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,240
What is in your brain?

428
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,220
What is in your brain?

429
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,920
What is in your brain?

430
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,160
Don't repeat what I said.

431
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,380
The big question was, what is in your brain?

432
00:21:38,420 --> 00:22:01,720
What is in your brain?

433
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:08,860
Friends, I'm going to depart from my prepared material just to explain something to you.

434
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,100
Then I'm going to give you this.

435
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,200
Actually, it's some kind of a melon.

436
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,140
There's supposed to be a pumpkin.

437
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:27,680
Friends, before a subgenius show, we preachers have this little ritual where we usually get some bobbing from the audience and have it come backstage.

438
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,200
We have this great big pumpkin.

439
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,500
When we have one, it's destroyed now.

440
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:40,040
We hollow the pumpkin out and we drill four or five holes in the sides, however many male creatures there are.

441
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,560
And we take a squirrel or two or three live squirrels, if we can get that many.

442
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,440
We put them inside the pumpkin.

443
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,920
We put the pumpkin full of squirrels on top of the bobby's head.

444
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,180
And then the preachers stand around and fuck the pumpkin with the squirrels.

445
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,760
Now, you know, that kind of gets our kids away.

446
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,180
It's like football players going, oh, I'm going to get a little bit of a big one.

447
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,800
I'm going to put it in the huddle just before the game, you know, to build up the spirit.

448
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,300
It's just a thing we do.

449
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,040
And the squirrels are dead and the pumpkin's been used.

450
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:23,360
Friends, the slack that we feel while we're fucking that pumpkin full of squirrels is nothing compared to the slack that you could be feeling just by staring at your dirty fingernails if you had true bob consciousness.

451
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,700
The fact is you are floating in a sea of bob pills right now.

452
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,040
There are bob pills.

453
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,500
Up to your dirt show, you've been choking to death on the pills of bob, friends.

454
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,560
And if only yours.

455
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:44,020
But the problem is you're too blind and deaf and taste numb to be able to feel those pills.

456
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:51,020
But, friends, what's in those pills is the same thing that's inside bob's head.

457
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,380
And it's the same thing that could be inside this pumpkin.

458
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,920
And, friends, I'm going to hand this pumpkin out to you.

459
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,360
Not right now.

460
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,580
I'm going to hold up the friends a little bit later.

461
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,040
In fact, I'm going to put it here.

462
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,820
Up, up, up.

463
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,360
Praise the pumpkin.

464
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,360
I'm not going to launch the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

465
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,080
That could destroy the universe if we do it in the wrong way.

466
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,400
Praise the pumpkin.

467
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,400
Up, up, up.

468
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,660
Praise the pumpkin.

469
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,060
Two of the pumpkins.

470
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,600
Praise the pumpkin.

471
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,280
Now, when somebody really feels the spirit.

472
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,300
We give you permission, as holy men, to come up here and grab one of these two fruits.

473
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,200
And, well, do whatever comes natural with it.

474
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,060
If you want to launch it, launch it.

475
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:53,280
Now, the one thing I ask is keep in mind that this nice club, Euclid Tavern, has let us come in here to be perverted assholes.

476
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,180
And we don't want to mess up their facility.

477
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,260
Which is why we're here.

478
00:24:59,260 --> 00:24:59,260


479
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,900
Which is why I have this sacred paper towel.

480
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:09,120
So, within limits, within reasonable limits, you're welcome to fuck the pumpkin.

481
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,780
Here, here's your mug.

482
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,640
Now, friends, as I said, 80 days.

483
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,840
We've got 80 more days until X day.

484
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,960
80 3D days, you might say.

485
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,240
Until the rapture, dear friends.

486
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,740
The rupture itself.

487
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:35,800
When the spaceships will line up at 7 o'clock a.m. July 5th this year.

488
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:46,860
The X's presences will line up in a huge line from north to south pole over the international date line in the middle of the Pacific Ocean at 7 a.m.

489
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:53,860
And they will remain hovering over the planet as the planet rotates beneath this great line of spaceships.

490
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,720
We in America will be able to sit and watch our planet.

491
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,200
And we will be able to see the X's and the X's on television as first the natives of Pago Pago are ruptured up.

492
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,220
The dues paying natives of Pago.

493
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,720
Then the Australians.

494
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Then the Japanese subgeniuses.

495
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,240
Then across Russia and Europe.

496
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:19,720
And in each of those on television, we will see the dues paying subgeniuses, one in a thousand, suddenly disappear.

497
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,420
Hey, man, I thought this was all just kind of a funny joke.

498
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,920
I didn't think if there really is an X day.

499
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,520
That means there really is a conspiracy.

500
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,200
There really is a bomb.

501
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,720
And that might mean there really is a hell.

502
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,740
Alright, don't worry about the hell part too much, friends.

503
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,440
You'll cross that bridge when it comes to it.

504
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,740
Big funny joke, man.

505
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,300
But friends, you know, that will be a day of glory.

506
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,960
Of naked glory.

507
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,060
And I must say, but yeah.

508
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,540
Is there perhaps one unforgivable sin?

509
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,120
That would prevent you from being ruptured up into these egg vessels?

510
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,800
Is there a sin in the church of the subgenius?

511
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,560
Oh, there's plenty of sins.

512
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,980
We collect them.

513
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,060
We list them.

514
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,400
We try to discover new sins.

515
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,320
We're born with the old sins.

516
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,860
But is there one sin where you commit that sin and Bob's pissed off forever?

517
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,500
Pull the lever, down you go.

518
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,900
Is there one?

519
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,920
Yes, there is, friends.

520
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,900
And it is the simple sin of not bothering to send in a bomb.

521
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,540
And that's the sin of not bothering to send in that $30 membership and become a minister.

522
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,500
A dues-paying subgenius minister in this church.

523
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,140
Once again, sure, maybe it's just something for nothing.

524
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,140
Maybe it's just a bunch of snake oil.

525
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:45,720
Well, if that's the case, then maybe you learned an important lesson that you needed real bad.

526
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,480
But what if it's true?

527
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,360
Ah, yeah.

528
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,540
Ah, yeah.

529
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,140
What if it's true?

530
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:02,740
You know, because if it is true, friends, what will you get for your $30 besides eternal salvation?

531
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,300
You get your own spaceship, for one thing.

532
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,920
You get your own planet.

533
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,200
And you get your own universe, if that's what you want.

534
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,160
If all you want is a little cottage out in the woods, that's fine.

535
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,520
If you only want a couple of shopping malls or a whorehouse, that's fine.

536
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:28,840
But if you want, you can have your own do-it-yourself universe.

537
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,560
You can have the world.

538
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,140
And you can have it now.

539
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,680
You just have to be willing to be killing for Bob.

540
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:51,440
You have to be ready to break all the rules with the other side.

541
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,560
We want the world and we want it now.

542
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,280
Friends, what is the law?

543
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,580
What is the law?

544
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,640
To rock on all fours and grovel and snuffle in the dirt.

545
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,720
That is the law.

546
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,600
We are not men.

547
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,040
To spill blood.

548
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:20,620
To mate all willy-nilly every which way with everything that walks around us.

549
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,620
That is the law.

550
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,420
We are not men.

551
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,440
Break on through to the other side.

552
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,520
What is the law?

553
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,980
The law to place doves every day of our lives.

554
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,720
That is the law.

555
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,380
We are not men.

556
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,380
What is the law?

557
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:48,480
To find another yeti, male, female, or pet and fuck it until you have more little subgeniuses.

558
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,360
That is the law.

559
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,160
We are not men!

560
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,280


561
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,660
What is the law?

562
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,340
Cause we are not men.

563
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,040
We are not men in the cortisol suckers and diarrhea

564
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,040


565
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,040


566
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,060
We are not men.

567
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,700
We are devour.

568
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,720
The evil air.

569
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,180
Break on through to the other sideải

570
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,180


571
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,140
We might Mercury and the other side,

572
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,340
We want Venus and the Venus abscent.

573
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,140
And we want it now.

574
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,660
We want the Earth.

575
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,120
And we want it now.

576
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,300
Earth first.

577
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,800
We want Mars.

578
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,140
And we want it now.

579
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,280
We will take Mars.

580
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,420
We want Jupiter.

581
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,020
And we want it now.

582
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,720
We want Saturn.

583
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,040
And we want it now.

584
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,660
We want Jupiter.

585
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,880
And we want it now.

586
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,380
You thought that it sounded just as good as anything from the fancy studios at WCSB right?

587
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,160
It fools people. They don't know.

588
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:27,320
In fact I have people going, what kind of super computer do you use to put our slack together?

589
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,080
And I go, I make that sentence.

590
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,760
Oh, a Cyber Spaz 9000.

591
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,160
And they go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.

592
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,540
They always act like they know what I'm talking about, so they don't want it to look stupid.

593
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,320
Just you kids in a treehouse, and none of that high-tech stuff at all.

594
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,580
You know, I heard one time, it was a vicious rumor that you, those,

595
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,740
those you know that when you get Collins it's actually just somebody downstairs

596
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,620
with a one on being cans and a long stream actually the Collins are from

597
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,640
years and years ago from others that gene we just fake our you know my half

598
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,740
the mother world shooter generated I type that stuff I heard your voice voice

dr. legume all those characters are we have them recorded and I can pump those

603
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,800
out on a little keyboard I actually type the words and the computer speaks the

604
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:29,520
voices if they were in the studio and that's the way you and it pumps out

605
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,620
pheromones along with the signal so we have the right kind of see this much no

606
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,880
more not just everybody's radio but modern-day radios if you go listening on

607

he and

618
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,640
many

619
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,640
will or

620
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,460
Don't you, baby?

621
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,140
Oh, of course I do.

622
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:56,820
I remember all the squirrels.

623
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,980
From back on Earth.

624
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:58,780
Who, me?

625
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,840
When you were young.

626
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,900
Oh, yeah.

627
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,060
I remember the squirrels.

628
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,400
They weren't real squirrels.

629
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,000
They were squirrels on TV even then, baby.

630
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,560
Yeah, yeah.

631
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,280
Admit it.

632
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:12,220
You never touched a real squirrel, even when you were young on Earth, did you, baby?

633
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,300
How could they steal my nuts if they wasn't real?

634
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,200
Every day I had the same problem.

635
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,660
I'd wake up and some squirrels had stolen my nuts.

636
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,780
And I'd have to go out in the side yard and dig around and root around like a were-not-men

637
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,100
and try and see if I could.

638
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,560
And sometimes I'd find truffles.

639
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,620
And sometimes I'd climb up into the treehouse and wait for them to come down.

640
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,840
And you still never found your nuts, did you?

641
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,300
No, no.

642
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,940
I still ain't gotten them to speak of.

643
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,380
No.

644
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,240
Nutless wonder.

645
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,320
It's a wonder.

646
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:35,460
It's a wonder.

647
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,200
Plenty of cowboy day.

648
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,240
I was sitting up in that treehouse as a child.

649
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,000
It's a wonder.

650
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,600
Counting his squirrels that he didn't have and his nuts that had been stolen away.

651
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,340
But I could still procreate.

652
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,540
I didn't do it the normal way people did.

653
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,340
I just, well, any time I'd be institutionalized, I'd stare at the wall for a long time.

654
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,900
Maybe then one of Virgin Macarena County.

655
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,700
Or one of them eating vindaloo hats I used to wear.

656
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,340
And I would stare so hard.

657
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,380
And then copies would appear.

658
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,960
That's the way I did it.

659
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,140
The tiny little days would come spitting out, wouldn't they?

660
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,260
Yeah, like the whiskey fairies would dance around my legs and tell me songs and stuff.

661
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:13,020
Until they'd turn into a little puddle and you'd have to wipe them up before the nurse came.

662
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,720
Yeah, well, they were a little bit wet.

663
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,600
Did the nurse ever come in and catch you procreating days?

664
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,860
No, she never actually caught me.

665
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,000
But she knew something was up.

666
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,920
She'd see the puddles and she'd hear the little day voices.

667
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,320
She'd hear,

668
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,200
.

669
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,580
And they would be like dancing in soft laughter in the closet.

670
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,180
She knew something was going on.

671
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,920
Or maybe she just thought it was one of the weird tapes I make.

672
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:34,540
.

673
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,400
You never know when it might be just one of the weird tapes you make.

674
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,220
Yeah, and then you start rolling backwards.

675
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,940
How much of this is memory and how much of this is just some weird tape you make?

676
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,000
It's a rollout.

677
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,460
That's what they call it now currently.

678
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,160
A rollout.

679
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:48,740
In research.

680
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,660
Yeah, that's when they stick you real hard in that part of your brain and everything comes back like a videotape.

681
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,440
You can see everything that you haven't done.

682
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,100
How much did you pay for that back alley rollout, Dave?

683
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,280
Forty-five bucks.

684
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,020
I mean, it did feel like an eight penny nail.

685
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,380
What did you remember when they did that?

686
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,900
What other memories did that rollout bring?

687
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,140
I don't think I remember what it was.

688
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,300
Maybe it was dying.

689
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,180
I can't tell if I was going forward or backwards.

690
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:14,940
You know how it is.

691
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,280
Well, I know how it is.

692
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,900
This might be a rollout right now.

693
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,180
Are you sure that you don't have a tube in your brain causing a memory?

694
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:28,940
A memory of sitting in a radio station when actually you're just in a little tuna can in space on the way down to the territory?

695
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:39,560
And in truth, dear friends, Lonesome Cowboy Dave was, in fact, in a tuna can only remembering a false tape.

696
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,260
A taped memory of his very...

697
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,760
But now...

698
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,040
James Kochalka.

699
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,980
Twinkle, twinkle, Ringo Starr.

00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,920
George and John and Paul.

701
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:02,860
I could be more famous-er than Redwoods are tall.

702
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,880
The Beatles came down in their spaceship.

703
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,080
And the whole world went apeshit.

704
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:18,020
Just be like the Beatles and let it be.

705
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,960
Be like the Beatles.

706
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,900
Let it be.

707
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,020
Twinkle, twinkle, Ringo Starr.

708
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,060
George and John and Paul.

709
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:41,080
I could be more famous-er than Adams are small.

710
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,180
The Beatles came down in their spaceship.

711
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,140
And the whole world got wasted.

712
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:56,720
Just be like the Beatles and let it be.

713
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,700
Be like the Beatles.

714
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,480
Let it be.

715
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,640
James Kochalka, superstar.

716
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,120
The pants are in the air.

717
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,120


718
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,120


719
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,120


720
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,120


721
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,580
The pants are up now.

722
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,760
Thank you.

723
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,520
Thank you.

724
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,400
Thank you.

725
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,720
Thank you.

726
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:25,760
Thank you.

727
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,480
Thank you.

728
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,620
And, yes, dear friends, you can write to James Kochalka and see about getting his CD.

729
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,100
Here's the address.

730
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,280
Got that pencil ready?

731
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,480
James Kochalka.

732
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,040
Spell that however you please.

733
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,340
P.O. Box 8321.

734
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,380
That's P.O. Box 8321.

735
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,640
Burlington, Vermont.

736
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,720
05402.

737
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,720
Burlington, Vermont.

738
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,280
05402.

739
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,720
I've been to Burlington, Vermont.

740
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,240
I had to throw some...

741
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:12,340
I had to throw an Alamo full of drunken teenagers off of the stage just so I could quit preaching, friends.

742
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,400
That was the way it was.

743
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,020
I hate that.

744
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,280
We want it now.

745
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,020
We want Neptune and we want it now.

746
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,360
We want Uranus and we want it now.

747
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:37,340
We want Pluto and we want it now.

748
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,300
We want the sun and we want it now.

749
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,960
The 25-hour day.

750
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,740
We will enslave the sun.

751
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,420
We want the universe and we want it now.

752
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,340
Now?

753
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,680
Now!

754
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,200
Now!

755
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:07,500
We want the universe and we want it now.

756
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,940
We are, we are, we are, we are.

757
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,960
Well, at least in 80 days.

758
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,860
You can have it now.

759
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:21,200
If you're willing to spend that 30 bucks now, at least you'll have a...you'll be first in line practically.

760
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,620
I close my eyes and look at the inside of my eyelids.

761
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,320
Give me a focus.

762
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,140
Where am I now?

763
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,400
Where am I?

764
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:27,700
Where am I?

765
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,120
Open my eyes.

766
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,140
Oh, yeah, Mom.

767
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,620
Wait a minute.

768
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,420
I'm in a watery basement.

769
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,320
You don't like these memories, Dave?

770
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:35,720
No.

771
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:43,340
We can change them by stirring them around, unless this is really just one of your weird basement radio tapes and not a memory after all.

772
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,840
Well, do something with them, man.

773
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,900
I'm starting to want to...

774
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,820
Hey, look, I'm just a shipboard psychiatrist.

775
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,200
There's nothing I...I'm just a computer, Dave.

776
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,840
I'm a tool.

777
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,780
I'm one of your tools.

778
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,280
You control me.

779
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:54,640
You're a tool.

780
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,320
Why are you crying?

781
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,020
I'm just...I'm here to do therapy with you and so forth to keep you from cracking up completely.

782
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,980
I'm trying to keep from growing up.

783
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,100
Don't cry.

784
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,200
You did it again.

785
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,320
Look at the globules floating around.

786
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,340
Now how are you going to...turn the vacuum on, Dave.

787
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,040
You're puked again.

788
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:12,920
You're shining.

789
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,700
Zero G.

790
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,800
What can make them shiny like that?

791
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,560
I hate that.

792
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,680
Oh, man.

793
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,560
I bet you hate it, too.

794
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,980
And all the voices in your head probably love to see those globules of vomit floating around.

795
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,580
They're kind of pretty, actually.

796
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,620
Floating at zero gravity.

797
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,220
I'm going to do...I'm going to do the subgenius marriage ceremony.

798
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:42,360
Only everybody here has probably heard that same old, long, wonderful ceremony.

799
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,960
I'm just going to do the quick version of it.

800
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,360
Friends, find yourself a mate.

801
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,600
Just think of one.

802
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,620
If you have one nearby, grab it.

803
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,900
I've got mine.

804
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:12,900
And, uh, friends, if there are any gathered here today who object to having everyone in this room join together with whoever they want to be joined together with in holy matrimony, for better or for worse, but not for long, just hold your fucking peace because we don't want to be together.

805
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:12,900


806
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:12,900


807
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:12,900


808
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:12,900


809
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:12,900


810
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:12,900


811
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:12,900


812
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:12,900


813
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,080
We don't care.

814
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:18,080
And we're going to make this a short-duration marriage that will last only 24 hours.

815
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,920
That's the promise.

816
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:26,940
If only we could all test our marriages out when short-duration marriages start.

817
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,460
The lawyers would lose a lot of money.

818
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:37,540
If only we could sell short-duration divorces for as cheap as we give away the marriages, which is for free.

819
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,080
Friends, I'm going to marry you right now.

820
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,460
By the power invested in me as a holy man.

821
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,880
By J.R. Bob Doherty.

822
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,660
Don't try to fight me,уєn?

823
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:49,900
Does anybody want to do it?

824
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:49,980
No.

825
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,380
God, you just aren't going to let me be your pastor.

826
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,880
But I'm going to be.

827
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,140


828
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,140


829
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,500
You're a serving pastor and you can't have a man's sanctity.

830
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,820
But it kinda works.

831
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,900
The degree to which a Madame dear, if she's called a estoure with me, I think we're gonna focus on her family.

832
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,040
Do you think you care at this point?

833
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,040


834
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:10,060
I, I can aware very well but not in practice in my lifetime, and, and, and Ahí tampoco.

835
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:10,560
Well, you can tell them.

836
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:10,560


837
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,840
what we're going with is awesome stuff.

838
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,400
No, stop.

839
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,740
I wonder who's next.

840
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,980
In the name, Otis.

841
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,520
Otis.

842
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,400
In the name of Screamin' Jay Hawkins.

843
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,820
In the name of...

844
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,380
Wendy O. Williams.

845
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,580
In the name of Tammy Y. Neff.

846
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,300
I now pronounce all of us man, wife, fame,

847
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,080
man in car keys, wife and pet at home,

848
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,140
wife and dildo, man in right hand,

849
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,680
whatever the hell it is, you're all married now,

850
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,320
you can fuck with impunity, mom won't know,

851
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,040
and the law doesn't care, praise Bob.

852
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,400
Oh gosh, where's the squid?

853
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,720
Oh gosh.

854
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,060
I was just...

855
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:10,060


856
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,920
I'm gonna consummate my marriage up here, friends.

857
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, praise Reverend Gordon Zola.

858
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,860
He brought the squid.

859
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:18,580
Friends, now.

860
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,560
This isn't the infant, this is just a larval squid.

861
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,000
This is actually, it's been stunned.

862
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,520
It's still alive, but it's, uh,

863
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,020
we've had it in the refrigerator.

864
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,780
This is a, for those of you who have,

865
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,540
you know, city kids,

866
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,260
Yankees, no offense,

867
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,620
for those of you who've never,

868
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,360
ever known the pleasures of life

869
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,420
out in the small towns,

870
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,820
in the woods and fields, the cattle ranches,

871
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,800
concentration camps,

872
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,880
this animal is known as a prairie squid.

873
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,060
You'll notice that it's got a sort of a penis-like appendage on the top,

874
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,380
and a little, almost like a vagina here in the, in the middle.

875
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,840
And you know, there's been many a subgenius lad and lass

876
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,040
who's gone out into the field

877
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,860
when Ma and Paul were busy going to church,

878
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,840
covered their laps with honey or molasses or something,

879
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,860
laid and started honking on their squid call,

880
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,280
laid back there in the grass,

881
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,700
waiting for that fecund, mighty little cephalopod,

882
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,400
that little mollusk, to come crawling up

883
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,980
and join you in sacred matrimony, holy love,

884
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,480
with this beautiful little animal.

885
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,700
Nowadays, most people, most people, if they even know what a prairie squid is,

886
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,020
they don't know what a prairie squid is.

887
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,100
They see him at the supermarket, dead, shaved, wrapped up in cellophane,

888
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,380
in the freezer, freezer compartment.

889
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,920
But friends, Bob Dobbs himself had a vision.

890
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,440
He had a vision that someday,

891
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,900
someday the skies would break open,

892
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,920
Jehovah One would have mercy on the human race,

893
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:06,700
and literally, prairie squid would rain from the sky.

894
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,740
Prairie squid, falling from the sky,

895
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:14,140
83-D squid, man, they get me so high,

896
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,260
83-D squid, now they're falling, oh no,

897
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,680
83-D squid, I'm gonna hit his home.

898
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,940
Oh, there's nothing like a rain in prairie squid.

899
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,220
We pulled off to the side,

900
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,320
we just knew they wanted to ride,

901
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,400
the sweetest squid you will ever know.

902
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,640
Blow you right through the door,

903
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:53,280
they'll blow you right through the hard door.

904
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,180
83-D squid, falling from the sky,

905
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,620
83-D squid, man, they get me so high,

906
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,660
83-D squid, well, they're falling, oh no,

907
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,920
83-D squid, I've got a tentacle.

908
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,540
Oh no! There's two!

909
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,440
Oh, there's a tentacle!

910
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,020
There's a tentacle!

911
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:11,400
There's a tentacle!

912
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,400
Hey, oh, a tentacle's a tentacle!

913
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,700
Oh my God, oh, oh, look at this!

914
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,080
It's little suction cups,

915
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,600
boy, those peel,

916
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,780
oh, first one to peel the suction cups off.

917
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,700
Oh, I like it so much.

918
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,660
Uh, yeah.

919
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,800
Mm-hmm.

920
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,080
Yeah.

921
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,980
So, if you're ever out in your life,

922
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,060
don't think you have to run and hide

923
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,460
before you see some hairy people,

924
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:37,800
isn't that husband?

925
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:37,800


926
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:37,800


927
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,140
Anyny touch that creepy pink snow,

928
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,280
fallin' down, oh no!

929
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,340
Hairy pink snow fallin' down from the sky.

930
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,160
Oh, is that slipste writing?

931
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,780
Just fall on over the hollow inside.

932
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:58,360
83-D squids, from the sky,

933
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,900
83-D squid, man, they got me so high,

934
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:08,320
83D Squid, where the corns alone, 83D Squid, that's right, the Lord!

935
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:16,640
83D Squid fell from the sky in front of my car while I was driving down the I-9.

936
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:22,400
I pulled over, I opened my car door, but they were blowing my mind through the car door.

937
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,740
Praise to all the Perry Squids.

938
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,940
Ah, yeah!

939
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,120
Yeah!

940
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:27,980
Yeah!

941
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:30,560
Ah!

942
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,220
Whoa!

943
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,660
Well, that's, there's somebody who knows somebody.

944
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,380
You notice I didn't mention anything about de-beaking the Perry Squid.

945
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:56,620
I like to see how many people go and try to have their way with that Perry Squid.

946
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,860
Sans de-beaking.

947
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,560
Oh, yeah.

948
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,000
I had my head up your ass.

949
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:12,240
The worms crawl through my brain, into your colon, on up through your throat.

950
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:22,520
Instead of no, I'll throw the one on your thug and through your mouth, on up into your head.

951
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,260
Friends, time is running out.

952
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:32,820
PM��딱

953
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:34,500
Until what?

954
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,840
Jason SEVENTINK.

955
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:40,880
Imagine getting anything you ever wanted internet.

956
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,840
Imagine getting anything you ever wanted in your wildest dreams.

957
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,520
Anything pretty wild, I know.

958
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:53,380
Anything you ever wanted for only $30!

959
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,580
kän그� במץ Grace.

960
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,320
Nhơi, Oakmari.

961
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,180
No.

962
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:56,720
Regina meek miner.

963
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:07,680
Imagine losing everything you ever wanted and ever had because you weren't sure you wanted to spend that $30.

964
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:13,440
Friends, the signs of the end times are nigh.

965
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,280
The end is indeed nigh.

966
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,020
Signs, there are signs in the heavens and signs in the earth.

967
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,360
Blood bunches up from the earth.

968
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,100
There are lights in the sky rebuking thee, my friends.

969
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,420
And if you think he's kidding, he's not.

970
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,320
Epic funny joke.

971
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,060
Have you been reading the book of Revelation lately, friends?

972
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,320
Have you been reading the book of the subgenius?

973
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,800
Have you been reading Revelation X?

974
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,900
Well, it's all there.

975
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:47,160
The signs are written there and you can read about them in the plain viewer this morning.

976
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,620
You can hear them on the radio every morning.

977
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,100
You can hear them talking about the signs of the end times.

978
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:59,740
And friends, you can read in your Bible, you can read in your book of the subgenius.

979
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:05,140
The seven seals shall rise up from the arctic ocean.

980
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:11,340
Barking and juggling and balancing a giant surface ball on the end of their noses.

981
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:17,660
Playing happy birthday to you on little bicycle horns.

982
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,280
The seven seals are coming.

983
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,340
And the seven fires are coming.

984
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:26,520
And the oils and bowls shall be emptying upon the earth.

985
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,840
The vials full of plague and viruses.

986
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:34,760
And friends, they've got some pretty cool viruses in store for you.

987
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:41,780
They've got some viruses that you'd probably pay 20% interest extra just to get.

988
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:47,020
There's some cool viruses and plagues on the way, friends.

989
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,700
For those of you who are saved.

990
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,100
Oh, for those who decided to die.

991
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:53,320
Oh, for those who decided to die.

992
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:53,320


993
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:53,900
Oh, for those who decided to die.

994
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,400
I like that Bob stuff.

995
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,660
I thought it was pretty funny, but not funny worth $30.

996
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:08,620
Oh, you will think it real funny, friends, when God's wine press crushes out the grapes of wrath.

997
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,780
And the blood of your sins flows out.

998
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:21,560
And God, or Jehovah One, takes the shoes off your sandals and starts squishing on that big fat full of dead human souls and bodies.

999
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:27,600
Squishing the blood of his wine press in between his toes just because it feels good.

1000
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:42,240
And you won't think it's so funny when a giant can opener comes down and pries open the top of the globe and scoops out all the magma so that the earth freezes.

1001
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,800
Except for the volcanoes that make it heat up to death.

1002
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:51,540
And you won't think it's so funny when the great scouring pad and deep sea water.

1003
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:56,640
And the dishwashing liquid comes to scour the highways of all the cars.

1004
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:13,180
And my friends, you won't think it's so funny when the giant orange juice squeezer puts the heads of all the people on earth inside of it and squeezes their ill-begotten conspiracy-dude thoughts out into a nice little shot glass.

1005
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:18,600
And some elder god can tip back just for a nightcap some night.

1006
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,520
Oh, you'll think it's real fucking funny.

1007
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,280
When a giant mop from outer space sweeps away the cities.

1008
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,460
And when a great comet, a comet shall appear in the sky.

1009
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:41,000
A comet toilet bowl cleanser will pour its hydrochloric acid down into the sinks and toilet bowls of your very mind.

1010
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:48,940
Into your skull to wipe out the sin and the disgusting muddy crumbling lack of faith they've found.

1011
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,400
You won't think it's so funny.

1012
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,980
When you're thrown into the giant washing machine of Gabbro, France.

1013
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:04,680
You won't think it's so funny when a giant vacuum cleaner comes down from outer space and sucks up all the cities of America.

1014
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,860
America the unrepentant.

1015
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:14,820
If America is too blind to see the truth of Bob, then let us finish ripping its eyes out.

1016
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:21,060
Or at least pull its left eye out so you can turn it around and point it at the right eye.

1017
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,800
Just long enough for it to look at its own eyes.

1018
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:30,760
Because my friend, what else are you gonna do?

1019
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:34,600
Are you gonna hide from God?

1020
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,880
You can't hide from God, cause he's bigger than you are.

1021
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,140
He's bigger than the whole universe. He's bigger than all infinity.

1022
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:49,040
You can't hide from Bob Dogg, because he's stupider than you are.

1023
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:55,080
You can't hide from Bob, because his face has been videographed and put up with more places than yours have.

1024
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,240
You can't hide from God, cause he's bigger than you are.

1025
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:03,300
You can't run, as J.R. Hypersleet said.

1026
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,360
You can't run from your own legs, cause not much of your use is to run away from a leg.

1027
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:11,060
How are you gonna run from your own legs? You can't run from your own legs.

1028
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:14,120
You can't hide from God, cause he's bigger than you.

1029
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,420
You can't think about your own brain.

1030
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,100
Cause it's what's doing the thinking to think about it with.

1031
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,640
How are you gonna think about your own brain?

1032
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:30,080
You gonna, like, just put a computer in there and say, okay, reboot, now think about my brain?

1033
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:34,500
You can't wash water, it's already the wettest thing there is.

1034
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,160
You can't clean soap, it's already the cleanest thing there is.

1035
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:44,420
You can't swallow your own throat, you can't digest your own stomach, you can't pee your own dick.

1036
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,440
It's too big to go through that little hole, mine is anyway.

1037
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,640
You can't pee your own dick, you can't swallow your own throat, you can't digest your own stomach.

1038
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,400
You can't run from your own legs.

1039
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,920
You can't hide from God, cause he's bigger than you, bigger than all infinity.

1040
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,480
You can't hide from Bob, cause he's stupider than you are.

1041
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,900
Huh, how many somebody my legs on fire pulled a lever down you go?

1042
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,240
She ain't got no legs.

1043
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,560
Praise J.R.

1044
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:14,340
You can't rip off your own chain, cause he's what's already been ripping you off to begin with.

1045
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:27,720
But friends, you know earlier I said there was only one unforgivable sin, and that was the sin of not sending in your $30.

1046
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:34,300
Actually there's another unforgivable sin, and that's the sin of believing in Bob and nothing else.

1047
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:40,140
Bob is not here to be your one true personal savior.

1048
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:46,300
Bob Dobbs, that man J.R. Bob Dobbs, is here to be a short-term, personal savior.

1049
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:49,020
He does not want more religious news.

1050
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,480
He does not want more nuts in this world.

1051
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,560
He does not want more curts and crackpots who cannot think for themselves,

1052
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,980
leaning on him like a crutch.

1053
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:03,800
If we wanted it to be a fan club, we would have called it the crutch of the genius,

1054
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,900
not the goddamn church of the fucking sub-genius.

1055
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,060
It ain't the intelligence that counts, it's the sense, God damn it.

1056
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:16,800
Common sense, sense of humor, and of course dollars and a cent.

1057
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:24,600
Now friends, I cannot tell you, and I cannot make it clear enough to you,

1058
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,820
how important the concept of a short-duration personal savior is.

1059
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,380
If Bob ain't giving you slack, kill Bob and find another personal savior.

1060
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:38,720
It can be any goddamn thing you want it to be, but there's a personal savior for me right now.

1061
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,320
A beautiful personal savior.

1062
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,860
This is my personal savior for right now, a $1 bill.

1063
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,020
But lest I become completely innocent.

1064
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:49,940
I'm addicted to it.

1065
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,280
Well, I'll do the same thing as Bob.

1066
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:57,880
Friends, as long as the smoke from this dollar bill is still rising up to heaven,

1067
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:05,420
the invisible spice monsters who really are up there know there's still something down here on earth worth saving.

1068
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:14,420
Friends, you do have to make your own slack.

1069
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:16,420
You make your own slack.

1070
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,360
Bob will not make it for you.

1071
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:25,760
Bob is not the answer, and neither is anything else.

1072
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:35,540
Do you understand how important it is that you learn to think for yourself?

1073
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,220
But only Bob can show you how.

1074
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,240
Question authority.

1075
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,980
Question authority.

1076
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:49,920
Or else.

1077
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,640
Praise Bob.

1078
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,500
Or else.

1079
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:05,060
But we're leaving the nest now, and as we conform to the sex goddesses,

1080
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:10,560
we won't think about earths of stupid jobs and humans and pollution.

1081
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:17,880
No, we'll think of the comic books, the fast food stores, the glorious forests and cities, and the...

1082
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,860
...of passing time!

1083
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:31,580
People don't have any power within them.

1084
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:31,960
Nobody will think to themselves more mature and clever through the series.

1085
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,140
No.

1086
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:36,320
Especially those of us that have much experience in the space and in the solar system.

1087
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,660
The behavior, the behaviour, the type of person that we want toaghve to go, iscé gal Bien다고.

1088
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,480
All connected, but of course in another world.

1089

Blo wus impeachment

1090
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:57,640
Go to sleep and dream of pleasure ships from high above on July 5th this year.

1091
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:14,920
Go to sleep and dream of twilight, my love of eyes, a dream so far back now.

1092
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:25,760
Sex goddesses and squids shall ride your way.

1093
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:34,360
The way of the moon keeps you safe until next day.

1094
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:42,960
Sex goddesses and squids shall ride your way.

1095
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,640
The smiling faces bow.

1096
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:51,740
The way of the moon keeps you safe until next day.

1097
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:58,320
Go to sleep.

1098
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:15,360
Go to sleep.

1099
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:26,280
By counting sheepfolds, you will follow rules into the hell they build.

1100
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:44,520
Go to sleep and dream of times when we will be to sing and praise the name of the Father.

1101
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,680
Praise God.

1102
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:49,200
God bless you all.

1103
01:00:49,660 --> 01:01:02,040
Amen.
