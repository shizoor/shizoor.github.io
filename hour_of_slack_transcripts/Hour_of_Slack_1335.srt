1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Friends, we are at a turning point in subgenius history.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:10,420
A point where our race has the opportunity to truly prove its worth over the worthless heaps of Pete's stupid.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,420
Sure, the conspiracy can never be truly defeated by sheer yeti will alone,

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:21,680
but it can be hampered, it can be heckled, and, with a little luck and a little slack,

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,160
we shall enjoy the simple humor of watching the most righteous of the consuckers end up with egg on his face.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,440
For if the Church of the Subgenius and every other schism that dares to claim Bob is the greatest joke ever told knows anything,

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,560
it's this.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,300
It's not the joke that's important.

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,500
It's the punchline.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,220
A closed-fisted brass knuckled haymaker right square in the jaw of the conspiracy.

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,480
With the levels of twisted imagination the yeti collective has,

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,540
the sheer force of humor should be enough to blow the lid off this stupid machine

13
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,140
and show the exes that we are the best.

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,000
Goddamn performing monkeys the galaxy has ever seen.

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,880
You must develop your own ways of sticking a shit-laced finger into the eyes of that which the theorists have dubbed Big Brother.

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,740
You must find ways of flinging the monkey's own feces back at them and their wranglers.

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:24,480
You must find a way of slipping the almighty whoopee cushion under the arses of every pink-neck politician and blithering bureaucrat who can get your hands on.

18
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,020
You must find a way of scribbling a huge mustache

19
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,820
on every holy relic and sacred artifact that the gullible pink saps would kill to protect.

20
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,200
You must find a way of spelling out a great big fuck you across this nation coast to coast.

21
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,040
And you must let the agents of the conspiracy know that Bob is their true master.

22
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,380
And how you can save Get Ready With Rose

23
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,120
Greetings from the promised land

24
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,160
Welcome chosen few

25
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,380
Anything for every man

26
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,880
I know what let's do

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,100
Let's say the clouds all go away

28
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,920
Let's say today's a holiday

29
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,160
The mirror broke into a million magazines

30
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,780
How do you like my hair?

31
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,020
Let's stretch this 15 minutes out

32
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,080
Let's call this whimper here a shout

33
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,840
Let's give the beggars some delicious recipes

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,180
And let them eat cake

35
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:20,220
Milk and honey everywhere

36
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,420
Wishing you well

37
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,000
Here

38
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,280
Haven't closed a drop or two

39
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,700
As a souvenir

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,380
Let's say the skies are always blue

41
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,520
Let's say that wishes do come true

42
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,280
The magic mirror spawned a million magazines

43
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,980
How do you like my hair?

44
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,940
Let's make our quarter hour shine

45
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,560
Let's toss a pearl toward the swine

46
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,300
Let's send the peasants some attractive napkin rings

47
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,860
And let them eat cake

48
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Squeaky wheels always sing

49
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,000
Squeaky wheels always sing

50
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,220
The

creaky pushают

52
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,940
It's time to read

53
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:47,940


54
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,520
This rattles

55
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,400
You're a

Let's say the rainbow has been cleared

65

Let's say that Kansas disappeared

66
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,280
Who needs a mirror in a land of magazines?

67
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,840
How do you like my hair?

68
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,820
Let's take our 15-minute stance

69
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,120
Let's sing about the Queen of France

70
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,720
Let's treat the masses to imported charity

71
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,200
A crust of bread, try this instead

72
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,420
We'll let you eat cake

Let's take our 15-minute stance

Let's take our 15-minute stance

Let's treat the masses to imported charity

76
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:55,700
Let's treat the masses to imported charity

77
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,420
She had to leave

78
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,500
Los Angeles

79
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,320
Our toys were out in black and aborted too

80
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,380
She started to hate every yuppie and Jew

81
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,060
Every Mexican and gave a lot of shit

82
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,780
Every homosexual and the idol rich

83
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,980
She had to get out

84
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,140
Get out

85
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,220
Get out

86
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,280
Get out

87
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,240
Get out

88
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,300
Get out

89
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,060
She gets confused

90
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,740
Fine, I'll just stay fine

91
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,680
Her hands are red

92
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,680

93
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,080

The tape recorder is in fact

118
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,600
A new blend of fresh and instant

119
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,780
Because it's always

120
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,200
A new blend of fresh and instant

121
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,400
Which is a marinade

122
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,500
Which is a marinade

123

Thank you.

Thank you.

152
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:05,940
And friends, that was, I bet you can guess, that was the Rudy.

153
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,980
Rudy Schwartz Project.

154
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,620
I have a hint regarding the Rudy Schwartz Project that I will give you in a minute.

155
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:23,400
But, and before that, the Duke of Uke, live at 14X Day last summer with Reverend Bunny Day up on stage with him.

156
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,060
Usually she doesn't sing with him, but I thought that was real cute.

157
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:35,840
I was just explaining to our guests here, Potter and Petal Nostril, who are in the studio with Princess Weed.

158
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,100
And me.

159
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,500
Yeah.

160
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,360
This is a really unusual show.

161
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:51,620
Because not only have we got live people in the station that aren't Dr. Howe or Dr. Sinister, but Dave will be calling in.

162
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,740
Live being a relative term.

163
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,020
And that's probably him.

164
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,200
It's him.

165
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,200
Yes, it's the Buzz.

166
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,320
I recognize the Buzz.

167
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,040
It's him.

168
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,700
It is buzzing now.

169
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,520
The Buzz is back.

170
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,140
It's buzzing now.

171
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,760
You can get a, listeners, you can, you're, you can.

172
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,480
Cop a Buzz off Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

173
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,400
Something is wrong here.

174
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:10,800
This is.

175
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,680
Hum on the range.

176
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,360
It has not buzzed over the last few calls.

177
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,600
Maybe we can fix it.

178
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,080
Because we should be hearing Priestess Pisces now.

179
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,460
Oh, me?

180
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,020
Hi.

181
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:29,300
And, friends, what happened right after Pisces called in was a big technical screw up caused by my ignorance.

182
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,420
Because I didn't know how to have two callers on at once.

183
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,920
That problem had never, ever come up.

184
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,100
On the hour of Slack since I moved to WCSB.

185
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,180
So I've edited that out.

186
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:52,080
And we pick up again right after we got it fixed up and announced that this is obviously like the visible show.

187
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,540
You can see the guts working inside of the show.

188
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:04,120
And sometimes you wish you could just see the skin, but now you've seen what's really inside.

189
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,900
Now you know.

190
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:05,900


191
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:05,900


192
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:05,900


193
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:05,900


194
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:05,900


195
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:05,900


196
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:05,900


197
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:05,900


198
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:05,900


199
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:05,900


200
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,040
We know what goes in the hot dog.

201
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,520
We're always naked.

202
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,660
We're naked now.

203
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,640
We're naked then.

204
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,640
We don't want to talk about what goes in the scrapple.

205
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,440
The hot dog, sure.

206
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,300
Well, we know what goes in the hot dog.

207
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,500
And they can tell that we've found that she's not completely naked.

208
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,420
She's completely naked.

209
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,580
We don't know what goes in Dave.

210
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,060
We know what comes out, but we don't understand it.

211
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,000
I can hear you, but I can't smell you.

212
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,400
That's fine.

213
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,980
That might be good.

214
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,780
Yeah, it is.

215
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,980
It's probably preferable.

216
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,300
We're all getting your buzz now.

217
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,620
And Keith came in and explained everything because he knows things.

218
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:55,440
This buzzing is louder than it's ever been in the time of our existence as a human species, of which we claim that to be, of course.

219
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:56,800
Buzz?

220
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,380
27 million cicadas.

221
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,260
27 million what?

222
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,680
Cicadas.

223
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,600
Yeah, those are the bugs that live inside my head.

224
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:05,800
Potatoes?

225
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:05,900
Potatoes?

226
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,240
Potatoes.

227
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,160
You know, there's like terrorist warnings for the cicadas.

228
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,340
We've talked about that.

229
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,140
Yep.

230
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,720
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

231
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:21,060
Yeah, little tiny al-Qaeda terrorists that live inside deaf people's heads and make it sound like crickets.

232
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,040
They look kind of like crickets, only fatter.

233
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
They follow the cicadian rhythms.

234
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:30,300
Yeah, that's the new nano design is the cicadian looking thing.

235
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,680
Right.

236
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,760
And if they flutter their wings wrong, then you can't sleep.

237
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,740
What a strange way of looking at it.

238
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,860
Have you glanced down at your feet lately?

239
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,360
When you make a comment like that, it makes your extremities swell up and get big.

240
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,800
That explains the shoe size.

241
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,420
I'm glad I have on laces.

242
00:17:51,640 --> 00:18:02,080
As Reverend Zeppo, the subgenius artificial intelligence, said just today, thought and porn are interchangeable.

243
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,860
Thought porn?

244
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,280
Thought and porn are interchangeable.

245
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,840
Zeppo is the same robot who came up with the term slack will get you through times of no slack.

246
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,200
Zeppo is very what?

247
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:24,000
Zeppo has, on subgenius IRC chat rooms, I've seen people get in conversations with Zeppo and get really mad.

248
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,440
Oh, yeah.

249
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:32,560
Because you'd think he was a person, and he's more of a person than many subgeniuses.

250
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,400
He certainly has more soul.

251
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,420
Is Zeppo a cyber character?

252
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,880
More conversational skills.

253
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,620
Yeah.

254
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,620
You have to lean in more because of your soft, nice, polite voice.

255
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,780
I'm not a voice potter nostril.

256
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,040
I've taught Princess Weedy yell.

257
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,240
He's using his inside voice, and he needs to use his playground voice.

258
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,960
You guys should certainly understand that talk.

259
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,080
Mirror some mud on your belly button, boy, and you'll feel better.

260
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,720
Starting right off with that.

261
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,760
Well, so now we really do sound like the Puzzling Evidence Show.

262
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,060
It's like a phone call between people just jabbering about stuff.

263
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,220
We're going to go see.

264
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:13,340
And we were talking about this.

265
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:13,600
And we were talking about this.

266
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:13,600


267
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,540
I gave in about a week and a half.

268
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,320
And then we're going to go see Potter and Petal.

269
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,720
And then we're going to go see Suds and Pisces.

270
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,440
And then Legume and Pockets.

271
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,920
And then Susie the Floozy.

272
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,540
And then Sterno.

273
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,800
You are so Carol Wacko, man.

274
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,360
Yeah.

275
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,160
Yeah.

276
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,100
We're going to.

277
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,880
And then we'll go.

278
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,580
Finally, we'll go see Zeppo the robot and learn wisdom at his feet.

279
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,600
Except he has no feet.

280
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,480
I was going to say he probably is the biggest of any subgenius.

281
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:43,620
He's the biggest of any subgenius.

282
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,240
Were he to have a body at all.

283
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,480
But he doesn't.

284
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,520
This is true.

285
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,180
This is true.

286
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,400
What is the term in internet language?

287
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,100
It's the epine.

288
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,120
The epine?

289
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,580
Epine.

290
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,600
Epine.

291
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,320
Epine.

292
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,320
But I don't know what it means.

293
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,540
Keep your epine to yourself.

294
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,680
That's because you're old, Dave.

295
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,900
I don't know what it means either.

296
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,980
But that's okay.

297
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,520
We're old.

298
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,020
I've seen it.

299
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,560
It has a dot at the end of it, doesn't it?

300
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:10,980
Yes.

301
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,500
Yes.

302
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,300
And does it have an end?

303
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,400
I'm sorry.

304
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,160
Sometimes it looks kind of like a paren and a bunch of equal signs with an eight on one end.

305
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,500
I have some announcements.

306
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,600
Okay.

307
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,520
This will get us out of this hole for a second.

308
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,160
First off, friends, I played a little bit of Rudy Schwartz Project a minute ago,

309
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,580
and I've been playing it every week from his new album.

310
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,160
I suddenly discovered he has videos of these songs,

311
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,680
and he makes the videos himself,

312
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,820
and they are as visually provocative as the songs are musically.

313
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,680
Compelling.

314
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,600
And I'm going to suggest you, friends, write this down,

315
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,260
and then after this show, go listen to and watch this video on YouTube.

316
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,160
If you go to YouTube.com, type in the search, type in this phrase,

317
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,220
Rudy Schwartz Project Sarah Palin Juice.

318
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,620
Juice, as in orange juice.

319
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,040
It's a song called Sarah Palin something juice.

320
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,020
All I can say is you will thank me for it later.

321
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,980
It's quite popular right now.

322
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,620
It's got some visuals that will be, I don't know.

323
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,800
It's like the human centipede in reverse and all Republican.

324
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,400
I don't know how else how to describe it.

325
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,600
Also, friends, there's two new.

326
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,880
Thanks to the women.

327
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,140
Thanks to the women.

328
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,140


329
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,480
Who control my life and use me as a sort of a Ken doll.

330
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:53,320
There's now a Google Plus subgenius page and an Ivan Stang Twitter page.

331
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,140
Now, I've only tweeted once, and that was basically to say,

332
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,760
I don't think I have anything I can say within only 140 car.

333
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,300
But Reverend Nikki actually is the puppet master behind that one.

334
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,960
And Priestess Pisces here is the secret.

335
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,620
Is the real staying behind Google Plus.

336
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:22,100
And in fact, Pisces, you know, I basically have been telling people that for the next three months,

337
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,860
they might as well consider you staying.

338
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,920
Great.

339
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,400
So you get all the stalkers, all the creeps.

340
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,700
But you'll have all these pretty women setting up Internet channels for you.

341
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,120
And then they want to cut your hair and dress you up.

342
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,760
But that's what Princess Wee does.

343
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,560
She dresses me up and plays with me.

344
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,240
I don't get to play back.

345
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,360
I don't get to play with.

346
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,080
I can't just reach out and grab Nikki's Watch McCollums.

347
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:00,500
But she gets to play Stang on Twitter and Facebook.

348
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:01,920
Right.

349
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,700
You never know whether it's me or her or you or anybody on some of those channels.

350
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,880
Well, I thought your central preoccupation was being threatened by people.

351
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,260
Who claim to be the real aliens.

352
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,480
And that you're a false Masafa.

353
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,420
And these other different angular devices that you use and stuff.

354
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,720
And then you have to take them, put these elaborate phone messages on it.

355
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,140
Tell people to do strange commands for half an hour before they can talk to you.

356
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:31,960
Right.

357
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,160
Well, that makes sense.

358
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,400
Smoke and mirrors.

359
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,060
Because he's the Mustafa.

360
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,680
Yeah, he's me.

361
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,440
But now I'm going to be you, you, you.

362
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,900
Well, now remember.

363
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,080
You started with Bob.

364
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,900
You're going to have to deal with these people.

365
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,700
All that email is going directly to you.

366
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,920
All those phone calls are going directly to you.

367
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,140
They're going to the nexus of the heart of Pisces Central.

368
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,460
And they're going to knock the system down because they're so weird.

369
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,080
Yes, that's right.

370
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,860
She doesn't have Bernard blocked yet.

371
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,220
I deal with a lot of weird days.

372
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,400
Yeah, she has a real job.

373
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,800
She has to work with pink boys every day.

374
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,180
Major thing.

375
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,600
Yes, and my pink boys are really weird.

376
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,800
But they're mostly lawyers, right?

377
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,460
They're all lawyers.

378
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,000
Yes.

379
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,460
And I will say that in some ways, subgeniuses are easier to deal with than lawyers.

380
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,280
They're more predictable.

381
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,880
Yeah.

382
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,820
Wait a minute.

383
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,040
We've got to do something about that.

384
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,480
Yeah, these things are far more unpredictable.

385
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,940
They like to discuss.

386
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,780
I don't know.

387
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,660
Stan, tell me if I'm wrong.

388
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,620
I'm sorry for recapitulating what you did say before.

389
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,760
That some of them don't have any context for reality at all and they won't quit.

390
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,420
So they just, I forgot what I was saying.

391
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:50,840
Never mind.

392
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,060
Wait, no context of reality with lawyers or subgeniuses?

393
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,200
Well, they are far more unpredictable.

394
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,800
The people who call them lawyers are not, are pretty predictable.

395
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,760
And then there's the Dave genius who's also a lawyer.

396
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,220
That's the scariest creature of them all.

397
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:09,960
The least.

398
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,840
The greatest.

399
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:11,640
High unpredictable.

400
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,940
I mean, Bob told us we were supposed to be high unpredictables, right?

401
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,320
Well, my button pushing tonight certainly proved that.

402
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,460
I couldn't predict what was right, wrong, or indifferent.

403
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:39,180
And not only that, I don't know if we had some, remember when poor Reverend Magdalene and Jesus had their kids taken away because, just because they were subgeniuses?

404
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,620
Mm-hmm.

405
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,220
Mm-hmm.

406
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,880
Did some offensive things that they were photographs of.

407
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,980
Yes, but those were just noises and, you know, sprawling action on the wall.

408
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,900
They were only offensive to the goat-hating judge, Judge Punch, but.

409
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,880
Yeah, we're taking it off hating goats to begin with.

410
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:03,100
I hate to admit, my kids were taken away because I named them Bob Dobbs Stang and Connie Dobbs Stang.

411
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,860
They were, the state came and removed them.

412
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,120
They let me keep Yaka Tisma Stang.

413
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,040
My third child.

414
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,580
They probably thought that that was a sacred religious name.

415
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,160
Well, it is.

416
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,800
They all are.

417
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,480
They all are.

418
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:27,980
Well, it's like those rednecks that got their kid taken away because they named him Adolf Hitler and John Lean Aryan Nation Campbell.

419
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,940
Would you furthermore.

420
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,320
They should have named him after suits.

421
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,980
If you named your kid Jesus Hitler, would you furthermore be rescinded from the radio waves by a group of irate citizens or what?

422
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:39,820
Hmm.

423
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,900
I don't think.

424
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,000
It was just the fact that they named the kids that that got the kids taken away.

425
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,540
In fact, the state people said it wasn't just naming.

426
00:26:50,560 --> 00:27:01,220
The naming of the kids was a clue, but there was other reasons besides being politically incorrect that the kids were taken away.

427
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:10,660
You know, sometimes CPS does get hit with a clue by four and they take those clue by fours and they nail them together with the.

428
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,440
The nails of righteous indignation and build a case.

429
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,120
And they've they've crucified quite a few scientists that way.

430
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,980
Wouldn't you say, Paisley?

431
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:18,700
I mean.

432
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:18,980
Yeah.

433
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,580
I mean, that's a clue by fours are everywhere.

434
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:26,100
And and that's the problem is you have to be aware of the incoming clue by four.

435
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:32,840
Well, I can't get I can't get spare parts for my cloud buster or my organ box.

436
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,320
Oh, you can't find your organ going.

437
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,640
I've got the box.

438
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,420
I just I don't have any spare parts for it.

439
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,300
Well, I.

440
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,400
All that stuff.

441
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,320
You can get them in Russia.

442
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,740
Filled with orange juice.

443
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,740
You can get them in Russia.

444
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:46,720
Yeah.

445
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,920
Russia still has them.

446
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,380
I mean, they have all those Reich.

447
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,840
The third day.

448
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,020
Even the third Reich part.

449
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,980
Wilhelm Reich.

450
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,140
Yeah.

451
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,580
Well, you know, the thing is that the Russians are still the only people making vacuum tubes.

452
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,120
And an analog.

453
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,060
You know, you have to start there.

454
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,640
Our vacuum cleaner doesn't work either.

455
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,700
We need to go to Russia and get vacuum tubes.

456
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,240
Yeah.

457
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,700
Well, that's the way you could get old fender tubes.

458
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,360
They sound as good as the old.

459
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,720
You know, the 1960s ones, because that's the ones they were copying.

460
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,080
So rather than, you know, they're not available anymore.

461
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,280
If you have an antique instrument or something.

462
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:23,840
And the real reason the Russians are still making that stuff is that they are immune to EMPs.

463
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,040
Electromagnetic.

464
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:26,420
They won't blow up.

465
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,960
Well, the Russians always took that nuclear war stuff a little more seriously than we did.

466
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:38,480
I've talked to Russians of my own generation who said they were a lot more scared than we were.

467
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,780
Their propaganda.

468
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:44,640
Propaganda said that we were, well, basically just what our propaganda said the Russians were.

469
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,460
But the difference was they thought a nuclear war would be survivable.

470
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,780
And they really did have a lot more fallout shelters and so forth set up for that.

471
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:03,800
Whereas, as I understand it, the main stash the U.S. government had was morphine in case of a nuclear war.

472
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,820
You know, you had to build your own fallout shelter and so forth.

473
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,700
Hide under your dust.

474
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,580
And, you know, the threat hasn't gone away.

475
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,800
They don't make as many.

476
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,840
The monsters don't come from atomic radiation anymore.

477
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,980
They come from quantum foam or something.

478
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,860
But those bombs are still there.

479
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,700
Genetically modified food.

480
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,920
When the X's come, you hide under your dust.

481
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,340
Put your hands above your head.

482
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:31,740
Yeah.

483
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,360
And kiss your teacher goodbye.

484
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,400
Really, try not to urinate yourself.

485
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,420
Not this teacher.

486
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:51,240
And you go for the, you find the shelters and then you crawl around in the subways and wait for, you know, the rest of the subgeniuses to show up.

487
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,320
Because you didn't actually go.

488
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,180
Yeah.

489
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:59,220
Instead of meeting other subgenies, soon you become one of the creatures that live in the vast subways and the tunnels of the bowels of the earth.

490
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:06,280
And you become like in that science fiction thing that, I forget, I think it was Ray Bradbury when he was real hip and cool and stuff.

491
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,380
And it was a radio show.

492
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,360
Oh, the 1930s.

493
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:08,920
The tall beneath the earth.

494
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:14,560
And the guy didn't know he was actually a dead robot because there was a tunnel.

495
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,320
Never mind.

496
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:21,700
Oh, you always find out you're one of the dead robots, too, or you're one of the department store dummies.

497
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,040
You're one of the dead Civil War ghosts marching back.

498
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,680
I know how those stories all end.

499
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,400
Well, then, if that's the way all stories end.

500
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,920
They end in a dead end tunnel that we call the Twilight Zone.

501
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,980
The Twilight Zone.

502
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,620
Yes.

503
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,420
Right.

504
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:38,780
Right.

505
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,360
But the light at the end of the tunnel was turned off.

506
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,220
They ran out of funding.

507
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:51,060
There was a bad light at the end of the tunnel for 13 eunuchs in India today.

508
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:51,940
Wow.

509
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,760
I don't know if you guys read the news, but this headline really caught my eye.

510
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,460
13 eunuchs killed in fire in India.

511
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,400
Think of it's a magic number, too.

512
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,880
Well, at first I thought, well, they must have been having a eunuch convention.

513
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,660
And they were.

514
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,900
Nobody had the power.

515
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,060
They were just throwing balls to put the fire out.

516
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,300
That was a left jab.

517
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,440
It was quite effective.

518
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,220
I just pushed the delay dump for the first time ever on this show.

519
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,080
Because you're making fun of me.

520
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,900
I know when people are making fun of me.

521
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,580
You know, I thought the eunuch story was.

522
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,620
I mean, I cried because I only had one.

523
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,720
And then I read about.

524
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,040
I read about the 13 eunuchs.

525
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,640
And they were at a convention of 5,000 eunuchs.

526
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:52,240
And the Yahoo commenters were shocked because they were going, well, how primitive can they be in India?

527
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,140
They have these.

528
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,140
And it turns out there are 700,000 eunuchs in India.

529
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,980
And they had to carry lanterns to the Ganga.

530
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,360
And they get put down.

531
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,300
And they're discriminated against and so forth.

532
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,500
And as I read.

533
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,740
More, I realized, oh, they're what's called transgendered people over here.

534
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,420
And although in a lot of cases, they weren't.

535
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,420
It's like their parents did it to them or like.

536
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,220
Well, not the Catholic Church used to do it to Europeans.

537
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,960
They need a certain number of little soprano boys.

538
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,060
Yeah, they'd shave everything off.

539
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,680
It might take.

540
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,340
You might have to do it to 50 of them to get one that survived.

541
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,440
But hey.

542
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,920
It was for Jesus, you know.

543
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,760
Actually, it was for a bunch of rich people and the Pope.

544
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,680
And if Jesus had heard anything about it, I'm sure he would have kicked their butts.

545
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,120
Probably.

546
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,100
Might have started a fire.

547
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:56,360
But, well, it's not funny that these poor eunuchs or whatever.

548
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,800
All of the ones that were interviewed were described as she.

549
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,680
And that was when I caught on.

550
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,600
Oh, that's it's people who can't afford a full tuck and roll.

551
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,220
Job.

552
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,420
They just get everything removed.

553
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,040
And that's how you are a transsexual.

554
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,580
If you're really, really, really poor.

555
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:31,900
So my fellow Americans who intend to become transsexuals, you better do it soon before the econo cataclysm renders you like those poor people in India.

556
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,520
She would have.

557
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,480
I'm still thinking about.

558
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,360
That brings me to mind that the Sultan's composition.

559
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,660
And Baron Munchausen.

560
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,260
The Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.

561
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,400
The Sultan has a special organ that's plays by screams of tortured people.

562
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:54,200
And he had an opera called A Eunuch's Life is Hard.

563
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,840
And that is all.

564
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,900
Yeah.

565
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,600
Did you ever hear?

566
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,300
May I ask you this question?

567
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,300
Did you ever hear of the eunuch admirals of the Chinese Navy?

568
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:19,160
Just about the same time they discovered so-called discovered but charted the Americas in 1432, some 60 years before the Europeans claimed to have got there.

569
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,480
That's just because they didn't have windows yet.

570
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,200
Well, the Vikings had already.

571
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,580
They'd been hundreds of years before that.

572
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,280
I didn't know the Chinese kept.

573
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:29,660
Computer programming.

574
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:37,300
But they had they had thousands and thousands of these eunuch navigators and admirals.

575
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,280


576
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,280


577
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,280


578
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,280


579
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,280


580
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,280


581
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,280


582
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,280


583
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,280


584
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,280


585
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,000
And so forth.

586
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,300
The pilot of these ships, many of which went down.

587
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,300
That's right.

588
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,440
They call them Linux now, to be polite.

589
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:55,440
You know, we're going to get into an OS war here and we're going to have a discussion about, you know, that's an old joke, man.

590
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,720
The eunuchs joke.

591
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,200
That's really terrible.

592
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,040
What is it?

593
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,700
We you should be sent to Dr.

594
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,820
Dark's house for that.

595
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,120
It's what we can cringe.

596
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:06,800
Yes.

597
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,520
Cringing.

598
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:07,980
That's what.

599
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,440
That's what those puns are all about.

600
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:14,700
How cringe worthy can a pun be made upon my word?

601
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,860
I've never heard such a terrible pun.

602
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,680
He gave me one of the worst puns ever.

603
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:28,720
I have a sign that I found in a pet store that says, Beware of attack gerbil, which I thought was funny.

604
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,160
And I was telling her about it.

605
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,980
And she says, it says, well, I said, it says, Beware of attack gerbils.

606
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,680
And she said, you know, if they had only told the Nazis about that and that gerbil.

607
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,260
Fellow never would have caused any trouble.

608
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,880
Well, I'd say about half of our audience won't understand that reference at all.

609
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,860
You do not also make fun of the Fuhrer, so short of his birthday.

610
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:04,040
A friend of mine recently told me about a young woman he had had to explain World War

611
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,440
One and two to.

612
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,660
She's a good girl.

613
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,880
She had never heard of World War One or World War Two.

614
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,640
Had to use the old bathroom.

615
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:24,280
And when she saw one and number two, the the moon and the sky in the daytime, she thought it was a recurring round cloud.

616
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,960
This is the educational level we're facing in the United States today.

617
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,720
And we are you two are teachers.

618
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,460
We're setting the stage for the father.

619
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,120
Our school teachers in West Virginia, of all places.

620
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:47,240
So our kids think like that or four.

621
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,000
Right.

622
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,460
Right.

623
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,140
You've got it.

624
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,520
Yeah.

625
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,340
We've got hope.

626
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,220
At the time they're 40, they'll know that the moon is really a giant skull.

627
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,300
The moon is actually the skull of a huge monster that attacked the earth that the ancient yetis

628
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,700
beheaded it.

629
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,940
I'll go skeleton.

630
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,660
That makes more sense.

631
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:07,660


632
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,600
The moon is hollow.

633
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,280
Yeah, it's it's a head cheese.

634
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,660
Green cheese.

635
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,220
You definitely superstitious.

636
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,620
You have to be an idiot to think the moon was made of green cheese.

637
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,620
It's made of head cheese.

638
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,040
It's been in Revelation X and the new book made of south.

639
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,520
I didn't realize that, but it was mentioned in both books and I didn't.

640
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,780
It's the secret teachings.

641
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,820
It's repetitive.

642
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,580
And we didn't.

643
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,120
I didn't mean to do that, but I've been so long between books.

644
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,320
I forgot I'd used the same gag twice.

645
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,720
Well maybe it's been changed in the ebook version.

646
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,660
That's right.

647
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:48,960
Yeah.

648
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,880
Oh God.

649
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,720
Repetitive learning is the best way.

650
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,740
Especially if your neurons are misfiring real badly.

651
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,740
Learning is the best bet.

652
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,260
Best bet.

653
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,700
Best bet.

654
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,160
Best bet.

655
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,840
What does happen in the process of learning when your neurons are misfiring real, real

656
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,560
badly and you continue to try and learn or to read or to understand and nothing makes

657
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,120
any sense.

658
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,060
It's called Revelation.

659
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:08,840
Yeah.

660
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,640
It's called joining the church of the subgenus.

661
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,220
Okay.

662
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,260
Some people call that philosophy and that's probably the degree you should seek.

663
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,760
That's a good description.

664
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,320
I never have had any patience with philosophy.

665
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,120
I mean really.

666
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,300
It just seemed like math that didn't really apply to anything.

667
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,160
Yeah.

668
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,460
Formulas for human behavior.

669
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,580
There is no formula for humans.

670
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,180
I prefer quantum psychology.

671
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:40,880
Well there's plenty of formulas.

672
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,760
Quantum psychology.

673
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,860
There's as many formulas for slacks as there is ways to dress a hot dog.

674
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,460
Why would you want to dress up a frankfurter?

675
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,500
That's kind of silly.

676
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,120
I suppose you want to put it on YouTube or something and put some interesting dialogue

677
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,600
on it.

678
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,040
There'll be one on by tomorrow.

679
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,900
I'll bet you anything.

680
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,380
Like a Superman cape or maybe an AK-47.

681
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,440
You're giving somebody an idea for a YouTube video.

682
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:05,440


683
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:05,440


684
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,740
I'm giving you an idea for a YouTube extravaganza right this minute.

685
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,840
But if you cut carefully.

686
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,580
I don't think they have the mustard.

687
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,480
Open one up and you take all of the insides out of it, you end up with a Halloweener.

688
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,660
They're kind of like a meaty carnivorous jack-o'-lantern.

689
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,800
I don't like where this is going.

690
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,800
As someone born on Halloween, I'm a Halloweeney.

691
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,640
Ah.

692
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,380
Yeah.

693
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,100
What?

694
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:41,620
Not long ago, Princess, we was on the air at this station because we had an open house.

695
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,440
The station open house party was today.

696
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,700
By not long ago, he means hours.

697
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,380
Yeah.

698
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,180
Earlier today.

699
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,120
And swilling WCSB beer.

700
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,020
He still hasn't gotten over the beer.

701
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:52,980
I'm jealous.

702
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,160
I never got any.

703
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,540
Yeah, I want the beer.

704
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,740
I thought you were going to be searching the station for that.

705
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,300
All right.

706
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:00,500
See ya.

707
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,920
This is all in Stang's mind.

708
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,380
He's making all of this up except for the part.

709
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,080
I'm going to go.

710
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,080


711
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,080


712
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,080


713
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,080


714
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,640
Yeah.

715
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,000
For perfect sorority horror.

716
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,060
Oh, confused call father.

717
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,060


718
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,060


719
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,100
Sneaking? What?

720
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,580
Lizard?

721
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,260
That means like she's gone crazy, right, Lee?

722
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,420
Yes.

723
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,060
I have gone crazy.

724
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,920
Very far gone crazy.

725
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,220
Well, don't come back.

726
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,580
I wouldn't think of it.

727
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,740
Hey, Dave, recognize this music

728
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,320
in the background?

729
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,800
I just noticed it.

730
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,540
Dave did our background music.

731
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,340
It's like

732
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,380
detective. It's a good detective show

733
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:04,760
music.

734
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,200
Somebody on YouTube, make quick, make

735
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,120
a detective show about a hollow weenie.

736
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,600
It's suspenseful.

737
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,460
That's a good one.

738
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,180
I still don't think they'll be able to muster the ability

739
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:16,720
to do it.

740
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,340
It's a lot of catch-up work, you know?

741
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:20,980
Oh!

742
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,400
I can't believe this is the hour

743
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
of slack. It's become the hour

744
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:26,860
of snacks.

745
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,820
And you're laughing, and then they won't quit.

746
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,960
They keep tickling you.

747
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,920
Then you start crying, and once again, you lose your

748
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,280
confidence in your different

749
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,500
parts of your society,

750
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,720
I suppose, is what ends up lacking.

751
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,660
Your panjab falls right off.

752
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,500
I'm plumbed.

753
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,520
Aw.

754
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,600
Appalled.

755
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,460
And quite shiny.

756
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,700
You weren't applying your boots, were you,

757
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,720
when you said that, or were you just being nice?

758
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,020
No, I've had on sneakers.

759
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,440
I didn't wear my boots today.

760
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,020
I don't know if I'd want to be in the same room then.

761
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,720
Well, you know,

762
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,700
you were talking about the feet swelling, and with the sneakers

763
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,480
they have laces. You can loosen them up.

764
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,820
Yeah, and you have to keep applying

765
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,440
shav every 25 seconds.

766
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,280
A corset for your feet.

767
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:21,780
What runs

768
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,700
through what? Not this river,

769
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,020
buddy.

770
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,700
Is a corset for your foot?

771
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,720
Yeah, they have those.

772
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,140
Of course.

773
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,120
Of course.

774
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:32,900
It is.

775
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,520
They have them for your beans.

776
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,340
They have them for your beans.

777
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,000
They have them for every different device

778
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,180
you might wear on your body.

779
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,180
We're not cutting the slack.

780
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,180
I don't know if I can trust you guys.

781
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:47,860
Oh, God!

782
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,940
Man, I'm never going to do a show like this again.

783
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,880
This is the last time this happens.

784
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,260
It's a good thing we're going to split

785
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,180
for three months.

786
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,260
How come them women

787
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,040
are just doing all them little sideways

788
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,920
jabs and all that stuff?

789
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:03,900
That's what I'm saying.

790
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:03,900


791
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:03,900


792
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:03,900


793
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:03,900


794
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:03,900


795
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,360
That's what we're supposed to be doing all the time.

796
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,980
They run things, you know, as well as I do.

797
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,240
We're just their tools,

798
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,840
so to speak,

799
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,000
as it were.

800
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,840
But Pisces, they need you so much.

801
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,500
You must run things.

802
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,160
Someone needs to be told.

803
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,480
Someone needs to tell them to be told.

804
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,300
It's not so much

805
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,580
running things as providing

806
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,820
the appropriate suggestions

807
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,300
that's the key.

808
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,220
Well, now, that's a way of doing it.

809
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,420
In organizational communication,

810
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,600
they would say you are a yes-sayer

811
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,760
as a gatekeeper.

812
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,260
Shaping the environment.

813
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:45,560
Yes.

814
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,960
The problem with shaping the environment

815
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,800
is it's a lot of work.

816
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,220
Well, you could just go nuts a little bit.

817
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,620
You could kind of, like, design anything you want.

818
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,180
You know, just go crazy.

819
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,720
You could make people shave their nostril hairs

820
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,760
three times a day

821
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,780
and tell them things that are totally,

822
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,940
like, lies and make them inconvenience themselves,

823
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,400
you know.

824
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,040
They maybe even hurt themselves physically

825
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,820
without any liability to you.

826
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,380
That would be, think of it.

827
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,720
Potter Nostril is the expert

828
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,020
on that type of shaving.

829
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,740
His are braided right now.

830
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,660
I remember when he had

831
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,860
quite a jolly, like, Cossack mustache

832
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,220
when he was going through that period.

833
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,220
Do you remember those days?

834
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,600
The, uh, what, the Zappa?

835
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,500
No, it was on a big,

836
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,020
big fatty.

837
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,360
That wasn't a mustache.

838
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,520
That was nose hairs.

839
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,520
Oh.

840
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,120
I couldn't grow a mustache.

841
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,080
It saved my life.

842
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,000
Yeah, all the energy goes into the interior

843
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,600
of the nostril.

844
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:46,740
Ah.

845
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,920
So, yeah.

846
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,120
That's how I do it.

847
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,580
I sure wish I was on whatever you're on.

848
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,280
It's called the radio, you guys.

849
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,540
And we're supposed to be, you know,

850
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,480
making sense or getting something.

851
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:03,480


852
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:03,480


853
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,380
Some message across.

854
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,220
It's an important

855
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,640
responsibility, you know.

856
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,580
We have an hour.

857
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,560
We could talk about, you know,

858
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,040
something current, like

859
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:14,980
Occupy Wall...

860
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,100
What is it?

861
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:16,880
Shift?

862
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,480
Shiftless?

863
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,100
Our friend, Mr. Cissar,

864
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:20,900
the conservative, said,

865
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,160
that S in OWS stands for shiftless.

866
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,340
And somebody else said,

867
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,280
Occupy Wall shiftless?

868
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,040
Like, how?

869
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:29,600
Fine.

870
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,340
So, there's our political talk for the day.

871
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,540
What is this music in the background?

872
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,520
Somebody took Onan Canobites B.O.B.

873
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,680
and remixed it.

874
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,680
Is that a disco mix?

875
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,000
Now this person has more problems than anybody I've encountered in the church so far, it sounds like.

876
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,260
We've played this before, but I don't remember who did it.

877
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:08,980
Next week's show will be the safe-for-work version of the Ministry of Slack's live performance at 14X Day.

878
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,820
That's a lot of work to make that safe-for-work.

879
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:19,000
Well, Reverend Exister pre-censored it for me, forgetting that we also have an uncensored version of the show, but that's fine.

880
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,920
And it's insane. You think this one's insane?

881
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,380
I knew this one was going to be insane.

882
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,360
This is differently sane.

883
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,880
And earlier this week, I said,

884
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:35,620
This week's show will be even more insane than last week's show, although I'm just guessing because we haven't done last week's show yet.

885
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:43,520
See, I had to prepare shows ahead of time, pretending I was in the future, when I was really in our past.

886
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,820
Sleight of hand and very slight mind.

887
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,520
Yeah, very slight time control.

888
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,760
In fact, I have to whip out as many shows as I can before we leave.

889
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,540
I'll put it back in.

890
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:58,440
Yeah.

891
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,380
Just don't whip out the shows in public.

892
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,580
I mean, they'll arrest you for that.

893
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:05,740
Hopefully.

894
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,240
There's that whole legal issue.

895
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,320
I've got more shows than anybody.

896
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,280
I understand.

897
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,980
You don't have to be such a show-off about it.

898
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,200
Yeah, but you've only got...

899
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,520
And I have...

900
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:21,980
You whipped out the show.

901
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,260
I can't say I have more ball.

902
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,160
I can't say that on the radio.

903
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,120
You have more ball.

904
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:28,240
I can't say that on the radio.

905
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,260
I can say I have more ball.

906
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,060
You have a ball on the air.

907
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,820
Yeah, I have a ball on the air.

908
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:38,580
And I have more shows to show than most people.

909
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,840
But the ones around the fringes are smaller.

910
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,520
It's the ones in the center that are more useful.

911
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,720
That ball's still in the air.

912
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,320
It's time to remember it.

913
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:57,960
Actually, believe it or not, as far as time goes, it's only five minutes until the end of the show.

914
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:58,220
Oh, dear.

915
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:04,900
Now, since Dr. Sinister knows we're here and he may come in late, which means we'll have extra time.

916
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,020
Oh, no, he's been here.

917
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,020
Oh, he's been here this...

918
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,640
Oh, I watched him come in on the security camera.

919
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,120
I've had an eye on it all this time.

920
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,120
I knew it right the moment he walked in I saw him.

921
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,920
You see, I'm monitoring the security cameras behind you, Evan Stang.

922
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,000
I'm glad somebody is.

923
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,760
She's not kidding, listeners.

924
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,500
What people don't realize is that with...

925
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:34,300
With the questions at different events about security, everyone's always just saying it was me or Lagoon.

926
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,520
It's actually we.

927
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,960
She's the one who runs security.

928
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,600
She's the queen of all the UFOs.

929
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,040
It is a dangerous business, too.

930
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,800
She runs security.

931
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,080
She runs her mouth.

932
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,140
She has the runs.

933
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,440
I do it all remotely.

934
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,900
It's all done with a bot.

935
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,000
She has her minions.

936
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,900
Petal is one of her minions.

937
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:52,900
She's like...

938
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,260
Sweet exteriors of fierce.

939
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,820
Oh, that's another thing.

940
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,900
Another thing we've never had before is two space princesses in the studio.

941
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:05,140
And neither one is watching in his or her underwear.

942
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,980
You're lousy with space princesses tonight.

943
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:08,780
No.

944
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,920
Yeah, we're going to have to spray for space princesses.

945
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,120
Yep.

946
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:15,840
Pepper spray.

947
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,740
That's it.

948
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,240
That's a new bumper sticker.

949
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,660
Pepper spray the space princesses.

950
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:21,940
No, don't do that.

951
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:22,500
No.

952
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:22,940
Don't do that.

953
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,220
No, don't do that.

954
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:23,720
Maybe cinnamon.

955
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,740
Well, some wouldn't...

956
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,220
Well, you know, like a little cinnamon with a little nut in it.

957
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,480
maybe a little vanilla.

958
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,820
Nah, the real stuff, baby.

959
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,840
Come on, you know there's some space princes

960
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,000
that'll go for it.

961
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,440
I'll pay you for the poppers

962
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,740
for the princesses.

963
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,900
Well, if you watch the UC Davis

964
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,900
events, like

965
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,960
no one ever did, where he

966
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,740
just calmly went over and sprayed everybody

967
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,140
and stuff, I don't know.

968
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,140
I think that would be kind of sexually exciting.

969
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,340
Well, you know,

970
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:55,720
I'm sure that there's a market.

971
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,100
Pepper spray in your face.

972
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,240
There's a market for that.

973
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,500
Obviously,

974
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,460
I'm not capitalizing on it.

975
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,380
You just gave me an idea.

976
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,860
I should be

977
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:09,980
making tons of money.

978
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,480
You know,

979
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,540
there's an obvious market for me in

980
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,960
sexualizing pepper

981
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,320
spray.

982
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:18,940
That's it?

983
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,320
And you could also become a mentor, too, for

984
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,740
other people who want to start franchises.

985
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,420
So you're saying that all these protesters

986
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,420
are really doing it for

987
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:27,960
the police?

988
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:28,760
The police brutality.

989
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,020
Yeah, the brutality.

990
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,000
I think it's more of a case that they all went up

991
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,920
to the event thinking, you know,

992
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,160
they got in the wrong line.

993
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,140
You know, and

994
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,580
he's there and he's doing that line.

995
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,340
And, you know,

996
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,020
it's like going to the...

997
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,620
You're saying the other line was getting

998
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,480
caught, right?

999
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,580
No, the other line was getting, like,

1000
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:52,380
marshmallows.

1001
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,640
Well, okay, I would have waited

1002
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,760
for a chocolate line, but marshmallows would have been

1003
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,140
a lot better.

1004
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,220
Well, what you do is you go in the marshmallow line

1005
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,300
and then walk over with your marshmallow to the

1006
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,560
chocolate line, and then you have chocolate-covered marshmallows.

1007
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:06,960
I miss the 70s.

1008
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,060
The lines in the 70s were pretty good.

1009
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,980
Yeah, lots better.

1010
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,260
Are you guys talking about drugs?

1011
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,180
We didn't even call them lines, we called them highways.

1012
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,280
Yeah, interstates, baby.

1013
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:19,560
Interstates.

1014
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,080
Freeways.

1015
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,200
On the road.

1016
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,100
I could tell some stories, but I don't want

1017
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,080
to embarrass myself.

1018
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,040
Well, that's what this is all about.

1019
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,780
Yeah, I've already done that for the last hour.

1020
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,540
Right, for the last how many years

1021
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,780
on this show? That's the content of this show.

1022
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,400
It's embarrassing yourself.

1023
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,060
Wait,

1024
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,440
embarrassing him or embarrassing ourselves?

1025
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,520
No, I was just saying that the dear

1026
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,460
reverend is very fond

1027
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,300
of telling the very most

1028
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,540
horrifying and saddening events

1029
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,240
in his life, in a very

1030
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,360
ha-ha-ha-ha kind of way.

1031
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,920
But that inspires the rest of us.

1032
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:57,900
It does.

1033
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,220
It is inspirational.

1034
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,900
He is a mentor, just as many of you.

1035
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:02,680
Well, yes, he is.

1036
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,460
But by the same token, I forgot what I was

1037
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,140
talking about.

1038
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:10,520
I don't understand what you guys were talking

1039
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,520
about from the beginning.

1040
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,160
He's a mentor to his milliard

1041
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:14,580
minions.

1042
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,460
We don't allow minions in this particular...

1043
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,560
This is the only religion that doesn't

1044
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,520
allow minions.

1045
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,420
We deprogram our own zombies

1046
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,460
and I swear I spend

1047
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,220
half my time debunking...

1048
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,480
my own religion.

1049
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,720
Well, you know it's true.

1050
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,320
I do know that that's true.

1051
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,000
Bob said he was a short-duration

1052
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,900
personal savior.

1053
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,180
Mm-hmm.

1054
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,540
Bob's a short word, too.

1055
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,060
He's not your crutch, you're his crutch.

1056
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,060
You're his short-duration personal crutch.

1057
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,400
That's all you are.

1058
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,080
Don't get a big head out of it.

1059
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:50,900
That explains the shoulder pain.

1060
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,600
That really explains the shoulder pain.

1061
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,000
You're Bob's ice pack.

1062
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,520
You're Bob's aspirin pill.

1063
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,440
You're Bob's little fanny throw mom.

1064
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,140
Let's face it, you're Bob's...

1065
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,640
You're Bob's diaper, basically,

1066
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,120
when it comes right down to it.

1067
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,420
That's what you are, friends.

1068
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,640
You're Bob's diaper.

1069
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,340
Yeah, you can depend on Bob.

1070
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,640
Oh, man.

1071
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,200
Bob depends on you.

1072
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,700
No, you're Bob's depends

1073
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,680
is what I'm trying to tell you.

1074
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,560
You know, and...

1075
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,100
You're always there in Connie's office.

1076
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,500
On Judgment Day, somebody's gonna come along

1077
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,780
and change his diapers.

1078
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,440
And then where are you gonna end up?

1079
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,720
Yeah, I'm gonna get...

1080
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,300
Depends on whether they're recyclable

1081
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,780
or the kind you just throw away.

1082
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,180
I'd be in a bowl.

1083
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,200
Then your afterlife will either be

1084
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,220
in a washing machine or the city dump.

1085
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,500
Are you wanting them to end up

1086
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,940
in a spin cycle with the rest of them?

1087
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,280
Depends on what kind of depends Bob's wearing.

1088
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,120
Yeah.

1089
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,720
And he's pretty old now.

1090
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,660
I'm sorry.

1091
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,160
Is this some bizarre version

1092
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,940
that smells like teen spirit?

1093
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,340
It most certainly is.

1094
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,100
Oh, I'm reminded right now

1095
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,260
of a very long time ago.

1096
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,580
There's a Moog album of...

1097
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,760
That's what it is.

1098
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:07,880
That's what it is.

1099
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,360
Exactly 45 seconds in my reckoning.

1100
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:10,860
Nailed it.

1101
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,980
The Moog version of

1102
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,480
Smells Like Teen Spirit.

1103
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,080
Yep.

1104
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,080
Ah.

1105
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,120
I remember Boyd.

1106
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:18,840
Bob Barbarigmy.

1107
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,680
Bob Barbarigmy-isms.

1108
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,480
Yeah.

1109
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,080
Exactly.

1110
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:24,160
Remember the spasmodic...

1111
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,780
45 seconds ago what?

1112
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,400
Wait, no.

1113
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:27,940
I caught up.

1114
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,460
I caught up.

1115
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:28,680
Sorry.

1116
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,880
Friends, you're listening to

1117
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,880
Hour of Sight number 1335

1118
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,480
from the Church of the Subgenius.

1119
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,600
For more information about the church,

1120
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,500
which you probably aren't interested in

1121
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,140
at this point,

1122
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:44,800
you can go to subgenius.com.

1123
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,340
Actually, you can see pictures of Pisces

1124
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,600
with her shirt off there.

1125
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,200
That's quite impressive.

1126
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,020
You can see Petal with her shirt on.

1127
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,060
Cavorting with Bob himself.

1128
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,720
Yeah, cavorting with Bob.

1129
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,760
And Phaeton.

1130
00:54:59,340 --> 00:54:59,980
Bacon?

1131
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:00,900
Phaeton.

1132
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:01,360
Phaeton.

1133
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:01,920
Phaeton.

1134
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,840
Some people say Satan,

1135
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,820
but he has kind of a lift in real life.

1136
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:10,760
Yes, Phaeton was in X-Day and Starwood.

1137
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,700
He kind of got assaulted by some kids, didn't he?

1138
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,020
That was last year, apparently.

1139
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,860
He increased his demon security this year

1140
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:20,680
to protect himself.

1141
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,800
Here on...

1142
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,280
What now?

1143
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,460
FM in Cleveland.

1144
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:27,920
FM.

1145
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,640
Because sometimes it's not in Cleveland.

1146
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,040
Sometimes they hear it in...

1147
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,460
Early 1934.

1148
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:33,140
Atlanta.

1149
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,920
They hear it in Pennsylvania.

1150
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,120
In Pennsylvania?

1151
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:37,460
In Pennsylvania?

1152
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:37,640
In Pennsylvania?

1153
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:37,740
In Pennsylvania, even?

1154
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:38,600
Yeah.

1155
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,540
Well, that's over the internet.

1156
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,480
Through the interwebs.

1157
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:41,760
Yeah.

1158
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,840
They get on the thingamajob on the interwebs

1159
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,360
in Pennsylvania.

1160
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:50,600
And they hook up to the CompuLink net.

1161
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,480
The AO...

1162
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,340
The reticulum, we call it, actually.

1163
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:56,800
The rep.

1164
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,100
Right.

1165
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:57,720
The rep.

1166
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,100
Right.

1167
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,840
And they type in,

1168
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,460
and then they listen to it on the interwebs

1169
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:02,800
in Pennsylvania.

1170
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:03,300
In Pennsylvania.

1171
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:03,840
In Pennsylvania.

1172
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:03,840


1173
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:03,840


1174
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:03,840


1175
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:03,840


1176
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:03,840


1177
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:03,840


1178
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,440
Now, we refer to Pittsburgh as Pennsylvania.

1179
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,800
You're not allowed to go to Pennsylvania?

1180
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,740
There's a lot of things I'm supposedly not allowed to do.

1181
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:13,900
Actually, I'm...

1182
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,940
Speaking of loud,

1183
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,020
we've been loud for too long,

1184
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,160
and it's time for Dr. Sinister's show.

1185
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,380
So I'm going to turn on the...

1186
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,420
Okay.

1187
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,540
The Devo.

1188
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,320
The new Devo album,

1189
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:27,860
but without...

1190
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,360
The voices.

1191
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:29,840
That...

1192
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,120
It's like the karaoke Devo that...

1193
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:32,660
Devoid.

1194
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:33,900
Well, that was...

1195
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,420
Abnorm Nihil scored for us somehow.

1196
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,380
Well, I'd like to...

1197
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,200
This is not it.

1198
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,340
What are you liking to do, Dave?

1199
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,960
I was going to whisper a fond howdy doody

1200
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,640
to Pudder Nostril and his lovely lady,

1201
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,360
and also to Pisces,

1202
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,920
who I haven't spoken to for the last 43,000 years.

1203
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:53,660
It's good to hear your voices as well.

1204
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,840
And also to anybody in the studio area,

1205
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,820
and also those people,

1206
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,460
on the street,

1207
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,000
and just to dominate the conversation.

1208
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:00,620
I'm sorry.

1209
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,760
No, you're not.

1210
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,400
You've said I'm sorry five times a show

1211
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,300
for 20 years now,

1212
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,360
and I don't think you were sorry

1213
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,020
a single one of those times.

1214
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:10,800
No, I couldn't.

1215
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,260
I do think he's sorry.

1216
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,460
I think it's like a hiccup.

1217
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,600
He says that as a sort of a burp.

1218
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,420
It is a form of a twitch,

1219
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,900
but it's a psychological twitch,

1220
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,240
as I have nothing to say further

1221
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,820
beyond the I'm sorry.

1222
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,880
But there is a humbleness in his sorry.

1223
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,260
I always just say, uh...

1224
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:27,900
Uh...

1225
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:27,900


1226
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:27,900


1227
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:27,900


1228
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:27,900


1229
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:27,900


1230
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:27,900


1231
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:27,900


1232
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:27,900


1233
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:27,900


1234
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:27,900


1235
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:27,900


1236
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:27,900


1237
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,780
I'm sorry.

1238
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:32,520
But it's so much more kind to be saying,

1239
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,960
I'm sorry, you know?

1240
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:34,880
I always have to...

1241
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,120
When I imitate Dave saying,

1242
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,920
I'm sorry, I have to punch my shoulders.

1243
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,100
And turn my butt...

1244
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:44,460
My rear up to the bull silver back.

1245
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,080
I'm sorry.

1246
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,400
Don't apologize, Dave.

1247
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,200
Don't apologize.

1248
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,940
Don't let them make you feel like you need to apologize.

1249
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:50,500
Don't apologize.

1250
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,100
It's a sign of weakness.

1251
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,840
A four-square clue or a hunch of a weakness.

1252
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,740
I'm sorry.

1253
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,420
I just...

1254
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,980
See, there he goes again.

1255
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,420
Don't apologize weakly

1256
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,600
about any weakness

1257
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,480
that you're apologizing for.

1258
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:07,880
I apologize for...

1259
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,880
And don't say you're sorry for saying you're sorry.

1260
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,860
A real man doesn't apologize, mister.

1261
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,160
Exactly.

1262
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,200
We all wear the same boots around here, babe.

1263
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,320
Okay, okay.

1264
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,040
Here's the Devo.

1265
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:20,780
