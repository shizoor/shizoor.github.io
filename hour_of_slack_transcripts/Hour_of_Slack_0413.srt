1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,300
Yes.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:16,380
To see your own brain, it is only necessary to follow several distinct and simple steps.

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,700
First, isolate yourself in a completely dark room.

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,500
It is difficult to shut out all light from your immediate environment.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:33,720
It may even cause feelings of oppression, suffocation, and impending, imminent, painful death.

6
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:41,820
Nonetheless, one must persist in blocking out every ray of light until the room is in absolute darkness.

7
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:50,880
And in this state, with the eyes wide open, one must accustom one's optic nerves to the complete absence of light.

8
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,420
And now, at this precious point,

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,480
a smile.

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,580
A small light source is added.

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,340
Its tiny beams light up the hitherto darkened room.

12
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:08,660
Follow with your eyes as you move the light source back and forth,

13
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,720
directly in front of your field of vision.

14
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,000
Focus your eyes, but do not strain them.

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,900
Watch only the light.

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,640
After a short time, you should begin seeing a fibrous mass in front of your eyes.

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:32,120
Almost like a curtain, or a three-dimensional image of the sort we call holograms.

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,140
Now the two rounded parts of the corpus callosum become visible.

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:50,540
The stretched out nerves of the medulla oblongata and spinal column extend behind and fade from view out of the circle of light.

20
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,120
These are the olfactory nerves.

21
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,620
These the auditory nerves.

22
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:54,620


23
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,760
The optic and these the oculomotor bundles, appearing like insectile legs.

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,020
Then the trochlear nerve and the trigeminal, which a great deal of pain passes through.

25
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,520
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you.

26
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,520
That was an exquisite pain.

27
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,580
But I have another for you even better.

28
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,240
Even better.

29
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,880
They say no pain is like that when the trigeminal nerve is appropriately stimulated.

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,380
But we have found greater pain.

31
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,520
Curiously enough, the brain itself has no nerves and cannot feel pain per se.

32
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,780
But what does that matter when it is a gathering structure for the entire nervous system of the organism?

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:48,280
In that sense, all pain, whatever happens to the extremities, is experienced in that little wet pulsing brain.

34
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,600
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

35
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,780
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

36
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,160
I now move the...

37
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:05,700
Proof that the brain is nothing more than an alien parasite that infests the human body shortly before birth.

38
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,360
No, it is not the brain. Rather, it is the pipe.

39
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,860
Fight the pipe! Fight the pipe! Fight the pipe! Fight the pipe!

40
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,680
Where's all the fanfare?

41
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,960
Where's all the hoopla?

42
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,500
What's about to happen?

43
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,420
Well, you already know what's going to happen, scabby.

44
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,840
Tell him.

45
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,620
And you breathe, reckless and violent, on a collision course with the establishment.

46
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,480
Headed for hell on chopped down hogs.

47
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,040
Hating each other, but hating the establishment more.

48
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,600
Welcome to the subgenius.

49
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,160
Radio Ministry.

50
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,600
Hour of Black.

51
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,020
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

52
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,220
Hallelujah!

53
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,080
Nobody listens, nobody gets hurt.

54
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,460
Black angels, a pack of snarling wolves in a fury of burning rubber and blood.

55
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,020
Crushing head on with brutal fury, soaking the streets with blood.

56
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,800
Don't push me, Chainer.

57
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,740
Why not?

58
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,480
You push me, you push us.

59
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,140
Push everybody.

60
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,260
Don't play games, huh?

61
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,680
A wild bunch of women, untamed and shameless, turning on for kings.

62
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,100
Yes, my true love possesses optimum lethality.

63
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,480
And the only person that could come slightly close to that is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

64
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,760
He possesses near optimum lethality.

65
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,080
He can kill with a look.

66
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,560
He can't kill with a lick.

67
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,840
Just a look.

68
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,320
Just a little shot from Bob's eyes.

69
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:00,660
Boing!

70
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,320
And you're gone, you know.

71
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,240
Joining the Church of the Subgenius is like getting a pair of free sunglasses that protects

72
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,680
you from those death rays of Bob Dobbs' eyeballs.

73
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:21,060
Yes, it protects you from, from, it gives you like an entire bodyguard protecting you

74
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,060
from the, from the, from the, from the, from the, from the, from the, from the, from the,

75
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,060
from the catapult of, of, of Dobbs.

76
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,520
You know?

77
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,860
Twenty dollars, you're set for life, man.

78
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,420
Even though life's not gonna, not gonna last too much longer, cause you know the world

79
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,160
is going to come to an end on July seventh, 1998.

80
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,080
Or, pardon me, July fifth, 1998 at seven AM.

81
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,320
I don't want to give you the wrong date because then you won't know whether you're gonna live

82
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,780
or die.

83
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,040
Because the exes are coming on July the 6th.

84
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,040


85
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,640
5th and you know what they're gonna do on July 5th?

86
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:10,780
See, the Hops, he sold the planet to the Exists, cause you see, he's the world's greatest salesman.

87
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,240
And he sold the planet to the Exists, but the Exists made a deal with Bob.

88
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:24,760
They said, okay, we'll buy this planet and we'll, you know, we'll do what we want with it and yeah, okay, we'll take care of your people.

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,960
We won't kill your people. His people being the subgenius.

90
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,240
Yeah, I think we each have to realize that we have a responsibility there and maybe be more bold than we've been.

91
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,380
Because our voices are heard if we, if there are enough of us talking.

92
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,000
And we just have to get together.

93
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,080
As a group of people who are against it because the ones that are for it sure do have a voice and are heard.

94
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,940
The world wears a mask to hide its startling differences.

95
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,300
Some natives in Africa enjoy life without clothes.

96
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,160
Only nudists in our part of the world enjoy life without clothes.

97
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,220
Once again, the only visitors WCSB can have, loud and clear.

98
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,440
And they're not the only ones.

99
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,320
I can proudly present Brain Rot Radio Theater and all its nakedness.

100
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,160
Hallelujah.

101
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,680
Watergate had so boldly and burlyly grew and assembled.

102
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,560
Their motive?

103
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,920
Who can tell what these fictional radio characters will think or do?

104
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,620
Even I can't tell what they're going to do.

105
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,740
And I'm writing this.

106
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,940
It was a local motive for sure.

107
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,540
A railway train of thoughts screeching, breaking the solitude of nighttime live radio.

108
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,340
Ha ha ha ha.

109
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,740
Join us.

110
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,020
As we join them.

111
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,280
As they join those who join them again.

112
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,300
And join hands that join in for a kickoff.

113
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,780
Stand on your hams.

114
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,020
If hams ain't there, stand on your land.

115
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,160
I don't care what you do.

116
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:56,860
And guess what?

117
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,480
No one else does either.

118
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,420
Ha ha ha ha.

119
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,880
The strange.

120
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,900
The hideous.

121
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,920
The amusing.

122
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,800
The shocking.

123
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,320
This tribe's ceremony of circumcision is barbaric.

124
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:13,880
And historically painful.

125
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,960
But terminates in the boy being cared for by a woman who teaches him the techniques of love.

126
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,120
So that's us.

127
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,280
The subgenius.

128
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,380
We're not going to die.

129
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,180
We're immortal.

130
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,600
Just like these guys here.

131
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,520
This is crash worship.

132
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,220
This song, if you want to call it that, was recorded live.

133
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,340
Obviously.

134
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,460
At a Samhain ceremony.

135
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,500
Samhain being the holiday that we just had.

136
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,680
Halloween.

137
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,260
Samhain being the holiday that Bleepo and I experienced a week late.

138
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,760
Yes.

139
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,340
Yes.

140
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,860
Samhain is when the veil between the living and the dead is the thinnest.

141
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,100
Normally it's supposed to happen on October 31st.

142
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,460
However, it happened on November 7th and 8th.

143
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,340
Yes.

144
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,820
Yes, the dead were raised and they came into our house.

145
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,400
And they touched us.

146
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:12,560
Yes.

147
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,300
We were dead.

148
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,960
We truly were dead.

149
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,720
The devil dog was dead.

150
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,200
We lost reality.

151
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,540
That's what happens on Samhain.

152
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,020
That's what happens.

153
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,780
Stuff like that.

154
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,200
You know.

155
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,980
Living, walking dead.

156
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,980
Goblins and monsters and evil powers and stuff like that.

157
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,640
What was Bob doing on Samhain?

158
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,020
Bob was probably watching TV or something and saw him.

159
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,640
Bob does stuff like that.

160
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,560
He doesn't believe in the living dead.

161
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,580
Because see, Bob wasn't there when we destroyed the universe.

162
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,280
Ivan Stang wasn't there when we destroyed the universe.

163
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,320
Not there physically, but he was there in our hearts.

164
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,000
We loved him and we missed him so.

165
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,840
We wish that he could have been there.

166
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,240
To share in this experience with us.

167
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:22,320
And I just, I would just like to conclude this little story with a thank you.

168
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:31,600
A thank you not only to JR Bob Dobbs, our savior, our high epopt of our church.

169
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,880
We'd also like to thank.

170
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,640
I'm sorry, Commander.

171
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,820
No member of my family.

172
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,100
My crew wants to be a hero.

173
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,840
And the normal leave is going to be fine without a promotion.

174
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,860
And tell that hunk of metal that MK31 is returning home.

175
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,040
Captain Hap.

176
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,780
But most of all.

177
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,840
Most of all.

178
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,040
Bleepo and I thank.

179
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,280
Thank you.

180
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,420
For bringing us to the edge of the world.

181
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,860
Bringing us.

182
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,820
Carvening.

183
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,720
Over the edge.

184
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,740
Down the cliff.

185
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,920
On the rocks.

186
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,280
Split.

187
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,520
Torn.

188
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,320
Bloodied.

189
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,520
Bruised.

190
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,720
Broken.

191
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,820
Atomized.

192
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,000
Thank you.

193
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,640
Wherever you are.

194
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,340
Thank you.

195
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:36,880
Hello.

196
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,040
Hello.

197
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,160
For without you we would not have raised the dead.

198
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,280
We would not have destroyed the universe and recreated it.

199
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,380
And it's so much better now, isn't it?

200
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,720
You must admit the world is a better place now than it was on Friday.

201
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,420
Yeah.

202
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
You have to admit that, don't you?

203
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:53,840
You're right.

204
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,080
I was right.

205
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:55,940
You're right.

206
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,940
Of course you have to admit it.

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,360
You know it's true.

208
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,080
Yes.

209
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,000
You're listening to this, aren't you?

210
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,560
Well.

211
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,160
The world definitely is a blessed place.

212
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,100
And this is a blessed radio show.

213
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,340
This is the Church of the Subgenius.

214
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:11,580
That's it, baby.

215
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,120
There will be a lot of husband and wife swapping.

216
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,400
There are a lot of great numbers of young people that are going to be living together without getting married.

217
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,840
And I think we see that already even in an area where we live.

218
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,300
We're kind of a minority being a married couple.

219
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,880
But again the thing he's talking about here is not just society at large but within the church.

220
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,220
Right.

221
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,760
These are sins within the church.

222
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:34,920
Here.

223
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,000
In this seaport dive, women can be bought for what you pay for a highball.

224
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,280
But that doesn't stop men from fighting over them.

225
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:49,600
And this woman believes that seaweed rubbed into her skin will make her irresistible.

226
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,560
Ah, yes.

227
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,000
Beauty.

228
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,460
The magnet that draws the attention of the opposite sex.

229
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,980
Desired by all people in all parts of the world.

230
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,420
They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

231
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,500
And all these women are making themselves more beautiful.

232
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,020
No matter how much it hurts or how bloody the process.

233
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,880
But peculiar ideas are not only women's.

234
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,540
This man is hunting the elixir of youth.

235
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,700
Eating freshly killed raw turtle, he believes, is the most potent of all aphrodisiacs.

236
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,280
This man believes that a mouse will cure this poor woman's nervous disorder.

237
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:32,980
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,280
But it's not easy to understand.

239
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,280


240
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,320
It's easy for you to say.

241
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,340
Now when you meet Bob Dobbs on the highway, will you really kill him?

242
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,100
Will you have it in your heart to walk up to that man, Bob?

243
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,400
That man who hates you so much.

244
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,040
That man you love.

245
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,800
Hate so much.

246
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,200
Walk up to Bob and just, and just end it all?

247
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,280
I didn't stop.

248
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,220
Would you really do it?

249
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:54,540
Yeah.

250
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,740
I had to stop and take him off off the side of the road and give him a ride wherever

251
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,360
he wanted to go.

252
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,020
I was compelled to do so.

253
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,140
I'm sorry.

254
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,980
I just.

255
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:01,980


256
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:01,980


257
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,400
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,400


259
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,400


260
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,400


261
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,320
All right, I'm sorry.

262
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,460
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:04,460


264
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,240
We're killing her.

265
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,400
We'll kill her.

266
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,140
I pushed the pedal down but my engine wouldn't run.

267
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,260
The gas wasn't going to it.

268
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,000
Man, you know, you know, that's why we were born with organic baseball bats.

269
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,040
For us to bash Bob over the back of his head with it.

270
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,120
You know that that's why women are weaker than men.

271
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,240
Hate.

272
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,800
I was too weak to kill him.

273
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,240
I understand.

274
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,240
I understand what you're going through.

275
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,140
What is this?

276
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,300
A granny social?

277
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,160
Let's kill these wimps.

278
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,480
Kill the wimps.

279
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,180
Looks like we don't need steak.

280
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,160
Man, I'm going to chop these wimps into bits and pieces.

281
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,300
They don't stop sticking to something.

282
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,780
They're fingernails into my head.

283
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,620
Wow.

284
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:06,840
Wow.

285
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,640
The earth has been making time to be smoked.

286
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,320
We have to make the earth smoke.

287
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,000
We have to make the earth smoke.

288
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,600
Friends, the word's sticking in my throat,

289
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,080
but we're in danger of losing the entire ministry.

290
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,560
Oh, yeah.

291
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,340
I don't care.

292
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,680
As long as I get more of these.

293
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,160
We can't have more.

294
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,160


295
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,800
We cannot run this ministry on love alone, children.

296
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,360
We wish we could,

297
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,860
but I'm afraid you're going to have to reach down in your pocketbooks.

298
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,180
Maybe if we just sold everything we own,

299
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,000
we could stay on the air another day.

300
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,960
Those naked girls are doing their wicky-wacky-wacky dance.

301
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,220
Wow.

302
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,380
Hubba Bubba show or anything like that.

303
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:42,620
Wow.

304
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,500
Take a look at them.

305
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,380
You don't have to tell me that three times.

306
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,440
Look at them.

307
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,460
You know, those are.

308
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,100
Look at them.

309
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,700
Look at them.

310
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,080
They say every gesture, every movement has a meaning of its own,

311
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,300
and you can believe that.

312
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,920
Watch it.

313
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,380
Wacked out, wacky knees.

314
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,060
My God, now they're.

315
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,500
My eyes have been glued to that one in the middle.

316
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,540
If I could only pull them off.

317
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,180
It's super glue or something.

318
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,160
Know the thrill of racing bulls

319
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,000
or the super thrill of the ultra-dangerous sidecar racing.

320
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,340
Perhaps the most macabre of all are these young lovers.

321
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,140
They find crowds and danger enhances their lovemaking.

322
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,800
I think they allいる!

323
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,740
Or asset level plus!

324
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,580
Come, me, you!

325
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:37,580


326
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:37,580


327
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:37,740
POWERFUL WHOO pores taste the sp 들어�gn Milli

328
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,500
Now they want more tea now they want the gold

329
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:41,500


330
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:41,500


331
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:41,500


332
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,220
With something trendy

333
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,220


334
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,220


335
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,220


336
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,220


337
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,220


338
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,220


339
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,220


340
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,220


341
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,220


342
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,940
Nicole

343
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,220
Be fine

344
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,400
Come on大

345
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:50,800
Oh, good, go

346
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
BO Так

347
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,640
Second high power

348
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,660
Did you get...

349
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,260
Get that locked, unlocked, unlocked.

350
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,460
The energy cleaner?

351
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,400
No, damn it all.

352
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,720
Where's my damn at all?

353
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,380
This lock just keeps thinking complicated.

354
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,920
Can't seem to do any good.

355
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,480
You got a bobby pin?

356
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,580
Tail pin?

357
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,760
Credit card?

358
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,180
Pneumatic drill?

359
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,040
Miniature nuclear device?

360
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,260
Oh, yeah, sure.

361
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,540
Always carry a mini-bag from...

362
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,700
Here is Shima Schwartz with me.

363
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,640
Hey!

364
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,860
Oh, here I am.

365
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,080
Have you guys just tried opening the door?

366
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,780
Opening the door?

367
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,060
Look, it says right here on the side

368
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,340
that this door is supposed to be locked

369
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,880
during station hours at all times,

370
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,420
and they know if they leave it unlocked,

371
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,120
someone like us could break in.

372
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,540
I'll be dipped in horse chip chocolate.

373
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,840
You was right, Scabby.

374
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,520
The door is open.

375
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,380
Yee-hoo!

376
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,500
All hail Zoom!

377
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,920
Try to keep noise level down to roar, cow pie.

378
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,420
We don't want no one to see us or hear us, remember?

379
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,160
We on radio.

380
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,340
We on mission.

381
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,280
On the mission from the lard.

382
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,420
Himself, itself.

383
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,700
The Gouda Buddha.

384
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,740
The big cheese.

385
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,940
The supreme being souffle.

386
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,260
Don't be silly, my fine-braided expatriate friend,

387
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,420
about talking too loud!

388
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,060
It's Wayne's Dead Show, man.

389
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,520
You know, Steve comes in,

390
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,440
puts on a hip commercial underground chat,

391
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,080
and he's got a bunch of canned stuff

392
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,820
he gets from an outlet in Boy's Grillsy,

393
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,080
Boy's Grillsy, Idaho,

394
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
and conks out in the Inception Room

395
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,600
after putting 12 hours in at the KKK Mart's giant linen sale.

396
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,600
Wayne's Dead ain't no bother.

397
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,560
Listen, I can hear him snoring.

398
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:37,820
.

399
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:37,820


400
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:41,660
.

401
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,320
.

402
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,520
.

403
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:42,540
.

404
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,020
.

405
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:52,180
. In answer to your first question,

406
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:52,520
. In answer to your first question,

407
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:52,520


408
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,440
can good Bob quit YOU a job?

409
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:54,780
.

410
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,880
.

411
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:55,880


412
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:55,880


413
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:55,880


414
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,100
.

415
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,520
.

416
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:57,540
.

417
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,300
.

418
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:58,360
.

419
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,420
.

420
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:58,460
.

421
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:58,460


422
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,040
I'll be gobs of gully-goshes.

423
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,100
You'd better puke your pee on full-throttle pumpkin cake.

424
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,060
Elsewise, your wants will be a wagon down on Mammy's Hind Manning.

425
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,600
Cause there's a case of slaves and slack robbers out to chop your slobber.

426
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,360
Pigs and dicks licking the cheeky-cheeky off your tongue.

427
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,220
Just when you're ripe and you throw them to load, slap back them and bomb at them.

428
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,360
They don't want your bones and be.

429
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,540
And if you got the cleft in step, Mommyo, they'll hate your work.

430
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,040
Hate's way worse.

431
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,680
So why can't you please her, pop a squeeze her when the gushers are going all normal and anti-right-line?

432
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,280
Crushing the jacuzzi sets in your sneezing chamber?

433
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,360
Tasting an empty platter in your beanbag, boy?

434
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,820
Where's your rollerballs at?

435
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,460
I can't drop me no glove roll on you.

436
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,140
You too.

437
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,680
You too, logo man.

438
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,140
They cut your check purse and water your creamery coming and going.

439
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,380
And the slums of Lovett won't be your abyss.

440
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,080
Cause the slacky-tats of the Greenwich Center be there in claw to flee.

441
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,800
They are dogs, isn't it?

442
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,380
But you are letting them bang down the barn doors.

443
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,360
And your cows are getting in and out.

444
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,460
You be gonna moon the man or follow him?

445
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,120
Moon to the slack.

446
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,700
Or a mouse like silly baby butterbug.

447
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,560
Or not.

448
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,140
You're gonna have to spreech English, Jake.

449
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,580
Get right with your muscle snake, snub monkey.

450
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,900
Quick spreech in your blizzera.

451
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,240
Lessen it snowing like lube juice.

452
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,880
Elsewise, you're clean bleeders blowing hot water.

453
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,420
You'll co-blind or please your neether trying not to.

454
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:57,260
Either way, you're getting up on the wrong side orbit for this kind of freed, peed-needed side trip.

455
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,180
Well, won't you don't you stand there like a Danny Nichols slug?

456
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,660
Or you gonna bust your flipperer in a righteous agony?

457
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,580
Boy, you got weeny ribbers in your fluter tubes.

458
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,960
Joint gumption with the true and the seed brave.

459
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,000
And peace for Bob, man.

460
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,900
It's sin you're jeans.

461
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,100
Buy out the gland owners with what you earn.

462
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,100
With your skinny, peeling face of pain.

463
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,240
Leave the man alone.

464
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,160
He's a piece of the fine ass.

465
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,920
Have a fuzzy, big bock.

466
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,320
And strike your heart-beth soft blow.

467
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,600
For the raccoys of the rocket racket.

468
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,620
This face-out belongs to your worship.

469
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,900
And the crotch of your choice toys.

470
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,400
Then I bet Bon and the flush lugger appears to let him sack.

471
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,900
You know who's a-comin'?

472
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,720
Them gins ain't mean to harm our nobody, no sir, ma'am.

473
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,500
You just workin' ugly good.

474
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,320
And they'll be gone by now, baby.

475
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,220
This has been your re-enunciator.

476
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,260
Thank me.

477
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,760
Thank you.

478
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,460
Uh, me.

479
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,680
Or something like that.

480
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,720
Uh, yes, dear friends.

481
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:17,060
That was, uh, that just there, right Dan, was indeed huge voodoo.

482
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,480
With yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang off of 10 Inches of Slack album.

483
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:30,680
And you are listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

484
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:35,680
In this case tonight, a show thrown together at the last minute.

485
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,220
But that's good, that's good.

486
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:42,620
That forces us to scavenge and parasitize the other shows.

487
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:51,800
So what you've been hearing, such as KPFA, uh, the subgenius show there with, uh, Dr. Howe puzzling evidence.

488
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,460
And Chainer hyperclinic.

489
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,000
And the other show, the show that completes in this particular case.

490
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:02,680
We also get lots and lots of clips from Brain Rot Radio Theater, WCSB in Cleveland.

491
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,860
Praise WCSB.

492
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Uh, that amazing, senseless waste of airtime that I love so much.

493
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,960
Uh, starring Scabby, Lonesome, and Psycho.

494
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,240
Toes, Wacky, Sal Wayne, Sam Haines, Lame Brain.

495
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,680
They get you talkin' all wink-lack.

496
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,700
I mean, torts.

497
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:35,600
Uh, also, a young sister, Goby, on her subgenius show from far, far up in Rochester, New York.

498
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,960
And all of that intercut in tonight's case,

499
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,940
With bits and pieces of media barrage, so-called tapes,

500
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,940
Put together by our friend, Nancy Regalia.

501
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,120
And uh, uh, you know that, that,

502
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:59,300
That huge voodoo piece that has my vocals on it, that has the secret in it.

503
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,420
The big secret is right there.

504
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,260
It's right in front of your ears if you can just decode it.

505
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,960
And I hope you can.

506
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,400
Because, friends, you know, as Sister Mary Squared, au contraire, says,

507
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:20,200
As the choke is to the chicken, so is the Venus to the flytrap.

508
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,060
And conjoined, they bring stressiveness.

509
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:32,200
And, friends, we've got a fellow minister out there who's been undergoing just that very stressiveness.

510
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:40,840
And I think if you all would join me in a quick prayer to send some slack to our good brother, Reverend V. Lee Lama,

511
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,960
all you Discordians and Eurasian Liberation Front people out there.

512
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,020
You know, whatever you do, throw down your picture of Bob and water it.

513
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:56,220
Or however you, you know, give unto the gods in return for, well, a bribe, basically.

514
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,720
It's a bribe is what we're doing.

515
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,780
A bribe to gods for the Reverend D. Lee Lama.

516
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:08,800
So that all the church may, yes, be benefited forever.

517
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,080
This is Doctors for Bob in the background.

518
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,980
And this coming up is a band you may have heard called The Pixies.

519
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,020
I'm gonna get my head around you

520
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,280
I come around catching thoughts of you

521
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,700
I get an electric touch from you

522
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,600
I take a hand and live it just for you

523
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,760
And the way I feel tonight

524
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,980
Like a dying wood in mine

525
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,140
And there's something going on inside

526
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,820
It makes you wanna feel

527
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,000
It makes you wanna feel

528
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,360
It makes you wanna try

529
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,060
It makes you wanna blow

530
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,480
The thoughts in the sky

531
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,340
And I can't stand up

532
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,860
I can't cool down

533
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,060
I can't get my head off the ground

534
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,740
I get my head around you

535
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,040
I come around catching sparks off you

536
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,280
And all I ever got from you

537
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,000
Was all I ever took from you

538
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,960
You won't take me home

539
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:30,960


540
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:30,960


541
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:30,960


542
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:30,960


543
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,980
And all I ever worth

544
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:32,980


545
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:32,980


546
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,640
But let it run

547
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Nasty as ink

548
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,100
It's just real

549
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,520
If you don't curve

550
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,280
We ces to confiscate

551
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,520
It won't send us a signal

552
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,520


553
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,520


554
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,520


555
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,520


556
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,520


557
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,520


558
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,520


559
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,520


560
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,520


561
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,520


562
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,520


563
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,520


564
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,520


565
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,520


566
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,520


567
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:44,820
and my death

568
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,800
It's all part of me

569
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,620
Just some wind

570
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,900
All my troubles can't be found

571
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,120
That's it, yeah, yeah, yeah

572
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,660
I'm taking my steps to a better part of town

573
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,980
Where all my troubles can't be found

574
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,440
I'm gonna make you walk through the walls

575
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,500
I'm gonna make you walk through the stars

576
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
All night sky

577
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,600
There's something that keeps me up at night

578
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,960
Happy birthday

579
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,160
Mr. President

580
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,800
Marilyn Monroe's belly button is a sort of compromise.

581
00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:02,320
Zoo Castle Films presents our insect world series 9 volume 27, The Fly.

582
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:11,680
Welcome boys, girls, men, women and teachers to the world of one of nature's most underrated wonders, the common fly.

583
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,400
Yes, the fly.

584
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,720
Both a bold and a shy creature.

585
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,220
He enjoys frolicking on the family's picnic in the park on Sundays.

586
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:25,360
Yet, he prefers to spend his frappage alone under a large leaf in his own pipe like in Trekking Tour, the proboscis.

587
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:34,860
The many faceted eyesight of the fly is so keen, he can detect movements before they even happen, making him a hit at parties and a big winner at the races.

588
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,120
But what about nectar?

589
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,940
Well, when the fly finds its time to mate or rut, he puts out his fillers, turns up his olfactory, and goes to the park.

590
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:49,940
He then goes to the factory and other sensory nerve inputs and scans the horizon for the picant, marshmallow smell of a female fly in heat.

591
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,720
Ah, lucky fellow, he's found one.

592
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,040
Yes, her mysterious dance seems to lift up his day and light up his night.

593
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,280
But it's all right.

594
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:06,680
As she comes to accept him, it's no secret that the fly's orgasmic pleasure is matched only by his built-in proportionate inability to remain in a fixed location for any length of time.

595
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,860
For no sooner has the mating couple filled each other's Gobi nodules with albumin and spoo,

596
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,920
than the fly, ever-touring, ever-seeking nectar, will be able to find its way to the fly.

597
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:20,980
The fly flies off to another destination, smiling all the while as the facets in his mirror-like covering reflect grace, land, and mansions of endless stars,

598
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,640
thus filling in the blank spaces of nature's lost address book.

599
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,240
Is it all in the name of love?

600
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,180
Or is this conscious pest but a note in the marvelous symphony of nature's universe?

601
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,800
Perhaps we'll never know.

602
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,500
But the next time you see a common fly, remember, there's more to this pesky fellow's life than rancid oatmeal and his attraction to that light bulb over your bed.

603
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,920
Yes, one of nature's most misunderstood anomalies, Mr. Fly, will open the door.

604
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,740
And you'll always be a part of Our Insect World.

605
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,860
Two-headed Elvis baby found in Martian spaceship!

606
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,120
Creature from future lands in Times Square with answer to world pollution.

607
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,520
Family dog performs emergency surgery on injured boy.

608
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,980
Looking for hidden messages?

609
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,380
Do you want the truth?

610
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,080
You don't know what you...

611
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,800
Well, if you do...

612
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,560
Just keep listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

613
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,980
And you could also...

614
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:26,280
You could, yes, write for free information if you're one of those who hasn't actually done that yet.

615
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,760
Just drop that self-addressed stamped envelope in the mail to Bob...

616
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,940
At...

617
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:38,560
Yes, post office box one four zero three zero six.

618
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,040
Dallas, Texas.

619
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,880
Seven five two one four.

620
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,440
And we'll be giving that number again and again and again.

621
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,220
In fact, I'll give it now.

622
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,560
It's post office box one four zero three zero six.

623
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,920
Dallas, Texas.

624
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,360
Seven five two one four.

625
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,320
We pause now to flip the tape.

626
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,800
Thanks there to Bleepo Abernathy for...

627
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,200
The Fly.

628
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,380
I've troubled some of you tonight.

629
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,880
You're troubled deep inside.

630
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,680
You ache.

631
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,420
You hurt.

632
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,740
Because you're just not sure.

633
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,880
I had a precious...

634
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,980
I had a precious Christian come to me the other day.

635
00:31:53,740 --> 00:32:02,100
He said, Reverend Ivan Stang, millions upon millions of Christians in this country don't really believe that there is a bomb.

636
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,880
They're agnostic.

637
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,860
They don't know.

638
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,480
They don't know.

639
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:06,860
But they know.

640
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,680
They don't know if there's God or before life.

641
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,760
They don't know if there's slack.

642
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:21,260
But in case there might be a bomb, they pay lip service to their failure.

643
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,000
You subgeniuses, wait your turn.

644
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,120
I ain't gotten to you yet.

645
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,620
You cannot absolve yourself of blame.

646
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,920
You cannot say, oh, I did it.

647
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,720
Because the company made me do it.

648
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,800
You must answer.

649
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,100
You must answer, sir, for your soul yourself.

650
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,420
So how do you know?

651
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,700
How do you know?

652
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,620
It's so important what you see.

653
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,560
Bob said, you must learn to see.

654
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,620
The stupid things are important.

655
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,280
Because there is a snake pit of false slack.

656
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,660
There are wolves in sheep's clothing ready to take your money.

657
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:13,200
there is false lack of condos, stereos, trans-fans, and yes, false sex. False sex, my friends.

658
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:21,580
So how do you know? How do you know? How do you know? Because it's so important because if you

659
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:33,180
miss it, if you miss it, if you miss it, you miss Bob. By their fruits shall you know them. God

660
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:41,920
Ecclesians 6.14. The same ones in the subgenius church teaching Sunday school classes, preaching

661
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:48,360
slack, or on that nine-to-five conspiracy double-breasted death culture breadline executive

662
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:58,100
suite, kissing asses and praying to the almighty dollar and spreading pinkness. And if that's all

663
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:02,420
there is to it, if that's all there is to it, then why bother?

664
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:09,340
Why bother? Oh, go on. Walk out that door. Walk out that door and have enough. If your so-called

665
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:16,160
subgenius religion does not change your life, does not clean you up, does not give you slack,

666
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:22,000
then it is not worth the words that spell that word called Bob. And if that's so, if that's so,

667
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:28,120
then the apostle Paul was a liar. Krishna was a liar. Buddha was a liar. Richard Nixon was a liar.

668
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:33,120
Charlie Manson was a liar. And God forbid, even James.

669
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:41,620
They are Bob Dobbs is a liar. But this book, this book says, let Bob be true and every man be

670
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:49,740
pea-shy. This book makes drunkards sober and prostitutes pure and harlots holy and rich men

671
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:55,620
poor. It'll still change men and women over men and women. And it is the only power on planet

672
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:59,200
earth that can set a house by free and break the chains of violence.

673
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:15,520
Millions, millions upon millions claim to love Bob. They are religiously active, but they do not.

674
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,400
They do not have slack.

675
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,280
Look at your job, your lifestyle, your religion, your country. If they ain't giving you slack,

676
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,760
that's bad fruit, mister. What are you trying to tell me, Ivan Stank? I'm telling you to get out

677
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,160
of it. I don't care if it pays you $50,000.

678
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,280
$50,000 a year gets you blowjobs and cocaine. I'm telling you to get out of it. Go for the door.

679
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:44,400
Get out of the thing. Repent. Quit your job. Slack off. Find a church that preaches the gospel

680
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:53,860
of our God and the gospel of his life. Find that church. Get in that church. Serve Bob and fornicate

681
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,060
like your very life depended on it.

682
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

683
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:02,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

684
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

685
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,160


686
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,160


687
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,160


688
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,160


689
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,160


690
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,160


691
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,160


692
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:12,420
I'm going to close this meeting with a prayer. Bob! Bob, I'm talking. Bob, I want you to come down.

693
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,000
Move the pain and misery. Cast out tumors, tuberculosis, cancers, arthritis. Now, today,

694
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:23,960
in the name of Lotan, in the name of Slack. Praise Bob. Good night. Good night.

695
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,920
Oh, yes, friends.

696
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:41,800
Friends, that was a live revival recording tape from an old, old subgenius revival back in the old days.

697
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:48,780
And those of you who are fellow Jimmy Swaggart aficionados, such as I myself most obviously am,

698
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:55,100
why, you'd have to just sit back and go, yeah, I remember when Swaggart was doing that rant.

699
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,380
And, you know, it's sad about our brother Robert Tilton.

700
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,360
Yeah.

701
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:07,740
You know, that guy started out as a nearly saved subgenius. He had everything except Bob.

702
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,420
He didn't have quite enough slack. He didn't have nearly enough money. Yeah, apparently he blew off

703
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:21,960
everything but the money. Although, who knows, you know, Tilton may have more slack than we'd

704
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,400
give him credit for, perhaps. So he certainly has a lot more than all those poor idiots that

705
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,340
sent him that money. And, you know, I'm glad he got that money while he was still able to get it.

706
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:42,520
Because, you know, as sleazy as that guy is, he's spending it a lot more wisely than did those who sent theirs to him.

707
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:54,920
And I honestly don't know what comes next on this show. I do have a letter here. This has been in the show box for a long time.

708
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:59,400
It's a letter from our listeners, Sally and Tom, out there, I believe in Fort Worth.

709
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,180
And this...

710
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:07,640
This letter, it has a little picture of Bob on the top of the letter. He's reading a newspaper and he's thinking the thought,

711
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:14,500
I want to eat your brains. They smell so rich and spicy. And the letter says,

712
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,680
Dear our...

713
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,740
Jakes.

714
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:23,780
The word Jakes is Elizabethan slang for privy.

715
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,420
In 1596, Sir John Harrington wrote Metamorphosis of Ajax,

716
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,340
a cloacal,

717
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,920
a cloacian,

718
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,920
a Cleocenian satire.

719
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,500
In it he gives plans for a flushable valve water closet.

720
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,780
And he writes verse.

721
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,400
Though he's responding to some weird traditional European religion.

722
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,300
He's so excremeditory.

723
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,720
And here is that verse, friends.

724
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,460
I don't know if that's the right music for this.

725
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,800
What shall we put? Oh, this will be good.

726
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,300
This will just be perfect.

727
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,540
It's just so in keeping. I'm sure of it.

728
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,820
A godly father sitting on a draught,

729
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,120
to do as need and nature has toft,

730
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,060
mumbled, as was his manner, certain prayers.

731
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,660
And unto him the devil straight repairs.

732
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,060
And boldly to revile him he begins,

733
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,540
alleging that such prayers were deadly sins

734
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,540
and that he showed he was devoid of grace

735
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,280
to serve God.

736
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,960
And he speaks to God from so unmeet a place.

737
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,620
The reverent man, though at first dismayed,

738
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,220
yet strong in faith, to Satan thus hath said,

739
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,200
Thou damned spirit, wicked, false, and lying,

740
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,760
despairing thine own good and ours envying,

741
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,020
each take his due, and me thou canst not hurt.

742
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,940
To God my prayer I meant.

743
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,080
To thee.

744
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,060
The dirt.

745
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,040
Pure prayer ascends to him that high doth sit.

746
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,560
Down falls the filth, for fiends of hell more fit.

747
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,700
And here's one of his short zippy ones.

748
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,600
To keep your houses sweet, cleanse privy vaults.

749
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,580
To keep your souls as sweet, mend privy faults.

750
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,840
And friends, Harrington built working toilets from his plans.

751
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,900
There's lots of great info.

752
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,020
And Lawrence writes,

753
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,340
Clean and decent.

754
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,740
A history of bathrooms.

755
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,420
But the Harrington quotes are the only religious stuff.

756
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,120
Well, thank you, Sally and Tom.

757
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,080
Actually, I have a book here, friends,

758
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,040
that I've been meaning to read to y'all from

759
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,120
called Sex in History.

760
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:54,060
And I could actually fill the next 20 hours of slack

761
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,740
with quite entertaining and interesting material

762
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,260
from this book by Ray Tavis.

763
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:00,560
This is Ray Tannehill.

764
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,680
This is a very, it's a great book.

765
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,160
Great in size, as they say.

766
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,060
And I will, since I don't know what is on the next tape,

767
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,300
I'm gonna go ahead and read this little bit from the beginning,

768
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:19,200
where the great Ray Tannehill is talking about reproduction theories.

769
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:26,080
It is not, it is not altogether easy to accept that homo sapiens,

770
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,900
after more than a hundred thousand years

771
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,360
of fully fledged existence,

772
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,580
may still have been unaware of the biological facts of life

773
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,300
when the Neolithic revolution began.

774
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,740
Even in the 20th century, however,

775
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,760
there have been tribal peoples whose ignorance remains profound.

776
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,020
The Bellonese of the Solomon Islands,

777
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,920
until they were enlightened by Christian missionaries

778
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,140
at the end of the 1930s,

779
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,120
thought that children were sent by their social fathers,

780
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,680
ancestral deities,

781
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,880
and that the only reason

782
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,000
for the function of sexual intercourse

783
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
was to provide pleasure.

784
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,500
Oh, imagine that.

785
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,620
In the 1960s, the Tully River Blacks of North Queensland

786
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,340
believed that a woman became pregnant

787
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,940
because she had been sitting over a fire

788
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,640
on which she had roasted a fish given to her

789
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,120
by the prospective father.

790
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,280
Another Australian tribe believed that women conceived

791
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,580
by eating human flesh.

792
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,720
The Trobriand Islanders,

793
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,720
though perfectly realistic about the function of colitis

794
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,660
between animals,

795
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,920
apparently drew no human parallels from it.

796
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,440
In Pawpaw, New Guinea,

797
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:43,360
the Hua tribe still think a man can become pregnant

798
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,560
by eating possum and may die in childbirth.

799
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,300
And a woman of one Australian Aboriginal tribe,

800
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,600
when the Western facts of life and fatherhood

801
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,580
were explained to her,

802
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,940
flatly denied it.

803
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,600
Him? Nothing!

804
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,700
She said,

805
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,420
scornfully,

806
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,280
even people who know of the biological role of the father

807
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,100
are sometimes shaky on detail.

808
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,200
In 20th century India,

809
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,760
one distinguished headman of the Sema tribe

810
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,800
told a European visitor that it was,

811
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,180
quote,

812
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,140
ridiculous to suppose that pregnancy would result

813
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,220
from colitis on one occasion only.

814
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,360
And friends,

815
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,740
Darwin himself might have said the same

816
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,440
because he never knew that fertilization

817
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,460
was accomplished by a single sperm.

818
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,620
But they didn't catch on to that until about 70 or 80 years ago.

819
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,860
And oh, yes, dear friends,

820
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,800
we'll hear more from this, uh,

821
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,540
Tannahill's Sex in History Book in future shows.

822
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,240
It is absolutely, uh, uh, you know,

823
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,880
why don't they teach this stuff in school

824
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,400
along with auto repair, that's what I want to know.

825
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,220
They think I'm crazy, but I know better.

826
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,200
It is not I who am crazy.

827
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,040
It is I who am mad.

828
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,000
Didn't you see the crowds?

829
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,020
You can't take it from me now.

830
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,520
I've had this ice cream bar since I was a child.

831
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,840
People always try to take it from me.

832
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,480
Why won't they leave me?

833
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,500
I've had this ice cream bar since I was a child.

834
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:35,340
I've had this ice cream bar since I was a child.

835
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,960
And so has Chuck.

836
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,940
Why this? What happened?

837
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,520
It was only a few short weeks ago, really.

838
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,260
Bob and Chuck were friends. Good friends.

839
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,360
They enjoyed a lot of good times together.

840
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,080
Nothing really unusual about Bob and Chuck.

841
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,300
Just a couple of guys in the midst of the normal process of becoming adults.

842
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,380
Certainly nothing to foreshadow the tragic event in which they were to find themselves,

843
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,500
unless it was another group of young people from school.

844
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,980
Frank and his group.

845
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,860
They, too, had an interest.

846
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,360
Lysergic acid diethylamide.

847
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,760
LSD. Acid. 25.

848
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,240
Take your pick.

849
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,920
It's equally dangerous under any name.

850
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,300
Silver spaceships think I'm unidentified.

851
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,640
Condonuts turning inside out with fractal size.

852
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,500
Also in between those spaces inside outside.

853
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,680
Strawberry wings of water flavor to the sky.

854
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,680
It's almost like you said to me before tonight.

855
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,340
Yay!

856
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,420
No, sir.

857
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,680
I'm not a mermaid without the pyramid in my eye.

858
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,800
Because no romance can become before you say.

859
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,920
If voodoo children are excused to kiss the sky.

860
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,760
Sky! Sky!

861
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,920
Are dolphins using alchemy to steal my mind?

862
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:39,960
Mind! Mind!

863
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,120
Sensations oscillating through DNA slime.

864
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,620
Are techie and crazy to mirror satellites?

865
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,200
Why was that dream I thought you saw inside my sky?

866
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,720
Sky! Sky! Sky! Sky!

867
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,500
And the Cleopatra from the moon.

868
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,320
I'm a Ouija board for it.

869
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,680
The government decipher like cockroaches.

870
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:00,380
Yee!

871
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,780
The reese that transits in full in the microwave.

872
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,200
Is why you cannot see a single word I say.

873
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,180
Hey! Hey!

874
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,980
Silver spaceships think I'm unidentified.

875
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,340
Eh, eh!

876
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,580
Condonuts turning inside out with fractal size.

877
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:17,780
Geh, geh, geh!

878
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,820
And also in between those spaces inside out.

879
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,400
Go, go, go, go, go!

880
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,880
Oh, here we go!

881
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:24,300
Go, go, go, go, go!

882
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:24,380
Go, go, go, go, go!

883
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,000
So

884
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,760
Like most acid facing

885
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,160
Session

886
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,560
They call him Pisaccio because him is psycho.

887
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:12,600
Pisaccio, Pisaccio, pronounce it like Bungos, Pistachio.

888
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:14,920
Pistachio.

889
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,340
Him not Pistachio, that is the nut.

890
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,500
Maybe Pistachio is.

891
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,180
Pistachio.

892
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:32,540
The nut is Pistachio, the hymn is Pistachio.

893
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,360
A hymn not to sing like a hare, but a hymn thus.

894
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,580
Pistachio, Pistachio, hymn red colored statue.

895
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,880
Such nut knock knock way, who is it to him is not sing touch for her.

896
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,200
Such a touch he'll be psycho.

897
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,480
Pistachio.

898
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,820
Oh so muchio muchachia for himio.

899
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,640
Pistachio no macho much, cha cha no mucho.

900
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:07,620
Pistachio, not cha cha cha cha, is the her with the hair of hey hey.

901
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:14,880
In the hair, not the her, is the heart of Pistachio.

902
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,480
The hymn not the nut.

903
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,860
Not to sing, not the hair, who have heart of hair, not heart of hair.

904
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,980
The hymn not to sing, not sing, stanching, stanching, stanching.

905
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:39,660
Pistachio.

906
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,120
He psycho Pistachio.

907
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,580
Ho ho ho ho ho.

908
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:47,500
Ho.

909
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:47,840
Ho.

910
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:48,080


911
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:48,820
Ho ho ho ho.

912
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,240
Ho ho ho ho.

913
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:59,220
And that's Henry Rollins with Huge Voodoo.

914
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,680
And this hideous chanting that will continue.

915
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:08,920
This song called Kermit the Frog on the Pyramids of Mars.

916
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,100
By, yes, Nicholas Gardner.

917
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,480
His very wings have lost their flavor to the sky.

918
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,560
It goes on like this, though.

919
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,440
It's all over what you said to me after tonight.

920
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:25,520
Ah, ah, three rounds without the pyramid in my eye, eye.

921
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,560
Ah, ah, enough.

922
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,480
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

923
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,380
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

924
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,020
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

925
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,540
Hey, because no one is standing with me for suicide.

926
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:40,780
I'm talking to you, and I'm excused to keep the sky.

927
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,940
I've been using that to steal my mind.

928
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,460
I have to get my fucking shoes on, son.

929
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,120
I, I, I.

930
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,940
Like most acid heads, Frank had a come unconsciously.

931
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:57,560
He felt less guilty about his weakness if he could get others to do as he did.

932
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,860
There's a much better way to fly than with toy planes.

933
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,580
He tried to be persuasive.

934
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,080
But there was something weird about the way he acted.

935
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,760
It was an old approach.

936
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,940
Taunts, dares, ridicule.

937
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,060
If you don't turn on, you don't belong.

938
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,180
You gotta turn on, tune in, and drop out.

939
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,400
Experience the mind-expanding powers of acid.

940
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,020
It's psychedelic, baby.

941
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,280
That's what it's all about.

942
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,920
Bob was not impressed.

943
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,420
He didn't know much about LSD, but what he had heard he didn't like.

944
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,040
Acid seemed like a whole lot more trouble than it was worth.

945
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:40,540
Sure, taunted Frank, exactly what the establishment wants you to believe.

946
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,280
And you just beat it up.

947
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,780
Bob wasn't convinced.

948
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,240
But Chuck was not quite so unaffected.

949
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,480
Although he tried to appear nonchalant, the adventure in it appealed to him.

950
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,240
What if it really does give you a greater insight to yourself?

951
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,160
At least we can try the stuff, Chuck argues.

952
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,620
What harm can that do?

953
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,100
Bob was adamant.

954
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,260
It would just be a matter of time before he could get to the bottom of it.

955
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:12,260


956
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,460
It was really a stupid thing to do.

957
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:22,440
And for the first time, the boys had a real disagreement and went their separate ways.

958
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:24,500
Sir?

959
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,020
Yeah, come on, Bob.

960
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,260
What's the matter, Bob, you chicken?

961
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:30,860
Huh?

962
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:35,680
Hey, look, Bob, all you gotta do is send your money.

963
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,840
Or at least a self-addressed stamped envelope.

964
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,380
Bob, come on, Bob.

965
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,100
What's wrong, Bob?

966
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:47,100
And that number to write to send Bob your advice is...

967
00:53:48,000 --> 00:54:00,360
Post Office Box 140306 in lovely Dallas, Texas 75214.

968
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:03,840
I know you can't get enough of that series of numbers.

969
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,860
It just grows on you, doesn't it?

970
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,980
It hurts, but yet you just can't shake it.

971
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,460
That's Bob.

972
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:16,780
At Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

973
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,420
And you know we give that number out for a reason.

974
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,360
And people send that self-addressed stamped envelope for...

975
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,640
Well, something perhaps reasonless.

976
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:33,200
But even there, even there, friends, you got some kind of a...

977
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,440
A madness behind the reason.

978
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,000
And you can believe that.

979
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,440
Watching these whacked out, wacky knees and...

980
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,720
My God, now they're...

981
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,040
My eyes have been glued to that one in the middle.

982
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,120
If I could only pull them off...

983
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,600
It's super glue or something.

984
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,640
Mama, by me death.

985
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,240
Not you, bozo.

986
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

987
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,460
I was talking to the lady there.

988
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:01,520
You're telling me my eyes have been nailed to that one on the end for the past 30 minutes.

989
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,940
Oh, your eyes are as big as your stomach's a heap.

990
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,640
You'll need a 30-pound claw hammer to get those incredibly painted out of there.

991
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,240
Unrestorated population hates your eyes.

992
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,900
In our country, these consider...

993
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:12,060
I'm no doctor, but I think you're gonna need a chainsaw to get your eyes back.

994
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,860
Hey, you don't need a chainsaw to tell which way the wind blows.

995
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,780
Hey, listen, I'm not in medicine.

996
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,620
Maybe I should be a staple instead.

997
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,720
You're gonna need something to...

998
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:27,960
You're telling me my eyes have been stapled to that one on the far right for the past five light years.

999
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:33,820
Hey, I'm no MD, but you're gonna need a staple puller to leave this dance floor.

1000
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,120
Yeah, you'll need to have that staple taken out of your navel.

1001
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:36,900
What do you think you are?

1002
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,340
Oh, you're a D. You're a DA.

1003
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:38,560
Playboy, play me.

1004
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,480
My lips use this argon.

1005
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,280
These days, everyone hears voices.

1006
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,100
Oh, God, he's lost it.

1007
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,860
Most of the punk rock's made on independent labels, right?

1008
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:55,980
Okay, now, if you take the album out and you look past the last song on a given side,

1009
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:01,780
in between the last song and the actual paper label on independent record companies,

1010
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,440
you've got to engineer a little stencil, a little message,

1011
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,800
from anything from Happy New Year to your brain is wasted.

1012
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:13,260
For some people, these voices don't even come from the outside.

1013
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:16,980
They come directly out of their knees or the metal plates in their heads.

1014
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:22,600
Five o'clock Sunday afternoon, and I'm stuck in a traffic jam that stretches 150 miles.

1015
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,300
Now, let's get in one more call.

1016
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,160
We talk, we read, we listen to Mozart sometimes.

1017
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:33,160
Right now, I am coming in through your ears, which filter what I am saying up into your brain.

1018
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:34,700
I heard you.

1019
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,800
I have been like this my whole life.

1020
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:37,700
I've heard you.

1021
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:38,740
I've been like this my whole life.

1022
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:42,080
I'm not going to talk to you now, I'm a whole flat.

1023
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,560
I admit that the men averse to funk and quarrelsome and foolish in the funk.

1024
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,760
Quarrelsome and foolish in the funk.

1025
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,880
No harm to your life.

1026
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,400
No harm to your life.

1027
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,060
You know what I hate?

1028
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:51,220
What?

1029
00:56:52,840 --> 00:57:00,360
I hate it when I'm playing with my fishing kit and I get the fishhooks caught in my urethra.

1030
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:01,600
That's it then.

1031
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,800
Try a mascara brush.

1032
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:02,800


1033
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,420
So I take a pipe and I shove it in there to make it bleed more.

1034
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,460
Then I twist it and I squirm it.

1035
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,280
Then I take the pipe and put it in my mouth and suck out the frog.

1036
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,180
They keep crawling.

1037
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,160
Slimy worms.

1038
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,560
And they crawl into my brain and I see a pipe in front of my face again.

1039
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,520
And I eat it.

1040
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,500
And then I turn into a worm.

1041
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,900
And then somebody shoves a fish hook in my urethra.

1042
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,020
I hate that too, man.

1043
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,440
Well, see? Something happens.

1044
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,020
All you gotta do is bring Bob and just drag Bob into it.

1045
00:57:53,060 --> 00:58:00,360
The problem is June is in third conjunction with the fourth dysfunction of Mercury's opposite on the other side of the moon.

1046
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:00,500
The third one.

1047
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,200
And we can't see.

1048
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,540
He's not supposed to know that.

1049
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:14,060
Oh, in effect, it's through the slack field Bob's pipe conjunctively blows outward and starts sucking in.

1050
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:19,620
You're all in Bob's pipe.

1051
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,260
Every damn one of you is sitting in Bob's pipe right this minute.

1052
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,360
Can't see the edges of the bowl right now.

1053
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:26,700
Can you?

1054
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,760
If you could just see.

1055
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,680
If you could see.

1056
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:35,700
You'd see the edges of the bowl of Bob's pipe surrounding you.

1057
