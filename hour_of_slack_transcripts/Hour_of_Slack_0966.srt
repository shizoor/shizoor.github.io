00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
The following is a paid advertisement for

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,000
Baaaaaawww

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,240
Brought to you by

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,640
Baaaaaawww

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:17,660
One person has released killer

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,500
sentenced to life without parole

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,560
on unsupervised weekend passes

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,840
and committed

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,200
the sentences of a record 53 murderers

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,340
The preceding was paid programming

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,760
which is not affiliated with

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,700
Baaaaaawww

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,080
Claims and opinions expressed are those of each

14
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,320
Baaaaaawww

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,640
who is solely responsible for the content of that

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,760
Baaaaaawww

17
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,820
The Subgenius

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,220
Power of

19
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,460
SWAT

20
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,100
One of the worst moments you may ever experience

21
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,280
Yes it is

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,940
Let's go sit down

23
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,680
Talk this over

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,960
New microphone

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,420
Dear friends

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:27,860
Praise

27
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,800
The light

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,320
Reference

29
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,540
Steve Checky

30
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,940
Who left them just where he knew we the subgeniuses would find them

31
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,240
In the trash

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,660
Yes dear friends

33
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,980
And it's been a long time since I've put together a brand new fresh show

34
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,700
We've had to do reruns a lot because we've been busy

35
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,120
I've been in hiding

36
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,680
Adding massively to our website at subgenius.com

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,120
And animating

38
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,320
And there's been a ton of great work done

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,500
And we've had to make a lot of new mixes

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,520
That have built up from the artistes and artistesses of alt.binaries.slack

41
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,020
Where so much of this comes from

42
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,000
And friends as I record this now

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,060
It's right before the election

44
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,700
And I've never seen anything so horrible really

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,480
In the face of all of this

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,520
With this show I'm just going to go for the pure slack

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,680
If you can't beat the conspiracy

48
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,580
You can at least make yourself stronger

49
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,300
And paradoxically in the end I'm going to be the one who wins this show

50
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,940
I'm going to get more slack

51
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,220
So whatever happens in this election

52
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,420
And whatever is happening in the future world

53
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,360
When you listen to this radio show

54
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,960
Keep in mind

55
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,640
This slackfulness

56
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,400
The spirit of this slackfulness

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,660
Shall still apply

58
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,660
It's a brand new day.

59
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,200
Common side effects are headache, nausea, and abdominal pain.

60
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Corn Pone.

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,520
Corn Pone.

62
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,320
Daddy, what's it going to be like in the year 2000?

63
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,120
Well, sweetheart, for your sake, I hope it'll be all peaches and cream.

64
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,960
But I'm afraid the end time is near.

65
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,600
The cataclysmic apocalypse referred to in the scriptures of every holy book known to mankind.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,820
It will be an era fraught with boundless greed and corruption,

67
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,520
where global monetary systems disintegrate,

68
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,500
leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of overcooked rice.

69
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,140
The nations of the civilized world will collapse

70
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,540
under the oppressive weight of parasitic political conspiracies

71
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,200
which remove all hope and optimism from their once faithful citizens.

72
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,440
Around the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins.

73
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,180
Unshielded by the ozone layer,

74
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,740
they have successfully depleted,

75
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,480
left to bake in the searing naked rays of light.

76
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,060
Wholesale assassinations serve to destabilize every remaining government,

77
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,700
leaving the starving and wicked to fend for themselves.

78
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,400
Bloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax-dodging corporations wreak havoc.

79
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,160
Pissed-off androids tired of being slaves to a godless and gutless system,

80
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,460
where the rich get richer and the poor get fucked over and out.

81
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,880
Unleash total worldwide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust.

82
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,720
Annihilating the terrified masses,

83
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,880
leaving in its torturous wake nothing but vicious,

84
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,600
cannibalistic, mutated, radiated,

85
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,660
and horribly disfigured hordes of satanic killers,

86
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,800
bent on revenge, but against whom there are so few left alive.

87
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,820
Starvation reigns supreme,

88
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,040
forcing unlucky survivors to eat anything and anyone in their path.

89
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,280
Massive earthquakes crack the planet's crust like a hollow eggshell,

90
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,920
causing unending volcanic eruptions.

91
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,760
The creatures of the seven seas,

92
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,580
unable to escape to certain death upon land,

93
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,360
boil in their liquid prison.

94
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,140
Disease encircles the Earth,

95
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,800
plagues and viruses with no known cause or cure,

96
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,140
laying waste to whatever draws breath.

97
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,740
And humankind, having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers,

98
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,800
fall victim to merciless attack at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes

99
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,000
who seek to conquer our charred remains.

100
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,860
This is Extinction Level Event,

101
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,420
the final world front,

102
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,060
and there is only one year left.

103
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,540
Wow, that's cool.

104
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,300
I can't hardly wait.

105
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,520
You don't have to, because here it is.

106
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,500
Because here it is.

107
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,520
Because here it is.

108
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,420
Because here it is.

109
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,000
Yo! Calling all live niggas!

110
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,120
Calling all live bitches!

111
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,680
We have a job for y'all on planet Earth!

112
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,040
Flip mode world domination in progress!

113
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,380
Motherfuckers!

114
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,600
Hi!

115
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:54,860
Hey!

116
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,160
You see me?

117
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,340
Looking for excitement,

118
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,340
adventure,

119
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,560
business opportunities,

120
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,860
and a real nice place to raise the kids?

121
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, explore no more.

122
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,820
We're there already.

123
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,460
Let's visit the world of the future!

124
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,960
World of the future.

125
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,160
Yes, this bustling world of the future.

126
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,560
World of a thousand moods reflects the dreams of its ambitious inhabitants,

127
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,820
dreams already realized of man's triumph over nature.

128
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,380
Where humans no longer suffer self-inflicted pains.

129
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,400
Where one is made to enjoy life.

130
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,440
Friends.

131
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:50,020
Friends, this is, it has been a fuck of a world lately.

132
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,920
Don't you agree?

133
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,260
The Constitution is in the shredder,

134
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,020
and Janet's titty is on the news.

135
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,880
The Catholic Church is raping little boys,

136
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,560
and what are the pinks worried about?

137
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,360
One stupid little titty.

138
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,440
Of course, that was a couple of months ago.

139
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,140
It'll be a new titty this time.

140
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,940
But what kind of bargain bin ladens are we faced with

141
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:22,480
as we smell the rank of stale pee on the Bush of Freedom?

142
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,280
My friends!

143
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:23,560
Yeah!

144
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,180
Those skull and bones guys have everything now!

145
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,700
They've got all the good drugs!

146
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,020
The adrenochrome!

147
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
And the saddest thing,

148
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,780
we used to laugh at the John Birchers.

149
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,800
Oh, ha ha ha.

150
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,340
Those funny right-wing conspiracy nuts.

151
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,740
Oh ho ho.

152
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,880
They thought the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations

153
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,960
were gonna take over the world.

154
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,960
Well, goddammit, if those kooks weren't right,

155
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,540
the right-wingers that took over the world are the commies!

156
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,820
That they were so worried about!

157
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,180
Hide the conspiracy right out in plain view.

158
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:01,820
Goddamn.

159
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,300
Friends, there is a mark of the beast.

160
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,000
There is a mark of the beast.

161
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,520
You make fun of 0666.

162
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,200
That's a big heavy metal rock and roll thing.

163
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,660
As a matter of fact,

164
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,780
the mark of the beast that shall be on the hand and on the forehead

165
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,820
is there already.

166
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,680
The mark of the beast on your hand is your fucking thumbprint,

167
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,420
and the mark of the beast that's on your head

168
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,920
is your goddamn ugly face!

169
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,500
Your face is the mark of the beast!

170
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,960
But, you know, without it, you can't get a job.

171
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,180
Jobs and this war

172
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,860
are both what we call contradictions.

173
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,900
Not contradictions, but contradictions.

174
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,780
Traditions of the conspiracy.

175
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,840
And what do us poor individuals,

176
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,580
I mean, we're not even a group.

177
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,360
We mostly can't stand each other

178
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,380
except for a few minutes at a D-Vival.

179
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,940
So how the hell are we gonna defeat

180
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,820
the conspiracy of all the normal people in the world?

181
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,980
Well, we've got one thing that they don't, and that's Bob!

182
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,440
We've got Bob, we've got our slack,

183
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,100
we've got our mutant abnormality!

184
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,080
Goddamn it, and sooner or later,

185
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,880
we're gonna have those aliens on our side.

186
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,760
Now...

187
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,580
I have to, now I have to get serious

188
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,560
and share something.

189
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,280
Something with you.

190
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,800
I'm gonna get you a drink.

191
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,340
I'm gonna get you a drink.

192
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,080
I'm gonna get you a drink.

193
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,340
I'm gonna get you a drink.

194
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,700
Ha ha ha ha!

195
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,260
Mommy is a Christian, Daddy is a Christian,

196
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,240
Reagan is a Christian too!

197
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,320
And they don't like to make a Christian out of you!

198
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,280
Learn to consume and meet a nice girl

199
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,500
and follow her fucked up rules!

200
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,540
Make you a slave with what they call schools!

201
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,320
Visit a church on Sunday,

202
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,860
back up a job on Monday,

203
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,540
sacrifice the prime of your life

204
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,700
for mother's religion and grief!

205
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,820
After we load you up a thrall

206
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,160
and your able to aim you,

207
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,000
nothing will ever seem like you're taking it off the ass!

208
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,480
Brings you to your grave!

209
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,700
And you'll get what you deserve!

210
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,740
For God so loved you,

211
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,400
he gave you horrible skin problems!

212
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,520
For God so loved you,

213
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,580
he gave your daughter multiple birth defects!

214
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,880
For God so loved you,

215
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,980
he gave your mother terminal lung cancer!

216
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
For God so loved you,

217
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,480
he gave your mother terminal lung cancer!

218
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,980
God so loved you, he severed both of your legs in a car accident!

219
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,760
The Rudy Schwartz Project, dear friends!

220
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,600
What an amazing song!

221
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,680
Actually, at the end of that was a little bit of Riff-I-Shankar noise.

222
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,520
Rudy Schwartz Project, friends, remember that.

223
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,540
We've had a lot of the cut-ups in this show.

224
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,920
Collages by the great Mr. Fernando Nani-Lemur,

225
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,700
hosting under the name of Alvin Greenspan.

226
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,800
Earlier we heard...

227
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,340
the intro to the Busta Rhymes album

228
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,300
Extinction Level Event.

229
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,940
With that great end-of-the-world stuff.

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,020
And then the new World of the Future stuff

231
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,140
was the old, old underground movie that I did so, so long ago.

232
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,800
That's been recut, by the way.

233
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,120
There's kind of a director's cut out now.

234
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,180
And we heard some preaching from the Beachland Ballroom subgenius,

235
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,300
the Bible here in Cleveland.

236
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,700
We heard the Rudy Schwartz Project.

237
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,200
Do that song.

238
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,280
Nice lawn.

239
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,120
And now, friends,

240
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,860
more Lemur Mucho.

241
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,160
And even some music by yours truly.

242
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,860
This is the city.

243
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,460
Los Angeles, California.

244
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,300
I work here.

245
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:12,900
I'm a killer.

246
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,240
My objective, robbery and murder.

247
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,960
My most vivid recollection of Bob was on the ground outside.

248
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,980
I said,

249
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,780
Excuse me, Bob.

250
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,860
He said,

251
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,620
I'm gonna let you die.

252
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,660
I've always thought that Bob was a lonely outcast

253
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,020
with that smile.

254
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,860
I love Bob's death.

255
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,180
Why do you even have to say a word about it at home?

256
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,240
I understand.

257
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,480
I understand.

258
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:49,900
Hello.

259
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,780
Up next, this week's Silent Bob,

260
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,580
who became a TV star in a series called Whirlybobbz and starred in another film,

261
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,040
The Big Bob with Kirk Douglas.

262
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,000
Then signed a contract with Bob and went on to a game show,

263
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,380
You Bet Your Bob's.

264
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,640
Here's Bob.

265
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,840
Help.

266
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,640
What's your game, Bob?

267
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,180
Bob's

268
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,480
Bob's

269
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,800
Bob's

270
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,820
Bob's

271
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,020
Bob's

272
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,280
Bob's

273
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,520
Bob's

274
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,360
Bob's

275
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,800
Bob's

276
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,880
Bob's

277
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,620
Bob's

278
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:39,620


279
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:39,620


280
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,900
Bob's

281
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,620
Bob's

282
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,900
Bob's

283
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,460
Bob's

284
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,380
Bob's

285
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:17,540
Bob's

286
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,000
Bob's

287
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,640
Bob's

288
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:18,740
Bob's

289
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,960
Bob's

290
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,500
Bob's

291
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:25,920
Bob's

292
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,960
Bob's

293
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,940
Bob's

294
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,600
Budby

295
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,580
Rubik'swszy

296
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,240
3-stop, 3-stop, 3-stop, 3-stop.

297
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,020
Stop.

298
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:03,960
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

299
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,800
Bob, Bob.

300
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,900
Bob, Bob, hand touch.

301
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,120
I know where he got you.

302
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,200
Why would you do that to me, Bob?

303
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,740
Oh, because he loves you, dear.

304
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,560
That piece was called Dubzana Scotzi.

305
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,700
Voyager, flyover, voice, one mix.

306
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:42,460
And I made that myself using some Mac hardware, software, and some Lemur hard clips.

307
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,780
For an animation project that I've been shooting in Dobbstown.

308
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,180
Yes, friends, we're traveling.

309
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,740
Not only to Dobbstown, but actually in November.

310
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,780
The European third or fourth, I don't know which, anal frock.

311
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:04,160
Tour is happening with shows in November in London, England, Hamburg, Germany, Amsterdam.

312
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,580
I know that none of our listeners are hearing this there then.

313
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,460
But anyway, check out www.subgenius.com.

314
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,660
And then London again.

315
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,600
But how?

316
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,480
How can this be?

317
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,360
And now, now we will hear and see Lemur Greenspan.

318
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,440
It's enough to make you completely mad.

319
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,280
I've got to get a hold of myself.

320
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,380
I must lose my head.

321
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,240
There's one thing certainly I ain't hear.

322
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,040
I got it.

323
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,440
The tiger.

324
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,500
Yeah, yeah, that's it, the tiger.

325
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,140
I dragged him off to his lair, that's what.

326
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,440
Maybe not.

327
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,580
Pretty soon, not even the bones will be left to tell the story.

328
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,200
I know nothing of such matters.

329
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,180
I live alone in the ice and forests of Weir.

330
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,300
Such is the life of a catchman.

331
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,400
I mean, if there's anything you need or that I can do, please tell me.

332
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,740
Well, you could let me make love to you.

333
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,700
Make love, did you say?

334
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,100
Yes.

335
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,900
What do you mean?

336
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,980
You don't even know my psychocardiogram.

337
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,720
Eh?

338
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,780
Well, on earth, for centuries people haven't made love unless their psychocardiogram readings were in perfect confluence.

339
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,740
I know nothing of that.

340
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,340
You ask me what you can do for me, and I told you.

341
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,000
Well, alright.

342
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,140
But I don't see what good it will do.

343
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,080
Do you have any pills?

344
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:40,780
Pills?

345
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,380
Oh, never mind, I have some here.

346
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,840
Well, what is this pill?

347
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,740
It's an exaltation transference pellet, of course.

348
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:51,640
Hm.

349
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,640


350
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,940
I know nothing of this.

351
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,600
I see.

352
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,640
Well, on earth, when our psychocardiogram readings are in harmony and we wish to make love, as you call it,

353
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,500
we take an exaltation transference pellet and remain like this.

354
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,300
Here, let me show you.

355
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,540
For one minute or until full rapport is achieved.

356
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,460
Ah, I don't care for that.

357
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,100
This.

358
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,260
This is what I mean.

359
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:22,820
This.

360
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,720
A bed.

361
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,660
That?

362
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,720
But nobody's done that for centuries.

363
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,200
I mean, nobody except the very poor who can't afford the pills and the psychocardiogram readings.

364
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:34,940
Why not?

365
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,500
Because it was proved to be distracting and a danger to maximum efficiency.

366
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,800
And because it was pointless to continue it when other substitutes for ego support and self-esteem were made available.

367
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,880
So, you won't do it?

368
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,080
Would you say that you're not going to do it?

369
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,080

I simply must insist, I guess so.

379
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,920
But I can assure you there's really no point at all in doing it like this.

00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:46,900
All slack and fun aside though, seriously, how are we going to save the planet and save the universe this time?

564
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:56,460
I hear a lot of ideas about saving the planet, but it's usually from people who can't even change a tire or take out their own trash.

565
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:07,500
Have you ever, anybody here ever been lectured for an hour on how to run your own business by somebody who's never even held down a job for more than three days?

566
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:15,400
Yeah, those are the ones that are the real experts. They'll let you know, man, look, let me do that. I'm an expert in whatchamacallit.

567
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,220
And experts in consciousness, friends. We see so many experts in consciousness.

568
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,280
I was happy to see Steve Gaskin, who actually...

569
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:34,860
Among all the hot air balloons such as myself who speak on this stage, that guy actually has done stuff.

570
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,920
He really did get off his butt. He did...

571
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:43,640
There's an alternative to fleeing America or killing the president, which is running for office.

572
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,240
That's the one that none of us are willing...

573
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,140
We might do the other two, but we're not going to do that.

574
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,460
You know, whoa.

575
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,700
Well, Gaskin did, but I noticed he gets the same question that I get a lot.

576
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:03,660
Hey, Mr. Old Man, I want to defeat the conspiracy and save the world. What should I do? My parents are such assholes.

577
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,580
Well, if you really want to change the world, then mow your yard,

578
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,680
cultivate your garden, then start telling everybody else how to run their lives.

579
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:22,520
You know, seriously, it's like you cannot change the conspiracy of the normals, but you can change yourself.

580
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,680
And you don't have to be dependent.

581
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:31,700
You know, if your parents are assholes, pardon the expression, but get a job, kid.

582
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,360
Quit complaining and do something.

583
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:35,980
I...

584
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,980
Yeah.

585
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,240
Yeah.

586
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,240


587
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:25,700


588
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:38,540
Esse on director or film director.

589
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,640
You learn absolutely nothing or you don't feel like you're as important as you were as you were in the middle of everything.

590
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,740
Let yourself go before you

591
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:41,740


592
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:41,860
You know what?

593
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,060


594
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,920
It's proof of what he told you.

595
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,180
You know what?

596
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,180


597
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,180


598
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,180


599
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,360
...wal Returning Shell.

600
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,240
into his eyes.

601
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,920
It puts a spring into his

602
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,840
stomach. It has given

603
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,580
him a rise.

604
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,960
There's a thing about Bob.

605
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,240
There's a thing

606
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,280
about Bob.

607
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,880
There's a thing about

608
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,800
Bob. Looks like Bob is

609
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,660
really on the way. There's a thing

610
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,560
about Bob.

611
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,840
There's a thing about Bob.

612
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,000
Bob is living

613
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,380
hard.

614
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,680
He can do it.

615
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,680
Bob is living hard.

616
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,280
It's your sleep.

617
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,040
Bob is living hard.

618
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,580
Bob is living hard.

619
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,880
Bob appears to have

620
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,040
been too much sex.

621
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,880
Bob is living hard.

622
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,620
I brought Bob

623
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,260
instead of him.

624
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,900
Bob is living

625
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,160
hard.

626
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,560
Bob is living hard.

627
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,720
Bob is living hard.

628
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:07,720


629
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,120
cool.

630
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,380
Bob is living large.

631
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:11,860
Bob is looking

632
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:11,860


633
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:11,860


634
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,260
Wow, you have

635
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:12,960
got clean fresh

636
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,140
hair on more into the

637
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:14,360
bed.

638
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,720
Bob is living large.

639
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,600
which makes every

640
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
barber around him being

641
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,420
quite pleasant.

642
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,240
Bob is living large.

643
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:23,920
Abracadabra

644
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:23,920


645
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,600
Introducing the new long-lasting sense of Bob.

646
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,400
This is the Bob Bob.

647
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,520
Jesus, Bob, what did you push?

648
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,160
It takes more than intellect to be a musician.

649
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,000
Put your soul into it a little.

650
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,140
Okay?

651
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,160
Oh, yeah.

652
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:23,980
Yeah.

653
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,260
Yeah.

654
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:24,520
It's fun.

655
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,840
If slack is something you get for nothing,

656
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,320
then what's my 30 bucks worth?

657
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,860
The 30 bucks is for the bragging rights to the slack.

658
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,560
That's really all it is.

659
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,400
And you get an 8x10 picture of Bob

660
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,180
and a little card for your wallet,

661
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,800
which you can try to get in places cheap.

662
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,940
You do get a real ministership in the Universal Life Church,

663
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,180
but I can give you that for free right now.

664
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,100
You're all ministers in the Universal Life Church there.

665
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,800
I can tell you that.

666
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
Whether you want to be,

667
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:54,800
whether you're not.

668
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
Oh, yes?

669
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,660
Yeah, now that the conspiracy is more subtle,

670
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,480
vile, and pernicious than ever,

671
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,480
what do we do about it?

672
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,980
Now that the conspiracy is more subtle,

673
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,540
vile, and pernicious than ever,

674
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,340
we become more vile and subtle and pernicious than ever.

675
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,400
Or go the other way and do like most of us do,

676
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,740
is just kind of live between the walls,

677
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,220
in the cracks,

678
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,220
trying not to draw too much attention.

679
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,080
And yet, as Frank Zappa said,

680
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:24,700
he's just trying to get us to the bottom of this.

681
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,900
You're not going to pass another little bit

682
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,520
to the next poor sucker down the line, you know.

683
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,540
You go, you've got to take care of yourself first.

684
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,860
And if you have any leftover,

685
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,480
then if you've got lots of slack,

686
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,400
it automatically shares itself.

687
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,460
But you cannot give somebody else slack

688
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,240
if you don't have slack yourself.

689
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,060
And since nobody else can tell you what slack is,

690
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,520
God damn it, you're on your own again.

691
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,820
Isn't that a shame?

692
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,260
You actually do have free will.

693
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,380
Damn, Bob cut you loose,

694
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,960
and he's in fact trying to scare you away

695
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,800
from joining his religion.

696
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,760
No wonder we're doing so crappy financially.

697
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,120
Damn.

698
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,140
You know, I've often, and this is honestly true,

699
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,980
I've looked at the Scientologists and thought,

700
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,340
if only one of us could keep a straight face.

701
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:22,980
But,

702
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,300
obviously,

703
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,880
yeah.

704
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,200
Oh.

705
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,000
When dealing with very basic questions

706
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,280
and putting them into William's machine

707
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,220
or thinking just in that same way

708
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:45,220
about how to take things right down to their very nub

709
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,040
where you couldn't change anything more

710
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,840
without destroying the question itself,

711
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,080
when one asks, what are we here for?

712
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,360
One realized that all of the religions of the world

713
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,320
had said that we were here to love God and obey Him

714
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,400
and kiss His ass and suck His gear

715
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,000
and turn over and get killed by Him

716
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,020
and be dumbed down into hell and eternal punishment

717
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,160
if we didn't do like He wanted to do.

718
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,680
And this turned out not to be true at all.

719
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,860
It turned out to be like a nose and diarrhea of bullsh-

720
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,060
because, obviously, what we are here for is

721
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,420
that we're here to go.

722
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,200
There's another future for us, we're not here to stay.

723
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,640
recordings decided on 4th June in εδώ

724
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:35,640


725
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,040
Byim

726
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,040
Checkt periods

727
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,040


728
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,000
て

729
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,040
If you smell the smoke, you don't need to be told

730
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,840
What you've got to do

731
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,940
Yet there's a certain breeze, so merry in between

732
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,840
They'd rather take a vote

733
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,060
Running short on time, still they can't decide

734
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,840
For we already know

735
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,820
That we are here to go

736
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,640
We are here to go

737
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,400
We are here to go

738
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,120
We are here to go

739
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,020
We are here to go

740
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,820
Go

741
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,540
Go

742
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,720
Go

743
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,580
What is really fine?

744
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,440
Who's at the top of the pile?

745
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,220
Where does he draw the line?

746
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,760
Let them figure it out

747
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,260
Go on and step across

748
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,080
Just remind yourself

749
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,200
That we are here to go

750
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,960
We are

751
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,880
We are

752
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,480
We are

753
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,380
We are

754
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,300
We are

755
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,160
We are

756
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,000
We are

757
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,460
We are

758
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,940
We are

759
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,080
We are

760
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,180
We are

761
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,180


762
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,440
We are

763
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:13,440


764
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:13,480
We are

765
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:13,480


766
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,080
When it draws too long

767
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,800
The tail wags the dog

768
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,800
The handed fights get fed

769
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,820
Trouble's not to fly, the crowd begins to cry

770
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,780
For some common sense

771
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,960
Let them all begin

772
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,960
When the odds are no win

773
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,780
And call the nearest turn

774
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,620
Cause we are here to go

775
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,480
We are here to go

776
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,200
We are here to go

777
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,940
We are here to go

778
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,820
We are here to win

779
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,500
Go

780
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,260
Go

781
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,400
Go

782
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:46,940
Go

783
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,460
What is really mine?

784
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,240
Who's at the top of the pile?

785
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,080
Where does he draw the line?

786
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,580
Let them figure it out

787
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,120
Go on and step across

788
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,400
Just remind yourself

789
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,960
That we are here to go

790
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,700
We are here to go

791
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,420
We are here to go

792
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,540
We are here to go

793
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,140
We are here to go

794
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,640
We are here to go

795
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,360
We are here to go

796
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,260
We are here to go

797
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,500
We are here to go

798
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,760
We are here to go

799
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,620
We are here to go

800
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:31,900
We are here to go

801
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,680
We are here to go

802
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,880
We are here to go

803
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,760
We are here to go

804
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,160
We are here to go

805
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,160


806
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,160


807
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,160


808
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,400
Here to Go, by Devo

809
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,340
The Devos

810
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,220
With Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh

811
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,360
Reverend Bob Casale

812
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,340
And our old friend

813
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,820
and Jerry Casale.

814
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,020
And before that, some cut-up Byron Ginson,

815
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,240
or Jinson, I don't know how to pronounce his name,

816
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,820
but Lymph Node Institute.

817
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,040
And before that, a question and answer

818
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,020
from the last Starwood Festival.

819
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,260
Fernand and Andy Lemur did some cut-ups.

820
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,300
The song, Something About Bob,

821
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,040
taken from those Evil Insight commercials,

822
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,160
was by Reverend Ed Fred.

823
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,660
There was some preaching from Starwood

824
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,040
and some Reverend Carter LeBlanc

825
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,700
preaching at 7X Day.

826
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:25,160
We heard the King of Slack doing that song,

827
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,360
Community Standards.

828
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,540
You can get everything by the King of Slack

829
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,640
at kingofslack.com or philtemiller.com.

830
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,640
And now, now some more Greenspan,

831
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,560
for such is the life of a catchman.

832
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,200
On Tuesday, June 15th,

833
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,140
Alan Greenspan,

834
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,260
would be complete.

835
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,900
At which point, Greenspan stated

836
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,580
that the United States and world's financial market

837
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,100
should be grateful for his years of work.

838
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,420
For College Media News in Washington, D.C.,

839
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,920
I'm in Washington, D.C.

840
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,160
That's Alan Greenspan.

841
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,680
Telephone!

842
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,440
It's Mr. Nibling from Igloo.

843
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,160
Thanks.

844
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:11,540
Bye.

845
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,520
Well, uh, uh, well, uh, uh,

846
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,240
keep your mitts off my money, huh?

847
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:17,880
Okay.

848
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,560
You might put poison in my food.

849
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,160
Ask your doctor about liver problems.

850
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,220
The saintly Alan Greenspan.

851
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,600
Alan Greenspan.

852
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,620
Right now, you must need

853
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,040
Alan Greenspan.

854
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,280
Right now, you must need

855
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,640
Alan Greenspan.

856
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,600
Right now, you must need

857
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,180
Alan Greenspan.

858
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,560
Right now, you must need

859
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,060
Alan Greenspan.

860
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,200
Alan Greenspan.

861
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,820
Gray, green, green, Newton,

862
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:45,900


863
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,980
Green, green, items,

864
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,000
green, súper, green,

865
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,440
green, pom, corn.

866
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:50,920
Green, green, items,

867
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:50,920


868
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:50,920


869
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,120
If your business receives

870
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,700
an Andrew witnesses

871
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,400
incompatibility with drinks,

872
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,680
it has been warned my

873
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,140
profession will

874
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:55,140


875
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:55,260
and danger incident.

876
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:55,500
Thank you.

877
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,220
It encourage.

878
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:57,680
comment.

879
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,460
I've done a lot of this in the B.いた

880
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,740
I think, I should rather do it over there as well

881
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:12,360
petites shipped on Friday,

882
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,180
Thank you.

883
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:42,640
Bye.

884
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,200
Bye.

885
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:42,600
Bye.

886
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,180
Bye.

887
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,660
Bye.

888
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,360
Bye.

889
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,520
Bye.

890
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,420
Bye.

891
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:07,080
That's Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.

892
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:07,520
Huh?

893
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,020
This is our next quote version unquote ma'am.

894
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:18,480
There's a little thing we do about a process which is known as electroshock therapy,

895
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:26,620
a very therapeutic process which has helped these young men become productive members of the musical industry.

896
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:33,080
But, hell, that wasn't nearly as bad as that time they shocked the living gee out of me.

897
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,340
Listen to my tale then.

898
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,780
But why? Why do you call me mad?

899
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,740
Could a madman have written songs such as these?

900
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,120
I think not. I'm not mad.

901
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:53,020
I'm merely an ordinary person seeking life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

902
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:59,100
My pursuit of happiness includes machine gunning 127 innocent children.

903
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,720
If that's mad, go ahead, lock me up.

904
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:10,720
Just because I enjoy washing my face in the blood of infants, is that any reason to lock me up?

905
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,520
I think not.

906
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,180
I've even got a piece of paper that says my mind is still okay.

907
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:24,500
Hell, I bet that guy down at the employment agency who wouldn't give me a job just because I'd been locked up one time,

908
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,100
bet he ain't got a piece of paper that says his mind is still okay.

909
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:35,300
Hell, I tried to tell him it was not me, it was the green energy demons, but they merely laughed at me.

910
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:39,560
But now those green energy demons are ruling the planet.

911
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,140
They're not laughing right so hard now, are they?

912
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:42,340
They're not laughing right so hard now, are they?

913
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:48,580
But that wasn't nearly as bad as that time they shocked the living gee out of me.

914
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,020
They're not laughing right so hard now, are they?

915
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:55,300
I tried to explain it was not me, it was the brain, the brain of Arnold Palmer,

916
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:02,840
which was controlling my mind via laser beam, via the FBI, via the CIA, via the Communist Party, via satellite.

917
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,620
It was the demon, the demon that forced me to do the deed.

918
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,480
But that wasn't nearly...

919
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,680
Dot, dot, dot.

920
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:11,880
Dot, dot, dot.

921
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,260
It wasn't...

922
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,460
I'm not insane.

923
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,980
I'm more sane than Son of Sam and Charles Manson put together.

924
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:23,200
How many people must I kill to prove I'm not insane?

925
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,440
But that wasn't nearly as bad as that time they...

926
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,620
shocked the living gee out of me.

927
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,300
Well, I didn't mind when they shocked the living pee out of me.

928
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:41,120
In fact, I kind of enjoyed it when they shocked the living see out of me.

929
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,800
I mean, that time they ran over my face with a pickup truck.

930
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,960
Oh yeah, that was fun.

931
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:51,920
That time they cut me in half with barbed wire and then peeled the band-aid off my...

932
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,980
my amputated arm.

933
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,540
Oh yeah, that was fun.

934
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:59,360
That time they skinned me alive and then called me dirty names.

935
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,720
Wee-haw!

936
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,740
That was a big ol' cocaine party.

937
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:08,640
That one time they converted my entire body into a wall of membrane

938
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,400
whose only purpose was to feel pain.

939
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,140
No, that time they converted my entire body to a wall of membrane

940
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:19,300
attached to a human brain whose only purpose was to feel pain

941
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,220
and then applied the flame.

942
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,240
Oh yeah, that was fun.

943
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,560
That time they converted every cell in my body

944
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:31,260
to the same nerve endings found in male testicles,

945
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,460
enlarged each cell to the size of a sun,

946
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,640
and then inserted huge sun-sized...

947
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:46,340
dentist drills into each of these sun-sized male testicle cells.

948
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,760
Wee-haw!

949
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,320
That was the time of my life!

950
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,500
Compared to that time they...

951
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,580
shocked the living gee out of me.

952
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,180
Hell, I thought a frontal lobotomy was a warm fuzzy.

953
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,880
I mean, I'm a...

954
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,820
I'm okay, you're a frontal lobotomy.

955
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,920
But it's all a very therapeutic process.

956
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,920
Hell, that time they put me in the room where you don't get any of the good pills.

957
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,480
Then they...

958
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,140
they had a needle that was so big

959
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,200
they had to lower me on top of it by a helicopter

960
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,380
in order to anesthetize me.

961
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,360
And that was only the needle, I'm not talking about the syringe.

962
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,860
And even that wasn't enough to put me in the room.

963
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:38,160
I had to get my head out.

964
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,860
Then they hooked me up to that device.

965
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,700
I'm not talking about that A.C. device.

966
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,880
I'm talking about that D.C. device.

967
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,020
They had Jones' titty hooked up too.

968
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,280
Then they applied the electrodes to my head.

969
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,280
I was still trying to explain to them how I wasn't insane.

970
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:54,420
I'm not...

971
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,340
I'm not a bad psychopath.

972
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,840
But hell, all that was fun, I reckon.

973
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,940
I guess you could call that a good party compared to that time they...

974
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,540
shocked the living gee out of me.

975
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,480
I just wanna say...

976
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,660
Doctors for Bob, dear friends,

977
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,840
have shocked the living gee out of me.

978
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,260
But before that, another great Rudy Schwartz project.

979
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,020
Songs interspersed with Lee Marie and Cut-outs.

980
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:31,120
And now some noise by Rabbi Shankar.

981
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,320
I don't know.

982
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,900
I don't know.

983
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:45,120
Somewhere in hyperspace, Bob has prepared a place for those he lusts for who will pay.

984
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:54,660
The X's will come again and make us over and the countdown's getting higher on X day.

985
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:04,140
Ten and nine, eight and seven, six and four and five, send your thirty bucks while you're alive.

986
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,840
Two and three, hurray!

987
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:10,460
Which will be when humans take a dive.

988
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,980
The countdown's getting high at our food drive.

989
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:32,340
Bob Dobbs was shot for you, met with the devil too.

990
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:35,440
But in deepest hell he did not stay.

991
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,720
Stay.

992
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,200
Stay.

993
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:42,280
Stay.

994
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,280


995
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,280


996
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,280


997
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,280


998
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,280


999
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,280


1000
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,280


1001
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,280


1002
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,280


1003
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:42,280


1004
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,180
The countdown's getting higher on X day.

1005
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:54,880
Ten and nine, eight and seven, six and five and nine, send your thirty bucks, you're out of time.

1006
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,740
Forty-two, boy, did he get you.

1007
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,640
Salvation should be a crime.

1008
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,320
The countdown's getting high on Frop this time.

1009
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,840
So, where's the damn thing?

1010
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:07,840


1011
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:07,840


1012
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:07,840


1013
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:07,840


1014
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:07,840


1015
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:07,840


1016
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:07,840


1017
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:07,840


1018
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:07,840


1019
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,580
Here we are.

1020
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,200
All right.

1021
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,060
Fellas, here's your story.

1022
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:13,540
Over.

1023
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:13,940
Over.

1024
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,040
Here at the North Pole, a few men have been destroyed with an arc of electricity.

1025
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:18,920
Over.

1026
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:19,500
Over.

1027
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:19,920
Over.

1028
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,940
The flying saucer which landed here performed a similar service with an arc of wood.

1029
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,920
This pilot is recovering from wounds received in the battle.

1030
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,100
Anchorage.

1031
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:28,620
Anchorage.

1032
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:28,980
Over.

1033
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:29,900
Anchorage.

1034
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:30,260
Over.

1035
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:30,920
Over.

1036
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,520
Over.

1037
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,620
That's your story, friends.

1038
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,260
Your story from Fernand and Andy Lemur.

1039
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:43,080
Before that, the song we heard was by Reverend Self Slayer, and the name of that song is

1040
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,220
the Blast Your Head Off song.

1041
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,600
This music in the background, by the way, is automatic robot fish.

1042
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:50,700
Greenspan.

1043
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:51,700
Reboot.

1044
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:52,360
Oh, yeah.

1045
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,140
Over.

1046
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:54,320
Reboot.

1047
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,040
So I asked the computer to improve me and said, you know what I'm talking about.

1048
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,800
That's making me think very carefully.

1049
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:00,660
Jesus Christ.

1050
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,980
Those loads pay off.

1051
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:03,740
Yeah.

1052
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,560
25 a day.

1053
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,560
No, wait.

1054
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,460
How would you like to collect 450 frog skins a week?

1055
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,280
And here's how, dear friends.

1056
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:24,960
Send your frog skins to this station and your or your chosen charity or church.

1057
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,260
That could be something that a person might do.

1058
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,360
Frog skins for Bob.

1059
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,880
That's all we're saying.

1060
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,240
And there's more on that moron Bob at www.softball.com.

1061
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,520
Subgenius.com.

1062
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:44,740
Incidentally, friends, I should mention to you that our old Austin and Dallas P.O.

1063
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:49,940
boxes have both closed down for good due to the horrible tragedies in Texas.

1064
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,580
Our new P.O.

1065
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:57,400
box is, as it has been for a while, actually, in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1066
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:03,480
And that's, you can write to Subgenius Foundation for free information or hour of slack or Reverend

1067
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,740
Ivan Stang at Post Office Box 181.

1068
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:13,700
417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1069
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:19,240
44118.

1070
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,680
It's so beautiful.

1071
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:27,100
And the background music this whole show has been by Reverend Angry Larry under the name

1072
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,820
Automatic Robot Fish.

1073
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:34,580
Normally, he plays with the amino acids, but he also does movie soundtracks like this.

1074
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:37,160
Well, we both do awful things.

1075
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:37,240
I'm not sure if you've heard of it.

1076
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:37,240


1077
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:37,940
Thanks, dear friends.

1078
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,440
Because we love you.

1079
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,580
And Bob, Bob loves you.

1080
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,140
Bob, I'm so sorry.

1081
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,340
That's fine.

1082
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:47,940
No.

1083
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:51,300
There's no way of me.

1084
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:51,980
So.

1085
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:01,260
Hi, Molly.

1086
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,500
Well, I'll get a lot.

1087
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,320
I'll get it.

1088
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:10,300
Hello?

1089
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,740
Hello, Wally?

1090
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:12,220
This is me.

1091
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,240
Hey, Beaver.

1092
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,460
You're a dumb little kid.

1093
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,080
You better hurry up and get in line.

1094
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,240
Okay.

1095
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,080
Goodbye, Wally.

1096
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:21,620
Bye.

1097
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:22,900
Bye.

1098
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,480
Bye.

1099
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:26,400


1100
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:26,520
Bye.

1101
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:26,980
Bye.

1102
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:27,420
Bye.

1103
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:27,680
Bye.

1104
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:28,800
Bye.

1105
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,080
Bye.

1106
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:29,340
Bye.

1107
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:29,560
Bye.

1108
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:29,620


1109
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:29,620


1110
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:29,620


1111
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:30,160
Bye.

1112
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,060
My bathroom

1113
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,100
My bathroom

1114
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,920
My bathroom

1115
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,020
Porn Chrome

1116
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,880
Beware ye the Equilibrium

1117
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,500
Oh you don't have to call me ye, just my friends call me that

1118
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,640
And the Equivalium

1119
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,120
And, and you can call me Go

1120
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,100
Ye and Go

1121
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,180
Go ye

1122
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:54,860
Go ye

1123
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:55,380
Go ye

1124
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:55,920
Go ye

1125
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,580
Go ye

1126
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,200
Go ye

1127
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:57,760
Go ye

1128
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,260
Go ye

1129
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:58,620
Go ye

1130
00:59:58,620 --> 00:59:58,640
Go ye

1131
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,360
Go ye
