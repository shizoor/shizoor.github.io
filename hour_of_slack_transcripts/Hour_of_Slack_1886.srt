1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
Remember

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,460
We're sitting together listening to this

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,460
And this was prison

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,040
Remember

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,960
You need me, and I have come

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,220
Hi Bob

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:19,840
Hi Bob

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,640
Yeah

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,520
Bob

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,140
Bob

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,860
Bob

12
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,820
Bob

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,100
Bob

14
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,260
Bob

15
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,240
Yes sir

16
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,660
I like subgenius

17
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,340
No sir

18
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,680
I don't like pink boys

19
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,580
Yes sir

20
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,600
I love Bob

21
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,580
No sir

22
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,840
I'm no sir

23
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,220
No sir

24
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,000
I do not want to stop Bob

25
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,900
I just want to give my feast to the thousands

26
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,300
In every leaf, in every twig, in every cow, in every pig

27
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,080
I want Bob deep fried and depreased

28
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,140
I want to feel him in the breeze

29
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,340
I want to see him in the sky

30
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,240
I hope his fight will end

31
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,580
And it was kind of nice for all those people.

32
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,440
Dear Bob, who floats above the ground, I long to hear the mournful sound

33
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,760
That's made when you emerge from space And come to this, my dwelling place.

34
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,840
Dear Bob, each night, while I'm asleep, I hope to my house you will creep

35
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,180
And poke your pipe in through the wall So I'll be burned, remembering all.

36
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,760
Dear Bob, it's time to close my eyes, remember now.

37
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,920
It's no surprise, if I should be found dead someday, I'll think that you were in the way.

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:39,460
Oh, gimme Bob, confusing that face With my own, can't remember my place.

39
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,340
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind

40
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:49,740
to the soul.

41
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,320
To the subgenius power of SWAT.

42
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:08,180
Bob's role on this planet is to see that the Earth is not sold on that glorious or terrible day

43
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,240
we call X-Day in 1998.

44
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,820
When the men from Planet X arrive.

45
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,820
Yeah, now it may sound ludicrous, it may sound ridiculous to men and believers out there.

46
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,620
You're saying that all, not all those people,

47
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,600
may be, yeah, may be.

48
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,940
You once were telling me about Planet X, Dr. Morbant.

49
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,040
Evil on Planet X is more than you could think of.

50
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,760
Evils, doxom.

51
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,000
Every night and day they wait to see the evil they go through.

52
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,460
Do they come down in flying saucers?

53
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,040
Flying saucers are bearing on us.

54
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,960
We don't know what to do.

55
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,140
We're here all alone.

56
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,280
The planets are fading.

57
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,820
The blood is running.

58
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,660
The lights were fading.

59
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,460
And they stalked us one by one.

60
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,500
The very...

61
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,660
This is the Man in Black, here for the Roma Wine Company of Fresno, California.

62
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,780
For centuries we have been circling your Earth, waiting for a means to penetrate your atmosphere.

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,060
I am the first to come to you.

64
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,480
With death and destruction?

65
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,180
Yes.

66
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,580
Go ahead and kill me.

67
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,580
What's gonna happen to your children?

68
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,180
What's gonna happen to your children?

69
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,540
What's gonna happen to you when this society we've created,

70
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,480
this society of air conditioners,

71
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,640
of station wagons with wooden sides,

72
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,600
of cautious, indeed, of retired actors,

73
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,520
of orange hail, of human politicians,

74
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,660
what happens when that collapses?

75
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,900
What happens when your daughter ain't worth a damn?

76
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,360
What happens when your daughter ain't worth a damn?

77
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,900
That's when the man from Planet X-9,

78
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,300
when the man from Planet X-9,

79
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,620
then friggin famous...

80
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,240
Zip Yarnيد

81
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,440
Just run the nave.

82
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,120
Tulip

83
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,720
get up.

84
00:03:52,940 --> 00:04:01,060
You'd won't let me die.

85
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,140
You'd rotten our future.

86
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,320
Mutton

87
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,460
Terra

88
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,160
Traits

89
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,080
Neurologies

90
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,080


91
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,080


92
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,980
Yummy

93
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,240
Yes!

94
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,000
Give us your children!

95
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,700
Give us your children!

96
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,240
Let us raise them!

97
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,240
You'll have weirder kids than me!

98
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,760
Ha ha ha ha ha!

99
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,760
That's odd.

100
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,560
Very odd.

101
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,480
Meltdown.

102
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,060
And this can happen to you!

103
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,980
This can be yours!

104
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,780
Uh, yes, dear friends, it can happen to you,

105
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,480
it can be yours, and it will be yours on X-Day 1998,

106
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,360
only two years from now,

107
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,740
and of course, dear friends, this is our X-Day show,

108
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,160
it's July, by the time you hear this tape,

109
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,640
I will probably be at the X-Day drill,

110
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,840
drilling my way deep into my own brain

111
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,760
in preparation for the arrival of those gods and goddesses

112
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,020
from outer space who will come in 1998,

113
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,360
July 5th, 1998.

114
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,960
You know the story, friends, and if you don't,

115
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,880
well, just keep listening, because we're gonna have

116
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,180
every tiny media barrage clip that ever had anything

117
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,860
to do with X-Day for this show and the next one.

118
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,360
I apologize for the last show.

119
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,480
But you know, as Dr. Legume pointed out,

120
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,420
in the first edition of the Book of the Subgenius,

121
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,620
the McGraw-Hill Orange cover,

122
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:44,180
there was a misprint that seemed obviously a mistake

123
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,860
that at one point made it look like X-Day would happen in 1996.

124
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,100
Well, what if that wasn't a misprint?

125
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,400
What if you're not ready, friend?

126
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,400
What if you're still putting off that mighty moment

127
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,540
when you write that mighty check?

128
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,220
What if?

129
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,560
These are all important what-ifs, friends,

130
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,480
and you know, that...

131
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,120
movie is coming out Independence Day.

132
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,640
God, their ploys are so obvious,

133
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,920
so filthy and so obvious,

134
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,600
that...

135
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,660
You know, the pieces are all coming together

136
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,040
for the one world government.

137
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,960
We can tell...

138
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,360
You can see the story behind the rise of Bill...

139
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,260
Clinton.

140
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,500
Bill Soft-On-Kitty-Porn Clinton, I should call him,

141
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,900
and his little clique rising to the American throne.

142
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,100
Yes, it was through the diabolical backroom machinations of Dobbs

143
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,940
that all of these things have come about.

144
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,920
Thou art but an insignificant insect.

145
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,080
And you'd better speak to the manager, boy,

146
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,960
because that day is coming.

147
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,140
That day is coming up, and well, I'm gonna...

148
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,160
I ain't...

149
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,080
I'm just gonna let these tapes carry you on through, friend,

150
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,640
because it's...

151
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,960
This is the biggest celebration of the Subgenius year.

152
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,700
And, uh...

153
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,120
I hope that...

154
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,720
I hope that you're readying yourself,

155
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,420
just as we are.

156
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,340
I'm sorry if you can't make it to the X-Day drill

157
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,480
in Sherman, New York,

158
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,720
while you're hearing this show.

159
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,580
I really am.

160
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,200
But, in the meantime, you may commune, yes?

161
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,080
You may commune now with the spirit of Dobbs

162
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,180
and the promise of X-Day.

163
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,160
Ah, yes.

164
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,260
You may commune with him.

165
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,080
You may commune with him.

166
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,360
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

167
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,520
I'm sorry.

168
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,520


169
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,520


170
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,520


171
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,520


172
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,520


173
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,520


174
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,520


175
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,520


176
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,600
But what a lot of us do not realize is

177
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,120
that in chapter 1 of Ezekiel, verse 4,

178
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,620
the angels traveled in whirlwind fashion.

179
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,320
Not like our jets straight ahead.

180
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,220
Whirlwind!

181
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,740
They move from one end of heaven to the other

182
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,700
like a flight.

183
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:14,560
of lightning, verse 14. And verse 15 says their color was burl. Do you know what they put into

184
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,480
spaceships now that are heaved out there? The only thing that can withstand the heat,

185
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:28,140
other things would disintegrate, burl ilium. It's like some kind of, some kind of vision,

186
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,660
like I've never seen before. It was like a wagon wheel coming out of the sky, and I was sitting

187
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,340
on the porch with Aunt May, and she said, what is it, boy, what is it? And I said, I don't know,

188
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:45,780
ma'am, I swear to God, I don't know, but she said, praise Bob. You know, when, if Bob, if Bob

189
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:57,120
says something, that wall climbing, wall, what was it, wall climbing, wall climbing, well,

190
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,500
I was wall climbing, I was wall climbing, and that's what Bob said to do, that's what Bob told

191
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:03,640
me to do. And I said, well, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,

192
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:03,880
I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it,

193
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:10,800
I can't believe it maybe me too, I was wall climbing, yeah. I, I get, I get, I get real scared,

194
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:25,400
Bob, because I, I seen them, I seen them before, but there's more of them now, and,

195
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:32,800
because there's lots more. They're, they're floating in the, in the air, and they, they're

196
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,620
living in the wind.

197
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:39,260
wood and the rocks and everything and they're they're always kind of

198
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:50,240
laughing and killing and laughing and all the time duncan lunan of the british interplanetary

199
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:57,020
society has interpreted the signals as a message from the space probe a message from a dying planet

200
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,440
right

201
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:26,280
along with bob the pursuit of slack and a conspiracy of pinks

202
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,960
the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse according to church doctrine

203
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:39,480
On July 5th, 1998, when the television signal of Amos and Andy reaches the men from Planet X,

204
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,900
the aliens will unleash their wrath upon the Earth.

205
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,240
And the men from Planet X are going to come down and take over Earth.

206
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,340
They're going to...

207
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:55,440
They will put us out of our misery unless Bob can explain to them in ways that they can understand

208
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,920
that there is something on Earth worth saving.

209
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,460
And only the subgenii, the dues-paying, book-buying, receipt-in-the-pocket,

210
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:10,320
paid in full to the church subgenii, have the tiniest prayer of survival.

211
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,400
The rest of them? It's a tough world, Jack.

212
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,980
The fighting Jesus looked out over the bridge of the exist battle saucer, Blood of Christ.

213
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,880
He looked and laughed.

214
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,920
He laughed and looked.

215
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,960
He looked and looked.

216
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,080
He laughed and laughed.

217
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,780
He laughed.

218
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:28,780


219
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,700
He laughed and laughed.

220
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,540
Jesus was in a psychopathically elated state.

221
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:08,340
His face resembled many of the perverse icons the humanoids of the dust moat painted of him.

222
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,160
They prayed to these for the salvation of their souls, as if they had any souls to save,

223
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,060
as if anyone would want to save them, which they didn't.

224
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,480
A whole disgusting religion now centered around his murder.

225
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,100
They had to gall to nail him up like a common criminal and then paint pictures of him enjoying it.

226
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,940
They thought he loved them for it, that he was forgiving.

227
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,020
Oh, the anticipation.

228
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,640
He was sick to his stomach with glee.

229
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,960
He would show them the true face of pain and sin.

230
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,740
It had taken him two thousand long years to return here,

231
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,160
and now he would pay them back for the scars he still carried in his hands.

232
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,080
Sweet stigmata.

233
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,400
Even the slightest thought of the scars made them glow red through his fists, through the boxing gloves.

234
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:06,300
The whole of the spacecraft was manned with angels of light personally lent by Jehovah One.

235
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:12,900
They supervised the demon teams operating on all tangible destruction spectrums.

236
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,320
All in attack mode.

237
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,420
Nagas, Orzuma, Shiva, Horus, Aeons, the dark bodies.

238
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,340
And at time and a half, too.

239
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,720
It was expensive to ravage a planet.

240
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,860
No matter.

241
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,740
The hope of that which comes had finally arrived.

242
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,460
And on Jesus' birthday.

243
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,900
What do you think, Dad?

244
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,680
His second in command, Jim Jones, stood by with the final attack coordinate codices.

245
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,200
A whole graphic map of Earth rotated slowly next to Jones in midair.

246
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,700
On its surface, grids of the natives' planetary defenses were lit up in green.

247
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,320
Ones, some depicting their pathetic communication structures in violet.

248
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,800
All in scale, quite pretty actually.

249
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,680
A colorful net surrounded the sphere.

250
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,060
It would soon enough be dark.

251
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,520
These children wait for us below, Jesus.

252
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,500
We will walk among them and we will smile.

253
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,960
At your moment of choice, of course.

254
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:24,940
Jesus studied Jones' puffy, tired face in the pink glow of the neuron banks that ran around the walls of the mighty dreadnought and shuddered.

255
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,180
He was no stranger to resurrection of the undead.

256
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,740
But whoever had brought Jones around again had slipped up.

257
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,420
Something was missing.

258
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,580
Something else was added.

259
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,680
Something.

260
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:43,100
Jones had been forced on him by the Djinn bankers who had financed this angelic war fleet.

261
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,840
Damn them.

262
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,200
He never forgot the price they had demanded for this mercenary raiding fleet.

263
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,780
Jones' constant reminders of their influence and expectations irritated Jesus no end.

264
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,160
Not to mention the influence of the war fleet.

265
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,780
The annoying habit Jones had copied from Dobbs.

266
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,500
The twisted creature insisted on smoking a pipe, even here near the sensitive nerve relays.

267
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,860
Jones might have been left dead a little too long.

268
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,280
He moved with a constant jerk and always poked at his throat.

269
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:21,680
He never removed his sunglasses and he still took massive injections of methamphetamines even though they no longer had any effect on his regenerated shell.

270
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,260
You know Jimbo, said Jesus.

271
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,680
The best part is that they think there's an afterlife.

272
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,100
That's why they strung me up the first time.

273
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,640
They think like bugs down there.

274
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,620
I'm well aware of that, Commander.

275
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:45,620
It bothered Jones to be back on Earth so soon after his failure with the social programming research post he had been running there.

276
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,340
It wasn't really his fault.

277
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,660
The administration change at Central merely cut off the funding for it.

278
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,180
He was forced to abort the experiment and terminate the experiment.

279
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,380
Then we'll have to wait before we find out what this is all about.

280
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,480
Not entirely.

281
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,400
The papers we found in Harding's laboratory explain why they're building the hydrogen bomb.

282
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:08,500
Its explosion was intended to deflect the rotation of the Earth enough to send it out of its orbit and spinning off into space.

283
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,160
Those zombies must have been as crazy as they looked.

284
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,240
It may sound ridiculous, but it's theoretically possible.

285
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,220
Yeah, we're safe now, for the time being.

286
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,200
But there are undoubtedly more of those power-mad creatures loose on other planets.

287
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,980
So it'll take constant vigilance on our part to ensure the safety of this world.

288
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,200
The

289
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:51,980
If this was indeed an extraterrestrial spacecraft with living occupants, it must have been very disconcerting for them to cross millions of miles of space only to be hit on the head with rotten oranges.

290
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,240
The dramatic advent of the space-time machine was a great success.

291
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,360
Christina Larson's Sweet Dreams

292
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,160
Theョ Raw Orfin's creation of a version of the places ofjas

293
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:13,340
On AI in the first 43 minutes of the insane experiment, where joys and sorrows of delays and flight inte layout all bigger, losing all ability to predict the future, use of three and four nautical miles of zero velocities or electric disc, landsat, NiF-2ノ-acions to fire the

294
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:21,220
tails of aliens tel nautical notion Carne verdad

295
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:26,620
Everything went black and I realized that I'd been cut off and shut off in a little tiny room where nobody was listening to me.

296
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,360
And I was talking to this hot little plush felt red rubber tip microphone.

297
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,140
Not hearing a thing and seeing only little tiny lights.

298
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:42,040
Wondering why I was strapped to this chair and put into this studio that seemed to be rotating very rapidly with lights flashing off rhythmically.

299
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:52,800
And it was a small man with a swollen head and hideously deformed eyes sitting behind the console pushing the buttons while pencils of light and energy flashed across my body.

300
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,080
And I wondered why I was there and what did they want of me.

301
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,540
And I couldn't figure out why I was sitting there.

302
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,920
And they didn't say anything.

303
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,520
They just kept flashing those lights at me and pumping those strange chemicals into me.

304
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,680
And the man with the funny head, the leader, the man with the strange grin and the pipe.

305
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,100
Well, I just want to know.

306
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,840
Do you want to be?

307
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,780
In the church or out of the church?

308
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,980
And where's your wallet?

309
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,120
The DC9 pushing the button.

310
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,360
Yeah.

311
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:24,240
I didn't know that I'd been snatched up and it wasn't really a dream until I saw these sacred nasal positions.

312
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,960
And suddenly it all came back to me.

313
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:36,740
And I realized that they'd stolen four and a half hours out of my life when they put me in that tiny room and plugged all those wires into me and made me talk.

314
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,460
Well, it's only an hour and a half tonight, mister.

315
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:39,780
And talk.

316
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,560
Because you only paid for an hour and a half.

317
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:41,860
And talk.

318
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,760
And talk.

319
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:43,760


320
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:43,760


321
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:43,760


322
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,540
Friends and neighbors of planet Earth.

323
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,260
I come to you from a long, long ways off.

324
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,460
I come from a planet that is similar to yours.

325
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,340
Your many fears, tensions, and frustrations are no longer ours.

326
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,660
I hate them.

327
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,020
With all my heart.

328
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,640
They are inhuman and to be destroyed.

329
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,860
What is your objective?

330
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,280
You are not ready.

331
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,960
But we will still save you.

332
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,020
Any questions, despite this, you will never answer.

333
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,020


334
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,020


335
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,020


336
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,740
and more satellites.

337
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,840
And we will be there

338
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,000
waiting to come again.

339
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,980
I'll be right here.

340
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,000
And we'll be sending that little

341
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,520
almond-eyed gray humanoid

342
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
around to your door

343
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,600
to collect those organs.

344
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,000
Snappy.

345
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,480
He'll be in the cute little uniform,

346
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,560
so don't be afraid.

347
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,940
They're your friends.

348
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,880
They're here to help.

349
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,580
They're our brothers from the stars.

350
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,220
You should believe anything

351
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,940
they whisper into your ear

352
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,960
in the dead of night

353
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,440
as you try to sleep.

354
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,500
Whisper, whisper, whisper.

355
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,540
They're your friends.

356
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,940
They want to teach humanity

357
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,460
and lead us into a new age

358
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,120
of enlightenment

359
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,060
under their gray jackboot.

360
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,020
Whisper, whisper.

361
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,860
Now listen, now listen, now listen.

362
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,300
Now listen, now listen.

363
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,720
If you wake up in a vat

364
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,520
of poison

365
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,640
with little aliens

366
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,600
standing around outside the vat

367
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,080
wrapping, tying napkins

368
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,100
around their necks

369
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,860
and sharpening their knives

370
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,680
and forks,

371
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,060
be glad because you've just

372
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,020
fell into the hands

373
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,460
of the good aliens.

374
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,060
The bad aliens are far, far worse.

375
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:31,840
Whoa!

376
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,880
Oh, they're not like the thing.

377
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,120
That was a cuddly little Benji

378
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,760
of an alien compared to what we're...

379
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,060
They aren't like aliens

380
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,280
in that movie Aliens.

381
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,320
Those are silly little werewolves

382
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,140
among monsters

383
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,800
compared to what we're talking about.

384
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,000
That is in the box.

385
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,900
What we're talking about

386
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,560
is more like what's growing

387
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,740
in your refrigerator right now.

388
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,400
That's what it looks more like.

389
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,700
What is this?

390
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,960
The effect is

391
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,360
it turns you into the alien.

392
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,820
But man,

393
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,440
take my word for it.

394
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,180
It's worth it.

395
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,600
It's great, man.

396
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,060
It's cool.

397
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,940
You'll love it.

398
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,800
It's for your own good.

399
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,060
What's the matter?

400
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,620
Are you afraid?

401
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,540
What's the matter, you chicken?

402
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,960
Come on, man.

403
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,300
Everybody's doing it.

404
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,200
Go ahead.

405
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,280
Stroke the alien

406
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,660
and collect the dew

407
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,100
that builds up on the surface.

408
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,300
It's like a snake

409
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,740
inside of its neck like a panda.

410
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,880
Go ahead.

411
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,240
Now demagnetize your head.

412
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,080
Okay?

413
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,920
I think you know what to do next.

414
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,820
I don't think you're the kind of listener

415
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,900
that I'd have to explain that to.

416
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,700
Now are you?

417
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,040
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

418
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,600
Yeah, I think they know

419
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,340
just what I'm talking about.

420
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,280
Oh, they like it too.

421
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,480
Oh, they're first and good.

422
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,740
I don't know what to do next.

423
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,440
You stand up on the hillside

424
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,500
with your bat call

425
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,200
and blow into the bat call.

426
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,080
It's not like a moose call

427
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,860
or a duck call.

428
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,060
You can't hear it.

429
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,040
Yeah, but it's super.

430
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,600
This is superfluous.

431
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,300
I give it a young name.

432
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,460
And just make sure you've got

433
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,400
your antidote pudding ready

434
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,340
for when that bat lands on your face.

435
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,920
You're going to have to use that pudding.

436
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,620
Mighty quick.

437
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,100
But it's worth it.

438
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,480
You'll dig it.

439
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,180
Well, I don't know.

440
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,540
I'm kind of scared.

441
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,200
Well, it's always scary the first time.

442
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,420
That's part of the kick, man.

443
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,240
Oh, okay.

444
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,580
Come on.

445
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,280
Everybody's doing it.

446
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,060
I ain't never going to do it.

447
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm too old to do it.

448
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,920
Aren't you susceptible

449
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,180
to peer group pressure?

450
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
I'm too old for it.

451
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,280
What are you, some kind of a weirdo?

452
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:02,880
Yes.

453
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,740
No, I'm not a weirdo.

454
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,600
I want to be like everyone else.

455
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,400
No, no, no.

456
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:08,880
Good.

457
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
Then you'll take this.

458
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,000
This little alien home.

459
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm a weirdo.

460
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,320
Stop rubbing your face.

461
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,360
I'm confused again.

462
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,120
I don't think there's a reason

463
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,340
for her to be confused.

464
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,520
There's something you find

465
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,820
when you open the door.

466
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,120
You take these keys

467
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,440
and one of the keys says Bob on it.

468
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,200
You stick it in the lock

469
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,640
and you open up the door.

470
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,080
And if you're lucky,

471
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,460
the green carpet rolls out.

472
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,300
And if you're not,

473
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,260
the red carpet rolls out.

474
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,860
He was communicating with them.

475
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,440
What do you think?

476
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,520
I think Rockefeller was crazy that night.

477
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,560
He got away with the money.

478
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,820
How can we stop them?

479
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,240
We can stop them

480
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,680
by stopping the pink boys.

481
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,480
If we stop the pink boys,

482
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,520
we can stop them murdering

483
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,220
and they're killing

484
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,140
and they're stealing

485
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,840
and they're persifying us.

486
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,840
But it's so difficult.

487
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,180
Oh, Jerry,

488
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,940
don't let the boy house save you.

489
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,540
Be brave.

490
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,180
Be brave.

491
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,560
I'll always be brave.

492
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,600
Because the women saves us.

493
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,900
Greetings to you earthlings.

494
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,720
I am Princess Dragomon.

495
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,900
I have taken over this planet.

496
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,880
Now I own the earth

497
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,760
and you'll be my slaves for all eternity.

498
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,680
The disasters you experienced

499
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,680
are just small examples

500
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,760
of our great power.

501
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,100
Either surrender to me

502
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,060
or I'll destroy all humans.

503
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,260
I've spoken.

504
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,560
It's all the warning

505
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,600
you're going to get from me.

506
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,600
You'll be destroyed.

507
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,420
They don't sleep either.

508
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,600
They're not emotional.

509
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,240
Angels don't have any emotion.

510
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,480
Another and worse war will break out.

511
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,700
And you see a night

512
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,660
with a strange light in the sky.

513
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,320
You will know it is a sign

514
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,440
that the world is about to be punished

515
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,340
for its crime.

516
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,880
By 1998,

517
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,000
every normal,

518
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,420
mediocriton,

519
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,340
pink boy,

520
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,300
admin,

521
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,420
Trekkie,

522
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,280
and hippie is going to be trying to get on board with the good ship dogs.

523
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,100
The good ship dogs.

524
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,620
Or they're going to fry along with everybody else when those aliens get here.

525
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:24,120
Of course, such a prophecy immediately arises our cynicism.

526
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,460
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

527
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,500
Perhaps.

528
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,160
Or is it just another of those prognostications

529
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,260
which have haunted man through the ages?

530
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,940
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand.

531
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,080
But for the fact that many of Nostradamus' other prophecies

532
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,160
have already been fulfilled.

533
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,560
But the old ones are coming back.

534
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,940
I'm going to let them through.

535
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:01,240
The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout.

536
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,740
On July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m.,

537
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,620
when we all have hangovers,

538
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,740
Wu-Tang's judgment will take place in the form of what the pre-scriptures call

539
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,740
the advent of the angelic host.

540
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,020
Happy, happy Independence Day.

541
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,740
Happy real Independence Day, my friends.

542
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,060
Because here in Dallas, Texas,

543
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,440
which is in its own time zone, you know,

544
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,700
all the cities that get the hour of slack are in different times.

545
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,140
And the time continues.

546
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,240
But here in Dallas, yesterday was July 4th,

547
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,940
the day before real Independence Day.

548
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,920
You see, for subgeniuses,

549
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:53,900
July 4th is like the day of disappointment and shattered dreams.

550
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,720
It's a day of lies and rushes to judgment

551
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,620
of drunken pinks and car crashes

552
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,520
and depressing desert storm parades.

553
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,620
And we mope.

554
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,200
And we mope around and think about things like wounded knee

555
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,220
and JFK and assassination

556
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,760
and the Spanish-American War

557
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,820
and Vietnam and Iran-Contras

558
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,460
and Watergate and so on.

559
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,820
But, dear friends,

560
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,740
dear friends,

561
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,700
July 5th,

562
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,840
July 5th,

563
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,980
that is a day of hope and promise

564
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,720
for the subgeniuses,

565
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,360
yes, friends, the day with the true America,

566
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,660
the Bob's America,

567
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,120
the America of our Masonic subgenius,

568
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,860
patriot forefathers and foremoms and foreslaves.

569
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,780
Today, July 5th, in Dallas anyway,

570
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,220
is the first day of the end of the world.

571
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,420
The end of their world, dear friends,

572
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:06,580
because it's the first day before the beginning of our world.

573
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,220
The day of our subgenius planet.

574
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
ascendant

575
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,280
theș

576
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:11,280


577
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:11,280


578
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
we're thrilled

579
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,800
and mình

580
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,740
to have this incredible between the internet

581
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,180
was here on this big?"

582
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:20,980
Do you remember week,

583
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,960
until you announced,

584
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:35,960
I'm annihilated,

585
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:42,300
And X Day Night, of course, we call X Dayeen, sort of like Halloween.

586
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,080
But X Day is our Independence Day.

587
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,420
Not July 4th, not Juneteenth, but Xistmas.

588
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,860
Xistmas, dear friends.

589
00:28:50,900 --> 00:29:00,260
And, you know, the night before Xistmas, the whole family, the subgenius fully extended nuclear family,

590
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:06,520
goes out and watches fireworks or else illegally sets them off in their backyard.

591
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:14,120
And then everyone, the kids and everyone, go in and watch Freddy Krueger, Nightmare on Elm Street videos around the fireplace.

592
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,780
And the kids are tucked in, of course, about 1 o'clock in the morning.

593
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:25,820
And the grown-ups stay up all night frobbing and frobbing and dooning and gleaning.

594
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,960
And doing X Day chants.

595
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,240
About how they're doing it.

596
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,260
The time is nigh for their arisal.

597
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,900
And songs, you know, X Day holiday songs like Take Me Off to Space, which we'll be playing soon.

598
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,180
And on X Day morning, of course, well, the grown-ups have been up all night.

599
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:52,060
But the kids get up real early because on X Day, the children are allowed to eat breakfast.

600
00:29:53,260 --> 00:30:00,040
And just before 7 o'clock, all the grown-ups and everybody sit outdoors on their easy chairs like I did.

601
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,240
This is the same thing.

602
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,360
This morning with beers or whatever in their hands.

603
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,860
And they do a countdown up till 7 a.m.

604
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:17,440
And then since it's not really X Day yet, they meditate, friends, on what it's going to be like when those men from Planet X come down and destroy the normal people on this planet.

605
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:24,000
And take the weird abnormals and eccentrics and those of us who have to live in disguise as a human.

606
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:29,340
And lift us up, up and away into the escaped vessels of the sex goddesses.

607
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,160
And that's what our...

608
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,040
Our religion is all about.

609
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,280
But, you know, anyway, on X Day, after...

610
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:41,460
After thinking about all that, we sing hymns more about how the humans are all going to die.

611
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,700
And then there's some rock and roll and dancing and so forth.

612
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,460
And then everybody goes to bed, usually fairly early in the day because you have to sleep.

613
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,040
I've been up all night on X Day Eve.

614
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,160
And they need to have energy for X Day Eve.

615
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,100
So on our...

616
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,240
X Day Eve...

617
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,640
I mean, when...

618
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,300
The night of X-mas, when everybody dresses up in costumes.

619
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:12,200
Dress up like angels or devils or God or Jesus or Bob or even Negi.

620
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:18,220
And, of course, you can get those Bob and Negi masks from your favorite subgenius vendors at Fractant Company.

621
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,400
As seen in your Sartfest.

622
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,560
Ah, yes.

623
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,500
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

624
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,180
Shall a-cundle-a-dub-a-soya.

625
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:29,900
Ha-ha.

626
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,460
Ha-ha.

627
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,800
Oh.

628
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,480
Oh.

629
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,160
Bye.

630
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,700
You have to go?

631
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:37,660
Yeah.

632
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:48,280
It's so funny when those scary monsters get the shock of a lifetime when they close and counter third time for the first time.

633
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,720
Then they wake up.

634
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,800
Good morning, America.

635
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,460
Good morning, America.

636
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,040
Good morning, America.

637
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,060
Good morning, America.

638
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,540
Good morning.

639
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,440
The X-est will descend with them.

640
00:31:59,440 --> 00:31:59,960
Scientific.

641
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,640
Magic.

642
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,640
Implements.

643
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,660
There'll be stalls of technology that will be too much for us to handle.

644
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:11,760
In one instant, all the hangovers will disappear, along with all pollution and nuclear weapons.

645
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:18,840
But in return, the human race will have to take on living machinery so complex that those it is peaceful.

646
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:24,080
The end result will be equivalent to letting toddlers play with a nuclear arsenal.

647
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:30,220
Bob, and not some conspiracy world government, must be there in a position of war.

648
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:42,380
Necessarily a modern world leader should explain humanity's behavior to the X-est in ways they can understand so they don't put us out of our misery with a snap of their cosmic finger, like they did the dinosaurs.

649
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:50,300
The right people, us, must be the ones that the X-est make into superhuman over men.

650
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,620
And even then, things will be damn tough for the rest of this period.

651
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,460
Which is called the time and half time.

652
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,200
You got it?

653
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,200


654
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,200


655
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:11,000
The X's have landed

656
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Earth's under their control

657
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:24,080
Dobbs vision stands proven

658
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,360
The city's radioactive holes

659
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:37,660
We don't know what their game is

660
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:43,500
But their name is unpronounceable

661
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:50,560
We don't know what they came for

662
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,500
But what they aim for

663
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,060
Is to destroy the world

664
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,640
It is impossible

665
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,200
To spare not we beings

666
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,180
In the second year

667
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,760
Before the millennium

668
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,200
On the day of God

669
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,900
Come Wednesday

670
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,460
As in the twinkling of an eye

671
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,800
There will come among thee

672
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,880
Yarkatism

673
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,520
Which are like unto thy great white brothers

674
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,700
They come as men

675
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,300
As grave and images

676
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,580
As the whirlwind

677
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,060
And the wind

678
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,060


679
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,920
As the cloud

680
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,100
And they are now on the heavens

681
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Working over me

682
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,740
Have landed

683
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,360
Their machines

684
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,040
Following our tracks

685
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,980
Dobbs vision

686
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,480
Stands proven

687
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,080
A world

688
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,380
Without slack

689
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,820
the force

690
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,800
Jump out from nowhere

691
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,560
Right now

692
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,740
Most oli-

693
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:16,740


694
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:16,740


695
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,040
Will face the shadow

696
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,920
nonристice

697
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,120
Launched up on the crannya

698
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,640
enabled to land

699
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:22,640


700
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,220
On aостоchi

701
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,340
On a зад

702
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,160
ない

703
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:30,260
And now I show thee signs in the heaven and signs in the earth, blood-belches from the earth,

704
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:34,180
my lights in the sky rebuke thee.

705
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:41,740
The children of heaven and the angels from heaven are among thee, spreading lies and deception.

706
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,440
They turn not as they go.

707
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,380
Ah, but who cares, dear friends? Who cares?

708
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,060
Because the end times are coming up.

709
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,800
You know, it's the first day of the end of the world.

710
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:10,460
And we've been given, Bob has given us to see signs and portents of what will bring this end,

711
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,220
what will trigger the day of judgment.

712
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:22,700
And what it's going to be, of course we know when the Exodus will, of course, arrive July 5th, 1998.

713
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,320
That's Sunday.

714
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,180
It's 7 o'clock in the morning all over the world.

715
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:33,360
But what triggers the end times for the other alien beings, the Yakatizma and so forth,

716
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:42,600
is this one moment when the world, when America becomes so decadent that it no longer deserves to live.

717
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:50,640
And that sign of the end times, dear friends, is the royal jelly enema.

718
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:58,460
At a time, 1998, 97, doesn't matter when, might be now, may have already happened.

719
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:07,060
A time when beggars are crowding the streets and children, poor children are out starving.

720
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:16,600
Celebrities and lawyers in Hollywood will be indulging in the latest hedonistic health, the crackpot health fad.

721
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,620
Getting enemas with the Yakatizma.

722
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,680
Pure royal jelly, the honey fed to queen bees,

723
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:31,620
which costs a thousand dollars for enough royal jelly to get the average jaded swinger, you know, off or whatever.

724
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:42,640
And so at this time when the homeless are selling their babies to procure used, leftover ambergris and royal jelly enema byproducts,

725
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:50,480
when a Hollywood star, the moment when a Hollywood star spends $60,000 in one night on that,

726
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,960
and his used jelly is sold on the streets for $200 for half a pint,

727
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:04,500
this so disgusts the aliens that they decide to trash the earth before the X's arrival.

728
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:18,440
Friends, it's gonna be a rough time and I'm gonna, this is gonna be an all X day night, a night of celebrating, yes,

729
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:24,500
that time when Bob will come and hose down the streets and clean up this crooked and perverse nation.

730
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:30,960
So we're gonna hear from Father Joe Mama as he delves on into this as well.

731
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,200
Praise Bob.

732
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,380
Hello friends, and welcome.

733
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,580
You know, most of you out there must be feeling pretty smug with yourselves.

734
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,520
After all, you're alive.

735
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,920
You're healthy.

736
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,540
Your life's insured.

737
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,900
There's a little money set aside in case of accidents.

738
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,620
What more could you ask for?

739
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,660
These are good times.

740
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:02,380
Easy money, easy sex, VCRs and Nintendo to keep your minds occupied.

741
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:07,080
You know, they say that the golden age is never the present age.

742
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,160
They really do say that.

743
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,780
But we look all around us everywhere, and what do we see?

744
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,800
Golden opportunity.

745
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,900
Well, friends, that's just common sense.

746
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:25,440
We come before the storm because tonight's sermon is entitled X Day 1998, Day of Reckoning.

747
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,540
We all know vaguely what X Day is.

748
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,200
Bob told us himself that it shall occur July 5th, 1998.

749
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:38,040
The X's shall land and whisk the good subgenies off to a never-ending pleasure cruise of the cosmos.

750
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,780
But what of the pinks that remain on Earth?

751
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,300
What will happen to the A-holes that are left behind?

752
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,880
Well, friends, as we all know, the A-holes are the ones that are left behind.

753
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:53,360
And as much as I hate to gloat over those less fortunate, the fact is they'll get exactly what they deserve.

754
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:00,600
Any real subgenie giving the normal what he deserves is about the cruelest fate a normal could ever receive.

755
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:06,220
After all, these are the same normals that have supported the conspiracy for centuries.

756
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:11,380
These are the same normals that have tortured us with their ignorance and defiled the name of Bob.

757
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,840
These are the same normals that have taken the most free country in the world

758
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,860
and turned it into an ever-growing bureaucrat.

759
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,880
And they've turned it into a democratic, governmental monster that feeds on taxes, committees, laws, statutes, buck-passing, and fill-in-the-blank.

760
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:34,600
Then, once the creature's rot-filled gut sprues out the digested combination of all the vices before mentioned by the lawyers and liars that created this filth, what's the result?

761
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,260
Why, the conspiracy, of course.

762
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:44,220
And this pile of stinking defecation we're supposed to kneel before and worship and serve?

763
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,380
Never!

764
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:53,580
Bob will avenge us for the years of conspiracy rule on that most dreaded of subgenius holidays, X-Day 1998.

765
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,840
Dreaded by them, but not by us.

766
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,340
Let us look at Bob's prophecy and see what the normals have in store for them, shall we?

767
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:14,480
Bob's word comes in many mysterious ways, not all of which are immediately recognized as divine in origin.

768
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,980
Indeed, since Bob transcends time, so does his word.

769
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,600
This revelation popped up in a 1938 radio drama.

770
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:32,560
In this story, the Martians, then a synonym for aliens, later to be known as X's, have landed and started to round up the normals.

771
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,540
Two of the unlucky survivors meet to discuss the future of mankind.

772
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,320
The smarter one asserts, quote,

773
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,400
I've thought it all out.

774
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,460
Right now, we're caught as we're watching.

775
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,000
And X's only has to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run.

776
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,200
But they won't keep on doing that.

777
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,800
They'll begin catching us systematic-like, keeping the best and storing us in cages and things.

778
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,820
They haven't begun on us yet. Not begun.

779
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,500
Later he goes on to say,

780
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:11,000
All those little office workers that used to live in these houses, they'll be no good.

781
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,020
They haven't any stuff in them.

782
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:17,560
They used to run, run off to work.

783
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:25,640
I have seen hundreds of them running and catching their commuter trains in the morning, afraid that they'd get canned if they didn't.

784
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,920
Running back at night, afraid that they wouldn't be in time for dinner.

785
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,420
Lives insured and a little invested in case of accidents.

786
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,020
Yea, and on Sundays, worried about the hereafter.

787
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,720
Well, the X's will be a godsend for those guys.

788
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,280
Nice roomy cages, good food, careful breeding, and no worries.

789
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:55,700
Yea, after a week or so of chasing around the fields on empty stomachs, they'll come and be glad to be caught.

790
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,580
Now this is 1938, mind you.

791
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,740
He goes on to say, finally,

792
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:06,220
That's not all. These X's are going to make pets of some of them, train them to do tricks.

793
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,460
Who knows, get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up and had to be killed.

794
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,180
Yea, and some maybe, they'll train to hunt us.

795
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,020
Yes they will. There's men who will do it gladly.

796
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,840
Well friends, how much more obvious does Bob have to be?

797
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:33,220
When he gave this brief preview of the future in 1938 on CBS, it sent millions of normals into the streets screaming for a reprieve.

798
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:41,440
They repented, they begged forgiveness, and yet, just a few days later, after Bob, Orson Welles, and the war,

799
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,380
the world's broadcast was described by the conspiracy as nothing more than a joke,

800
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:52,340
the normals went back to the conspiracy way of life as if nothing had ever happened.

801
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:58,200
They came so close to getting a second chance and mending their ways, but they blew it.

802
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:05,640
They went back to the conspiracy masters, and for their loyalty, they were genously rewarded with yet another world war.

803
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,940
There's a strange sense of poetic justice to it, isn't there, friends?

804
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:15,360
Well, they haven't seen nothing yet. Just wait till the real McCoy comes.

805
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:20,580
It's only a few miles down the road, pink boy, and like Dr. Al prescribes to his patients,

806
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,640
if you're caught in a nuclear holocaust and your skin begins to melt, don't panic.

807
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:32,580
This is perfectly normal. Yes, friends, just another normal way to die for the normals doomed to die.

808
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:39,700
What? Did I say doomed to die? I should have said lucky to die, for bliss it are the dead after X-Day arrives.

809
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:47,280
The doomed are the unlucky pink survivors who must live out their wretched existence under the cruel and merciless X-Sys.

810
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,260
Cruel to them, but not to us.

811
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,600
Not only will there be no more bowling alleys and golf courses for the pinks,

812
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,460
but there'll be no more subgenies to kick around anymore.

813
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,740
We'll be surfing the celestial stars, smoking our frock, unweaving our slack,

814
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,600
and sexing our anti-virgins like there was no tomorrow, because in space, friends, there isn't.

815
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,680
Only back on Earth.

816
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,580
Only back on Earth we'll be in Amar, and then the next day, and then the next.

817
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:19,020
It'll be an eternal hell without end, and we'll be enjoying it all in the heavens on closed-circuit TV,

818
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,900
because we won't want to miss a single revenge-filled minute.

819
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,540
Praise Bob! Amen.

820
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:34,160
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

821
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,860
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

822
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:43,660
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

823
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,100
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

824
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,720
With needles in my belly, take samples of my skin.

825
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:57,120
I don't care as long as I can live with saucer man.

826
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,740
I know that you don't take requests, but I'm a special case.

827
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,180
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

828
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,100
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

829
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,100
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

830
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,560
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

831
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,040
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

832
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:28,660
Hey, cow mutilators, let me join your crew.

833
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,980
Give me a knife, you bet your life I'll cut up cows for you.

834
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,160
I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly beast.

835
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,200
Don't know why I play that old lady, ain't one of your hays.

836
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:51,660
I'm a Abby Cowboy-Beast, on her food credit card,

837
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:51,660


838
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:51,660


839
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,280
And honey, I'm from senin'

840
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,200
And don't going

841
00:46:54,200 --> 00:47:03,620
Come on now, you tiny robot, with your little nipper claws.

842
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,140
You pale, 안� BETH LEOH

843
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:08,040
with flat and clammy paws.

844
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,200
Life is just a sucker's dream, and death is a disgrace.

845
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,520
So come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

846
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,960
Oh, take me off to space.

847
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,740
Take me off to space.

848
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:21,300
Whoo!

849
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,080
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

850
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,220
Take me off to space.

851
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,340
Take me off to space.

852
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,640
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

853
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,040
Woo.

854
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:50,440
Oh, friends, you know, oh, I should mention that was Horton Nenslow singing Take Me Off

855
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,240
to Space, that wonderful old hymn.

856
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:56,880
That's one of the hymns that we like to sing on our subgenius holidays.

857
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,760
A lovely, lovely old-time gospel hymn.

858
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,320
Yes, yes, yes.

859
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:08,320
This is Doctors for Bob in the background.

860
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,040
They do it their way.

861
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:31,000
As the mutants move, that leaps up Tibetan Tiger Man.

862
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,300
What about, uh, what about...

863
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:39,580
What about this, uh, reputed, uh, Jesus Starfleet that was, uh, supposed to have shown up?

864
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,760
As you see, they have just left the hangar deck at Lunar Central and have cleared the

865
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,180
airlocks into the colony.

866
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,400
The crowd of scientists and technicians are going wild.

867
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,540
What a space ovation.

868
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,020
Now let's feel another.

869
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:00,980
Now in celebration of this great occasion, we have planned a lunar party.

870
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:04,300
We hope all young people throughout the solar system...

871
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,640
will join us in celebration of this great day in outer space.

872
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:20,980
Bob?

873
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:27,460
Late that Saturday night before retiring, I took out the snapshot picture of the sailor

874
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:31,340
and studied it until I could close my eyes and see this man's face as though he was standing

875
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,020
in front of me.

876
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,300
Sparge and I.

877
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,440
Not having a face.

878
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,980
Yeah, that's what people say.

879
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,460
I pretty much think it's a bunch of shi...

880
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:40,660
Ugh!

881
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,020
I love you!

882
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:53,060
The flying saucers are my friends, cause they're so nice.

883
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,400
I'm gonna see them again and again.

884
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,300
Is that before or after the bob pills?

885
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:03,940
In.

886
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,960
We'll have a third sexual organ which cannot even be imagined yet.

887
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:15,920
And human beings in the future will have all 27 sexes that exist on planet Earth,

888
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,920
which will make it difficult to get laid on a Friday night

889
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:29,000
because we have to go to 27 separate singles bars in order to score an entire union.

890
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,920
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Drew Pearson.

891
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,600
We bring you this special radio television broadcast

892
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,600
in order to give you the very latest information on an amazing phenomenon,

893
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,620
the arrival of a spaceship in Washington.

894
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:50,420
The rumors of invading armies and mass destruction are based on hysteria and are absolutely false.

895
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:57,360
And you are not alone. And you are not alone.

896
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,120
Remember it.

897
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,360
The truth is true.

898
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:21,760
The UFOs are making us up. The UFOs are making us up. The UFOs are making us up.

899
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:30,080
The part of your soul which is attached to your dollar rises up with the smoke

900
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:36,960
and it is received by our interplanetary excess guardians and you will be saved.

901
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:43,580
And in some cases we don't want the money. We throw the money in toilets and flush it down.

902
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:54,500
But our intra-sewer sponge nine-inch worms receive the part of your soul which is attached to the money again

903
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,060
and you can be saved by the nine-inch worms also.

904
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:01,560
Yeah, Bob can, you need Bob following you around. Bob can see through all those Bob hands.

905
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:08,240
The nine-inch worms are the only force which can encounter the excess maggots

906
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,420
and protect humanity from the excess maggots in 1998.

907
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,740
The excess are going to leave Earth.

908
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:19,360
Oh yeah, we'll be completely free to do whatever we want.

909
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,800
They're just going to leave us alone.

910
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:27,040
But they're unmentionable, unnameable, horrible maggots.

911
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,040


912
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:33,380
Maggots will remain. We will be dogs to them in more ways than you can ever imagine.

913
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,080
Unless, unless the nine-inch worms are preserved.

914
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,620
No eight-inch worms aren't going to help you. No ten-inch, ten and a half-inch worms are going to help you.

915
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,740
Oh yeah, ten-inch worms will show you a good time.

916
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:49,680
Oh yeah, ten-inch worms will take you out on the town all night compared to those nine-inch worms.

917
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:53,640
You know, people are sitting there going excess, end of the world, 1998.

918
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,140
If they don't buy the book,

919
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:01,660
when 1998 comes and the world is a nuclear wasteland,

920
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,480
when we're all slaves or ground beef, they're going to go,

921
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,360
oh, I guess these guys weren't kidding.

922
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,640
Yeah, I should have read the stark fist a little more carefully.

923
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,440
He said while digging through nuclear holocaust,

924
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:18,720
looking at the third hand growing from his stomach.

925
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,220
Why doesn't it go away?

926
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:21,720
Oh.

927
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,560
Heliopters are what brings them down.

928
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,200
You can put it in your pipe and smoke it.

929
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:34,720
Heliopters are, this is a legend that is going to be revealed right now in media for the first time.

930
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,540
Heliopters are these quasi-mechanical, leather-clad, demonic,

931
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:44,780
they kind of look like helicopters at first glance, but they are alive and they're employed by a,

932
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:50,400
I hate to use the term minor deity, but this guy's name is Gbrogfran,

933
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,900
and he's right up there with Bob, I'm not kidding.

934
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,460
He's right up there with Odin and Arnold Palmer.

935
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:59,180
If you ever see anything that says approved by Gbrogfran, buy it.

936
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:04,340
And these heliopters are how Dr. Sir Bobby Quipman has arrived,

937
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:09,760
and oftentimes there are tons of Bob pills on these heliopters,

938
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:14,180
and special compartments that were designed for the transport of these sacred anointments.

939
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:17,620
It was the heliopters that originally brought our minds to Dobbs.

940
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,800
The rattlesnake manure.

941
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:24,460
By stench of the spirit is like bone to a million slaughtered swine.

942
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:30,460
And in these times thy planet is wreathed in foul vapors of fire.

943
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:37,300
Hold on a minute, the conspiracy has put a slight detour in front of us here, I must change lanes.

944
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:44,380
But there are other things, other evil, dark, shadowy forces at work in this solar system of ours,

945
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,960
in this galaxy, in this corner of our universe.

946
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:54,660
...Nigi by imposing his twisted will upon the trajectories of Jehovah's neutrinos.

947
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,340
...is able to deflect those trajectories.

948
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,200
Feasibility study ended.

949
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,440
Abduction of human race, infeasible.

950
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,180
Warning, warning.

951
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:14,680
Psychics applying the proper slack have discovered secret Nazi UFO bases in the Antarctic.

952
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,420
The truth that President Truman never told us.

953
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,040
Dobbs bless his boring soul.

954
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,480
They called him Wellman when he was a human.

955
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,920
Before the ground took over. Before the ground took over.

956
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:35,580
This is what I do to all your deities.

957
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:41,740
...second until they slow me down.

958
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:47,220
Therefore, there is a God. End of quote.

959
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:54,300
I said you're gonna have to get yourself in discernment here and be able to discern the spirit of God from the spirit of Hinduism.

960
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,700
I said people in Haiti, I said when the Holy Ghost hits them they think it's Buddha.

961
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,440
Because Buddha hits them like the Holy Ghost hits them.

962
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:11,860
People in America think that when the Holy Ghost hits them that it's witchcraft.

963
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,580
Yes, witchcraft throws people down.

964
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,880
They see demonic visions and the devil uses them.

965
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,360
Buddhaism and witchcraft.

966
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,200
And the powers of the pagan gods.

967
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:34,220
The powers of the pagan gods produce its lines, signs and wonders.

968
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:39,500
But I want you to know that the pagan gods and their false religions can do what they're doing in the world.

969
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:42,200
Bless God, what can we do with a true God?

970
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,900
With a true Christ? With a true Holy Ghost?

971
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,480
We ought to be able to do more than what they're doing.

972
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,020
Hallelujah.

973
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:50,400
Hallelujah.

974
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,600
How would God take the scales off your eyes?

975
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:58,400
And open your eyes to behold that the Lord's coming is at the door.

976
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:06,140
And that all that's happening in the world is getting us ready for Jesus Christ to dwell in the fullness of God in the saints.

977
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:11,420
That we will come forth with revelation and manifestation of the Holy Ghost.

978
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,460
Revealing Christ to the world.

979
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,840
That we will possess in our temples the very fullness of the spirit.

980
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,760
That we'll be filled with the spirit.

981
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,360
We'll be filled with it.

982
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,500
We'll have oil in our lamps burning.

983
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,760
That we will not stop until our lives have been complete.

984
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,360
I don't care. They can talk about me all over Brownwood and Baines and around here.

985
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:35,440
Call me anything but I'm preaching the truth.

986
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,700
They can talk about me and turn on this minister and say this ain't real.

987
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:42,580
But you let one of them hypocrites come and show where I'm wrong.

988
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,220
And take the Bible and prove that this ain't God.

989
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,420
And this ain't the word of God to the people.

990
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,000
And I'll leave tomorrow.

991
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,240
Hallelujah.

992
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,300
But I'm not leaving tomorrow.

993
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,560
You say why?

994
00:57:53,860 --> 00:58:01,940
Because there ain't nobody in the state of Texas and the state of Alabama, Florida or anywhere else can take the word of God and prove this is wrong.

995
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:02,980
They may lie.

996
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,260
They may accuse.

997
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,380
They may tell all manner of evil.

998
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,660
But they cannot touch this spirit.

999
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,500
They cannot touch this word.

1000
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,540
This is the word of the Holy Ghost.

1001
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,100
This is God's promise.

1002
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,560
This is God's word.

1003
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,760
God's truth to you.

1004
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:25,140
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

Bob, Post Office Box...

1011
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,020
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1012
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,700
The bike is evil and I don't know why.

1013
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:04,980
And then my wife, she fell down and they've had to pick her up and her leg's okay.

1014
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,080
And something, you can't get something for nothing.

1015
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,360
You know, if it ain't one thing, it's another.

1016
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,140
It.

1017
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,140
You know what I'm talking about?

1018
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:11,360
It.

1019
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:11,720
It.

1020
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:16,340
If it, if it ain't one thing, it is gonna be another.

1021
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,440
It may be coming back on that opposite reality chain.

1022
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,880
You know, the one coming back the other way?

1023
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,100
It's like a big A.

1024
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,960
It's like a big A.

1025
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,600
If it weren't for nothing, in contrast, you know, we'd be like nothing too compared to it.

1026
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,220
And you can't know nothing unless you know everything.

1027
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:33,180
But you can't know everything unless you know nothing.

1028
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,160
I mean, people say it crazy.

1029
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:40,900
They get in there and they say, but the Hades, the Hades and the unseen world and the abode of the lost.

1030
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:41,900
And they say that ain't real.

1031
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,980
And I've seen it down there on the seventh level.

1032
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,420
And I, the mystery, the mystery, the mystery.

1033
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,440
It just, it just tears us apart.

1034
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,100
The mystery.

1035
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:56,300
And if we can just say, I know, I know that everything can be fine.

1036
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,600
I know it's gonna be okay.

1037
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,960
