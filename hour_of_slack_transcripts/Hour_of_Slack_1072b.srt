1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,300
Three stained drapes.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,280
When I knew I was still in Marty's hotel room,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,200
I knew that hours had been thrown out of my life and thrown away.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,220
Then the light screamed again, and this time there were words.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,200
Big thousand-watt words that said,

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,540
Delicious dancing girls.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,840
And in between there was the creaking sound of a rocking chair.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,180
Then the rocking chair made words, too.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,000
You're not thirsty.

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,500
You don't want a drink.

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,700
You don't want a drink.

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,860
His face, it's shaking!

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,680
And his hand, he's a monster!

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,920
Run, Horst! Run!

15
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,280
You can't get away, John! You can't get away!

16
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,100
It's my horse!

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,980
Where are you?

18
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,740
The Self-Genius

19
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,120
The Self-Genius

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,860
Yes, dear friends,

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,100
and thanks to Fernanda and Andy Leamer,

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,240
as always, for our opening credits.

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,220
This is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang,

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,020
and this would be

25
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,480
our

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,280
Hour of Slack number

27
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,140
1072

28
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,600
B

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,260
And it's a

30
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,660
rerun of somebody else's

31
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,960
subgenius show.

32
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,260
Yes, the great station

33
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,820
WREK in Atlanta

34
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,140
has a weekly show

35
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,980
called Bob's Slack Time

36
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,040
Fun House.

37
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,160
Every other week is done by the great

38
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,400
Reverend Susie the Floozy.

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:27,800
And

40
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,400
every other other week

41
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,140
is done by the Lymphnode Institute.

42
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,300
And this show is a wonderful example

43
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,980
of their work.

44
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,400
Unlike me, they're not barraged by

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,060
submissions

46
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,220
from subgeniuses

47
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,420
all over the world.

48
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,860
They just collect

49
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,260
things from their immediate environment.

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,400
So they have

51
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,040
more known music

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,740
running on their show, and they

53
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,700
do, well, you'll see.

54
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,040
They put a lot of work into writing

55
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,260
their show.

56
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,420
And this particular show is a great one.

57
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,000
At the end,

58
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,600
they'll give you more information

59
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,520
on where you can get podcasts

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,920
of their show,

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,480
which is via WREK.org.

62
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,560
And also,

63
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,580
if you poke around where you get the podcast

64
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,100
for Hour of Slack,

65
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,220
you will also find

66
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,940
Bob's Slack Time Fun House, and for that matter,

67
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,200
the Puzzling Evidence Show,

68
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,020
and links to all kinds of other

69
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,280
sublimiously audio

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,140
things. And so now, friends,

71
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,080
let us join

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,340
the mighty

73
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,520
Lymphnode Institute.

74
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,100
Yetis and simpletons,

75
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,200
poison ghouls.

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,340
Tonight, we once

77
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,400
again don the stiff, sticky

78
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,040
trappings of the faux

79
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,160
medicinal arts,

80
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,100
lace our boots

81
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,040
tight, and

82
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,020
duct tape our waders to our

83
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,220
waists as we wade

84
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,780
into the postmodern

85
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,500
moral quagmire

86
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,180
of torture.

87
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,300
We will titter with glee

88
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,200
as we watch our simian

89
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
cousins attempt to retain

90
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,740
their Judeo-Christian

91
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,840
ethics as they attempt

92
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,920
to survive in this

93
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,780
meaningless world that

94
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,360
Dobbs has sold them.

95
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,080
Of course, while this may be a great deal

96
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,880
of fun, it is

97
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,640
very, very, very

98
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,920
bad news for us, yetensiny.

99
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,060
But,

100
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,760
we'll get to that

101
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,020
later.

102
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,060
No!

103
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,060
No!

104
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,340
No!

105
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:46,660


106
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,080
No!

107
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,680
No!

108
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,100
No!

109
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:51,780
No!

110
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:51,920


111
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,000
No!

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000


113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,060
No!

114
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,460
No!

115
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,520
No!

116
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:55,920
No!

117
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,220
No!

118
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:56,600
No!

119
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:56,840


120
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:56,840


121
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:56,840


122
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:56,840


123
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:56,840


124
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:56,840


125
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:56,840


126
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:56,840


127
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:56,840


128
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,120
No!

129
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,340
No!

130
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:58,760
No!

131
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:58,960
No!

132
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,240
No!

133
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,260
No!

134
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,020
I was sitting there on Sunday morning in the chief of police's office at a large table.

135
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,240
Torture.

136
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,560
He was listening to a football game.

137
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,600
Let's be up front about it.

138
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,360
A football game.

139
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,600
Torture.

140
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,700
T-O-R-T-U-R-E.

141
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,640
On the small transistor radio.

142
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,120
That's the bottom line these days.

143
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,740
And I had it very low.

144
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,620
It's replaced death.

145
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Even teenagers kill themselves.

146
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,580
These days, along with the depressed and terminally ill,

147
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,340
deaths are released from pain and anxiety and humiliation.

148
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,420
Value, reward.

149
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,140
But the threat of death just isn't enough to control people.

150
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,420
So the ante's been raised.

151
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,840
Now, it's torture.

152
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,620
And high-tech torture at that.

153
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,680
As the technocrats say, it's functional.

154
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,520
That's why everyone who's intelligent and un-anesthetized enough to care

155
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,000
has sort of put their life on hold.

156
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,860
Underneath all the defensive layers of denial

157
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,820
we're all in.

158
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,300
We're all afraid of being tortured.

159
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,380
Anguished.

160
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,380
Or homosexually gang raped or having it happen to someone we care about.

161
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,300
Screaming.

162
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,240
And we're all self-consciously living a lie.

163
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,060
And I knew what it was.

164
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,880
We're all happy Joes.

165
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,360
And I knew that this man was being tortured with.

166
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,120
How did it happen here in the land of the free, in the home of the brave?

167
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,560
Tortured with electricity.

168
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,840
I mean in some banana republic.

169
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,300
Well, it kept getting louder.

170
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,220
Some distant.

171
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,380
Past.

172
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,680
Like the Spanish Inquisition.

173
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,700
And more horrible.

174
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,960
World War II.

175
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,820
The Nazis.

176
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,740
The fanatical Japs.

177
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,040
And each time.

178
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,880
But not us Americans.

179
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,020
And each time.

180
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,400
G.I. Joe.

181
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,580
And each time.

182
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,860
Frank Sinatra.

183
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,800
And each time.

184
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,200
Jerry Lewis.

185
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,900
Autumn in New York.

186
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,440
The chief would tell me, Colonel.

187
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,460
Baseball.

188
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,700
To turn up the radio.

189
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,900
College football.

190
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,000
Glenn Miller.

191
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,000
Pretty soon.

192
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,720
Somehow it doesn't fit.

193
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:24,820
It's not.

194
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:24,820


195
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:24,820


196
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:24,820


197
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:24,820


198
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:24,820


199
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,480
It's not.

200
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,240


201
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,240


202
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,240


203
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,900
But it does.

204
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,040
Of course it does.

205
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,160
I could still hear those sounds.

206
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,720
Because it was always a facade, the image of America.

207
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,780
And now the facade has finally failed.

208
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,280
Anguish.

209
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,660
Like a burned out clutch.

210
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,580
Screaming.

211
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,220
Screaming.

212
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,560
Screaming.

213
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,160
Or a decayed tooth that breaks open.

214
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:48,760
Horrible.

215
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,120
Horrible.

216
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,580
Horrible.

217
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:49,900
Horrible.

218
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,020
They both smell bad.

219
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,480
Strange.

220
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,800
It's so bad.

221
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:54,800


222
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:54,800


223
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:54,800


224
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:54,800


225
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:54,800


226
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:54,800


227
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:54,800


228
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,500
Ominous.

229
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,480
Going back to the office, in the embassy, naturally I was speculating who that possibly

230
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,160
could have been.

231
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,500
But the motive that I had in everything that I did was to save the lives of Americans

232
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,400
who in some cases were being tortured to death.

233
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,560
For thousands.

234
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,020
For more.

235
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,080
Who are you?

236
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,260
I swear I love the Houston immigrants.

237
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,080
And I hate their horribly Paid Astкая.

238
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,040
I don't even know their name.

239
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,760
Rival pitchwriters like me are like this.

240
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:20,780
They're disgusting if you catch a glimpse of them.

241
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:20,780


242
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:20,820
Who are you anyway?

243
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,380
And I don't even know why it is you.

244
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,760
Strut pud думаю dais river, radtion urnantis, mining urnまぁn Municip镇s is highlighted

245
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:24,760


246
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:24,760


247
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:24,760


248
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:24,760


249
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,560
my family and making this ad because i want you to know

250
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:50,660
but the motive that i had and everything that i did

251
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:56,040
was to save the lives of americans who in some cases were being tortured to death

252
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,720
so

253
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:49,260
then jesus christ the son of god came to this earth lived about 30 years and totally sinned

254
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,620
for existence

255
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,740
and one would be stripped and whipped

256
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,720
and the crown of thorns crushed down until it lost her in his spell

257
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,960
feet totally dragging every cross up the hill being tortured to death

258
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,340
things just let them die it's torture to death that's what we call it today

259
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,060
for me

260
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:20,840
you

261
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:20,840


262
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,140
so

263
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,540
your

264
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,560
soul

265
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,300
I don't know.

266
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,300
I don't know.

267
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,120
I don't know.

268
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,720
And we will...

269
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,240
And we will...

270
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,780
And we will...

271
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,760
Weapons of mass destruction.

272
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,740
Yeah, good question.

273
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,620
I appreciate you asking that question.

274
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,120
And that's exactly what's going to happen shortly.

275
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,520
Rape and torture.

276
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,220
Rape and torture.

277
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,120
Rape and torture.

278
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,800
Rape and torture.

279
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,560
Rape and torture.

280
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,340
Rape and torture.

281
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,140
Rape and torture.

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,820
Rape and torture.

283
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,740
Rape and torture.

284
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:25,240
Hear or consider an application for a writ of alien detained by the United States who has been detained as an enemy combatant,

285
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:37,560
or is awaiting such to hear or consider any other action against the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of the United States,

and is awaiting such determination.

289
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,500
The title tends to use any other action as added by a person who,

290
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,900

Anything we do to that end, to that end in this effort, any activity we conduct is within the law.

391
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:38,020
We do not torture, and therefore we are working with Congress to make sure that as we go forward, we make it possible, more possible, to do our job.

392
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:48,780
We do not torture, we do not torture, we do not torture, we do not torture, we do not torture, we do not torture.

393
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,520
I think about Iraq every day.

394
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,760
Adam, I think about Iraq every day.

395
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:06,800
Every single day Adam, I think about Iraq every day.

396
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,020
Every single day.

397
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,200
Said every single day.

398
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Bett cuz, every single day.

399
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
Celebrate every single day this year.

400
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,160


401
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,340
Every single day.

402
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,280
Every single day.

403
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,320
Why don't you start a class.

404
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,880
...

405
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:21,920
Okay.

406
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,000
We do not torture.

407
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:50,520
Christianity, like most religions, seeks to suppress normal human mental function with pain and humiliation.

408
00:18:52,660 --> 00:19:00,980
Christianity is, at its core, a death cult organized around the sacrifice of their own God.

409
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:17,960
The highest grossing independent film ever made in the United States, graphically, almost pornographically, catalogs the many potential and supposed tortures of their God.

410
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,500
Torture.

411
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:33,180
Torture is a natural extension of the fears and desires of pink humanity, and furthermore, a natural extension of the beliefs of Christianity.

412
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,640
Of self-sacrifice taken too literally.

413
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:48,940
It's entirely reasonable that if one's own God was made to torture and die terribly,

414
00:19:48,940 --> 00:20:05,460
then, why not a heathen, a Mohammedan, a Buddhist, or, well, a subgenius?

415
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:13,180
You don't really believe that they are walling the Mexicans out, do you?

416
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,480
Oh, you poor, sad dead...

417
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,140
Dead, dead little monkey.

418
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:28,820
What do you think the commander in chimp meant when he spoke recently of a third religious awakening?

419
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,800
Witch burning, of course.

420
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,140
Witch burning?

421
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,980
You burning.

422
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,240
But, we've gone into all that before.

423
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:47,220
You should be well prepared for your terrible, terrible, terribly funny death.

424
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,760
I expect you to be laughing.

425
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:57,020
And so the institute is beyond asking the mere simple questions

426
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,900
as to why monkeys can't recognize their own reflection...

427
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:12,880
And why they are surprised when adherents of the State Death Cult attempt to put their real beliefs into practice.

428
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,920
One cannot read the Gospels without getting the distinction between your faith and your religion.

429
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:27,580
impression that Jesus came to die. Mark 8 31 and he began to teach them that the

430
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:33,980
Son of Man must suffer many things and they will mock him and scourge him and

431
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:41,800
spit on him and kill him. Much of the gospel narratives focus upon the death

432
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,440
of Christ and those incidents surrounding the death of Christ

433
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:54,200
sometimes called the passion narratives. Now normally scourging was a precursor

434
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:01,900
to the crucifixion and it was a brutal affair. In fact one could even die from it.

435
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:08,220
How do we as we consider ourselves civilized people, how do we react to

436
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:15,220
things like this? With horror, with sorrow and with determination it reveals the

437
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,380
face of an implacable

438
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:22,940
enemy who's willing to violate any norm of civilized behavior and it should

439
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,760
stiffen our resolve to eliminate them and it should also make us understand

440
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,600
how tough the struggle is going to be. The scourge itself was made out of wood

441
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,400
it had a wooden handle with leather throngs and each on the each end of

442
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:46,280
those leather strips was a sharp piece of bone or lead and it would

443
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,620
lash the flesh it would tear it into threads it would look like tattered

444
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:57,520
toilet paper. Our dog sometimes goes after our toilet rolls he pulls them

445
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,480
down and he tears them up and that's what it would have looked his back raked

446
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:11,720
with this scourge. Sometimes the parent made gaping wounds were of such size that

447
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,360
you could peer in and actually see the vital organ.

448
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:26,760
This body no doubt was covered with horrible bruises and cuts and wounds and don't forget

449
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:34,800
that he had been beaten black and blue prior to this. Then they began to spit on him and

450
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,520
to blindfold him and to beat him.

451
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:44,480
When I saw the prisoners, the Iraqi prisoners being captured and being blindfolded by the

452
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,280
USA Army.

453
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,260
I knew that they were being captured and being blindfolded by the USA Army. I knew that they

454
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:51,460
were being captured and being blindfolded by the USA Army. And the officers struck him with the palms of their hands.

455
00:23:51,880 --> 00:24:00,240
Well these are just a few bad apples. It was verbatim what they said about you

456
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,320
know the torture manuals and those who killed the Jesuits and the church women

457
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:12,040
and El Masotti and the list simply went on and on and that really angered me but

458
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,000
it you know that must say they're consistent in telling the lies you know.

459
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,520
People are trying to downplay the evil and the seriousness of all of this.

460
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,940
But it's obvious here when you read through what they do here they are beginning to mock

461
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:34,000
him like a cat playing with a half dead mouth. Bashing it back and forth like it were a ball

462
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:44,740
of string. It's that sadistic kind of cruelty that gets pleasure out of seeing people hurt

463
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,980
and be loved.

464
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:53,260
I really wish that someone of these right wing pundits would just let themselves be waterboarded

465
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,480
once. You know just on national TV and tell us how that feels and then they can call that not torture.

466
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:12,120
How long it went on we don't know but it must have gone on for a while. Then they struck him or kept on striking him. Kept on striking him. Kept on striking him.

467
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,180
We could read it this way they kept on spitting.

468
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:21,940
they kept on spitting spitting spitting spitting on him.

469
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:32,540
But don't we see brethren how depraved are the hearts of men. Don't we see here how depraved

470
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:40,160
are the hearts of men. Very few people in the world especially in modern Western culture

471
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,880
are willing to face who they are.

472
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,960
Well it is tough and I think we've been seeing aetyo Arabian orhigh in Western culture could

473
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:45,960


474
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:45,960


475
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:52,160
that but where do we go from here don't react in a way that makes us behave in

476
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:59,420
the way they they do most people view themselves quite positively most people

477
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:07,700
have a view of man that is quite flattering man is good or basically good

478
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:14,900
then they believe the longer we live on planet earth the better we get but how

479
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:23,780
do you explain the Jewish Holocaust how do you explain September 9 11 how do you

480
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:30,300
explain the millions of babies unborn that are aborted every how do you

481
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:37,120
explain all of the sex crimes how do you explain all of the murders how do you

482
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:43,860
explain the serial killer man does terrible things man has always done

483
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,880
terrible things

484
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:51,320
and man will always do terrible things and if you want up simply to look back

485
00:26:51,320 --> 00:27:00,440
in history and time and see how terrible man is look here abuses are inherent to

486
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:06,360
the world you cannot have a clean world you have to have raping killings torture

487
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,960
it's impossible that's his world that is the meaning of war

488
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,580
God somehow caught off guard?

489
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,040
no!

490
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,200
he sits in the heavens and laughs

491
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,800
ío

492
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,900
hey

493
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,100
No

494
00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:01,320
He couldn't speak his morgue out there C's GM

495
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,420
student

496
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,640
Haha

497
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,400
Stay

498
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,020
resist

499
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,960
You

500
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,680
Stupid Christianity is stupid.

501
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,180
Stupid.

502
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,680
I am learning to live each day.

503
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,480
It's just one at a time.

504
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,760
I'm trusting in the Lord to make it ever sublime.

505
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,080
I will not put God first in all that I do

506
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,640
by accepting his son Jesus to carry me through.

507
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,280
Jesus Christ.

508
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,740
Jesus Christ.

509
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,180
Jesus Christ.

510
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,600
Jesus Christ.

511
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:09,620


512
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:11,460
Jesus Christ.

513
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,980
Jesus Christ.

514
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,440
Jesus Christ.

515
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,260
Jesus Christ.

516
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,060
This he has promised, this he will do.

517
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,200
And for Jesus alone can make all things new.

518
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,600
I now trust in Jesus to show me the way to happiness and love throughout the day.

519
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,860
With him at my side and his love in my heart,

520
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,360
my life is beginning to have a new start.

521
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,300
Jesus Christ.

522
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,680
Jesus Christ.

523
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,140
Jesus Christ.

524
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,580
Jesus Christ.

525
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,920
Jesus Christ.

526
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,600
Jesus Christ.

527
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:05,200
Jesus Christ.

528
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,380
Jesus Christ.

529
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,600
Jesus Christ.

530
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,440
Jesus Christ.

531
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,080
Jesus Christ.

532
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,340
Jesus Christ.

533
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:11,340


534
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,820
Thank you.

535
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,140
Thank you.

536
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,540
Thank you.

537
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,340
Jesus Christ.

538
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,440
Jesus Christ.

539
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,840
Jesus Christ.

540
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,960
Rock over London.

541
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,400
Rock on Chicago.

542
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,920
The heartbeat of America.

543
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,540
That's today's Chevrolet.

544
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,380
That's today's Chevrolet.

545
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,740
Yes, with all that

546
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,340
Christianism,

547
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,380
Christian love and charity,

548
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,240
it's not hard to understand

549
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,940
why some people,

550
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,300
having been told for their entire

551
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,980
lifetimes that they were

552
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,140
born bad, and that in all

553
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,080
likelihood they will spend all

554
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,240
of eternity writhing

555
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,240
in pain, doled out by

556
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,380
a loving God.

557
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,100
Well, some of these people get a little

558
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,280
cuffed in the head.

559
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,640
And these rebels,

560
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,140
as it were,

561
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,460
adopt the binary

562
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,080
opposite.

563
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,480
No, no, not of actually

564
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,000
enjoying pleasure,

565
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,520
which is a lot harder than it sounds,

566
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,260
and incidentally, recent studies

567
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,180
indicate that this may only be

568
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,360
possible for yetis.

569
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,660
No, these poor, sad,

570
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,880
mere human apes

571
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,040
adopt the binary opposition

572
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,120
of enjoying pain.

573
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,340
If we carry

574
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,280
this thought to its illogical

575
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,980
conclusion, it suggests

576
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,200
an afterlife in Christian hell

577
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,340
of back rubs, foot rubs,

578
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,980
oral sex, that sort of thing.

579
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,300
Sadism, of course,

580
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,180
is nothing

581
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,520
without masochism.

582
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,180
And so we wind up in a world

583
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,900
of young, Baptist

584
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,820
human ashtrays and

585
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,240
lots of cutters.

586
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,920
Surely this is exactly what

587
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,300
Jesus had in mind.

588
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,720
Cut me up.

589
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,420
My mind's on fire.

590
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,980
You cannot choose between lust,

591
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,700
desire between love,

592
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,300
hate. Screw up my brain.

593
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,080
Your words mean nothing

594
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,660
and I suffer the pain.

595
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,520
Cut me up.

596
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,140
My mind's on fire.

597
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,340
You cannot choose between lust,

598
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,400
desire between love, hate.

599
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,140
Screw up my brain.

600
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,940
Your words mean nothing

601
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,460
and I suffer the pain.

602
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,080
Crucify me.

603
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,880
Why couldn't I see?

604
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,140
My blood splattered, body wanting

605
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,200
ecstasy, sex,

606
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,920
pain, pain,

607
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,380
pleasure, eternal torture

608
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,080
lasts forever.

609
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,800
Cut me up.

610
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,420
And lead me to bleed.

611
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,180
Come closer to me.

612
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,940
It's you that I need.

613
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,680
Decide what you want.

614
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,420
Give it to me.

615
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,960
My body is yearning and it's

616
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,520
agony. Penetrate me.

617
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,340
I'm invaded.

618
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,600
Your rite of pathage leaves

619
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,160
me degraded.

620
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,120
Stimulated passion I have to endure.

621
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,940
Ritual pleasure.

622
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,660
There is no cure.

623
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,100
Welcome to the torture chamber.

624
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,140
Set the sign above.

625
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,020
The entrance.

626
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
Let me know as you chase.

627
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,540
You might have him.

628
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,560
Looking like a man.

629
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,580
It's an age.

630
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,620
It's like you can sense.

631
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,320
The anguish.

632
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,280
Theater of pain has just begun.

633
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,860
Mr. Torture is pain with his whips and his chains.

634
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,580
He knows just what to say.

635
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,120
Mr. Torture.

636
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,160
It's a feeling you know.

637
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,000
Then just pick up your phone.

638
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:54,940
I want it.

639
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,760
I want more.

640
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,140
Mr. Torture.

641
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,160
Mr. Torture.

642
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,160
Southland.

643
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,460
Obvious.

644
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,140
Deserters.

645
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:08,740
Unlimited.

646
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,180
Tories.

647
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:09,820
Special bread.

648
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,640
A sinning.

649
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,220
So that there is heat to blow your mind.

650
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,940
You can catch him off his website.

651
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,660
As a legend.

652
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,620
Every week.

653
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,640
Next time a torture's move.

654
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,960
Come in your way.

655
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,960
Mr. Torture.

656
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,380
Southland.

657
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,320
To that house I've since paid.

658
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,100
He knows just what my pain.

659
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,540
Mr. Torture.

660
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,520
If you're feeling alone.

661
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,500
Then just pick up your phone.

662
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,400
I want it.

663
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,140
I want more.

664
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,600
Mr. Torture.

665
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,720
Mr. Torture.

666
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:37,940
Southland.

667
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,540
Obvious.

668
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:48,540


669
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,140
A możlible sale.

670
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,620
Closè story.

671
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,580
You better

672
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,700
think that Your The perfect

673
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:57,700


674
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:14,580
If you're feeling alone, it's just me cutting you from the running down the hall

675
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:21,120
It's the torture, it's the torture, it's the torture, it's the pain

676
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,420
Crucify me, why couldn't I see?

677
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,820
My blood splattered, body was in ecstasy

678
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:37,420
Sex, pain, pain, pleasure

679
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,660
Eternal torture lasts forever

680
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,260
Crucify me, why couldn't I see?

681
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,660
My blood splattered, body was in ecstasy

682
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,160
Sex, pain, pain, pleasure

683
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,540
Eternal torture lasts forever

684
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:25,780
You torture me with sadistic pleasure

685
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,360
It's just another memory to treasure

686
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,620
Your lust for blood, eternal pain

687
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,300
My mutilation that puts you to shame

688
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,400
You torture me with sadistic pleasure

689
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:37,400


690
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,440
Crucify me, why couldn't I see?

691
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,840
My blood splattered, body was in ecstasy

692
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,420
Sex, pain, pain, pleasure

693
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,740
Eternal torture lasts forever

694
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,280
Crucify me, why couldn't I see?

695
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,600
My blood splattered, body was in ecstasy

696
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,200
Sex, pain, pain, pleasure

697
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,520
Eternal torture lasts forever

698
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:30,340
My dogs singin', sharein' travel

699
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,080
No work number, references

700
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,840
Won't you blow it?

701
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,220
Since you built it, try to keep clean, cause the rent is due.

702
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,200
And the water keeps tapping my head.

703
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,100
The water keeps tapping my head.

704
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:58,220
Since it's never your turn, I'll speak for you.

705
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,420
Leave my hang, now, bloody brother.

706
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,360
Wearing, tearing, so I'm bare.

707
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,100
If I don't make it, what's the use?

708
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,980
The water keeps tapping my head.

709
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,100
The water keeps tapping my head.

710
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,980
Well, at least I lived through Chinese torture.

711
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,720
At least I lived through Chinese torture.

712
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,380
The water keeps tapping my head.

713
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,060
The water keeps tapping my head.

714
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,300
At least I lived through Chinese torture.

715
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,940
At least I lived through Chinese torture.

716
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,200
At least I lived through Chinese torture.

717
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,100
I lived through Chinese torture

718
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,640
Things got mixed up under the bridge

719
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,500
I put someone's head inside of a bell

720
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,400
And ring it

721
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,140
And eventually

722
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,000
They'll go insane

723
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,100
And eventually

724
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,680
They'll go insane

725
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,060
They'll go insane

726
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,600
They'll go insane

727
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:29,960
And eventually

728
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,020
You're hired!

729
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,240
You're beaten down!

730
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,520
You're irritable!

731
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,700
Your mental and physical health

732
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,780
Are suffering!

733
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,480
Is there any escape?

734
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,020
Is there any escape?

735
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,620
Stop! I'm for science!

736
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,760
Stop! I'm for science!

737
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,280
Stop! I'm for science!

00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,900
A cut up of House Resolution

755
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,860
Number 6166

756
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,820
The detainees

757
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,120
The law

758
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,160
Steve Craig manipulated our president into torture

759
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,720
Then the Jesus torture sermon

760
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,460
Which was mostly actually in context

761
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,860
An acapella version of Christianity is stupid

762
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,980
From the Negative Land album

763
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,000
It's all in your head

764
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,800
FM

765
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,060
Just like torture is all in your head

766
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:25,200
Athameh got off on eternal torture

767
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,880
Hell is a hell

768
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:33,000
Halloween performed a compressed as much as I possibly could version of Mr. Torture

769
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,360
And Johnny Society sang about Chinese torture

770
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,540
And then Negative Land again with methods of torture

771
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,360
We'll close out this evening with

772
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,540
A few relevant words

773
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:53,200
From former President General Dwight David Eisenhower

774
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,300
A man who knew about atrocity

775
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,220
And then Negative Land will

776
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,260
Do something terrible to a monkey

777
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,580
Because we don't just torture each other

778
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,200
We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century

779
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,140
That has witnessed four major wars among great nations

780
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,100
Three of these involved our own country

781
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,940
Despite these holocausts

782
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,460
America is today

783
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,960
The strongest

784
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,320
The most influential

785
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,100
And most productive nation in the world

786
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,320
Understandably proud of this preeminence

787
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,340
We yet realize

788
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:34,620
That America's leadership and prestige depend

789
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,380
Not merely upon our unmatched material progress

790
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,740
Riches and military strength

791
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,740
But on how we use our power

792
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,940
In the interest of world peace and human betterment

793
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,820
Crises there will continue to be

794
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,660
In meeting them

795
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,660
Whether foreign or domestic

796
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:56,920
Great or small

797
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,140
There is a recurring temptation

798
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,920
To feel that some spectacular and costly action

799
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,740
Could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties

800
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,640
A huge increase in newer elements of our defenses

801
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,560
Development of unrealistic programs to cure every ill in agriculture

802
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,940
A dramatic expansion in basic and applied research

803
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,940
These and many other possibilities

804
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,820
Each possibly promising in itself

805
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,620
May be suggested as the only way

806
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,020
To the road we wish to travel

807
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:37,020
But each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration

808
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,960
The need to maintain balance

809
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,100
In and among national programs

810
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:48,400
A vital element in keeping the peace is our military's balance

811
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,740
Our arms must be mighty

812
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,720
Ready for instant action

813
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,500
So that no potential aggressor

814
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,720
May be tempted to risk his own destruction

815
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,820
Our military organization today

816
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,600
Bears little relation to that known

817
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,520
Of any of my predecessors in peacetime

818
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,540
Or indeed by the fighting men of World War II

819
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,720
Or Korea

820
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,640
Until the latest of our world conflicts

821
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,340
The United States had no armaments in this country

822
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,880
American makers of plowshares could

823
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,300
With time and as required

824
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,180
Make swords as weapons

825
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,480
But we can no longer risk emergency improvisation

826
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,720
Of national defense

827
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,540
We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry

828
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,900
Of vast proportions

829
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,800
Added to this

830
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,580
Three and a half million men and women

831
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:45,880
Are directly engaged in the defense establishment

832
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,500
We annually spend on military security alone

833
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,860
More than the net income of all United States corporations

834
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,440
Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment

835
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,140
And a large arms industry

836
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,840
Is new in the American experience

837
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,420
The total influence

838
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,900
Economic, political, even spiritual

839
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,500
Is felt in every city, every state house

840
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,320
Every office of the federal government

841
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:19,380
We recognize the imperative need for this development

842
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,380
Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications

843
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,100
Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved

844
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,100
So is the very structure of our society

845
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,980
In the councils of government

846
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,080
We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence

847
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,040
Whether sought or unsought

848
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,880
By the military industrial complex

849
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,900
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists

850
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,340
And will persist

851
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,000
We must never let the weight of this combination

852
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,880
Endanger our liberties or democratic processes

853
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,720
Today the solitary inventor

854
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,800
Tinkering in his shop

855
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,180
Has been overshadowed by task forces of science

856
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,140
In laboratories and testing fields

857
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,220
In the same fashion

858
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,820
The free university of diversity

859
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,540
Historically the fountainhead of free ideas

860
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,800
And scientific discoveries

861
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,520
Has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research

862
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,160
Partly because of the huge costs involved

863
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,660
A government contract

864
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:31,600
Has become virtually a substitute

865
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,020
For intellectual curiosity

866
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,940
For every old blackboard

867
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,480
There are now hundreds of new electronic computers

868
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,140
The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars

869
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,660
By federal employment, projects, allocations

870
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,980
And the power of money as ever present

871
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,760
And is gravely to be regarded

872
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,860
Yet in holding scientific research and discovery in respect

873
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,060
As we should

874
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,680
We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger

875
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:09,000
That public policy could itself become the capital

876
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,940
Of the scientific technological elite

877
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:16,360
As we peer into society's future

878
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,980
We, you and I, and our government

879
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,260
Must avoid the impulse to live only for today

880
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:27,140
Plundering for our own ease and convenience

881
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,620
The precious resources of tomorrow

882
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,300
We cannot mortgage

883
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,940
The material assets of our grandchildren

884
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:39,540
Without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage

885
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,920
We want democracy to survive

886
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,880
For all generations to come

887
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,720
Not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow

888
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:59,160
And now once again it's time for Wildlife Tonight

889
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,700
Dr. Oslo Norway here

890
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,640
With a shocking remote from Wildlife Tonight

891
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,900
Right now we are going live to Wildlife Tonight's box office

892
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,240
At the San Francisco Zoo

893
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,740
Where Buck is going to demonstrate why there never was any Adam or Eve

894
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,900
Buck are you there?

895
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,660
Yes, thank you Oslo

896
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:27,060
This is Buck Logic with Wildlife Tonight

897
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:32,260
And where could you find more wildlife tonight than the San Francisco Zoo?

898
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,360
We're here in the zoo's new stinky monkey house

899
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,160
A generous endowment from the Simien M. Stinky Estate

900
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,200
Makers of stinky shoe stretchers

901
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,600
And here with me is Chuck

902
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,280
The night shift monkey man at the San Francisco Zoo

903
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:46,840
Is that right Chuck?

904
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,760
Yes, something like that

905
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,260
Well we appreciate you letting us in after hours to do this

906
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,460
Chuck, and if you're ready now

907
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,400
Please bring in the monkey

908
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,500
Are you sure about that? That's my last question

909
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,380
Yes, it's quite alright

910
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,400
And here he comes through the iron clad door

911
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,520
With a chimpanzee

912
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,800
We'll do it right on the table there Chuck

913
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,580
Careful, get him up against the armature

914
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,020
Tie those straps securely

915
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,360
They can take your face right off

916
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,180
He's doing the best I can

917
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:23,700
And so what we're going to do right here on Wildlife Tonight

918
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,600
Is shave all the hair off this chimp

919
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,940
From face to feet

920
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,140
Now Chuck is going to spray the restrained chimp all over

921
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,400
With Gillette's new tough guy shaving gel

922
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,780
And we're going to begin shaving this chimpanzee

923
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,640
His entire body, clean of all hair

924
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,740
And I believe this is another exclusive for Wildlife Tonight

925
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,260
And it's all in your head FM

926
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,480
Although I must confess I don't see why no one has done this before

927
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,240
And now Chuck, ow, not too fast there Chuck

928
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,260
That's really good, this is not an easy job

929
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,020
Chuck is rapidly shaving the chimp's body now

930
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,840
And there seems to be a little discomfort

931
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,500
But come on, we've all been shaved

932
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,940
It doesn't actually hurt that much

933
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,300
Now we're seeing some real skin here

934
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:24,760
We're doing this full body monkey makeover for the first time anywhere

935
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,820
Because I'll bet none of you listening out there

936
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,960
Have ever seen a shaved monkey before in your life

937
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,060
Think about it, I'll bet never before

938
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,900
And you know what, there's an important reason

939
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,520
Why you've never seen a shaved monkey before

940
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,580
And it does not include protecting the dignity of the animal

941
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,820
That's just an excuse

942
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:50,200
Nope, nope, you have never been allowed to see it

943
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,320
Because it's a shocking, almost unbearable testament

944
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,800
To our own intimate link with animal evolution

945
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,680
You know, I could lose my top over this

946
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,920
Wow, oh, chimp appears very angry

947
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,980
The chimp is strapped in a skinny position

948
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,500
To a sort of a crucifix style outfit

949
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,540
With an armature on the table

950
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,600
Trembling a little under the wriststrings

951
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,600
Be gentle, Chuck

952
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,720
I'm having a little trouble with this

953
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,840
I think I'm going to have to switch to something else here

954
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,760
And now Chuck is struggling to shave the feet and toes

955
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,440
What's his name, Chuck?

956
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,760
This is a girl, we call her Cherry

957
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,120
Cherry, wow, cute breasts

958
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,800
Be sure to get all around her private parts too

959
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,600
I want a completely shaved monkey

960
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,340
I'm done doing it

961
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,920
Wow, that makes her very angry

962
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,240
Yeah

963
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,640
She doesn't like that at all

964
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,120
Ah

965
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:53,200
Ah, you know, we're sorry we have to put this innocent chimp through this

966
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,560
But it's simply necessary to create a greater good for all of us

967
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,120
Sort of like testing cosmetics on him

968
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:06,080
Chuck is using a Jumbo Gillette Pro-Tech Tough Guy razor system on Cherry

969
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,000
And perhaps it should have been a Lady Pro-Tech

970
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,420
But it seems to be working just great anyway

971
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:15,560
From first shave to last, always a smooth shave with Gillette

972
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:21,880
And come to think of it, in Cherry's case, this probably is her first and last shave

973
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:28,720
But when this chimp is entirely shaved, everyone will see for the first time

974
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,420
Why we are truly all brothers to this sister under the skin

975
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,400
And now Chuck is finishing off her face and neck

976
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,580
Just leave a head of hair like us, that's all we need to do

977
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,440
No mustache, it's a girl

978
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,940
Great, great, that's it

979
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:47,320
And here comes the hose

980
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,560
Rinsing her all off now

981
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,680
And there

982
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,940
There you have it

983
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,160
Look at that

984
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,800
Release the straps, Chuck

985
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:04,480
Amazing

986
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,200
Creepy, but amazing

987
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,100
Turn her around, Chuck

988
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,600
Turn her around

989
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,280
Keep turning her, Chuck

990
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,520
That's it

991
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,360
She looks just like my kid

992
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,760
Now I was going to say, I realized this in rehearsal

993
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,080
Once you see a monkey's full frontal bare skin anatomy

994
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,220
Something we have never been allowed to see before

995
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,620
It's so strangely like our own bodies

996
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,060
Just different proportions in the parts

997
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,180
But all the same skeletal and facial features

998
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,540
Muscular structures

999
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,060
It's like an organic revelation

1000
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:46,840
All right, Chuck, you can remove the shaved chimp

1001
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,480
A wonderfully telling demonstration

1002
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,360
Thank you

1003
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,620
Thank you, Chuck

1004
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:53,360
And

1005
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:54,480
And

1006
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,280
Don't worry about Cherry, folks

1007
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,320
We have a little skirt and sweater for her

1008
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,380
And, uh, Cherry, here's a banana for being so good

1009
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,800
Well, what can anyone say?

1010
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,280
Seeing is truly believing

1011
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,460
A wildlife tonight revelation

1012
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,320
And for God's sakes, what more need we be?

1013
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,040
So, that's it

1014
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,740
Nature's clock is ticking

1015
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,180
Thanks to Cherry the Chimp, Chuck the Monkey Man

1016
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,560
And the Gillette Shaving Corporation

1017
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,680
Now in your face with the Pro-Tech Maximus II Jet Shave System

1018
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,460
I'm Buck Logic

1019
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,880
Now back to Oslo, Norway's brain

1020
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,040
At It's All in Your Head FM

1021
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,000
That's it?

1022
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,160
That's it for Wildlife Tonight

1023
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,860
Thank you, Buck and Chuck

1024
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,060
And good luck

1025
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,920
Wildlife Tonight is a syndicated feature of the Simian Stinky Networks

1026
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,640
Oh yeah, a slag killed my baby

1027
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,780
Oh, she culled on a slab

1028
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,920
And I know it, maybe

1029
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,000
Covered her with honey

1030
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,360
On a fire ant hill

1031
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,860
Made her drown

1032
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:13,940
Cause she don't have no gills

1033
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,340
Oh, that's that hour of slack

1034
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,400
They said they were fighting a conspiracy

1035
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,380
When they beheaded my baby on live TV

1036
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,960
Crushed her under an iron ore load

1037
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:34,240
And dumped her body on a country road

1038
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,980
And carved a water pipe for her

1039
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,440
From her little skull

1040
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:43,120
Made her blow up like an Alka-Seltzer seagull

1041
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,480
If you know what I mean there

1042
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,160
You oughta know by now

1043
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,460
That the hour of slack killed my baby

1044
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,880
Every Saturday night at midnight right here

1045
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,640
On WREK Atlanta

1046
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,020
Except that this probably isn't WREK Atlanta

1047
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,100
Unless it is

1048
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,780
We're running a show from mighty WREK

1049
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,120

1050
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,000

1051
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,060
Praise the Lymph Node Institute

1052
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:05,900
And your friends, you can get podcasts of that and Suzy the Flusy Show

1053
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,040
And the Puzzling Evidence Show

1054
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,780
And the Hour of Slack

1055
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,940
If you look at the Hour of Slack page at subgenius.com

1056
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,180
