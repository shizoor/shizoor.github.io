1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960
Welcome to the subgenius radio hour of slap.

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,040
I better try and break it.

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,160
These things can do nasty things to the brain if the pitch gets up into ultrasonics.

4
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,460
You like that?

5
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,540
No, sir.

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,360
Just keep thinking about that.

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,900
It's almost beyond human understanding.

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,460
Some fantastic invisible force converted two men into jelly.

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,480
Human.

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,520
Look, Dan.

11
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,080
Look at this.

12
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,940
Look what it's done.

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,880
The whole...

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,720
The tissue structure's eaten away.

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,800
The bone's powder.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,700
Oh, it takes care of my supper tonight.

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,580
But let's leave things of this world behind

18
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:17,640
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.

19
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,460
This is Reverend Ivan Stanger.

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,820
I'm 31 years old, friends.

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,180
Not an old man, a young man.

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,080
Not too many wrinkles on my face, but I tell you, friend,

23
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,960
the wrinkles on my old head come not from...

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,860
from worrying, but from partying.

25
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,660
There's two kinds of people.

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,540
The kind that gets wrinkles from worrying and the kind that get them from partying.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,540
Now, my gray hairs come from kicks, and I can dig it.

28
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm a hip cat.

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:48,280
I can enjoy myself, and I believe that's what the Lord God thing, Wotan, put us on this planet to do,

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,880
is to enjoy ourselves.

31
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,580
We were created.

32
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,680
Therefore, there must be a reason.

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,500
Therefore, that reason must be to have fun and get slack.

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,980
This is the logic of Bob Dove.

35
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,360
It's a job, friend, and it is inescapable.

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,080
Uh, so, you can't enjoy yourself if you're a hateful pink boy who thinks that hurting other people is enjoyable.

37
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,140
So, slack for thyself and slack for others, friends, are not interchangeable, but interconnected.

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,360
And so we find that there was a consistency in the word of Bob that was not visible before.

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:26,420
And of course, it cannot ever be visible to one who does not have the blood of the Himalayan Yeti pulsing through their veins.

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,840
Let there be slack.

41
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,240
In the beginning, God created Heavens, the Earth, Formless Darkness, Deep Spirit, Surface Waters.

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,340
God said, Light, Light, Light, Light, Light, Day.

43
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,820
God said, The Waters, The Waters, The Waters, The Waters, The Waters, Day.

44
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:55,100
God said, The Waters, The Sky, The Dry Land, Earth, The Waters, Seas, The Earth, Grass, Seed, and Fruit, Trees, Be, The Earth.

45
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,500
The Earth, Grass, Seed, Kind, Trees, Fruit, Seed, Kind, Day.

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:16,480
God said, Light, Sky, Day, Sun, Sea, Sea, Day, Day, Light, Light, Light, Light, Light, Earth, Sun, Sky, Day, Light, Light, Light, Light, Day, Day, Day, Day, Day, Day, Day, Day.

47
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:29,960
Ah, yes, friends, ah, yes, what a fine, fine show this promises to be with not only the usual weird clips and bits from all kinds of movies,

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:41,100
but binary slack by our friends such as Mr. Sister, Fernanda Nandy-Lemur, Artemia Salina, New Monet, Tesla Coil, and so many others, friends.

49
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:53,500
Also, this show will feature the Indianapolis Devival, held a few months ago in Indianapolis, Indiana by the Queegee-Bow Cartel.

50
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,360
Friends, it was like this.

51
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:10,400
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, friends and neighbors, local hicks and out-of-town rubes,

52
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,720
welcome, one and all, to the 2002 Indie-Vival.

53
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,980
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah.

54
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:28,360
I am your host, Pope Fred, and on behalf of the Queegee-Bow Cartel

55
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,360
and the good citizens of Indianapolis, Indiana, I thank you.

56
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,840
I thank you. I really do.

57
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:47,740
I mean, it takes a great and wonderful thing for each and every one of you to tear yourselves away from your mundane lives,

58
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:55,900
to come out here to buy expensive drinks, and listen to music that you could have heard on VH1,

59
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,780
or better yet, download from the internet for free.

60
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:12,680
Indeed, we have stiff competition from this very city to take away your entertainment dollar.

61
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,200
And in the interest of fairness, I will give you a bottle sample.

62
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,280
You have a chance to see the Ray Romano.

63
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,280
Yes.

64
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:35,600
TV's Ray Romano from Everybody Loves Raymond on the 26th at the Clothes Memorial Hall for a night of comedy, comedy, comedy.

65
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,940
This weekend is the last chance that you'll get to see Scooby-Doo live!

66
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,620
Hello!

67
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,560
Scooby-Doo live on stage at the Murat Theatre this weekend.

68
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,360
You came here.

69
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,740
Roll raggy and deep.

70
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,100
Sound Tribe Sector 9 is playing right now at the patio.

71
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,740
Really?

72
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,520
Really.

73
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,640
He's gone.

74
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,740
Oh, well, we got your ten bucks. Thank you.

75
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,000
Thank you very much.

76
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:18,480
And lastly, Indianapolis offers for your entertainment pleasure, John Mayer at the Murat Egyptian Room,

77
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,680
who has, and I quote,

78
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:29,480
a solid singing voice that captivates crowds and an obvious passion for creating earnest songs.

79
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
End quote.

80
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,180
Now you can't beat that.

81
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,920
No siree.

82
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:46,960
What chance, what chance does our little dog and pony show have against such a veritable cornucopia of sights, sounds, and amazement?

83
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,300
None.

84
00:06:48,300 --> 00:07:05,660
Were it not for the fact that our dog can spout hellfire rants that'll curl your nostril hairs, and our pony has been trained to do things that you can only see on the internet or bachelor parties.

85
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,220
Plus, our kids have hearts.

86
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,620
They care enough to bring this show to you.

87
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,280
Care enough to bring access to your home.

88
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,600
They're far away from Pittsburgh, if we could.

89
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,080
And we did.

90
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:33,140
St. N and Sister Hell in a Handbasket will give you more bang for your buck than any solid singing voice could muster.

91
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,240
We'll be right back.

92
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,220
One night while I was lying, looking at the sky,

93
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,540
I thought of the subgenius, is it all a lie?

94
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,820
I thought of all the books and papers that I'd read.

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,980
I thought of Arnold Palmer and his bleeding head.

96
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,360
I thought of all my brethren and rants that they'd share.

97
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,260
I thought of all these things that I'd read.

98
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,660
I thought of all these things and wondered if I cared.

99
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,880
I pondered for a while.

100
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,940
I pondered through the night.

101
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,220
By the next morning, I decided they were right.

102
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,740
We got rhyme selections in a wide array.

103
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,840
Chaine de bonbon pour vous manger.

104
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,100
Ring in the news cause I'm country mic.

105
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,280
Use a microphone like Shazam, use tight.

106
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,420
The party people scream, ring, ring, sing, ring.

107
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,620
Cause I got a remote for my beat down.

108
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,720
Ring in the news cause I'm country mic.

109
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,300
Word.

110
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,240
I felt so relieved.

111
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,240


112
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,680
It really was a rush.

113
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,020
I am so happy that I'm a subgenius.

114
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,280
Tired of playing normal and following the herd.

115
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,520
I woke the next day to go and spread the word.

116
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,700
The people that I talked to, they acted all afraid.

117
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,080
They won't even listen unless they're getting paid.

118
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,340
I really do hate them, these things of which I speak.

119
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,240
They point it and they laugh.

120
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,660
They said I was a freak.

121
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,720
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak.

122
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,740
Tick tock, socialize.

123
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,800
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes.

124
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,880
Who in the world do you want to fight?

125
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,880
It's against the system we should unite.

126
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,160
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

127
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,060
Now I sit here thinking of everything I've said.

128
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,340
I really am a Bobby.

129
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,320
My face is turning red.

130
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,220
I thought I was a Bobby.

131
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:48,640
I was finished.

132
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,640
I wondered what to do.

133
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,240
Ready to give it up.

134
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,880
I didn't have a clue.

135
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,520
Then it all came to me.

136
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,180
I really should have known.

137
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,600
There are so many like me.

138
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,280
I'm really not alone.

139
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,780
I found others like me with whom I could converse.

140
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,680
One day the subgenius will rule this universe.

141
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:26,660
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the man who sort of started this whole thing.

142
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,800
A man who's a close personal friend.

143
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,120
I love the man.

144
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,040
He's the cream of my coffee.

145
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,100
The sugar in my tea.

146
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,960
The Adam to my Costello.

147
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,100
The one, the only.

148
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,820
I...

149
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,520
I...

150
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:47,940
I...

151
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,080
David Stant!

152
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,940
I love you, Siobhan.

153
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,960
I love you too.

154
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,780
I love you.

155
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,160
You sit down and shut up!

156
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,340
Because there is something I have not heard out of you maggots and pukes yet.

157
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,520
Have I heard a god damn praise Bob?

158
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:12,940
Praise who?

159
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:12,960
Praise who?

160
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:12,960


161
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,260
Praise who?

162
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,800
too? I don't think I heard it very loud.

163
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:29,160
Ah, it's starting to sound like music. Like with a beat, it could be like praise Bob!

164
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,160
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

165
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,760
That's enough! What's wrong with you bunch of Bobbies or what? Jesus Christ. A bunch

166
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,480
of religious fanatics. Oh, friends, well I guess that will do for this sacred moment

167
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,360
I got y'all yelling a little bit.

168
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,880
Friends, welcome to the very first in all history

169
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,300
Indianapolis D-Vival.

170
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,680
Praise fucking God!

171
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,400
The conspiracy tried to keep us away from this

172
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,320
D-Vivian state, but by God we did it anyway!

173
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,500
Now friends, I suppose this may be the very first

174
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,360
subgenius D-Vival for some of you.

175
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,360
Some have come around and heard this old comedy thing

176
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,080
and some are going, I'm going to go there and make

177
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,340
sure they're as stupid as I've heard by God,

178
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,080
just so I know once and for all.

179
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,940
And when you come to a subgenius D-Vival,

180
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,020
sometimes you see these amazing displays of behavior,

181
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,660
apparent abnormal behavior, and you go,

182
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,860
what the hell does that have to do with Bob?

183
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,720
Well, it doesn't necessarily have to do with,

184
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,040
have a damn thing to do with Bob.

185
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,340
It's just a thing.

186
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,300
Because really, all Bob wants for you is slack.

187
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,940
Now listen, they get all excited about slack.

188
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,200
It's like, how many of you can tell me what slack is?

189
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,160
Indefinable.

190
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,860
There's someone with the correct definition of slack.

191
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,680
It is absolutely indefinable.

192
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,740
Those who know don't say, and those who say don't know,

193
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,100
as the Hell's Angels used to say,

194
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,660
which makes me think I probably shouldn't be saying

195
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,800
that myself anyway.

196
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,320
But I will come up and give a longer sermon later,

197
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,040
but I wanted to pump the newcomers up with just enough

198
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,520
to get you to, well, either come or get frustrated

199
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,940
and come back one more later.

200
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,600
So I'm going to give you a very quick capsule description

201
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,700
of this beautiful institution known as

202
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,080
the Church of the Sub-Goddamn-Genius.

203
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,780
There are only three things you really need to know about it.

204
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,580
And you'll have it down.

205
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,660
Bob, slack, and the conspiracy.

206
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,780
That sounds like I hardly need to explain anything.

207
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,880
But, oh, and the one rule.

208
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,340
There is, you know, most religions rely on an incredible number of rules.

209
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,300
Damn, man, I'm so distracted.

210
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,340
I'm trying to read his death sign down there.

211
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,800
There's so many religions and things offer you

212
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,440
all these complicated sets of rules.

213
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,420
And we do too.

214
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,540
But they're all understood to be complete bullshit.

215
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Except for the one really serious fucking goddamn rule

216
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,920
in the Church of the, pardon my language, sub-genius.

217
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,200
That one simple, obvious rule is, of course,

218
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,820
fucking if they can't take a joke.

219
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,760
And you know the damn weird thing about it is,

220
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,000
there's, every now and then you stumble upon something

221
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,260
that sounds like hilarious bullshit in the Church of the sub-genius

222
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,120
and yet somehow happens to be true.

223
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,880
Well, most of them aren't always true.

224
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,280
But, fuck them if they can't take a joke is something you can live by.

225
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,940
And in fact, it is the only philosophy you can actually live by.

226
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,300
Now, to give you a capsule summation about this man, Bob,

227
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,820
whose face you've seen in clouds tattooed on hookers' butts.

228
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,980
And sometimes some of you have it so embedded in your mind,

229
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,100
embedded on the retinas of your eyes,

230
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,500
that even when you blink and close your eyes,

231
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,700
you see the negative version of his hideous, grinning visage.

232
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,600
I find it hideous because he's my boss.

233
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,180
Okay, I know most of you like Bob.

234
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,040
I do too.

235
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,280
But imagine, you know, having to...

236
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,700
I have no words for the guy!

237
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,140
Anyway, Bob Dobbs, back in 1953, founded this Church of the sub-genius

238
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,300
when he discovered, well actually he didn't discover,

239
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,420
but he was, he was, uh,

240
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,920
he had this sort of a vision, my friends.

241
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,200
He was trying to make his own amateur TV set,

242
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,320
he stepped in a puddle of water,

243
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,400
and God himself grabbed Bob up and yanked him up by the scruff of the neck

244
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,800
and told him that there was a conspiracy of normal people

245
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,680
who had been robbing away the slack of the weirdos and abnormals

246
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,640
through, since the dawn of time.

247
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,200
Well, this wasn't actually God saying this,

248
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,540
it was this alien space monster that has...

249
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,760
managed to convince most people it dealt with that it was God over the centuries.

250
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,320
So what's the difference?

251
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,380
Uh, and so, when Bob, and also this creature,

252
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,440
this monster from outer space who is worshipped as God and Jesus by many people,

253
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,920
was, uh, it told Bob that the world was going to end July 5th, 1998,

254
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,420
by which fact we know that obviously that date has not come,

255
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,240
the conspiracy is a lot bigger than we thought,

256
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,980
and they started messing with the calendars,

257
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,100
and God only knows how long ago.

258
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,000
Anyway, friends, he said,

259
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,600
Bob, I want you to get off your ass and start yourself a do-it-yourself religion.

260
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,120
I give you a church to found,

261
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,100
not upon a rock, but upon a sandy shifting beach of hypocrisy, friend.

262
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,920
Beautiful, beloved hypocrisy,

263
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,440
for where would any religion worth its salt be without its fair measure of hypocrisy?

264
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,780
It's the only thing that he says, God.

265
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,000
Praise fucking God!

266
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,420
And Bob was a salesman before he was a prophet.

267
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,320
He would, in religion, he decided it was the best product of all,

268
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,820
because there was no manufacturing costs at all.

269
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,460
And so he created this disorganized do-it-yourself religion,

270
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,960
a non-organization for non-joiners,

271
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,300
which is why there's only about a hundred people in here, not a hundred thousand.

272
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,160
People who are, what, the sinners, the mutants, the misfits,

273
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,220
the disbelievers, or those who will believe anything.

274
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,000
Those are the ones.

275
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,760
Those are the ones.

276
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,460
I'm looking for people who like to draw flies, friend.

277
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,940
Now, here's the thing.

278
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,920
All subgeniuses are, in fact, completely different from each other.

279
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,600
If you look around this room, you'll go,

280
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,500
well, some of them are sort of what I expected,

281
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,320
but, ew, that's a, my fellow subgenius, you know.

282
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,580
Well, friends, it's true.

283
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,760
The only thing that any of us have in common,

284
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,940
is that we have nothing at all in common with the conspiracy of the normal people.

285
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,740
Now, sometimes I used to feather that and go,

286
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,900
but now the normal people, they can't help it,

287
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,140
because they, ah, who cares?

288
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,500
Kill them all anyway!

289
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,000
Let goddess sort them out!

290
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,920
I'm sorry, I had a pagan's t-shirt.

291
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,900
I thought that was real funny.

292
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,580
Let goddess sort them out.

293
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,900
Goddess is peaceful, not like God.

294
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,540
God's all mean,

295
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,460
and got a beard,

296
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,880
and lightning bolts, right?

297
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,500
And goddess is round, and earth-like, and sweet.

298
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,160
Well, then we'll let God kill them all,

299
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,240
and let goddess sort them out.

300
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,880
And those who goddess sees,

301
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,540
have paid their $30 dues in the church of the subgenius.

302
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,480
That's when that goddess rips her goddess mask off,

303
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,980
and says, well, I was actually one of those hideous alien monsters.

304
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,060
And you're safe,

305
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,360
and you're going to be given the powers of God,

306
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,900
and we'll take you up just like all that new age crap,

307
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,300
except,

308
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,120
one of those religions has to be right, right?

309
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,040
Right!

310
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,920
What if it's this one?

311
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,140
Why not?

312
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,140
It's so damn crazy, it just might work, you know?

313
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,440
How I, because, you know, they say you can't beat city hall.

314
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,360
Ah, well, the same person certainly can't,

315
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,000
because it's only the crazy people, folks,

316
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,600
who are nutty enough to actually stand up and try to beat city hall.

317
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,860
And you never know,

318
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,520
sometimes it actually happens,

319
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,440
it seems too good to be true, though,

320
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,620
and that's why some people don't believe in Bob.

321
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,640
They think, oh, well, I understand, I get the joke.

322
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,080
I'm not a sub-subgenius.

323
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,300
I get that, I understand,

324
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,320
you guys are just making fun of those religious nuts, you know?

325
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,520
You're just pretending to be religious nuts.

326
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:54,800
No!

327
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,900
We are not pretending to be religious nuts, my friend.

328
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,500
You have not seen a religious fanatic lose his mind.

329
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,220
And lose all perspective until you've seen a sub-genius in slack.

330
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,680
A sub-genius in slack does not think logically.

331
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,040
He does not think about, well, does it make sense?

332
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,140
Bob said in 1998 the aliens were going to kill the normals and save the,

333
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,360
and it didn't happen in 1998.

334
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,100
That doesn't make any sense.

335
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,620
Well, fine, how far would Jesus have gotten

336
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,200
if the Christians worried about making sense?

337
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,280
How much, you know, how well would,

338
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,420
how much did yesterday's newspaper sell

339
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,960
if those newspaper editors worried about the news making sense?

340
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,200
My God, that's what this is.

341
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,820
People look at the church as sub-genius.

342
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,160
They go, well, that's a sub-genius.

343
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,220
That just means people just below a genius.

344
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,760
I don't know if that means they're stuck up or self-effacing or what.

345
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,900
Friends, it doesn't have anything to do with intelligence.

346
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,320
It has to do with sense, common sense,

347
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:03,460
sense of humor and the all-important dollars and cents.

348
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,200
Oh, yes.

349
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,460
The harvest.

350
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,060
And friends, Bob did not become the high epop

351
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,360
to the church of sub-genius because he's some smart guy.

352
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,760
I mean, look at him.

353
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,760
He's not smart.

354
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,320
He's got what it counts.

355
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,420
Luck, not brains.

356
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,700
How far did brains ever get you on a hot date?

357
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,640
Nowhere.

358
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,400
Even looks don't matter that much nowadays.

359
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,620
It's luck, luck being in the right place at the right time.

360
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,220
As Bob said, I'd rather be lucky than good any day.

361
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,680
And as a result, Bob has a power.

362
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,680
The power that other, that popes don't have.

363
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,880
The power to fail.

364
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,120
And yet, every time he fucks up, he makes a million bucks.

365
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,320
That's because he walks the path, the true path,

366
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,040
the path of least resistance, my friends.

367
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,320
He surfs that path of least resistance.

368
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,460
And now, Bob has the superpower of luck,

369
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,860
but he does not have the great godlike power

370
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,440
that some better connected deities have.

371
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,980
He cannot forgive your sins.

372
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,740
Because he doesn't give a shit

373
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,520
about your piddly little pathetic sins.

374
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,900
He doesn't think you get anything worth going to him,

375
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,780
going to the trouble of having to forgive him.

376
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,780
He won't forgive your sins because he came here

377
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,680
to excuse your sins.

378
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,420
He brought not forgiveness, but an excuse.

379
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,920
You don't use Bob as a crutch.

380
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,420
You let Bob use you.

381
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,980
You, as a crutch.

382
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,400
You do not ask Bob,

383
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,040
Hey Bob, what do you smoke in your pipe?

384
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,620
You throw yourself in that pipe.

385
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,080
You let Bob smoke you.

386
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,180
You let Bob light you up, suck you through that pipe,

387
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,720
into his lungs, and you become part of Bob's brain.

388
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,340
You're in Bob's brain.

389
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,580
You're one of those thoughts that might be the thought

390
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,160
that made him get a little wood that minute.

391
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,480
Or it might be the thought that made him want to leave town.

392
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,500
Ugh.

393
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,060
Anyway, friends, that's the good news.

394
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,320
Then there's the conspiracy.

395
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,760
Tomorrow is Hitler's birthday, isn't it?

396
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,740
Speaking of World War II.

397
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,500
Oh my God.

398
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,120
At 420, dude.

399
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh man, 420.

400
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,620
You know what that means?

401
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,920
420, 420.

402
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,580
We're in 420 right now.

403
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,280
Jesus, I'm getting out of this skyscraper, man.

404
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,260
Wait, tomorrow's Hitler's birthday?

405
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,280
Yeah, at 420.

406
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,860
Damn, I'd like to get him a card.

407
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,380
Wake Branch Davidian's death day.

408
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,480
I don't think my Nazi uniform fits.

409
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,040
It fits me anymore.

410
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,500
I was a lot more trim back in my Bundeswehr days.

411
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,220
Well, see, you know, I'll be seeing our friend Father Joe Mama

412
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,980
on Hitler's birthday.

413
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:39,840
Really?

414
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,060
About Saturday night at the Indianapolis debacle.

415
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,380
Papa Joe's coming up to Indianapolis, huh?

416
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:45,880
Yeah.

417
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,760
The Divide. Wow.

418
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,360
Yes.

419
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,000
What could be more fun than strapping Papa Joe Mama

420
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,560
in one of his Nazi suits down and taking out one of those

421
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,960
testicle crushers and just crushing them in front of everybody?

422
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,660
That's not a Nazi suit, and those aren't testicles, Dave.

423
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,380
Oh, okay, okay.

424
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,640
I get them confused.

425
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,220
It's a satirical commentary on fascism.

426
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,360
Okay, but do you...

427
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,420
And a damn fine-looking subgenius torture commandant outfit.

428
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,600
Yeah, but you should not grow pubic hairs on a commandant's outfit.

429
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,240
Those aren't swastikas.

430
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,720
They're three-legged pipe stickers.

431
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,940
Oh, I thought they were, okay.

432
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,760
I confused them for pubic hairs once again.

433
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,160
Yeah, people are so ignorant.

434
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,280
They see Nazis everywhere.

435
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,300
That's a Russian uniform that the other folks have.

436
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,180
They wear it often.

437
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,840
Why would people see Nazis anywhere?

438
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,200
Are they having some kind of mass psychosis or something?

439
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:32,820
What makes them...

440
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,660
What would make them hallucinate Nazis everywhere?

441
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,340
I mean, Nazis, what?

442
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,620
Well, that's what I grew up...

443
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,100
When I was growing up in the 30s and 40s,

444
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,000
that was what I was taught to fear and hate were Germans and Japanese.

445
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,880
Now, of course, I'm shining your shoes.

446
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,440
It's weird how that's happened.

447
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,020


448
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,660
You see, now that you are tired of being part of these cigarette butts

449
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,620
and these electrodes are not doing too much for you,

450
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,220
but you will tell us about some more keys,

451
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,420
and you will tell us very soon.

452
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,500
Oh, oh, oh, what's a marquee?

453
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,900
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

454
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,100
No, you're not.

455
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,720
You're not in the slightest sorry, Dave.

456
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,180
I'm in the schley bell time.

457
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,720
You say that all the time.

458
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,180
That's a codependency thing.

459
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,000
I'm still in Christmas, man.

460
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,600
I'm never leaving.

461
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,080
That's it.

462
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,840
I'm in Christmas.

463
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,400
You vomit on Christmas.

464
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,680
Yeah, but sure.

465
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,420
It's one of the few times of the year I get to vomit freely

466
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,540
and be complimented in the colors and also my shades.

467
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,740
Oh, art.

468
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,420
I hate modern art.

469
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,220
So do I, but, you know, the lizard people demand it.

470
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,080
Yeah, yeah.

471
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,180
Nazis and lizard people everywhere.

472
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,620
Ah, yes.

473
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,480
From south of the border, the Nazis and the lizard people.

474
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,420
Our brave boys are in Texas ready to attack Mexico City.

475
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,140
And to annoy the serpent enemies, the evil empire of the Canadian creatures.

476
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,060
And hello us.

477
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,280
Look at them.

478
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,040
They have no knowledge of the past, no ambition for the future.

479
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,900
So lucky.

480
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,160
Why would you say something like that?

481
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,780
Can you even imagine what it's like to remember everything?

482
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,780
But it was worth it to have thousands of people all over America believe,

483
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,900
because they heard Papa Joe Long say it on NPR,

484
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,420
that the Church of the Subgenius,

485
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,220
had indeed been behind the Columbine.

486
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,980
One lie, friends, can be worth a million bucks.

487
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,800
As Bob said, there's no such thing as no PR.

488
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:46,300
And friends, I love just how evil and sick and incorrect politically is that man,

489
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,980
Father Joe Babbage!

490
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:56,940
Away!

491
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,560
Away!

492
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,300
Away!

493
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,400
The sermon for the John Luther now commenced.

494
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,920
Yes, dear friends, it is true.

495
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,360
The truth hurts.

496
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,460
And our good friends, I think it's fair to say,

497
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,720
if there's a single ally in the world that we love more than any other,

498
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,080
it's probably got to be Al-Qaeda.

499
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,460
And they have a say in that.

500
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,600
So get over there, friends, and it goes like this.

501
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:34,680
He who tells the truth should keep one foot in the stirrup.

502
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,580
Now, whether he's talking about gynecology, I don't know.

503
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,620
On to the sermon.

504
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,320
The sermon tonight is entitled,

505
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,680
Reparations.

506
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,400
Because there has been a recent movement afoot,

507
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,580
to sue various companies, if not the government itself,

508
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,960
for slavery in the 1800s and before.

509
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,140
Lawyers figure if they could work around the statute of limitations

510
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,800
and collect four billion for the internment of World War II Japanese,

511
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,920
and then sidestep the century-old Swiss banking laws

512
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,220
to squeeze out another four billion for Jews who lost their account numbers,

513
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:21,880
then some schmuck, some schmuck should be able to extract a few billion more,

514
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,640
from the powers that be,

515
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,480
for the kidnapping, rape, and enslavement of various African ancestors.

516
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,480
So tonight, we're going to examine this controversial topic,

517
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:40,400
and consider the true ramifications in regard to this man, Bob.

518
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,580
Of course, any subgenius worth their salt can tell you that slavery,

519
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,660
the ramifications for slavery,

520
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,640
are,

521
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,440
to put it charitably,

522
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,860
a joke.

523
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,840
It's nothing more than a smokescreen

524
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,700
to camouflage the conspiracies,

525
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,960
ongoing enslavement of the masses today.

526
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,400
Do I hear praise Bob?

527
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,760
Praise Bob!

528
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,160
Attention all humans,

529
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,500
attention all humans,

530
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,840
stand by for an important revelation.

531
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,060
People,

532
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,160
do not go to work on a volunteer basis.

533
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,200
They are compelled to go,

534
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,180
and show up hat in hand,

535
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,340
begging to serve their conspiracy masters,

536
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,040
or else they starve in the streets.

537
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,720
Oh sure,

538
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,480
you can call it employment,

539
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,380
and come up with all sorts of fancy, soundy names like,

540
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,600
free enterprise, and capitalism if you want.

541
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,140
But make no mistake about it,

542
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,980
it's still slavery, plain and simple.

543
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,040
Only now, my friends,

544
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,540
they've repackaged it,

545
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,200
and put it in a new container.

546
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,740
Now it's wage slavery.

547
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,040
Yes, because the conspiracy eventually realized

548
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,800
a very important little point.

549
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,880
They realized that it's always cheaper to rent,

550
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,040
than it is to own.

551
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,020
And we all know how they love to cut costs.

552
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,080
Do I hear praise Bob?

553
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,420
Praise Bob!

554
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,460
Praise Bob indeed!

555
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,740
The old time slaves, my friends,

556
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,880
they were never paid for their work.

557
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,660
Oh, that difference is true.

558
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,820
But they were also given,

559
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,940
the bare necessities of life so that they could survive.

560
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,560
Food, clothing, shelter.

561
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,700
Wage slaves, however,

562
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,020
they're given little pieces of bread,

563
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,520
and paper,

564
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,300
which they're told are quite valuable,

565
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,680
but which the conspiracy in fact,

566
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,940
mass produces like toilet paper.

567
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,820
Then, those same workers are expected to turn around

568
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,900
and fork over much of that same little pieces of paper,

569
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,460
so that they can buy the same necessities

570
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,960
that they used to be given for free.

571
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,580
Oh.

572
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:15,280
Plus, they're also expected to give another 20 or 30% for taxes.

573
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,160
For what?

574
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,120
To the conspiracy in order to control their lives!

575
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:19,740
Yeah!

576
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,860
And if anyone refuses to pay the conspiracy's tax,

577
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,860
what happens?

578
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,300
It's off to the big house!

579
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,400
The house of pain!

580
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,780
Free enterprise indeed!

581
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,560
But now,

582
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,120
now there's always a certain percentage,

583
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,000
and we all know them too well, don't they?

584
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,420
They're made to be celebrities.

585
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,380
We're supposed to respect these certain workers

586
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,100
that work for the slave masses so much,

587
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,580
that they earn extra pieces of paper.

588
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:52,020
They're allowed to retire and stop working

589
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,960
to serve as motivational examples for the rest of society!

590
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,080
If we work really, really hard,

591
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:05,780
then we also, we also might be able to retire.

592
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,640
And, we're told, if we follow the rules,

593
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,440
be just like them.

594
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,400
Better yet,

595
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,580
if we really make it,

596
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,960
oh, and this part's great, friends,

597
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,400
if we really make it,

598
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,900
we'll be able to rent our own slaves!

599
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,660
That's right!

600
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,620
Then we'll be just like Pinky!

601
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,860
We'll be able to afford our own servants!

602
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,320
Incredible, but so, so true.

603
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,660
Yet, you see, friends,

604
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,240
the sad fact is

605
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,880
that money doesn't really matter.

606
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,380
Possessions doesn't really matter.

607
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,060
The only thing in life that really matters

608
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,620
is life itself.

609
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,020
We're all given only so much of it,

610
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,100
and the moment it's gone,

611
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,220
we die.

612
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,300
And no more free minutes.

613
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,440
The conspiracy,

614
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,500
the conspiracy knows us

615
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,380
and can't stand the realization

616
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,020
that they were given the same amount of time

617
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,880
as the rest of us.

618
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,800
So what did they do?

619
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,160
They immediately set out and devised new ways

620
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,400
in order to capture, take away,

621
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,960
and control all the free time of others!

622
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,560
Yes, my dear friends,

623
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,860
that is how slavery began.

624
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,040
And they started to use it

625
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,540
so that they could get more goods and services

626
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,860
at the expense of others,

627
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,500
the so-called servant class.

628
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,960
Oh, a little problem occurred, though.

629
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,500
Over time, they started to realize

630
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,000
that slavery was more expensive

631
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,940
than it might otherwise be,

632
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,160
so they devised this new

633
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,680
rent-a-slave concept.

634
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,620
And it also had an added benefit.

635
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,740
There were no more escapees.

636
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,480
Remember that?

637
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,580
A few people might run away.

638
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,800
This way, with rent-a-slaves,

639
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,820
if they disappear,

640
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,420
another one quickly shows up

641
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,620
to take their place.

642
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,620
In fact, they'll even compete

643
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,420
for their privilege!

644
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,500
Incredible!

645
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,140
And yet that's the beauty of their system.

646
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,920
It's a much more easier

647
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,200
and efficient way to do it, isn't it?

648
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,040
And best of all,

649
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,620
the slaves don't even realize

650
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,320
they are being controlled.

651
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,420
Oh, how that must have seemed

652
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,540
like the days of Camelot to the Khan,

653
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,700
the golden age of domination and power!

654
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,040
But then something terrible happened,

655
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,720
my friends.

656
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,640
A leader appeared

657
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,500
who demanded in a thundering voice

658
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,840
to let my people go!

659
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,060
His name wasn't Moses,

660
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,580
although he spoke with the authority

661
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,600
of Jehovah One.

662
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,120
His name wasn't Harriet Tubman,

663
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,480
although he ran an underground railroad

664
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,460
to freedom.

665
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,940
No, sir, his name was, is, and shall ever be

666
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,480
J.R. Bob Dobbs!

667
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,520
And he won't rest until the very last

668
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,700
of genius is free.

669
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,260
Will you give me a praise, Bob?

670
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,280
Praise Bob!

671
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,860
Now, if the African Americans,

672
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,040
wish to legitimize slavery

673
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,020
by accepting a monetary payment

674
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:14,640
for the past,

675
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,740
that's their business.

676
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,140
Then the Khan will print up

677
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,640
more pieces of paper,

678
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,560
hand it over, and brag,

679
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,760
well, then, now that closes

680
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,680
the books on slavery,

681
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,400
we said we were sorry

682
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,000
and promised never to do it again.

683
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:28,880
Weak, weak.

684
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,620
So, uh, stop complaining

685
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,800
and get on back to work.

686
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,280
Now, if that's not bad enough,

687
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:36,980
my friends,

688
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,840
there are some pink conspiracy hoaxes

689
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,360
who have even gone so far as to say

690
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,860
that the blacks should be thankful for slavery.

691
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,620
They joke amongst themselves

692
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,860
that the lucky ones were captured,

693
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,780
domesticated,

694
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,080
and transported to a civilized nation

695
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,320
that offers plenty of social prog-

696
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,340
programs like five years,

697
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,360
five and higher long years of welfare.

698
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,940
Oh, aren't they so fortunate.

699
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,020
And if they were back in Africa,

700
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,000
they sneer,

701
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,180
the Negro might be starving

702
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,360
or swatting flies,

703
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,840
or waiting to contract an egg,

704
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,220
or a pig's eggs.

705
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,620
Oh, but now he just follows the rules,

706
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,400
kiss plenty of pink little butt,

707
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,440
and doesn't cause any trouble.

708
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,380
He'll get a warm place to sleep

709
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,160
and a loose pair of shoes.

710
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,720
The arrogance.

711
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,560
The outrage.

712
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,220
Oh, how the conspiracy

713
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,580
can even dare to think such things.

714
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,560
That should be all the proof that we need

715
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,420
that you cannot compromise with the con.

716
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,140
No, sir, these aren't rational,

717
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,920
these aren't rational beings.

718
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,760
They're monsters,

719
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,320
and they only understand one thing,

720
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,260
one thing,

721
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,220
and that's brute force.

722
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,380
Bob Dobbs knows this better than anyone else.

723
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,920
Yes, my friends,

724
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,720
and he's going to make sure

725
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,720
that he doesn't settle for such a cheap cop-out.

726
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,760
No, sir,

727
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,720
the subgenius race will not accept

728
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,940
a settlement for the past

729
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,360
or the present.

730
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,520
We refuse.

731
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,960
A presidential apology.

732
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,740
And we will not accept

733
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,960
the pink,

734
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,040
oh, we're so sorry, pink guilt platitudes.

735
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,980
We can't toss out words,

736
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,660
and they won't be permitted to just say,

737
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,780
oh, we're sorry, and throw money our way,

738
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,560
and then claim to be paid in full.

739
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,180
No, sir.

740
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,320
We demand payment

741
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,480
in a more precious commodity,

742
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,820
one that they could relate to, perhaps.

743
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,900
For every lifetime,

744
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,140
we expect one to be forfeited,

745
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,140
plus interest.

746
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,960
Now, I'm not saying whether that means

747
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,140
the conspiracy slave masters and their overseers

748
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,140
must be euthanized,

749
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,940
or made slaves themselves our next day.

750
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,600
That is, after all,

751
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,040
a question that evangelicals and Holocausters

752
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,220
are still trying to sort out.

753
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,540
But I will say this,

754
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,660
all subgeniuses agree on this one premise,

755
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,240
and that is this.

756
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,500
We will never,

757
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,840
ever forgive and forget.

758
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,860
Do I hear a praise, Bob?

759
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,380
Praise Bob!

760
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,420
Praise Bob, indeed.

761
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,040
The conspiracy is not the only one

762
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,080
who can hire certain bill collectors.

763
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,140
Bob Dobbs is bringing the entire fleet

764
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,500
of them here to Earth on X-Day,

765
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,420
and on that fateful day, my friends,

766
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,660
at 7 a.m.,

767
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,100
he's going to unleash the entire force

768
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,320
on the conspiracy.

769
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,460
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

770
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,520
Yes, the Pink's will then know

771
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,040
the true meaning of Bob's pipe

772
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,860
as they struggle and scramble to pay the piper.

773
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,960
We, on the other hand,

774
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,480
will finally have our chance

775
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,800
to truthfully look towards the heavens

776
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,160
and sing in unison,

777
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,260
Free at last! Free at last!

778
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,620
Praise Bob, almighty Lord! Free at last!

779
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,780
Hear this word of Bob!

780
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,360
Praise Bob, indeed!

781
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,640
Praise Bob!

782
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,780
Thank you, Bob!

783
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,000
Thank you, Bob!

784
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:28,060
Yes, I am a Bobby.

785
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,160
I don't care if it's true.

786
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,380
Yes, I am a Bobby.

787
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,380
There's nothing you can do.

788
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,760
I don't care if you like me.

789
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,700
It means nothing to me.

790
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,340
Bobbies are here to stay

791
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,900
and someday you will see.

792
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,140
I've set my 30 bucks.

793
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,320
I've got my minister's card.

794
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,560
I'm a dupe-paid member

795
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,640
and it wasn't all that hard.

796
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,900
I'll set my own ministry

797
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,860
and it will be the first.

798
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
Bobbies are not so bad.

799
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,220
We really are not cursed.

800
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,540
Subgenius.

801
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,700
Subgenius.

802
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:05,860
Subgenius.

803
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:07,980
Subgenius.

804
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,380
Subgenius.

805
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,980
So now you know my story.

806
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,040
There's nothing I left out.

807
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,160
I try to tell the truth

808
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,180
of what it's all about.

809
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,540
Yes, I am a Bobby.

810
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,500
I'm proud to say it's so.

811
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,840
Yes, I am a Bobby

812
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,940
and a Slack-billed dynamo.

813
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,160
I am a true Yeti.

814
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,160
And yes, it makes me proud.

815
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,860
I am a subgenius

816
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,400
and I'll say it out loud.

817
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,560
I don't care much for pink

818
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,720
and the things that they say.

819
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,400
The Church of the Subgenius

820
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,020
will soon have its day.

821
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,900
Did you really think

822
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,300
we would give you two acts

823
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,500
and walk away with your ten dollars?

824
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,620
Yes!

825
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,260
No!

826
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,060
No, my friends!

827
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,480
The answer is no!

828
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,160
We have much, much more!

829
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,000
While any church

830
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,080
would go for the easy buck,

831
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,340
we are entrepreneurs.

832
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,060
And we are nothing

833
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,780
if not a value church.

834
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,000
While other churches

835
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,880
preach family values

836
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,680
and Christian values,

837
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,620
we give you one dollar's

838
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,580
worth of entertainment for one dollar.

839
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,380
One dollar's worth

840
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,340
of religion for one dollar.

841
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,380
And triple your money

842
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,180
back if you're not eternal!

843
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,360
Praise Bob!

844
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,000
Praise Bob!

845
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:38,180


846
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
Praise Bob!

847
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,100
Coming up,

848
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,820
to whet your appetite,

849
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,740
DJ Selyau,

850
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,340
K.K.A. Stylio,

851
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,400
will be spinning

852
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,680
the wax fantastic

853
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,360
in a barrage of collage

854
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,560
and thumbing his nose

855
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,000
at such convention

856
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,400
as copyright laws

857
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,740
and good taste.

858
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,100
Now, I've only listened

859
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,700
to about 40 seconds

860
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,920
of his material,

861
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,620
and my ears bled,

862
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,120
my bowels voided,

863
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,620
and I could taste colors!

864
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,500
Now, if that isn't

865
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,660
product endorsement,

866
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,780
I don't know what is.

867
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,040
Selling aå

868
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,380
on campaigns

869
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,260
on the telephone. First I'm gonna

870
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,500
catch her when she's home alone.

871
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,900
And then I'm gonna call her on the telephone.

872
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
Who you gonna call?

873
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,020
First I'm gonna catch her when she's home alone.

874
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,480
And then I'm gonna call her on the telephone.

875
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,160
I just called

876
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,200
to say

877
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:21,980
Boo!

878
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,840
I'm gonna scare you.

879
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,140
Boo! Nanny poo.

880
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,420
Babbity boo.

881
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,140
Beepity bobbity boo.

882
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,560
Babbity boo.

883
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,260
Beepity bobbity boo.

884
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:35,860
Cause you're a bugaboo.

885
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:36,720
A bugaboo.

886
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,120
Cause you're a bugaboo.

887
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:38,980
A bugaboo.

888
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,680
A bugaboo.

889
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,020
A bugaboo.

890
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,180
First I'm gonna take a couple balls of slime

891
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,780
and sneak them in her shoes and wash her wine.

892
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,380
Ew!

893
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,320
Slime, she'll say.

894
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,420
Peek-a-boo.

895
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,660
Peek-a-boo.

896
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,880
Peek-a-boo.

897
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,280
Ha ha ha.

898
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,300
Ha ha ha ha.

899
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,080
Ha ha ha ha.

900
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,980
Peek-a-boo.

901
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,660
Peek-a-boo.

902
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,980
Peek-a-boo.

903
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:11,800
Peek-a-boo.

904
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,320
Peek-a-boo.

905
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,500
Things that make you go

906
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:14,720
Boo!

907
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,200
Say this, are they booing me?

908
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,340
No, they're saying boo-erns.

909
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,620
Boo-erns.

910
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,900
Then I'm gonna take a couple pieces of cheese

911
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,460
and clip them to her shirt and the socks on her knees.

912
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:27,980
Ew!

913
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,360
Slime, she'll say.

914
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,000
Bray.

915
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,220
Then I'm gonna open up a cage door.

916
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,680
I'm gonna break my rustic cage.

917
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,040
And all the mice out there'll pour.

918
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,040
Three guy mice.

919
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,560
Three guy mice.

920
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,720
Me and you and the dog thing.

921
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,060
Boo-hoo, hoo-hoo.

922
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,540
Boo-hoo, hoo-hoo.

923
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,860
Boo-hoo, hoo-hoo.

924
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,840
Oh-ho.

925
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,640
Oh-ho.

926
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,160
And then she's gonna run around and...

927
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:01,460
Sir!

928
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:01,780
Spear-cockles.

929
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,260
Yelling.

930
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:02,680
Bear!

931
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,720
Healthy! Healthy! ILIEN!

932
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,180
Healthy! Healthy!

933
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:06,880
And beefberry Susie!

934
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:08,480
amo

935
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,240
Beep boop

936
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:09,380
...

937
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,760
And off it goes,

938
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,100
yo this good rock boop

939
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:14,100


940
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:14,100


941
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:14,140
y

942
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:14,140


943
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:14,620
y

944
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,340
boy

945
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:18,340


946
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:18,340


947
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,920
But like a romco ad, there's much, much more.

948
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,020
Yes, indeed.

949
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,120
We have live mummification tonight.

950
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,820
Live mummification tonight.

951
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,320
They're being mummified.

952
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,820
You don't see that every day.

953
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,700
Today, Crimson, Maine will delight your senses

954
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,520
with a performance that is both titillating and educating.

955
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,560
Serving the Indianapolis area since 1997,

956
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,420
Crimson, Maine has been pierced, lashed, bloodied, suspended,

957
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,780
gagged, bound, and burned more times than I can count.

958
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:07,880
All right!

959
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,920
Winston Churchill once said,

960
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,780
Winston Churchill once said,

961
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:22,400
I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.

962
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,580
You'll have your blood soon enough.

963
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,980
You have your sweat right now, as you can plainly see.

964
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,340
And we will toil for you.

965
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,260
Oh, how we will toil for you.

966
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,120
Not just we humble preachers here on stage,

967
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:44,040
but our bartenders over there, our cleaning staff wherever.

968
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,280
Oh, we will toil.

969
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:46,800
We will toil.

970
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:46,800


971
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:46,800


972
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:46,800


973
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,500
Such toil I cannot imagine.

974
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:56,400
As for tears, we shall see here at the 2002 Indie Vival.

975
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:01,680
And now, DJ Sully out and Crimson, Maine!

976
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:02,540
Woo!

977
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:03,440
Woo!

978
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,360
Woo!

979
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,580
Woo!

980
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,260
Woo!

981
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:08,640
Woo!

982
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:08,640


983
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:08,880
Woo!

984
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,320
Woo!

985
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:09,800
Woo!

986
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,460
Woo!

987
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:10,460


988
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:10,460


989
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:10,580
Woo!

990
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:10,820
Woo!

991
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,040
Woo!

992
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,220
Woo!

993
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:15,500
Woo!

994
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,180
Woo!

995
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:17,180


996
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:17,180


997
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:17,180


998
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:17,180


999
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,620
Please help us.

1000
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,460
We're stuck.

1001
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,700
Don't worry, just relax.

1002
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,000
I'll get you out of this gunk.

1003
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,440
Come on.

1004
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,940
You can have him.

1005
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:28,940
Thanks.

1006
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,240
OK.

1007
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,140
Let's make a break for it.

1008
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,720
We're almost there.

1009
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,860
Oh, no!

1010
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,560
Ahhh!

1011
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:41,420
Ah!

1012
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:41,420


1013
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:41,440


1014
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:27,520
Thank you, Commander. But hold the party, Vince. Because we haven't seen the last of the Clever.

1015
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,780
They are full of...

1016
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:01,900
Slack!

1017
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,900
Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, Slack.

1018
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,340
Yeah, that's why we're all here, ladies and gentlemen.

1019
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,940
We're here for Slack. We're here for Bob.

1020
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,300
Let's hear it for Bob!

1021
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,680
Praise Bob!

1022
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,000
I love you, trained monkeys. You're great. You're wonderful. I love you guys.

1023
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:22,820
All right.

1024
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,580
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, Jacob.

1025
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:28,760
Nannies are breaking.

1026
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,220
All the coffees are cooking and there's bread and bacon.

1027
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,320
Roll out, cowboy.

1028
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,820
I thought somebody was actually in the room screaming at me.

1029
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:40,580
While she's hot, they're all throwing her out and spitting the skillet.

1030
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,060
Let it go, Jacob.

1031
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:46,660
If I can't whoop it, I'll go...

1032
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:47,780
Damn!

1033
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:52,240
Me and Gaggy Gag and the rest of the boys were sitting around the campfire one time

1034
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:58,460
and Cookie noticed that the third guy from the left was an oversized mutant pig

1035
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:03,120
and his sunglasses had melted all over that juicy old pork fat belly.

1036
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,940
Well, we decided to make some...

1037
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,340
I was born full-grown with nine rows of jaw teeth and a whole board for more.

1038
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,740
They were spurs on my feet and a rawhide quirt in my hand.

1039
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:28,600
And when they opens the chute, I come out a-riding a panther and a-roping longhorn whales.

1040
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,720
I've rolled everything with hair on it.

1041
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,540
And I've rolled a few things that was too tough to grow any hair.

1042
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:41,140
I've rolled bull moose on the prod, she-grizzlies, and long bolts of lightning.

1043
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,940
Mountain lions are my playmates.

1044
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:48,800
And when I feel cold and lonesome, I sleep some of the dinner rattlesnakes

1045
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,140
because they always makes me nice and warm.

1046
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,160
To keep alive, I eat stick dynamite and cactus.

1047
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,800
The Grand Canyon ain't nothing but my bean hole.

1048
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,120
When I get thirsty, I drink cyanide cut with alkali.

1049
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,820
When I go to sleep, I pillow my head on the Bighorn Mountains.

1050
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,860
I lay in boots in Colorado.

1051
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,800
And my hat in Montana.

1052
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,900
I can stretch out my arms, clean out from the crazy woman fork,

1053
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,200
plumb over to the upper Gray Bull River.

1054
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,820
My bed tarp covers half of Texas and all of old Mexico.

1055
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,420
But there's one thing for sure and certain.

1056
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:35,540
And if you boys wants to know, I'll tell you that I'm still a long way short of being the daddy of them all.

1057
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,880
Because he's full-grown.

1058
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,840
And as any man that really knows can see,

1059
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:39,840


1060
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,900
well, boys, I ain't nothing but a daddy of them all.

1061
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,280
Oh, suckle my triceratops.

1062
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:50,100
He could have stopped with, I could train tumors with my one good eye,

1063
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,920
and I'd pee to Colorado River.

1064
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,380
But instead, he had to go on for six hours.

1065
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,120
Hey, that's the way you do it.

1066
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,620
That's a bragging song, huh?

1067
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,700
I mean, a bragging pole?

1068
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,020
Man.

1069
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,560
This is the story of Good King Stang.

1070
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,820
I'm not going to go on with that one.

1071
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:06,320
Why not?

1072
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,080
You'd be some big bragging.

1073
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,440
We ain't past midnight.

1074
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:08,880
Oh, yeah.

1075
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,740
We're not past midnight.

1076
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,840
We ain't past midnight in some parts of the world yet.

1077
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:20,080
But first, friends, I shall tell you the story of Good King Stang,

1078
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:26,560
whose queen was renowned as the finest poontang.

1079
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:33,140
All across the land, 10,000 miles around,

1080
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,900
none matched the beauty of the babe with the crown.

1081
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,680
Now, among those who admire,

1082
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:47,400
the bounteous Princess Wee was one lowlife bastard they called Chris Lee.

1083
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:54,560
Chris Lee thought to diddle the fang that he knew good and well belonged to King Stang.

1084
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:04,240
Now, we've seen fuckheads, assholes, shitheads, and turds, geeks, glorks, ninnies, and nerds.

1085
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:09,820
But the sorriest morphidite you ever did see was that chive-ass beaker.

1086
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:17,940
This guy hated being sexed and the perfect street boy he had before見て-l Saucey®,

1087
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,380
you make aaalso.

1088
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:24,880
Just look at his mouth should be clean

1089
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,060
from long hair and looks too drunk for some point in me life.

1090
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:25,060


1091
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:25,060


1092
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:25,060


1093
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:25,060


1094
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:25,540
a man of gold in theologie.

1095
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,420
This nobody calidad Wee.

1096
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,220
since he'd asked his face to take all he's but the word,

1097
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:29,860
never even, qardicased.

1098
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:30,980
put a man like I currently bring and understand,

1099
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:35,140
and now, I am just as angry.

1100
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,560
Well, if you make her look like Walmart,

1101
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,980
she'll say to you what she'd have had to tell her dad,

1102
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,220
under a pair of glasses,

1103
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:39,220


1104
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:39,720
I've gone a dance harder.

1105
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,940
First he'd have Lee tied to a cigarro cactus steak.

1106
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:49,260
Then in a giant microwave oven, Chris Lee's ass he would bake.

1107
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,540
In Lee's rump, Stan would roast a corn on the cob.

1108
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,500
He'd serve some to me, but he'd butter some for Bob.

1109
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:05,340
But even at the trial, Chris Lee showed such sass

1110
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:10,820
that he vulgarly winked at me as if to make a coarse pass.

1111
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:17,600
Seeing this made Stan so furiously mad, it almost blew out the one royal knack.

1112
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,640
And the kingdom heard Stan yell,

1113
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,880
That Chris Lee will pay or shut up like hell.

1114
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:30,960
His lily-white ass I will churn like butter

1115
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,680
until, at polite apology, I do hear him utter.

1116
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:38,840
So untie his feet and untie his hand,

1117
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:42,180
because I'm going to whip that motherfucker man to man.

1118
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,880
Friends, they fought like devils and not like men.

1119
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:52,080
They gouged and they bit and they kicked.

1120
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:57,440
But then something dreadful happened before the battle was done

1121
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,940
that left all the kingdom and even King Stan stunned.

1122
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,180
For while they fought each other,

1123
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,320
into the war,

1124
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,140
the setting sun,

1125
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,680
that fine princess we,

1126
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,880
off with Dr. Philo Drummond,

1127
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,680
had run!

1128
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,420
Friends, I should give a little tip of the hat.

1129
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,680
It's great. Rudy Raymore,

1130
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,080
Dolomite, who inspired that.

1131
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:26,700
Dolomite!

1132
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,820
I hate you.

1133
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:35,680
I love you.

1134
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,520
I want non-digital cameras.

1135
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:42,780
I want a lot of money, so I can have a digital camera and a scanner and everything.

1136
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,500
I have so many ideas and not enough cash!

1137
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,940
I think every simulist has said that.

1138
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,540
I'd do something like that.

1139
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:18,560
Ah, yes, friends, the Indie Vival on April 20th, 4-20-2002.

1140
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:24,400
At the very beginning of this show, we heard some KPFA puzzling, evident, strange mix,

1141
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,820
and of course some ESO swamp radio with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Professor Chaz Smith in it.

1142
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:36,480
But mostly we heard Pope Fred, Papa Joe Mama, St. Ann and Helena Handbasket,

1143
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:42,580
and St. Dalio or Stalio or DJ Selly Out.

1144
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:50,060
And here are some contact addresses or URLs, actually, on the Internet for Stalio.

1145
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:56,240
Check out badtaste.gabber.org.

1146
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,740
That's badtaste, one word.

1147
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:10,920
G-A-B-B-E-R.org for his Tuesday night radio show or his website is geocities.com.

1148
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:21,160
That's geocities.com slash Soho slash 9024.

1149
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:28,620
Queejibo put that whole Indie Vival together and they do the greatest subgenius magazine

1150
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:29,620
printed.

1151
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:33,840
It's a great magazine, which you can get by mail and you can get information about that

1152
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:46,740
from Queejibo, which is spelled, and this is part of a website address, Queejibo, Q-U-I-J-I-B-O.

1153
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:54,740
Q-U-I-J-I-B-O, Queejibo.walkingdead.net.

1154
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,860
Walkingdead.net.

1155
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,300
And for a postal address.

1156
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,400
Write to Queejibo at, got that pencil ready?

1157
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:06,620
18 West Main Street, Apartment X.

1158
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:15,000
I've been to that apartment on 18 West Main Street in Greenfield, Indiana.

1159
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:22,940
Greenfield, I-N-4-6-1-4-0.

1160
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,620
And St. Ann and Helena Handbasket can be CD-able at www.

1161
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,900
www.minitrue.org.

1162
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:37,980
And Minitrue is spelled M-I-N-I-T-R-U, no E.

1163
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,540
Minitrue.org.

1164
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,460
And this in the background is the great Frank Marino.

1165
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:53,540
Friends, you can reach the Church of the Subgenius at www.subgenius.com or write to Bob for free

1166
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:59,140

Oh.

1172
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,180
Oh.

1173
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:26,020
Oh.

1174
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:27,380


1175
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:27,460
Oh.

1176
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,320
Oh.

1177
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1178
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1179
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1180
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1181
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1182
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1183
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1184
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1185
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1186
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1187
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1188
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1189
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1190
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1191
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1192
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1193
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1194
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1195
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1196
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1197
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1198
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1199
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:29,760


1200
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:30,420
Oh.

1201
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:30,460


1202
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,100
Oh.

1203
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,340
Oh.

1204
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:31,540


1205
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:31,680
