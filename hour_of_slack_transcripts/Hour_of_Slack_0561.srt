1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,780
Test, test, test, test. How do the channels balance out?

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,640
How do the channels, channels balance out?

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,020
How's the channel balancing, balancing, balancing, balancing, balancing out?

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,460
This is gonna be the crazy show.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,480
Do I seem edgy?

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,200
A little.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,080
You know, I quit smoking about a week ago, and, uh...

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,580
Yeah, me too.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,740
It's been like boring a wild hare of ass.

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,180
I mean, I can't do anything right. It's just, uh...

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,880
Look, let me just chill out.

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,520
I know what you mean.

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,840
We'll relax. You put up 500,000, I put up 500,000.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,880
We're partners.

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:46,940
That's it, buddy.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,860
We're all locked in.

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,300
Locked in. Let's... All right.

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,660
500, of course, I'll sign it right now.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,200
Five.

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,640
Uh, we expecting someone?

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,180
Oh, yeah.

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,740
That's Bobby.

23
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,560
Bobby.

24
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,940
Oh, no.

25
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,940
It ain't Bobby.

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,100
It's the tobacco demon.

27
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,820
Tobacco demon.

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,660
And it's designed to get you off nicotine for good.

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,720
That's a good deal, right?

30
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,740
It worked for me.

31
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,300
Yeah.

32
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,400
Go for it.

33
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,220
Now, let's get back to the celebration.

34
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:21,900
Ah!

35
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,960
If justice...

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,200
And for only this Swift in the real world.

37
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,420
Bob, little Ivan has been issuing your dirty book.

38
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,700
You rotten ratfeet bitch!

39
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,580
I'll get even!

40
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,100
That's my Boyle.

41
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,980
All firm and tumescent and ready to pop!

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,780
I'll get even with you too!

43
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,320
Dad!

44
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,860
You pipe-smokin', talkin' head!

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:49,680
Hey!

46
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:51,700
Bob.

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,480
Bob.

48
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,220
Bob.

49
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,880
Bob.

50
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,940
Yes.

51
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,200
I can be a Bob.

52
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,600
And in this moment...

53
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,640
Think about it.

54
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,260
What have we got to lose?

55
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,680
A standard operating procedure.

56
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,320
If you're going to do this, you're going to do it our way.

57
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,800
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

58
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,140
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

59
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,840
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

60
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,240
is specially designed only to be played on radio station.

61
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,940
Shut up!

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,800
Oh, okay, well, you see, this guy's getting excited,

63
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,900
and they write all the jokes for us, and then we just do the show, that's all.

64
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,620
Whose idea was this anyway?

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,680
It's not really a live show.

66
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,120
Do you think these callers are talking to somebody?

67
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,280
This is all composed of random bits of information

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,880
selected by electronic computer.

69
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,500
No one is here.

70
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,680
No one is here.

71
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,360
Go back to sleep or ask about Theme World.

72
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,840
The top part was discovered,

73
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,620
and it led stairway after stairway

74
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,020
down into the bowels of the earth,

75
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,580
the mummified form of the original Tower of Bob

76
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,440
that the Theme World attraction is based on.

77
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,640
Here is your host,

78
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,340
Reverend Ivan Sands.

79
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,180
The sexiest man on earth.

80
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,380
A young Adonis

81
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,140
who's irresistible to women.

82
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,360
I can't wait a moment longer.

83
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,980
I've got to have sex with you.

84
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,680
The facilities are now enormous.

85
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,940
This is where the young composer

86
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,720
feeds a fragment of it

87
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,600
into several types of music.

88
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,380
I'm going to turn on the tape recorders

89
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,680
and gradually...

90
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,420
Gradually go stark raving mad.

91
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,560
Oh, yes.

92
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,680
But ain't that what you love

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,380
about the church anyway, huh?

94
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,500
Yes, well, that's the best thing about subgenius

95
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,560
is it digests and spits out

96
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,820
the best of the old religions

97
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,520
and turns them into something

98
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,160
totally unpalatable for all of us.

99
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,600
If you were here, you'd be a man.

100
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,880
If you were here, we'd be dancing now, so...

101
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,980
On this footage, you can see the

102
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,680
pretendivision.

103
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,120
Pretendivision.

104
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,920
Yes, it's a three-dimensional image here.

105
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,580
Do you get the cable, or are you just getting this on the radio?

106
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,780
Just on the radio.

107
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,440
Oh, well, go turn on your television set

108
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,400
if you want to see the picture.

109
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,360
Channel B-O-B.

110
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,620
No TV.

111
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,600
No TV.

112
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,620
No TV.

113
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,460
Well, this is a special set you get.

114
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,840
You are a subgenius, aren't you?

115
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,000
You are a subgenius, aren't you?

116
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,920
You're a subgenius, aren't you?

117
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,220
You're a subgenius, aren't you?

118
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,140
You're a subgenius, aren't you?

119
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,580
You're a subgenius, aren't you?

120
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:51,680
You're a subgenius, aren't you?

121
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,400
This is tape number two in the Word Audio album

122
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,860
Life on the Edge.

123
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,820
Mike Trout continues with the abridged reading

124
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,100
of this best-selling book by Dr. James Dobson.

125
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,180
Stage five is called Hand to Shoulder,

126
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,980
which is slightly more personal than the holding of hands.

127
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,440
It reflects a buddy type of relationship

128
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,220
where the partners are still side by side

129
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,720
rather than facing each other.

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,480
At this stage of intimacy,

131
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,140
a hand to the shoulder indicates

132
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,260
more of a friendship than an expression of commitment.

133
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,280
Stage six is Hand to Waist.

134
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,000
This position is clearly more romantic

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,500
than any of the prior stages.

136
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,800
Casual friends don't stand

137
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,640
and embrace each other in that way.

138
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,800
It's just one more stop along the way

139
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,280
to a deeper, more intimate relationship.

140
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,440
Stage seven is called Face to Face.

141
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,720
This level of contact involves

142
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,680
gazing into one another's eyes,

143
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,320
hugging and kissing.

144
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,980
If the previous stages have not been rushed,

145
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,220
it has meaning beyond anything that's gone before.

146
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,460
Typically, it's a reflection of sexual desire

147
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,900
and romantic feelings between the partners.

148
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,780
Of course, many people engage in face-to-face activity

149
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,320
that's merely frivolous and titillating.

150
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,280
So, let's hear it for them.

151
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,140
In the audience,

152
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,180
they're not Memories,

153
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,200
so they can't be

154
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,780
linked to reality

155
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,980
orìnhit,

156
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,300
except

157
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:40,300


158
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:40,300


159
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,800
they may not be wide open.

160
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,700
It's possible that the feelings

161
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,040
do Yuan Ming

162
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,300
contribute to the performance of the second stage.

163
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,720
He will treat you so kindly

164
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,320
Till I

165
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,660
Till I will have you

166
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,900
To your heart

167
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,520
Yeah

168
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,340
You hear that feedback?

169
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,440
That's what my teeth feel like

170
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,360
From nicotine withdrawal

171
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,380
Still, it's been a month

172
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,300
So who needs a support group?

173
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,160
It's a patch

174
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,500
You stick it on your skin

175
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,080
We might as well have to take a class on how to breathe

176
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,780
How to breathe is Mr. Yamato's group down the hall

177
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,100
You'll be in that one later

178
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,860
But this comes first because Nicoderm CQ

179
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,880
Isn't as simple as a plastic bandage

180
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,660
You have to use it the right way

181
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,880
Or it won't work the way it's designed to

182
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,300
Hey, this is kid stuff

183
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,760
You'll sweat it out alone

184
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,140
With few if any friends by your side

185
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,660
Friends that haven't betrayed you yet

186
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,100
While you wait for whatever it is

187
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,620
That's supposed to happen to happen

188
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,140
You'll sweat it out alone

189
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,140


190
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,540
A passive, angry pawn

191
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,320
Consumed in nostalgic sadness

192
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,280
Surrounded by a world that does not care

193
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,820
Where there's nothing to look forward to

194
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,180
Except death

195
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,480
Hey, well, yeah

196
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,000
Screw that death stuff anyway

197
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,280
That's what I say

198
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,140
I just, I got so sick and tired of it

199
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,220
I'm tired of wanting to die

200
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,460
It was about to kill me

201
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,360
It was about to kill me

202
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,440
Now, where's my devices here?

203
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,600
But friends, everything is okay now

204
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,380
Yes, everything's fine

205
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,760
I found some new Hendrix bootlegs

206
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,980
I've got the Osric tentacles tape in the background here

207
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,140
And the weather has changed a lot

208
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,460
It's become, uh, it's actually snowing outside right now

209
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,280
I'm gonna quit doing the show in a minute

210
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,360
And go out and watch the snow, you know

211
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,580
Because when it snows in Dallas, Texas

212
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,560
Where I am

213
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,480
You see some spectacular stupidity out there

214
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,540
Me included, it's great

215
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,380
But, uh, oh, and the Tarzan's radio station here

216
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,720
Smells a whole, whole lot different

217
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,140
Than it did when I was in the army

218
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,820
And, and, and altogether

219
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,580
It is a truly, it is a new year, my friends

220
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,580
Usually when, when New Year's

221
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,360
Now, I know by the time you hear this tape

222
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,500
It'll be a couple of weeks after

223
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,260
But I'm doing it right after New Year's

224
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,540
And it usually doesn't, you know

225
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,680
It doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me

226
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,620
It's just a human dating system

227
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,640
But this time it did, friends

228
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,340
This time it was quite different

229
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,340
Because, because my friends

230
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,800
This is

231
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,860
A special year for our planet

232
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,680
This is the last year

233
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,280
On which there will be

234
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,360
A July 6th

235
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,360
This is the last year

236
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,520
That will host an August

237
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,100
There will never be another September

238
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,600
After 1997's, dear friends

239
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,020
And 1997 will bring

240
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,480
The last Christmas

241
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,740
And for that matter

242
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,880
The final New Year's Eve party

243
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,080
And you know, there's some possibilities

244
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,060
For that

245
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,960
There's kind of like a

246
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,020
Interim halfway

247
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,100
X-Day .5

248
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,760
So, next, next New Year's, friends

249
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,520
There will be

250
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,620
We will have a

251
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,940
Another X-Day drill

252
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,080
Anyway, thus, friends

253
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,640
It is the Dobbs-bound duty

254
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,840
Yes, I say duty

255
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,900
Of every subgenius

256
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,480
To celebrate wildly

257
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,820
Every day

258
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,040
After July 5th, 1997

259
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,000
Because

260
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,920
Every day

261
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,360
From that point on

262
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,920
Shall be the last

263
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
Of that day

264
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,540
Yes

265
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,920
It has been

266
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,520
A rough transition over to the new way, friends

267
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,280
Because, let me tell you something

268
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,460
It's a wonderful life

269
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,600
When you realize you're nuts

270
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,160
When you realize you're crazy

271
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,180
And things weren't near as bad as you thought

272
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,120
And this week I'm saying

273
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,400
Thank God for depression

274
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,040
I have a story to tell, my friends

275
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,940
Just at the last minute

276
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,620
This angel came to me

277
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,800
I was about ready to end it all

278
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,080
Yes, I was just going to close down the show

279
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,520
But this angel came to me

280
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,200
And showed me what the world would be like

281
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,300
If I'd never been born

282
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,500
My worst enemy was the dictator

283
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,580
The false Bob was his mouthpiece

284
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,860
Masquerading as Bob

285
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,100
The Bobby that you hate the most

286
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,920
The stupidest subgenius you've ever seen

287
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,640
Was your

288
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,200
I mean, well, stupid isn't a crime in our church

289
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,420
But, you know the

290
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,640
You know what I mean

291
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,520
That was your boss

292
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,760
My wife had been divorced seven times

293
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,140
All my

294
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,600
Dr. Philo Drummond was a drug addict

295
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,180
A homeless heroin addict

296
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,360
And all my other buddies

297
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,820
Had all died in Vietnam

298
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,080
All because I had never been born

299
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,500
Among all the subgeniuses

300
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,600
Only Janeer's world was the same

301
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,740
No, actually, friends, I'm just kidding

302
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,280
But, yeah, a couple of days ago

303
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,240
Somebody said something to me

304
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,460
In the middle of my screaming

305
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,680
They said, to tell the truth, Stan

306
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,380
You actually sound like you're crazy

307
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,840
Right now, like you lost your mind

308
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,000
Oh, dear friends

309
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,780
And you know what?

310
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,660
That was that week

311
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,860
That was the first thing I'd heard

312
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,620
Or considered in days

313
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,360
That actually made any sense

314
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,640
That I might be insane

315
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,080
Seemed sane

316
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,940
Because

317
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,920
I hate to get

318
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,560
I couldn't even do a show last week

319
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,100
They don't know, man

320
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,060
You don't know

321
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,360
Nobody knows

322
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,180
I quit smoking about

323
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,960
Well, it's been more than a month now

324
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,160
You know, I'm not going to do a show

325
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,180
Oh, I was hitting the wrong volume pot there

326
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,160
Yes, friends, I quit smoking

327
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,340
That ain't easy

328
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,220
Because we're talking

329
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,720
It was like cutting my arm off

330
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,120
My own arm off with a dull saw

331
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,140
Still is

332
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,380
I have one of the meanest, most vicious

333
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,420
Deeply entrenched, death-wished cigarette habits

334
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,020
That you will ever hear of

335
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,800
Now, I haven't touched a smoke

336
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Haven't cheated a bit

337
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,660
But I'll tell you, friends

338
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,640
As bad as the third day is

339
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,800
The third week

340
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,160
Is the third week

341
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,980
Is a thousand times worse

342
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,480
Because physical twitching and hating

343
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,420
The cellular need

344
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,080
That you can get your hands on

345
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,700
And grapple with fair and square

346
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,480
Oh, that's over

347
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,540
Yes, that's over

348
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,300
The demons

349
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,520
The tobacco demons

350
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,120
In fact, they want you to be

351
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,020
Supremely confident

352
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,160
Oh, they want you to say

353
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,880
Oh, that was easy

354
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,920
Oh, yeah, that was easy

355
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,940
Because then they can pull out their big guns

356
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,800
The psychological approach

357
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,000
And I'll tell you something, man

358
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,920
The tobacco demons are smarter

359
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,620
Than you are, sir, ma'am

360
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,280
Because they still control your unconscious mind

361
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,200
You can clean them out of the forebrain easy enough

362
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,040
But since when could any subgenius

363
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,040
Actually rule over its own subconscious

364
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,480
Using that weak lever of the forebrain?

365
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:34,660
Hmm?

366
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,760
Well, actually, you can

367
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,500
And I've done it

368
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,540
And I'll do it again, probably

369
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,520
But it's hard

370
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,800
It's hard as hell, friends

371
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,260
Because that old subconscious

372
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,860
Is tons smarter than what you're using

373
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,420
To listen to this show with

374
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,660
And it can figure out answers to problems

375
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,660
You never work out by trying

376
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,860
And by the same token

377
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,800
It can work up bizarre

378
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,700
Imaginary scenarios

379
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,520
To justify anything

380
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,500
And trick your forebrain

381
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,340
Into acting upon those

382
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,420
And the tobacco demons

383
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,860
Will move you up to phase three

384
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,220
And let you forget the cigarettes completely

385
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,940
Oh, yeah, but you're so messed up

386
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,560
And obsessed over something else

387
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,140
That you start to feel like

388
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,800
Nobody could be expected

389
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,860
Not to smoke under such unfair duress

390
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,620
I'm gonna get off of this

391
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,560
I may go back to my confessions

392
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
In a little while, friends

393
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,640
But what I'm trying to say is

394
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,640
Warning

395
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,640
Non-smoking can be hazardous

396
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,380
To your mental health

397
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,520
And may endanger the physical health

398
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,640
Of others

399
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,000
If you break a habit

400
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,220
Just be careful that

401
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,900
That's all you end up breaking

402
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,140
And you know the fact that I can even pursue

403
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,600
Such a string of logic

404
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,220
Indicates that my brain cells

405
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,720
Are probably functioning better now

406
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,460
Getting more oxygen

407
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,100
But to what end?

408
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,920
To what end, I ask you?

409
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,020
Infinite pointless philosophies

410
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,760
Rules and formulas

411
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,720
Ranting and so forth

412
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

413
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,040
I must not think

414
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,840
That's it

415
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
Must not think

416
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,180
Now is not a good time

417
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,420
For me to think

418
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,420
I think

419
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,980
Because I'll think I've figured anything out

420
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,840
No, no, no, no, sir

421
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,860
I'm out of that trap

422
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,700
No, sir, ma'am

423
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,820
I'm gonna do just what seems doable

424
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
That's all I'm gonna do

425
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,060
I'm gonna ignore all that type A

426
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,220
Coffee achiever urge

427
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,360
I yearn for more hours in a day

428
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,280
But nay, nay

429
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,600
I will stop

430
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,820
Praying for you

431
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,740
For more hours in a day

432
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,740
I will merely accept

433
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,020
That I'll just have to spend

434
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,480
Four times as many days instead

435
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,640
Because what's the hurry?

436
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,480
What's the big rush?

437
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,180
What if you got to lose a little time, maybe?

438
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,060
Hell, I quit smoking

439
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,440
By the time I'm 60

440
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,800
It'll be as if I never smoked

441
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,840
Sixty

442
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,080
But that means I'll live forever

443
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,920
If you don't smoke

444
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,120
Then you'll live forever, right?

445
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,320
But why am I worrying about this?

446
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,540
Why am I worrying?

447
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,060
Why do I even fret about it?

448
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,520
I keep...

449
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:19,820
What?

450
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,600
They're X Day

451
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,340
Did we forget X Day?

452
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,480
The end of the world?

453
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,680
When they destr...

454
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:24,980
The...

455
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,880
It's cool

456
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,200
It's cool

457
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,480
Monkey madness is all around

458
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,820
Turtles flying off the ground

459
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,660
Screaming monkeys will kill your sleeping fits

460
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,920
Hi there, Mr. Golden Honeydew

461
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,180
Or should I say, Captain Poultry?

462
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,760
Ha!

463
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,600
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

464
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,960
Well, hello there, little Spain

465
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,460
And what can I do to you today?

466
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,220
Could you hit me over the head with a baseball bat

467
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,820
And tell me a story about monkeys?

468
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,760
Oh, well, okay

469
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,240
I was in a store

470
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,980
And I saw these monkeys playing

471
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,000
I yelled to them to darn their socks

472
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,220
But they didn't understand what I was saying

473
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,180
But they giggled harshly

474
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,740
Ha ha

475
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,640
That was a good one

476
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,080
That was a great story, Captain Poultry

477
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,120
Now could you sing me a song about food?

478
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,280
Oh, why sure

479
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,260
Hey, I'm Captain Poultry

480
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,380
Food, food everywhere

481
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,860
Free the cow, free the chair

482
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,140
Feed me into a hamburger lair

483
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,360
Feed me anything, I don't care

484
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,020
I'm Captain Poultry

485
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,040
I'm Captain Poultry

486
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
Monkey madness is all around

487
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,360
Turtles flying off the ground

488
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,280
Screaming monkeys will kill your sleeping fits

489
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,640
I'm Captain Poultry

490
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,740
Like burgers, monkeys are burgers

491
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,140
Burgers are good, monkeys are deadly

492
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,060
Monkey madness all around

493
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,340
Turtles flying off the ground

494
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,420
Screaming monkeys will kill your sleeping fish

495
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,640
That was great, Captain Poultry

496
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,340
Now could you tell me another story about mummies?

497
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,340
Oh, well, certainly

498
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,620
Most monkeys can sleep

499
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:16,620


500
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:16,620


501
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:16,620


502
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:16,620


503
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:16,620


504
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:16,620


505
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:16,620


506
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,060
This particular one cannot

507
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,960
It tries to stay out of the water

508
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,040
But the anvil tied to its legs won't let it float

509
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,020
The anvil tied to its legs won't let it float

510
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,720
Food, food everywhere

511
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,800
That cow, that dog, that funny monkey

512
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,920
That funny monkey

513
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,980
That funny monkey looks confused

514
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,160
Let's eat the funny monkey

515
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,180
Let's eat the funny monkey

516
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,260
Let's eat, eat, eat

517
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,560
The funny monkey

518
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,640
Captain Poultry, could you tell me what the monkeys look like?

519
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,020
Well, sure

520
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,220
It's face looks like a people's sunshine

521
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,920
It spears me in the eye

522
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,720
Food make me happy

523
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,820
Food in my tummy

524
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,540
Monkey in my tummy make me happy

525
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,500
The funny monkey

526
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,620
The funny monkey

527
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:48,600
The funny monkey

528
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,560
Ahh yes dear friends

529
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,820
We're listening to John Klopp and the Gland Puppies

530
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,460
and we're...

531
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,100
Whoa!

532
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,980
We'll have more of that

533
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,800
Pleasant, pleasant...

534
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,920
I told you it was going to be a crazy show.

535
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,880
A real crazy...

536
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,560
They're laughing at me.

537
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,580
I know they're laughing at me.

538
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,120
I know they're laughing at me.

539
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,280
Theory.

540
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,480
You probably remember that one.

541
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:21,900
The 100th monkey theory lies at the very core of many popular New Age philosophies.

542
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:29,800
Years ago, scientists observing the behavior of monkeys on a remote island noticed that one female,

543
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:35,660
unlike all the others, had begun washing her food before eating it.

544
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,700
As soon...

545
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:45,000
Not only were her offspring washing theirs, but all her fellow monkeys adopted the admirable habit as well.

546
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:51,840
So far, one could call this a simple example of monkey see, monkey do.

547
00:22:52,380 --> 00:23:00,200
But monkeys on distant islands suddenly started washing their food too.

548
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:06,260
And this is far more than mere proof of monkey telepathy.

549
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:15,700
This suggests that, just as the so-called cleanliness vibe of an isolated monkey tribe may influence other monkeys at a distance,

550
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:22,680
surely the love consciousness of the more advanced humans will snowball.

551
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:31,200
And as more and more become enlightened, a critical mass shall be reached, and all humanity shall come together into the New Age.

552
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,080
Whichever version of it happens to have the most adherence at that particular time.

553
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,780
Now, admit it.

554
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,220
Admittedly, dear friends, monkeys are not men.

555
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,900
Chimpanzees, however, are men.

556
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,220
Regular chimpanzee behavior is like a hideous cartoon of human society.

557
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,620
Even more brutal and cruel, if that can be imagined.

558
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,920
But there are two chimpanzee species.

559
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,560
The smaller, lesser-known bonobo, or pygmy chimpanzee,

560
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,580
leads what we might call a utopian existence.

561
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,700
Rather than the biggest, meanest male, or gray-backed, silver-backed,

562
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,020
ruling the pack through intimidation and taking all the girls,

563
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,220
bonobos settle all conflicts by fornicating.

564
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,220
Indeed, they fornicate all day long.

565
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,080
Conflicts or not, married or not, incestuously or not, it doesn't matter to a bonobo.

566
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,540
Instead of an endless battle, life for the men.

567
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,460
For the noble bonobo is an endless orgy.

568
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,980
Oh, needless to say, as with our primate cousins,

569
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:52,220
most humans are what we would call normals.

570
00:24:52,220 --> 00:25:02,220
Like regular chimpanzees, with only a minority being what might be called true bonobos.

571
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,120
Sadly, we bonobo types must hide our proclivities away,

572
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,140
lest our more warlike brothers slay us all.

573
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:20,960
Or at best force us, as they do, to skulk with our various yeti mates in sleazy motels.

574
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,220
But, taken together, these seemingly unrelated zoological facts hold, yes,

575
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,760
profound implications for the human future.

576
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,540
For let us posit, dear friends, that the human race is not only a human race, but a human race.

577
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,020
And that it is the 100th bonobo.

578
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,620
What if, now just gather this in your head and think,

579
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,040
what if the number of human and chimpanzee sex fiends

580
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,620
finally reached critical mass,

581
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,760
and a mighty bonobo consciousness love vibe

582
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,340
spread like wildfire across this earth,

583
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:03,820
prompting all the jerks and bobbies and idiots and so forth

584
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,960
to see the error of their instincts

585
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,180
and spontaneously lay down their brass knuckles and briefcases

586
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,660
and make love, not war,

587
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,400
that all humanity and subgeniusdom might achieve

588
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,740
worldwide sex paradise?

589
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,160
Why not?

590
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,700
There are three problems.

591
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,980
Firstly, the popular 100th monkey theory is based on a hoax.

592
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,800
It never happens.

593
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,440
Not the way they said it did anyway.

594
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,760
Secondly, even if it were valid,

595
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,380
it would merely raise the dark question of the 100th Hitler,

596
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,320
the 100th Jeffrey Dahmer, and etc.

597
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,260
We've already seen the 100th Limbaugh.

598
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,160
And the third problem is, dear friends,

599
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,380
the bonobos are almost extinct.

600
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,820
Sorry to let you down,

601
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,360
but I guess I'll see you all down at the sleazy motel,

602
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,140
along with the rest of my fellow preachers.

603
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,500
Thank you.

all five men were found dead.

625
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,600
Helene was run out of town

626
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,500
and forbidden to return.

627
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,380
Yes, Helene, the beautiful Hungarian girl,

628
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,860
was just too pretty for society's own good.

629
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,520
Else those guys were a bunch of dumbasses.

630
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,560
The music, by the way, in the background

631
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,980
is Osric Tentacles.

632
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,460
Hard to find, but it's out there.

633
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,480
Keep your eyeballs peeled.

634
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,040
Amen.

635
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,580
Mr. Lennox?

636
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,740
Gorman Lennox?

637
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,720
I'm Bob.

638
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,780
Oh, gee.

639
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,580
Jesus, Bob, hey.

640
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,160
Where'd you get that hat?

641
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,960
Uh, it's no...

642
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,900
No kidding.

643
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,780
Uh, will you excuse us?

644
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,460
Hold on a second, Bob.

645
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,180
Uh, Bob, this is, um...

646
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:44,760
Roz.

647
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,180
Roz Kincaid.

648
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,620
Hi. Nice to meet you, Roz.

649
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,480
Uh, Roz, Bob here is from, uh, Los Angeles.

650
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,620
He has a very important collection

651
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,880
of, uh, American Western art.

652
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,180
Isn't that right, Bobby?

653
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,380
Uh-huh.

654
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,440
I sort of tricked you, Roz.

655
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,100
I'm an art broker.

656
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,940
And Bob here is a client,

657
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,980
and I'm gonna take him around to some of the galleries,

658
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,660
recommend some acquisitions.

659
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,160
But first, I'd like him to look at your paintings.

660
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,640
I'm gonna recommend that he buys one.

661
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,340
That is, if we can come to, uh, Fairprice.

662
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,220
Oh, Noah.

663
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,340
You're an artist?

664
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,420
Just look at the work, Bob.

665
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,300
You tell me.

666
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,540
Jesus Christ, Bob, what are you doing?

667
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,040
What if she comes out here and sees that?

668
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:31,580
What?

669
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:31,720


670
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,780


671
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,780


672
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,780


673
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,780


674
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,780


675
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,780


676
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,780


677
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,780


678
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,780


679
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,780


680
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,780


681
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,780


682
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,780


683
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,780


684
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:31,780


685
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,220
You're her dreams.

686
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,780
You don't throw away somebody's dreams.

687
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,200
Come on, let's go.

688
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:35,820
We're on a schedule.

689
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,380
We gotta move.

690
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,220
What's going on?

691
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:38,760
Is this hell?

692
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,020
This is sound hell.

693
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,780
Yeah, nice shrieking at you.

694
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,340
Listen, listen.

695
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,460
The first side of my 90-minute tape is about to run out.

696
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,920
Hold on, hold on.

697
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,220
My tape, my tape.

698
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,000
Wait a minute.

699
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,120
45 minutes later.

700
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,660
Be quiet for a second.

701
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,060
Wait a minute.

702
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,880
Okay, no, you're not gonna be able to cover this on tape.

703
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,180
There is a blank spot that you'll have to do.

704
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:54,760
There's gonna be a blank spot.

705
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,540
We're gonna turn our tapes.

706
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,660
A black hole in the air.

707
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,800
We'll turn our tapes over together.

708
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,480
Okay, ready?

709
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,300
Wait a minute.

710
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,040
Wait, okay, wait.

711
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,780
No, you wait.

712
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,160
I'll turn mine over and then you wait.

713
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,400
They're gonna pop those cassettes.

714
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,320
Then we'll cover it.

715
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,680
Then you send me the copy of about the 30 seconds that I missed turning mine over.

716
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,600
Almost ready.

717
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,140
The copy.

718
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:09,900
Almost ready.

719
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,980
Do you ever edit the show?

720
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,360
No, I just record it straight forward.

721
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,140
And then listen to it?

722
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,580
Okay, now.

723
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,100
Okay.

724
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,820
Oh, now.

725
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,920
Okay, now we say the funny stuff.

726
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,980
Now that he's not getting on tape.

727
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,220
Oh, that was pretty good.

728
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,520
Let's practice up on our thinking.

729
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,380
Oh, that was pretty good.

730
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,260
Let's do it.

731
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:06,620
Let's do it.

732
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,700
Let's do it.

733
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,780
Let's do it.

734
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,740
Let's do it.

735
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:32,740


736
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,720
Let's do it.

737
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
Let's do it.

738
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:39,320
Let's do it.

739
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,680
Let's do it.

740
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:46,920
To see your own brain, it is only necessary to follow several distinct and simple steps.

741
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,020
First, isolate yourself in a completely dark room.

742
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,680
It is difficult to shut out all light from your immediate environment.

743
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,020
It may even cause feelings of pain.

744
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,280
Feelings of pain.

745
00:34:59,300 --> 00:34:59,620
Oppression.

746
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,640
Suffocation.

747
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,520
And impending, imminent, painful death.

748
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:10,300
Nonetheless, one must persist in blocking out every ray of light until the room is in

749
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,300
absolute darkness.

750
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:18,520
And in this state, with the eyes wide open, one must accustom one's optic nerves to the

751
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,960
complete absence of light.

752
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:26,320
And now, at this precious point, a small light source is added.

753
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,860
Its tiny beams light up.

754
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,920
The hitherto darkened room.

755
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:38,840
Follow with your eyes as you move the light source back and forth directly in front of

756
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,880
your field of vision.

757
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,020
Focus your eyes, but do not strain them.

758
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,780
Watch only the light.

759
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:53,080
After a short time, you should begin seeing a fibrous mass in front of your eyes, almost

760
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,860
like a curtain or a three-dimensional image of the sort we call holographic.

761
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:05,140
Now the two rounded parts of the corpus callosum become visible.

762
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:15,080
The stretched out nerves of the medulla oblongata and spinal column extend behind and fade from

763
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,960
view out of the circle of light.

764
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,440
These are the olfactory nerves.

765
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:24,820
These the optic and these the oculomotor bundles, appearing like insectile legs.

766
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:31,780
Then the trochlear nerve and the trigeminal, which a great deal of pain passes through.

767
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,220
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

768
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,140
Thank you.

769
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,040
That was an exquisite pain, but I have another for you even better.

770
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,600
Even better.

771
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:45,960
They say no pain is like that when the trigeminal nerve is appropriately stimulated, but we

772
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,400
have found greater pain.

773
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,600
Curiously enough, the brain itself has no nerves and cannot feel pain.

774
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:01,560
What does that matter when it is a gathering structure for the entire nervous system of

775
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,100
the organism?

776
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:08,900
In that sense, all pain, whatever happens to the extremities, is experienced in that

777
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,100
little wet pulsing brain.

778
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,300
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

779
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,500
I now move back.

780
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:21,940
Okay.

781
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,320
Oh.

782
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,240
And go to the ordered labor room.

783
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,600
You're not seen for the first time, Dr.

784
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,100
Lexe.

785
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:29,960
Excuse me, unveiled a possibility that is.

786
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,920
So trying to leave the vigilance on the ele chaîne there?

787
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,280
Nice.

788
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,200
Where's all the fanfare?

789
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,360
Where's all the hoopla?

790
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,760
What's about to happen?

791
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,760
Yeah, really.

792
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,700
The brain.

793
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,000
The pain of the brain.

794
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,100
The pure pain.

795
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,080
Yes, friends, I've had to face that pain lately myself.

796
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,100
When I quit smoking, it was not pleasant.

797
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,780
But it's still kind of weird.

798
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:19,040
And from what I understand, one continues for years and years afterwards to suddenly feel that one will surely die if one doesn't get a damn wiggy going in there.

799
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,020
Friends, now what we've been listening to at the beginning of the side.

800
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:31,660
Well, actually, you know, there's been a lot of KPFA subgenius show from Berkeley with puzzling evidence.

801
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,560
Dr. Howell.

802
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,300
That was Dr. Howell talking about the brain.

803
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,360
Just then.

804
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,820
And we've heard a lot of the editing on this was done years and years ago, actually, by puzzling evidence.

805
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:54,020
But this music, this lovely music you've been hearing in the background and the earlier song, Flight of the Barfing Death Fags.

806
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,460
That was the name of that song.

807
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,520
Flight of the Barfing Death Fags.

808
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,720
Lovely little piece of music there.

809
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,440
It's by the Gland.

810
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,440
Puppies and Reverend John Klopp.

811
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,340
Also used to be known as Roy Rogers and the Hemorrhoid Rogers.

812
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,500
That was it.

813
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,860
Hemorrhoid Rogers and the Big Pooh Generator.

814
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,040
This band has had many names.

815
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:26,040
I'm about to give a contact email for the Gland Puppies.

816
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:34,500
That's ear, E-A-R, ear at pebcac.trippy.

817
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,740
Dot org.

818
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,340
Pebcac is like P.

819
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,500
It's ear at P-E-B-K-A-C.

820
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,020
Dot trippy.

821
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,860
T-R-I-P-P-Y.

822
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,140
Dot org.

823
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:57,680
For information there about the Gland Puppies and my email address is slack at metronet.com.

824
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:03,440
Actually, that's Jesus's email address, but it'll get you there.

825
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,460
He forwards that stuff.

826
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,500
Okay, I've got to try to keep a lid on.

827
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,640
See, I get upset very easily these days.

828
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,660
My hormones are acting up without the nicotine.

829
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,620
Boy, I left up.

830
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,220
I forgot.

831
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,780
One morning, I forgot.

832
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,540
Actually, my nicotine patch fell off during the night.

833
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:34,280
And the next morning, I woke up shaking with rage.

834
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,300
And swollen with fury over the injustice of the world.

835
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,540
And the entire world owed me a huge apology.

836
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,980
I went out to...

837
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:42,820
What?

838
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,000
Is that them?

839
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,620
Is this the apology I've been waiting for?

840
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:48,780
Yes.

841
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,000
Yes, it is good.

842
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,500
Thank you.

843
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,200
Thank you.

844
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,080
I'll tell you, though, that day that I lost the patch was like, as Jane said,

845
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:03,820
that was like a great big old cocaine party compared to that time they shot the living gee out of me.

846
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,620
I was like, I'm not going to do this anymore.

847
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:06,620


848
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:06,620


849
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,020
Because it did get worse, friends.

850
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:15,400
And, you know, you can't know what depression is, clinical depression,

851
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,500
unless you've had it and gotten over it.

852
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,680
Or else, well, I guess if you dealt real closely with somebody who has it.

853
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,760
And I have, unfortunately, both.

854
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:34,760
The catch-22 of depression is that you...

855
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,080
You literally can't pull yourself out of it, by definition.

856
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,240
That's what it is.

857
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,600
You know, I can get myself out of smoking or not.

858
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,680
But depression is different.

859
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,920
It's bad brain, dear friends.

860
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,860
Bad chemistry.

861
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,300
And sometimes you need replacement chemicals, like the patches, which really help.

862
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:02,180
Just in order to oil the stuck-shut hinges on the mental slack-shacked door.

863
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,820
If you know what I mean.

864
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:10,460
And you may need psychological support, dear friends, to get the door cracked open before.

865
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,520
Now, I have no friends, but I...

866
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,720
Not really, but I do have you, dear friends.

867
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,920
And now I'm not...

868
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:28,420
Don't get the idea, folks, that we've suddenly decided that conspiracy-style mental health programs are suddenly Dobbs-approved now.

869
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,960
That is definitely not the case.

870
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,020
It's...

871
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,360
It's...

872
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,260
What we're saying is...

873
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,780
If a pill can fix you, take the damn pill.

874
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,540
They've done miracles with antidepressants.

875
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:48,060
I'm a big believer in seeking the right antidepressant.

876
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,220
Which may just be froth.

877
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,780
Same thing.

878
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,540
But, you know, if it can...

879
00:42:53,540 --> 00:43:01,880
And if somebody who's trained to circumvent your self-deluding bull-hockey that you pull on yourself can actually do that,

880
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,040
then let the insurance company pay.

881
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:04,820
And if you're a good person to do it,

882
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:13,160
you know, if you need five bags of the sacred herb Havaprop Zipulops per day to keep from becoming a serial killer,

883
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,700
then buy the froth and live off the dog food.

884
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:27,440
But if you quit smoking, get ready for some nasty, nasty, nasty experiences.

885
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,760
In the first week, you start losing things all the time.

886
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,640
Things like keys and wallets.

887
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,240
And...

888
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,240
Passwords.

889
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:41,100
And you start getting lost in your own neighborhood when you're driving at night.

890
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,340
And you start getting up to do something.

891
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,360
And instead of forgetting what you were gonna do when you get in the next room,

892
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:53,860
you forget what you were gonna do before you even finish standing up.

893
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,900
It can get to where it takes five minutes to figure out left from right.

894
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,940
Stuff that you would normally do on autopilot.

895
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,960
Like flip tapes of this show.

896
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,500
You can no longer do.

897
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,660
You screw them up.

898
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,140
Second week is a whole lot worse, friends.

899
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,400
Second week is...

900
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,960
The subtle insanity creeps in.

901
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,500
And the act of thinking,

902
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,340
Oh, that was easy.

903
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,440
That first week was easy.

904
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,420
That's what triggers it.

905
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,120
That's when they know to move in.

906
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,020
You start repeating yourself in conversation,

907
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,160
or else thinking that you just repeated yourself.

908
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,100
Or that you would be repeating yourself,

909
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,460
and then you never say it at all.

910
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,880
And you can't hear anything anybody says to you for the first two or three times they say it.

911
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,080
You can read one paragraph six or seven times.

912
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,620
And it gets to where,

913
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,500
even though you can't remember what you did five minutes ago,

914
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:57,620
you can vividly recall every broken or forgetting promise ever made to you since childhood.

915
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,960
Every little insult,

916
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,100
or slight,

917
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,000
especially by close friends.

918
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:09,480
The perfect recollection of everything ever borrowed from you but not returned.

919
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,460
Vividly imagining painful,

920
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,400
vindictive arguments down to every perfect nuance and detail.

921
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,780
Photographic recollection of imaginary arguments.

922
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,920
In the third week,

923
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,940
you start believing those arguments.

924
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,180
And you realize that those arguments really happened.

925
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,840
A greatly increased sex drive.

926
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,580
Greatly reduced sex drive.

927
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,180
Completely, greatly confused right off the road.

928
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,100
And crashed into a tree!

929
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,160
Sex drive.

930
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:45,960
Drive.

931
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,460
Hmm.

932
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:49,920
Uh.

933
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,620
Fretting for five hours a night.

934
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,860
Sleeping for three.

935
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:04,000
Inability to remember anything good ever happening to anybody except those you most envy.

936
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:08,260
Inability to accept the existence of anything good.

937
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,060
Period.

938
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,800
And then,

939
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:18,820
you've become convinced that you've just been kidding yourself the whole time.

940
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,060
Up until then.

941
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,240
Up until that moment.

942
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,380
Thinking about all this time I've been a sap.

943
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,160
A chump.

944
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,820
Only now can I finally see the bitter truth I was hiding from myself.

945
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,740
How ludicrously,

946
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,580
pathetically naive I was.

947
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,860
How easily I've winked.

948
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,580
It's almost funny.

949
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,660
I know now that they've all been laughing at me behind my back this whole time.

950
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,040
And I was too much of a trusting fool to see it.

951
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,900
But that's over with now.

952
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,260
No.

953
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:53,480
No.

954
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:54,780
No.

955
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,060
No.

956
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,880
And you get to where any single statement that might be construed as less than highly flattering,

957
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,780
you interpret as an insult.

958
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,040
It's just more proof of the conspiracy against you.

959
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,700
Against you!

960
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,000
Friends.

961
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,440
You can e-

962
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:21,240
I got to where I was setting up conversations with such evil Moriarty-like twisted logic,

963
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:26,280
that no reply anyone could make could be taken as anything but total betrayal.

964
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:31,140
Or, at best, the most callous insensitivity.

965
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,480
And this went on for weeks.

966
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:39,800
Although I looked at the calendar and realized it had only been four days.

967
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,540
Ugh, friends.

968
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,280
If you're lucky, you know, at some point when you're quitting smoking, somebody says,

969
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:46,580
Hey!

970
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,540
You're nuts, man.

971
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:50,760
And-

972
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,460
And if you're-

973
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,820
And if you're real lucky, it sinks in and you go,

974
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,340
Oh!

975
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,660
Oh my god!

976
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,380
Whoa!

977
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,140
Praise Bob!

978
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:01,540
It was just severe depression and drug withdrawal and borderline schizophrenia.

979
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:02,180
Heh!

980
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:02,680
Hey!

981
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,720
It's New Year's Eve!

982
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,380
It's a wonderful life!

983
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,800
You know, I-

984
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,900
You know, as much as the normals disappoint me, I'd still rather think it was me being

985
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,740
a jerk than that literally everybody else was a jerk because of me.

986
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:20,740


987
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,140
You know, I-

988
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,480
I can do something about me.

989
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,260
You can do something about me.

990
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,140
You can turn it right off.

991
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,360
But, I don't know.

992
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:34,840
Knowing you're crazy can keep you sane, at least, uh, until the third month.

993
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:35,920
Heh heh heh heh.

994
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:40,380
But, we won't have to worry about the third year, dear friends.

995
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:47,080
The third year after you quit smoking because, on the escaped vessels of the sex goddesses,

996
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,740
smoking is healthy.

997
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:50,620
Ha.

998
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,720
Calling Planet Earth

999
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,140
Calling Planet Earth

1000
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:49,620
Calling Planet Earth

1001
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:58,240
Because I love my home

1002
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:20,280
When I think of all the things I had today

1003
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:27,820
And I think of all the things I've thrown away

1004
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:35,440
I promise to return every can

1005
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:43,280
For that five cent deposit and the good of all men

1006
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,040
Cause I

1007
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:47,740
I

1008
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:48,700
I

1009
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:48,980
I

1010
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,480
Love this place

1011
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,480
Cause I

1012
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:58,800
I

1013
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,360
Love my home

1014
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,940
Calling Planet Earth

1015
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,380
Calling Planet Earth

1016
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,280
Calling Planet Earth

1017
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,880
Calling Planet Earth

1018
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:34,940
Calling Planet Earth

1019
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,360
Calling Planet Earth

1020
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,480
Calling Planet Earth

1021
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,980
Calling Planet Earth

1022
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:39,980


1023
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:39,980


1024
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,000
Calling Planet Earth

1025
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,020
Calling Planet Earth

1026
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:40,120
Calling Planet Earth

1027
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,120


1028
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,120


1029
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,120


1030
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,540
Calling Planet Earth

1031
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:40,540


1032
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:40,540


1033
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:40,540


1034
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:40,540


1035
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,160
Calling Planet Earth

1036
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:41,160


1037
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,400
Calling Planet Earth

1038
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,280
Calling Planet Earth

1039
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,860
Calling Planet Earth

1040
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:56,200
A moment of silence for all the short people who won't exist at all.

1041
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:05,620
Cause I love this planet.

1042
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:16,540
Cause I love my home.

1043
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,640
One more time now.

1044
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:27,680
Cause I love this planet.

1045
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:38,500
Cause I love my home.

1046
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,120
Planet Earth.

1047
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,520
Planet Earth.

1048
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,920
Planet Earth.

1049
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:45,920


1050
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,360
Calling Planet Earth.

1051
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,800
Calling Planet Earth.

1052
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:15,200
Well, I see fingers, hands, and shades of faces.

1053
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,520
Well, I see fingers, hands, and shades of faces.

1054
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,620
Reaching up, but not quite.

1055
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,720
Touching the promised land.

1056
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:28,960
I hear pleas and prayers and a desperate whisper saying,

1057
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:34,880
Oh Lord, please give us a helping hand.

1058
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:36,780
Yeah, yeah.

1059
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,920
Mm, ooh.

1060
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,720
The way down in the background

1061
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,320
I can see frustrated souls

1062
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,320
The city's burning

1063
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,780
And on across the water

1064
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:02,180
Babe, I see a weapon sparking

1065
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,180
Out the sting of death

1066
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,540
And up in the clouds

1067
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,100
I can imagine UFOs

1068
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:07,740
Chuckling themselves

1069
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,580
Laughing, they say

1070
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,200
Those people so uptight

1071
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,620
They sure know how to make a mess

1072
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,920
Hey!

1073
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:48,120
guitar solo

1074
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,660
Back at the saloon

1075
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,700
My tears mix in mildew

1076
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,480
With my drink

1077
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,700
I can't really tell my feet

1078
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,320
From the salt that's on the floor

1079
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,260
But as far as I know

1080
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,640
They may even try to ram me

1081
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,960
And sell the thing they sell me

1082
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,700
Brothers, help me

1083
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,440
And don't worry

1084
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,700
About looking at the score

1085
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,480
Can't hear it

1086
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:45,700
Yeah

1087
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:49,160
guitar solo

1088
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,880
And it's time

1089
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:15,600
For a new beginning

1090
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,440
For a new beginning

1091
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:16,520
For a new beginning

1092
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:16,520

00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:16,520

00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:16,520


1096
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:16,520


1097
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,500
And a big bye-bye

1098
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:21,720

Who else?

1119
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,700
I think I gave everybody else

1120
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,980
That will give

1121
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,920
You can write to Bob

I know it doesn't seem real

1137
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:00,380
But it's real

1138
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:03,080
It's all real, dear friends

1139
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,640
And, uh, anybody got a lighter?

1140

Oh, no, I can't think about that

00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:40,960

I'll be happy to answer them

I'll see you next time

1153
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,080
Bye!

1154
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,080


1155
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,080


1156
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,080


1157
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,080


1158
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,080


1159
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,080


1160
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,080


1161
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,080


1162
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,080


1163
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,080


1164
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,080


1165
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,080


1166
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,600
We live in an age when many people

1167
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,260
Particularly church people

1168
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,260
Expect someone else to do everything for them

1169
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,960
They expect the pastor or evangelist

1170
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,600
To lay their hands on them

1171
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,520
Tap them with God's power

1172
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,700
And heal them

1173
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:07,300
Or deliver them strictly by the anointing on God's servant

1174
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:10,400
While they themselves take no active part

1175
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,700
In the faith process

1176
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,080
Folks, it doesn't work that way

1177
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:18,020
Particularly in the case of something so deeply entrenched

1178
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,160
As the drug problem

1179
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,760
Yes, we can lay hands on you

1180
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,260
And yes, we can pray that God will take away the craving for drugs

1181
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,540
And he will do it

1182
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:29,460
But you must do something to certify the cure

1183
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:33,880
The Bible says, resist the devil and he will flee from you

1184
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,780
You yourself must resist him

1185
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,500
Once the devil sees that you have been set free

1186
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,800
He will try to get you back in bondage again

1187
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,660
First he will try to compromise you

1188
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:51,000
He will try to get you to sell the drugs which you are no longer using

1189
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,280
After all, you paid a lot of money for them

1190
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,900
And you need the money, right?

1191
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:56,860
Uh-huh

1192
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,560
The Lord is able to supply your needs

1193
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,820
You don't need drug money to live

1194
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:04,300
God will take care of feeding your baby

1195
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,060
Or whatever it else is you are concerned about

1196
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:09,480
So don't send up those drugs

1197
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,900
Now failing that

1198
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,780
The devil will try to get you to give them to him

1199
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,300
He will send the drugs away to a friend

1200
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,340
There's nothing mysterious or complicated about it

1201
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:20,160
Let's take it nice and easy

1202
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,840
Making all the stops along the way

1203
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,700
That's the basic idea

1204
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,060
Bonding is damaged when couples scramble the stages

1205
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,860
If they kiss passionately on the first date

1206
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,080
Engage in heavy petting a month later

1207
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,480
Or have sexual intercourse before marriage

1208
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,340
Something precious is lost in their commitment to one another

1209
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:42,240
They've not allowed the glue to dry

1210
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,200
Perfect

1211
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,080
You're a woman

1212
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,960
Have sex with a woman

1213
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,620
Have sex with a woman
