1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
The biggest problem is the shutdown of the Bay Bridge, which we interrupt normal programming for a test of the emergency broadcast system

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,680
This is only a test

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,560
Oh my god, they're coming to get us!

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,260
This is it! Run! The Russians! This is the end!

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,480
Nuclear weapons, everything they got! Water to New York! All gone! We're nuts!

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,240
Just a few seconds, it's gonna explode! Run to your shelter! Run!

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,980
Time for a main! Be the first to an end! Screw your wife! Screw your children!

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,660
It's every man for himself! Red Trap Tower!

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,160
If you just see that deadly radiation or that explosion, you're gone! It's curtains!

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,440
Oh my god, what a terrible way to go! You're figuring it'll fall out! You're an aramouse!

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,360
You turn green, you vomit! You vomit all over the place!

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,560
Just get in there and live! Lock the other sucker out! You're the only one that matters!

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,300
President, that's all we need! Get with it and turn back!

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,900
I wanna see Russia blow off a big smoke screen! I wanna see them die to save our way to the night!

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:01,100
What's going on? I want my revenge! We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die!

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,460
This was only a test.

17
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,360
The end has come for humanity. Not in the red of atomic fusion.

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,340
Not in the glory of interstellar combustion. Not in the peace of white, cold silence.

19
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,660
But that! That creeping, grasping flesh below us.

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,140
It is a joke, eh, Lewis? A great joke! The joke of the cosmos! The end of all mankind!

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,120
But why? Because of...

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,020
The Self Genius Hour of Swat!

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:44,760
It is a psychological technique whereby you, seated in the auditorium, actually become part of the action you see on the screen.

24
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:52,020
Let me show you something. You will feel absolutely no pain at all. Feel.

25
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,340
Now you...

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,460
Uh, things are pretty weird here in Dallas, as you can tell.

27
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:08,680
I don't have the radio or a tape deck on. This is just the sound effects of the downtown street that I'm driving down.

28
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:22,820
It's pretty confusing, really. You can see why the Subgenius Foundation had its... the church itself had its birth here in Dallas.

29
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,480
I mean, I don't even know whether I'm going forward or backwards.

30
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,660
And sometimes... sometimes it almost feels like a freeze frame, you know?

31
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,940
And on top of that, I've been editing film all month and...

32
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,640
You know, I don't know whether... I mean, sometimes I think I can just rewind my own reality.

33
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,840
Maybe I can even stop it.

34
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,240
The Subgenius Foundation

35
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,180
The Subgenius Foundation

36
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,220
The Subgenius Foundation

37
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,160
Do you know what you are?

38
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,620
There's a very dirty word for what you are.

39
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,080
And a very dirty group of people running a very dirty business.

40
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,060
Oh, yes, didn't you know?

41
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,600
We're highly organized.

42
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,420
The Church of the Subsudicia

43
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,580
ступ

44
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,540
Next we have as our guest the demon from William Peter Blatty's film The Exorcist.

45
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,460
Says he can't stay long, only long enough to read a couple of lines from the movie script.

46
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,940
He's been very busy lately, hopping around the country, being received by several hosts.

47
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,000
Can't say we wish him much luck.

48
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,480
Secondly we have Mr. Paul Caruso who will discuss the subject of UFOs.

49
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,840
Now let's hear from the demon because he must run.

50
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,580
Demon?

51
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,420
Yes.

52
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,060
Demon, I was talking to Bob Hope recently.

53
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:04,860
Yes.

54
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,360
And he says that he just couldn't concentrate very much on the movie.

55
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:18,640
Apparently while he was in the movie theater there was a chap next to him who kept putting his tail in Mr. Hope's popcorn box.

56
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,040
Yes.

57
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,580
Yes.

58
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,160
And he said, I make the wrongs.

59
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,300
I like to see myself on the screen.

60
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,180
Well I know that you're in a tremendous, tremendous hurry.

61
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,220
So we'll get on with the script reading and then we'll let you go.

62
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,640
Would you read a script for us now?

63
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,160
Yes.

64
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,420
I would be glad to.

65
00:04:52,340 --> 00:05:03,780
What's going on with him?

66
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,900
下 cả

67
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,060


68
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,240
I believe from the very first part of the script I'm in the sense you're feeling the pain ofcible Kurt Warth, or worse.

69
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,240


70
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,380
And takeあの Морон в moon.

71
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,220
Escape from your inferiors, from the halt and lame of mind.

72
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,040
Do you speak to men, you pious vomit?

73
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,240
Your abode is in a nest of peacocks, Meron.

74
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,380
Well, that's certainly enough of that.

75
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,040
Our guest was the demon from The Exorcist.

76
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,080
And now let's go to our next guest.

77
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,260
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

78
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,000
Welcome to Radio Station EXP.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,060
Tonight we are featuring an interview with a very peculiar looking gentleman

80
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,560
who goes by the name of Mr. Paul Caruso

81
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,780
on the dodgy subject of are there or are there not flying saucers or UFOs.

82
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,480
Please, Mr. Caruso, could you give us your regarded opinion

83
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,080
on this nonsense about spaceships and even space people?

84
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,260
Thank you.

85
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,600
As you all know, you just can't believe everything you see in here, can you?

86
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,120
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must be on my way.

87
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,840
What?

88
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:19,920
What?

89
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,920
Oh, I can believe it.

90
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:36,220
So until next week, at the same time, same station, this is Bob Snyder signing off.

91
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,620
And life goes on.

92
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,900
This drug has application for the anesthesia.

93
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,340
I have such energy, such exhilaration, almost euphoria sometimes, and without distortion.

94
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,100
It's quite amazing.

95
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,960
You're actually using it on yourself?

96
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,480
Of course, I'm preparing a full study.

97
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,500
It could change our entire approach to medicine and the dreams landing.

98
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,360
Incredible, vivid.

99
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,180
No, not dreams.

100
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,340
More like memories or experiences of another level.

101
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,720
Jekyll, are you sure it's safe?

102
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,520
Primitive people have been using it for centuries.

103
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,780
Until now, man has been locked up in the dark prism of the mind.

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,840
I may have discovered the secret to set him free.

105
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,300
Excuse me, Dr. Jekyll.

106
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,280
It's just a length.

107
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,580
You're on your own path or something.

108
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,480
I have stopped thinking for an infinite number of hours trying to figure out where this cuts

109
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,480


110
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,540
The justice system tells you you can make history, while fighting against it.

111
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:10,540


112
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:10,540


113
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:10,540


114
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:10,760
So you see?

115
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,100
Oh, he can give you some favour, no low pay.

116
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,080
Maybe le stato, or something.

117
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,000
Oh, and I'd like to present you... Oh and now I'd like to present you... Oh, and now I'd like to present you... You esasge a Nazi.

118
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,080
His is excellency count of year seven thousand dollars. his is excelency count of year seven thousand dollars.

119
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,600
Hohenstaufen von Liechtenstein, our guest tonight.

120
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,160
The Count has a war wound.

121
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,740
He's not able to speak very well, but he signals by...

122
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:31,980
Rem.

123
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,100
He waves his stumps and thus communicates.

124
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,780
Yes, and here we are, flying high over the hills of Berkeley now.

125
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,440
Yes, it does sound that way, doesn't it, dear friends?

126
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,720
No, it's Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

127
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,260
And you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

128
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,700
The voice of...

129
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,160
Actually, the opiate of the people.

130
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,080
The opiate of the masses on the voice.

131
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,060
The voice of the people.

132
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,800
And on that upbeat note,

133
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,200
and all this wonderful wonderment,

134
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,320
and clever little tape bits we've just been playing,

135
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,920
well, we're just going to stop

136
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,080
and get into something rather interesting here.

137
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,220
Dear friends,

138
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,080
if you have...

139
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,200
had any friends who were killed

140
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,160
on the Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge,

141
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,480
turn off the radio or switch over to another station right now

142
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,520
because what's coming up is not going to be pleasant.

143
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,780
We don't do this as sick humor, however.

144
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,140
By the way, for anybody who's wondering,

145
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,640
all of our subgenius friends in the Bay Area and environs

146
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,860
called in sick to their jobs, but they're fine.

147
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,940
But how...

148
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,560
What we have coming up here is a story that's interesting

149
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,640
because it was written three years ago by St. Palmer Vredes.

150
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,900
This is another installment in the World Without Slack novel.

151
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,440
And the reason we read it is because it illustrates the psychology

152
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,260
of certain Californians anyway, you know, the sickos,

153
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,700
the kind that we associate with and play on the air a lot,

154
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,520
in dealing with the threat, the constant threat of earthquakes.

155
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,300
It's also a reminder, in a way,

156
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,780
that the quake last week was relatively very minor.

157
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,360
In fact, as I was talking to my friends on the phone this week in San Francisco,

158
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,380
they were all really disgusted at the way the media had treated it.

159
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,120
I mean, it scared the daylights out of a lot of us the first day

160
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,760
because it sounded like the big one.

161
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,340
But as it turned out, you know, I mean, of course,

162
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,020
there were many, many tracks.

163
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,600
There were many tragedies involved and so forth.

164
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,900
But for the most part, as my friend, Reverend Court Holland,

165
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,120
Slackmaster, was saying, he goes,

166
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,740
oh, it was so terrible.

167
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,440
Why, we didn't, we couldn't even make phone calls for two hours.

168
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,280
We didn't have lights for seven hours.

169
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,340
We couldn't even watch TV.

170
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,620
And there was no water to shampoo our hair with for, gosh, five or six hours.

171
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,020
Also, the quake, if it was,

172
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,740
it was God's judgment on that Sodom and Gomorrah we call San Francisco.

173
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,920
It's funny which neighborhoods he picked

174
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,580
because Castro Street came through with flying colors,

175
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,520
whereas somehow it was the really rich neighborhoods

176
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,200
where people lost a lot of their goods.

177
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,000
Anyway, by the way,

178
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,440
you may wonder why I do these readings of things live on the air

179
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,020
instead of using home recording.

180
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:26,700
You know, it's that despite the mistakes that I may make,

181
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,220
number one, it's sort of more immediate

182
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:35,640
and one is in show mode when one knows that you are listening right now.

183
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,720
And the other thing is the station has much better microphones than I do.

184
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,320
Anyway, this is from World Without Slack, Chapter 1.

185
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,580
The Sound of the Earth

186
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:02,420
Doug Wellman got caught as he was crossing the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.

187
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,880
Didn't even notice at first, just kept talking into his black box.

188
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,460
Notes, jokes.

189
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,540
The car began to shake.

190
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,060
So did the bridge.

191
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,760
Hot damn earthquake!

192
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,600
Now he heard it.

193
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,780
The sound cut right through the headphones,

194
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,080
reaching over to the digital recorder,

195
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,740
and as he was reaching for the recorder on the seat,

196
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,900
he turned up the mic volume

197
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,020
even as he began to fight for control of the speeding vehicle.

198
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,280
The low-frequency moan of total motion was rare music.

199
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,480
The shifting of tectonic plates would be a good white noise background

200
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,600
for the next Doctors for Bob 45.

201
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,940
He glanced at his dashboard computer and noted the readout.

202
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,200
10.2 Richter scale blinking in neat red liquid crystal dashes.

203
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,880
The real trick was going to be staying alive for the next five minutes,

204
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,420
during the funhouse ride to which the North California coast was being treated.

205
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,700
Wellman's van was drifting crazily down the back of a tremendous gray snake

206
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,020
that was doing an airsots break dance.

207
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,340
As he entered the Treasure Island tunnel,

208
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:12,980
the sides and roof of the bridge passageway began to acquire a crust of smashed metal and flesh

209
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,660
from less fortunate drivers and passengers.

210
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,100
Bus into Toyota, into Ford, into Beamer,

211
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:19,760
into Mack,

212
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,080
into the Black Rig.

213
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,560
Somehow he kept dodging the lethal dancing wreckage,

214
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,540
continuing to trap every agonizing DB on his metal oxide strip.

215
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,500
The city came into view as he bounced out of the tube at 90 miles an hour.

216
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,160
He changed lanes to avoid clipping a VW

217
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,160
and almost got taken out by a car that sailed over him,

218
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,080
tires just brushing his roof.

219
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,440
Glancing quickly to his left he saw it hit the top of a jag spinning in circles

220
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,020
and, in a dramatic aerial rebound,

221
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,460
fly over the bridge railing.

222
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:57,180
Wellman briefly glimpsed a pale, uncomprehending officer grappling with the useless wheel

223
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,280
as his unit flew into the cold, green water below.

224
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,420
Cutting maniacally through this auto holocaust,

225
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,000
Doug heard the tunnel collapse behind him.

226
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,280
All on tape! All on tape!

227
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,580
He screamed in delight.

228
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,360
Wait till Gordon hears this!

229
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,540
It's the earthquake! The big one!

230
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,020
Like a damn atomic bomb!

231
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,080
Yee-haw! Merry Christmas!

232
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,000
The precision gyroscope

233
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,620
and microscopic tape heads would compensate

234
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:26,080
for all the random motion without any noticeable distortion in sound resolution.

235
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,280
With loud snaps the bridge cables were unwinding and breaking,

236
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,680
their massive steel strands flinging cars through the air all about him

237
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,860
like miniature matchbox toys,

238
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,580
as millions of pounds of stored kinetic tension were released in seconds.

239
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,500
The bridgeway buckled beneath him.

240
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,580
Another jolt and its rippling pavement began to tilt to the right

241
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,540
at a disturbing angle, but this nearly allowed him a quick look at the Embarcadero.

242
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,040
Thick clouds of vibrating grey dust billowed up a hundred feet or more,

243
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,740
concealing the ground from view.

244
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,000
The pyramid was gone, safety engineered quake rollers and all.

245
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,320
Most of the high rises were tilting into each other at absurd angles,

246
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,800
sinking into oscillating quicksand,

247
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,160
foundations unable to support their own weight in the liquefied landfill.

248
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,480
Sparkles of glass from the shattering picture

249
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,360
windows twinkled in the afternoon sun

250
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,160
as they showered over helpless pedestrians many stories below.

251
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,840
The effervescent flickering was peppered with tiny flailing secretaries and junior execs.

252
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,960
As he watched, the Shackley building shuddered and went spiraling down,

253
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,760
all its floors collapsing efficiently in a graceful pirouette of destruction.

254
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,480
The sane thing to do was to stop the van and hold tight.

255
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,380
The determined wellman, however, furrowed his thick eyebrows,

256
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:48,460


257
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,440
and sped up.

258
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,540
He had to reach the foundation office on Folsom.

259
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,460
If he could make the 9th Street exit,

260
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,480
he might have almost five minutes to remix before the band's share time

261
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,620
on the Sanyo Sound Sat ended for the day.

262
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,780
Doug steered down the elevated ramp at a 12 degree tilt,

263
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,480
swerving to avoid people spasmodically flung across his path,

264
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,280
their pinwheeling bodies leaving bright, Polack-like smears on the pavement.

265
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,440
Great cracks began to appear in the roadway behind him,

266
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,940
swallowing the wreckage in big gulps.

267
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:27,160
To his rear, the East Bay refineries in Richmond had their quake-proof storage tanks rupture,

268
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,300
unable to withstand the unforeseen magnitude of the main shock.

269
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,180
Millions of gallons of oil and gasoline spilled into the water and caught fire.

270
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,400
A series of huge explosions released roiling mountains of toxic gas.

271
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:48,420
The hellish black smoke almost succeeded in obscuring the fleet of flying saucers,

272
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,880
that were suddenly dancing over the whole sky.

273
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,840
Music background there by Arnold Mathis.

274
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,840
And the story was a bit of World Without Slack by Saint Palmer Vreedes.

275
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,120
Dear friends, you can call the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

276
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:28,780
Speak to Mighty Will O'Dobbs here at 823-7490.

277
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,760
In Dallas, Texas, only during Hour of Slack broadcast times, dear friends.

278
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,460
9 o'clock to 10 o'clock Sunday nights in Texas time.

279
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,520
And coming up in a little while,

280
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,980
we'll be reading to you some further excerpts from World Without Slack,

281
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,760
this time describing what happens to Dallas on X-Day.

282
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,000
But in the meantime...

283
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,800
And this is the Rudy Schwartz Project.

Man-kineds, she can only wooman kind to.

295
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,800
Cuz your bottom line is how many peeps do you fund.

296
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,480
That's the yolでspite des Hotel streufer.

297
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,040
your way to the head of the pack by cheating deceiving and licking the crack of dishonest

298
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:53,100
people who think like you who want a jacuzzi and a room with a view a wife who acts stupid and makes

299
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,380
you feel bright if she has big tits and her teeth look bright of course you respect her and your

300
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,640
marriage won't flunk as long as she puts out when you come home drunk she thinks you're garbage and

301
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,100
you think she's scum you'll both be content if you manage to come promotions receive when you

302
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,880

303
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,440
me you're a smegma on toast and that's all i can see

304
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,860
so call me a cynic and call me a bore that don't change the truth that you're still a whore to the

305
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,960
worthless existence you know that you lead fueled by the lies that you eat sleep and breathe

306
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,240
fueled by churches and unions and such and corporate sleazeballs can't get enough

307
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,680
springsteen football pretzels and beer the problems the commies the jews and the queer

308
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,500
church association and bundles describe us more as virginuzu blood all over our bodies as

309
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:02,620
female rescuers and as women they step in evil whores rage and tempest turns everyanni

¶¶

312
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:50,800
Ah, yes, dear friends, and you can always write for free information from the Church of the Subgenius, which you're hearing right now.

313
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,960
Actually, hearing Rudy Schwartz Project in the background.

314
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:02,240
But for free information on the church, get that pencil ready and write to good old Bob.

315
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,240
Just Bob. That's not me. I'm Reverend Ivan Stang.

316
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,800
You don't want to talk to me. You want your...

317
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,580
Your prayers to go straight to Bob and your love offering.

318
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:27,200
Bob at P.O. Box 140-306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

319
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,320
And we'll be giving that number again at the end of the broadcast, but meanwhile...

320
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,840
¶¶

321
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,640
Must have been fairly exotic, wouldn't you say?

322
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,860
Mm-hmm.

323
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,460
How about those rabid Janeer fans?

324
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,400
The kind of thing only people like Tenderly and Convenience...

325
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,140
They ought to be muddled.

326
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,000
Frank Zappa would go to.

327
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,600
Yeah.

328
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,860
...heat the cloth and foam off their stage and off Janeer's shoes.

329
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,780
Yeah, after I got bit by one of those rabid fans, I had to get an injection.

330
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,180
Oh, yeah?

331
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,760
In the buttocks, yes. I know it.

332
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,260
I'll look at the tape later.

333
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,900
Although I don't have one anymore.

334
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,600
A butt or an injection?

335
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,940
Well, neither one.

336
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:09,600
You know...

337
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,740
Because there's no place to put the injection.

338
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:10,840
You know...

339
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,400
But I'm having a buttocks...

340
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,020
Buttocks transplant.

341
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,180
Apply buttock suction pump, series M200R.

342
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,620
Did you hear the one about the guy who had his buttocks put in the wrong way,

343
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,100
and when he went down a slide, it sounded like...

344
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,080
I saw that guy in my elementary school at the playground.

345
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,700
He was the most pathetic thing I've ever seen.

346
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,720
All the other kids called him back-assward-bad.

347
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,080
He was terrible.

348
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,140
What a sad thing.

349
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,160
He wasn't a very good student, either.

350
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,660
If my dog had a face like yours, I'd shave his ass and have him walk backwards.

351
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,660
That's right, Dad.

352
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,060
At our studio of subgenius...

353
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,500
I can't continue with the punchline.

354
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,040
It's so hideously destructive.

355
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,220
There is no punchline.

356
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,640
There's a long line to the punch bowl, and we're going to be...

357
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,100
Yes, call us.

358
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,680
Can you believe that?

359
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,480
You're awake listening to this show, and we don't have any punchline.

360
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,280
Call 848-4425.

361
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,600
Well, the no-callers fit the no-punchline show here at 848-4425.

362
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:04,640
If my butt had a dog like yours, I'd shave its movie and make its book walk backwards.

363
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,820
I'd make book that that jayner could walk backwards over hot coals and still gather a fond clientele.

364
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,480
Whatever you do, don't let him talk on the show.

365
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,160
Right.

366
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,360
Well, he talks all the time.

367
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,680
He can't stop it.

368
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,940
I'm trying not to let him.

369
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,680
Okay.

370
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,160
Really, I mean, he hasn't really said that much.

371
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,040
Well, Mr. Jayner, if that is your name, how do you find our fair city?

372
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:32,560
Well, I just, uh, I took a ride at Albuquerque and went halfway around the globe, and there it was.

373
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,260
We understand that you had lunch with some of the Bon Tons sat down in our beautiful sister city of Los Angeles.

374
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,540
Well, that's true.

375
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,240
Uh...

376
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,260
I had to tell Dr. Leary and Larry Flint not to be very nervous around me.

377
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,860
All you folks out there think this is a joke, and yet it's unbelievably true.

378
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,240
And yet it is kind of a joke at the same time.

379
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,040
Yeah, it's funny. Life's like that.

380
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,900
It doesn't matter.

381
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,860
When you're crying.

382
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,400
And yet I feel that sometimes I don't even know myself.

383
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,040
Henry, what's the matter?

384
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,220
Suppose you found yourself at the edge of a labyrinth.

385
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,980
Or better still, a dark forest.

386
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,540
And you believed there was a great secret hidden inside, perhaps a wonderful secret.

387
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:31,300
But there was a danger that even if you discovered it, you might get lost and never find your way out again.

388
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,900
Would you go forward into the forest?

389
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,440
I believe in everything.

390
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,920
And that sounds weird to say that you believe in everything.

391
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,180
But if you believe in nothing, that's pretty vast.

392
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,620
Yes, I mean, it's something to think about, you know.

393
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,240
And if somebody thinks that they know the truth and somebody else don't, dear hearts, they only got half of it.

394
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,740
See, you got to weigh them thoughts because they're weird.

395
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:06,720
But I know that life is good, and I love life, and I love to live it, and I believe between swinging and not swinging is what moves us.

396
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:16,580
Yes, there have been those folks who have been bound in the round who would occasionally be tended to put those down who they considered to be in the square.

397
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,180
But, dear hearts, it's neither those in the round or the square, but the spiral.

398
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,800
Yes, that leads toward the top of the stair.

399
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,320
Rejoice.

400
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
Love your enemies and drive them nuts.

401
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,500
Share it with a total stranger.

402
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,480
Love your enemies.

403
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:36,880
You're supposed to love your enemies.

404
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:36,880


405
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,080
You're supposed to give it to your friends.

406
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,860
Yes, dear hearts, I believe in love.

407
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,600
I believe love is good.

408
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,080
And I believe if there's anything bad in the world, a preacher's going to find it first.

409
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,800
Let them have it.

410
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,060
We'll just do these good things.

411
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,840
Of course, I mean, I love preachers.

412
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,640
I mean, they mean well.

413
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,640
They got their own kick going.

414
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,300
And somebody said, Brother Dave, says, you know, say, why don't you be a preacher?

415
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,520
You could make a million dollars.

416
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,960
Dear hearts, what would a preacher spend, you know?

417
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,140
You know, what would a preacher spend on the world?

418
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,140


419
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,140


420
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,140


421
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,140


422
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,140


423
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,140


424
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:15,520
Well, anyhow, this is weird that we are gathered in this celestial realm and moving into another

425
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:15,840
dimension.

426
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,180
And I believe that the mind is something.

427
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,300
When we leave the realm of dualities, that's when we commence to sway.

428
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,840
It's neither the stroke of the pendulum as it goes to and fro, but the essence that drives

429
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,980
it that makes us go.

430
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,640
See?

431
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,160
And that is known as hard sayings.

432
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,400
Oh, yes.

433
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,760
They have been going for years.

434
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,500
Now, you couldn't explain to somebody or let them know anything if they had never.

435
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,040
No, if they had never thought of it, I don't think they would.

436
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,060
Exactly. Let them choose for themselves.

437
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,420
But are they really capable, Jane?

438
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,100
But what do we really know of freedom?

439
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,960
My God, if real freedom were offered to you, you'd run for cover.

440
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,660
You'd hide. You'd be terrified.

441
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,340
But I thought I was free.

442
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,380
I mean free to do whatever you pleased.

443
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,860
What if I followed my every instinct completely?

444
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,120
You mean absolutely no rules, no laws?

445
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,680
No laws, no proprieties, no holds barred.

446
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,920
I see a piece of food I want, I take it.

447
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,120
Henry, please.

448
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,880
I see a woman I want, I take her as well.

449
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,240
Hold on, Jekyll.

450
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,260
You all act as if our manners, our morality were handed down to us by God.

451
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,600
But they are.

452
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,100
No, madam, they're not. We made them up by mutual agreement.

453
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,740
But what if I don't agree? What then?

454
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,340
I clap you in irons and throw you in prison.

455
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,220
Straight off.

456
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,380
You'll have to catch me first.

457
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,720
Actually, I don't believe there's no such thing as a multitude.

458
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,860
I believe we're all individuals.

459
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,800
Of course, I ain't knocking your blade.

460
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,180
I mean, don't tell me about none of your doubts.

461
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,480
I've got enough doubts of my own. Tell me something you believe in.

462
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,760
I believe in love.

463
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,440
And when I talk about love, I don't mean the kind of love

464
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,920
like when a 19-year-old boy kissed an 18-year-old girl.

465
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,760
Dear hearts, that ain't love, that's emotion.

466
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,560
But when that same 19-year-old boy kissed a 49-year-old girl,

467
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,440
whoo, dear hearts, that's love.

468
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,820
How many of you got a friend to talk to?

469
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,720
After long search, research, apparently profound cognition,

470
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,380
come up with exactly the same answer.

471
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,600
One, that there are other universes interrelated with ours,

472
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,640
both time-wise and or space-wise.

473
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,820
Two, that these may be infinite in number.

474
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,140
Three, that some, if not all of them,

475
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,580
have as intrinsic items of their makeup, intelligences.

476
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,800
Four, that some of them at least learned long ago

477
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,740
how to come through to us and go back where they came from.

478
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,520
Five, that some of these, the intelligences,

479
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,700
are millions of years ahead of us in material technology

480
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,380
and also by way of understanding of reality and finality.

481
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,680
That some of these have controlled us in our whole evolution,

482
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,840
since ever.

483
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:07,360
It all sounds very much like the novelization of Clarke and Kubeck's 2001.

484
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,660
The

485
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,920
The

486
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,200
The

487
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,400
The

488
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:17,980
The

489
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,080
The

490
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,460
, That Seas

491
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,180
Subtitle, possible by Tony

492
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,440
Bob is fill in the blank.

493
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,980
Bob is fill in the blank.

494
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,660
The Bob that can be described as not the true Bob.

495
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,440
He's a trickster. Obviously, look at his face.

496
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,060
You know, what's in the pipe that he's smoking?

497
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:15,160
And what is this game that Bob Dobbs represents?

498
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,100
We're about to get back, back into the world without slack,

499
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,560
as if we ever left it.

500
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:30,980
But excerpts from the novel in progress, chapter four, by Palmer Reades.

501
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:40,660
As Bob Dobbs said in Divine Secrets of Sales, lecture 13013,

502
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,420
I may not know reality, but I know what I like.

503
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:51,100
Also, as Nellie Connolly said to John Kennedy seconds before the assassination

504
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,140
on November 22, 1962,

505
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,540
you can't say Dallas doesn't love you now.

506
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,140
Stang and Dobbs had set up temporary headquarters

507
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,900
for their collection of followers

508
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,780
in an old burger chef on the west end of things.

509
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,900
It was bad ground.

510
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,340
Lots of Dallas industry had left behind lots of bad chemistry.

511
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,940
Add the BZ gas and the nerve weapon residue from the end time,

512
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,280
and it made for us.

513
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,380
Sweet stew.

514
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,440
Just what Bob liked to eat for breakfast.

515
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,060
It took Wellman and Spam Duvalier almost a whole day

516
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,820
in a case of metal-piercing ammunition to reach the temple.

517
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:43,220
The aftermath of shake-up riots had left most of the roadways impassable,

518
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,260
even by their military vehicle, a Cadillac gauge Terminator.

519
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,740
Spam had insisted that they fully arm their transport,

520
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,180
so they were now backed up by an Orla-Con,

521
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:59,020
a 20mm electric cannon, an 81mm mortar, assorted grenade launchers,

522
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,840
and all the spare gear they could cram into the armored cabin.

523
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,260
Duvalier had never used any heavy rock and roll gear before

524
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,560
and had to spend the first couple of hours alternately deciphering

525
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,100
and cursing the Arabic manuals while Wellman drove.

526
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,160
Some rapture.

527
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,620
Most of the Christians had been killed in the first ten minutes of the Second Coming.

528
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,540
Gnostics seemed to have been immune somehow, but there'd never been great danger.

529
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:27,440
The number of these in Texas, so the body count here had been somewhat extreme.

530
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,000
Dallas had bragged of being the most Christian city in America.

531
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,420
The pious had asked for the cleansing fires of Jehovah,

532
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,660
and their prayers were answered...

533
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,180
in spades.

534
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,720
When Jesus Christ himself turned out to hate Christians,

535
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:47,340
every last one of his welcoming flock was sent to an unexpected reward.

536
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,420
Quickly.

537
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,040
With pain.

538
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,520
It hadn't done the city of love any good.

539
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,540
But at least it wasn't underwater like Houston.

540
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,460
All the urban freeways had been blown in a last-ditch attempt by the Dallas PD

541
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,420
to contain the remaining terror-stricken populace in the trouble areas.

542
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,740
It hadn't worked.

543
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,840
The city-wide panic had been ignited by the grisly sight of believers dissolving and disintegrating,

544
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,900
shrieking as they rose into the blue Texas sky.

545
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,020
With most of their senior tacticians recalled to sudden glory,

546
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,520
the remaining cops were overwhelmed by the terror.

547
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,820
The city was overwhelmed by swarms of hysterical and heavily armed citizens,

548
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:32,300
attempting to flee the effects of what they must surely have thought was a sneak attack by the Soviets,

549
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,160
trying out some fiendish flesh-melting secret weapon.

550
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:41,400
The shaft of horrible green light stabbing down from the heavens fifty miles to the west

551
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,680
didn't help to calm things down much either.

552
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:50,480
More often than not, wellmen and spam would suddenly find the street down which they were traveling

553
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,040
blocked by crumbling makeshift barricades,

554
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,480
and rooftop snipers.

555
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:58,520
Grim reminders of Christmas still adorned much of the wreckage.

556
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,920
The smashed, fried Santas hanging from bent streetlights

557
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,960
were a grotesque memory of more stable times,

558
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,700
all the more so as they alternated with weathered corpses dangling from phone poles.

559
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:17,820
Rooters and civilian militia had tied them down in Dealey Plaza for the better part of an afternoon.

560
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,540
Holed up in the wreckage of the Hyatt Regency,

561
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,020
a few paranoid locals had gotten hold of them,

562
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,480
and had harassed the slow-moving scout car for an hour or so,

563
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,060
playing tag by lobbing poorly-aimed 40mm shells at them from just out of their view.

564
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,780
Things had been dicey until wellmen had managed to put the X-ray laser back together.

565
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:43,240
After that, a few sweeps of the hotel garage and reunion tower with the invisible beam

566
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,440
had instantly silenced their assailant's barrage.

567
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:52,220
Doug Two's talent for breaking equipment had almost cost them their lives several times that day.

568
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:59,020
No strangers to Dallas, the pair had always joked in the past

569
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,860
about the shining glass offices of downtown,

570
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:09,120
about how the monstrous colored rectangles reflected the hellishly hot rays of Texas noon sun

571
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,440
back and forth between their tinted finishes,

572
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,560
each new refraction angle making the beams a little bit more coherent,

573
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:22,380
a little bit stronger until, at some unoccupied focal point where all the invisible beams intersected,

574
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,600
20 feet or so above the middle of State Street,

575
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:30,320
there was a single square inch of space with the surface temperature of a small star

576
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,240
able to vaporize anything moving across it.

577
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,760
God help the pigeons that flew around down there.

578
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:43,180
The pigeons had long ago all been caught and eaten by the starving citizens of Dallas.

579
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,220
Wellman and Duvalier should have known better than to make jokes.

580
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,500
The men in black had warned the strike team of the psychic violence

581
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,940
the area seemed to exude and of its effects on organics.

582
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,120
They told them that the mirrored angles of the banks and hotels

583
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,740
compounded this urge to self-destruction

584
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,560
and that the geometry of the downtown area was itself an illness

585
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,000
planned long ago by now dead rebel architects.

586
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,940
They noted that this rationality sapping phenomenon was strongest right around city center.

587
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:19,760
This effect was so intense in Fort Worth that the excess didn't even bother trying to save it,

588
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,480
just cooked the place down.

589
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,520
The city was torn down to slag first thing off.

590
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,360
With most of the mirrors long since shattered,

591
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:31,540
the steel girders of the buildings themselves still held dismal power.

592
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,740
Oh what a holy day it must have been when the razor sharp shards of glass

593
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,760
rained down upon the crowds emptying back out into the streets,

594
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,100
slicing and dicing office workers still too pink,

595
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,240
still too sheep-like and obedient to think of jaywalking even at the cost of their lives.

596
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:58,060
The men in black lent the two the best blank brain filters available,

597
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,900
but it was still depressing.

598
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,580
Spam and Doug squabbled away the whole time

599
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,600
like some demented survivalist rewrite of The Bickersons.

600
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,720
As for the rest of Dallas,

601
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:14,240
the city that shoots presidents and shoots the people that shoot presidents,

602
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,780
nothing remained.

603
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,740
Block after block of ruins stretching away for miles,

604
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,480
the fires had raged on,

605
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,680
the streets were washed out of control for weeks,

606
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,100
dead cars filled the streets and collapsed freeways,

607
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,700
all frozen in their tracks when the first electromagnetic pulse

608
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,660
from the war saucer had reached them,

609
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,660
frying out their generators and burning up the wiring.

610
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,540
Many vehicles had grizzly and impressive holes punched through the roof,

611
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,020
where bone and flesh had temporarily met metal

612
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,340
on their unstoppable journeys to the sun

613
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,840
when the imperative calling to eternity had beckoned.

614
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,200
The horizon lay mostly flat,

615
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,280
broken only by the randomly placed skeletons of lonely office towers,

616
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,380
counterpointing the lazy drift of fluffy yellow clouds above.

617
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,700
The matte gray M4000 finally pulled up to Aftermath Central.

618
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,840
Victor Street, indeed.

619
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,180
Ha! You could still see the giant cement hamburger.

620
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,420
A junk food god, it figured as much.

621
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,020
The newsletter had promised a force field and a mansion.

622
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,920
You can't believe everything you read,

623
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,080
Duvalier reflected.

624
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:26,260
It didn't look like Stang had any 50,000 Bobzoids to command, either.

625
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,660
More lies.

626
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,160
Wellman stopped the tank and gave Duvalier a funny look.

627
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,200
All out for Buldada Time Control Laboratories.

628
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:42,080
They checked their handguns and hopped out onto the back parking lot of the gods.

629
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,160
That's what the faded sign said it was, anyway.

630
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,380
The subgenius foundation that was being presented to the 20-buck bobbies

631
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,260
didn't look so grand these days.

632
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,060
Spam kicked in the service entrance door,

633
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,040
calculated to be an impressive action,

634
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,720
but actually an easy feat.

635
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,760
Acid rain had eaten away the hinges a while back.

636
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,080
Had eaten everything away a while back.

637
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,380
As the rotted slab fell inward,

638
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,700
Duvalier moved quickly,

639
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,640
Wellman covering him with his MAC-10 and following his point.

640
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,040
The building was seemingly deserted, had been for months.

641
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,780
Dust and grit covered everything in a fine layer.

642
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,220
With no other footprints to give away signs of prior occupation,

643
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,240
they broke trail through the walk-in cooler

644
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,700
and continued their search for the missing Avatar and his second-in-command.

645
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,660
They walked past the large, uncomfortable cages

646
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,340
in which Ivan made his synthetic superheroes sleep.

647
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,860
They had been used to store potatoes in more normal times.

648
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,220
Now the bins appeared empty as they approached.

649
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,260
Duvalier wasn't so sure.

650
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,120
Invisibility was one of the first things a subgenius learns to manifest.

651
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,180
To think this used to be a food preparation.

652
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,800
He thought, looking into the wooden boxes that served as the mating areas

653
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,260
in their disgusting rituals and recoiling at the site.

654
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,060
Invisible, the overmen might well be,

655
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,560
but their mucus was strictly first-plane.

656
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,140
The stains alone made him sick.

657
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,920
Another dead end we should have known better,

658
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,960
Duvalier swore, breaking the silence.

659
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,540
He spat on the floor and leaned against the peeling formica counter.

660
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,760
I should have expected something like this.

661
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,320
Wait till I get my hands on Sterno.

662
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:17,780
I'll make it.

663
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:21,440
A multicolored furball the size of a watermelon

664
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,400
floated out from behind a broken deep fryer.

665
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,060
As they watched, it unfolded in thin layers

666
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,140
until nothing but a pipe, now familiar,

667
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,720
hung motionless before them at eye level.

668
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,700
Cut the crap, Dobbs.

669
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,780
They were both irritated at his moronic level of mysticism.

670
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,780
Ever since the retreat,

671
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,900
Bob had been showing more and more signs of strain.

672
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,720
Any follower unfortunate enough to be in his presence

673
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,600
suffered a constant barrage of the sleazy magic tricks

674
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,060
that those autistic aliens had taught the salesman of slack

675
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,000
while he was off-planet being transformated.

676
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,580
The pipe had now turned orange,

677
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,940
and the smell of cheeseburgers permeated the gutted kitchen.

678
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,440
Cheeseburgers!

679
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,700
There hadn't been an edible cow alive for five years,

680
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,960
not since the ozone layer had been wiped away.

681
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,500
Most cows had gone the way of the dinosaurs,

682
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,860
excepting the few swollen with cancers

683
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:15,660
and blinded by the constant shower of deadly ultraviolet.

684
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,580
Along with thousands of spiders,

685
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,340
and a species of birds, plants, and animals.

686
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,400
Through their usual inimitable stupidity,

687
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,460
the humans had been well on their way to fossil history

688
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,760
even without the aid of the Space Brothers' Jihad Squad.

689
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:34,440
A ghostly background noise of grill hoods and Muzak faded in.

690
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,860
The faint sounds of dishes clattering and waitresses ordering QB bread

691
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,900
and number six specials could be heard.

692
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,240
May I help you?

693
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,180
The voice. It was Bob, all right.

694
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,260
Dobbs was speaking in Moe Howard's voice,

695
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,760
but it still contained all the charisma of the salesman's erratic personality.

696
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,340
Yeah, I'll have a large fries and a Coke, jerk, Willeman shot back.

697
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,200
Jeez, Bob, give me some slack. Where's Philo?

698
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,360
We were supposed to trade him in for a shipment of the pills, remember?

699
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,120
Yesterday? It only almost got us killed when Drummond didn't show.

700
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:12,160
The posse coma taught us didn't appreciate our deal falling through like that.

701
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,160
Never mention Jesus in my burger shop.

702
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,320
The non-answer set Doug's mustache twitching.

703
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,920
Dobbs, I get the feeling you're not hearing me, as we used to say in California.

704
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,960
86 the blather or punch out and go home.

705
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,840
Willman's exasperation with the situation was clearly growing by the second.

706
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,040
He foolishly started to bring the muzzle of his machine pistol up to the hovering pipe.

707
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:39,860
Instantaneously, the fast food church filled with bright blue water

708
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,980
and little goldfish that all looked like Bob.

709
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,160
Their miniature pipes trailing smoke as they squished through the air.

710
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:46,960
The smoke was still around the room.

711
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,640
Another hallucination.

712
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,460
Spam and Willman paid no attention to the distraction upon finding themselves still able to breathe in spite of being submerged.

713
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,840
Spam swatted at one of the deformed things when it swam too close to his face,

714
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,960
the action dissolving the creature as his hand passed through it.

715
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,900
Dobbs always misses some detail, he told Willman.

716
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,080
That's the problem with this inane religion.

717
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,280
At least the aliens are methodical.

718
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,000
Pills? Pills? Pills!

719
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,480
We are very attractive by most discriminating standards.

720
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,200
I am bi and very sensitive.

721
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,940
Good clean sex is all I'm after.

722
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,720
A little pain, a little kink.

723
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,200
Pills! Pills! Pills!

724
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,640
Bob, calm down, it's okay. We don't need to know where Philo is right now.

725
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,520
Who cares? Slack, right? Slack. Slack. Slack. Slack.

726
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,000
The water had changed into pills. Mounds of them.

727
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,440
The kitchen had filled with gleaming transparent pills.

728
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,980
The two men were waist deep in waves of glittering,

729
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,440
capsules. Bob had come through.

730
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:52,060
Willman was scooping them from the counters and shoving them into his mouth as fast as he could,

731
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,800
washing them down with more pills.

732
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,780
The payoff. Tens of thousands of the pills.

733
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,580
Even Duvalier was taken in by the sight.

734
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,540
They could stop looking for the saucer.

735
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,880
Both of them were set up for pre-life.

736
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,200
The pills disappeared, of course.

737
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,800
And their place was Dobbs, casual as a pimp,

738
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,960
grinning like some demented television game show.

739
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,640
What a clown.

740
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,320
Willman, face white with shock,

741
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,260
looked up from the floor, screaming,

742
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,460
fingers grasping at vacant air.

743
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:30,400
Damn smokin' Wiseacre ghost son of a bitch salesman!

744
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,960
Upon finding his cheeks and hands suddenly empty,

745
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,940
he went berserk, raising his automatic,

746
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,420
and emptied a full clip point blank into Dobbs' chest,

747
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,400
walking the shot straight up the wide red power tie.

748
00:45:50,680 --> 00:46:13,280
It was the greatest soccer game show for aavin four years.

749
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,940
The автомобiles formally predict that the audition will take place

750
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:14,940


751
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,440
Oh, yes.

752
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,460
Dear friends.

753
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:39,880
Ha, ha, ha.

754
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,540
Ha, ha, ha.

755
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,060
Come back, Bob.

756
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:51,660
And friends, you can get Bob to come back by writing, once again, for the free information,

757
00:46:52,820 --> 00:47:02,160
Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

758
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,860
And, uh, I think it's time, well, what is it time for?

759
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,820
A little song, maybe?

760
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,100
Hmm.

761
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,380
Nah.

762
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:21,080
We've got exactly ten minutes left, and that's just long enough for Papa Joe Mama.

763
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,580
Hello, friends, and welcome.

764
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:32,140
Tonight's sermon is entitled, Bob Means Laugh.

765
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,860
Bob Means Laugh.

766
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,480
You see, we at the church,

767
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,640
we get so absorbed with the nuts and balls of the church

768
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,180
that we often forget a cornerstone of Bob's teaching.

769
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,800
That cornerstone is this.

770
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:00,640
Bob said, laugh, even if they don't get it.

771
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,440
That's good news, friends.

772
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,840
Bob says, laugh, even if they don't get it.

773
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,580
Now, in the wake of Bob's assassination,

774
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,900
in the web,

775
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,220
in the anti-Bob's conspiracy,

776
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:17,260
and in the business-as-usual wholesale slaughter of Bob's beliefs,

777
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,160
Bob's church,

778
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,100
Bob's chosen,

779
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,760
and yes, even the deprogramming of a prophet or two,

780
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,060
not to mention the assets.

781
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,140
Damn, I wasn't gonna mention that.

782
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:29,840
In the wake of all this, it's easy for us to forget Bob's blessed news.

783
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,100
But that doesn't change the fact that he did say it.

784
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,960
Laugh, even if they don't get it.

785
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,940
Bob said it, I believe it, and that's the end of it, friends.

786
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,000
That's what most of you should be saying now.

787
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,000
But even those of you who do get it won't use it when you're supposed to.

788
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:49,680
Why?

789
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,840
Why is that, friends?

790
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:57,320
What did Bob mean when he said, laugh, even if they don't get it?

791
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,020
Did he mean laugh when you witness something funny?

792
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:03,880
Sure.

793
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,940
Just because Bob's a god doesn't mean everything he says doesn't make sense.

794
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:09,900
No, sir.

795
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,400
When Bob says laugh,

796
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,600
he means just that, laugh.

797
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,140
But does he mean laugh only when you witness something funny?

798
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,080
I don't know, friends.

799
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,580
He's dead now.

800
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,880
And all the excitement, I forgot to ask him.

801
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,580
But I have a feeling that if I had, he would have answered with just one word,

802
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:34,900
one simple two-syllable word whose simplicity masks its incredible ramifications.

803
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,740
A two-syllable word that means the same thing all over the world,

804
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:46,460
in every conceivable language, be it English, German, Polish, Jewish, black, Hispanic, or

805
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,520
what have you, a universal word all over this world.

806
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,360
Bob, spit it out.

807
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,300
No, no, not the blood, the answer.

808
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,000
What do you mean by laugh, even if they don't get it?

809
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:02,720
He waves you closer, friends, so you can hear him, and then whispers that two-syllable word,

810
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,960
ha, ha.

811
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:10,000
And then defecates in death, as most people do, except in this case it's holy shit.

812
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:10,720
Now, that's okay.

813
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,740
It's only a scenario, friends.

814
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,740
Bob did not say that.

815
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,920
We're just imagining what he could have said.

816
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:21,440
But we do know he did say, at least according to one witness, quote, forgive them, for they

817
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,040
still don't get it.

818
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,580
What did he mean by that?

819
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,500
I don't know.

820
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,440
I wouldn't tell you if I did.

821
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,380
That's not the topic.

822
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,460
The topic tonight is laugh, even if they don't get it.

823
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,880
You see, Bob could have just said laugh and left it at that.

824
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,620
Or he might have said laugh.

825
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,000
Laugh, but only when it's funny.

826
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,580
But he didn't say that.

827
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,740
Or if he did, no one around heard him.

828
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,640
Or if they did hear him, they forgot it.

829
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,400
Bob might have also said forgive them, for they still don't get it.

830
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:53,620
In fact, he did say that, at least according to one witness.

831
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,160
But I already said that's not the topic.

832
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,860
The topic is Bob said laugh, even if they don't get it.

833
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,280
Glory be.

834
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,260
Praise Bob.

835
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:07,540
He wants us to laugh, not just when it's funny, even when it's not funny, at least according

836
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,260
to some folks, maybe even yourself.

837
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,740
He didn't say you have to get it to laugh.

838
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,640
He didn't say they had to get it to laugh.

839
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,900
He just said laugh, even if they don't get it.

840
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,200
And you can be they as easily as they can be them.

841
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,680
Laugh, even if you don't get it.

842
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,860
As long as someone else doesn't get it, friends, you can't read minds.

843
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,440
But if you don't get it, it's safe to assume they don't.

844
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,960
Or if they do and don't laugh, even if you don't get it but do laugh, then you're just

845
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,580
laughing for them getting it when they don't laugh.

846
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,620
It's that simple.

847
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,200
Do you realize what this means, friends?

848
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,060
In terms of your everyday struggle?

849
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,280
Against that force the conspiracy calls reality?

850
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:47,140
It means you can drive home tonight and swerve to avoid a bird, plow head on into the oncoming

851
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,960
convertible, kill the honeymoon couple inside, then drive home in order to call the police,

852
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,580
leave the damaged but still running car in your garage, fall asleep on the bed from exhaustion

853
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:58,260
and shock, only to wake with a terrible headache and discover the car's poison and fumes have

854
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,860
suffocated your entire family and probably caused you irreversible brain damage.

855
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,740
All that and you still have the peace of mind to pick up the phone, call the sheriff, and

856
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,120
ask him if he does free delivery.

857
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,700
Bob says laugh, even if they don't get it.

858
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,860
Let me tell you a sad story.

859
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,640
It's a true story.

860
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,120
I don't like to tell it.

861
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,700
I've only told it, oh, maybe 200 times in my entire life.

862
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,800
You see, it's about my younger brother named Benny.

863
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,980
I love my younger brother.

864
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,940
Way back in 1980, it was August 11th.

865
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,140
I'll never forget the time.

866
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,200
It was exactly 12.

867
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,980
No, actually, I guess it was 1.

868
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,100
I don't remember.

869
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,220
I think it was 2.30 in the afternoon when the phone rang.

870
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,540
Woke me up as usual.

871
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,100
Voice said, Joe, it's Benny.

872
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,660
Didn't sound like Benny.

873
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,480
In fact, it was my mama.

874
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,760
She said, he's been hit in a car accident.

875
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,300
He needs his nap.

876
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:52,380
Right now.

877
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:53,960
Not later, but now.

878
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,180
Well, I took the next flight out, friend.

879
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,800
But of course, I started to feel guilty, so I turned around, came back, and joined the

880
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,820
rest of the family at the hospital.

881
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,520
Benny was on life support unconsciously.

882
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,880
Have you ever seen anybody?

883
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,460
You know, unconscious on life support?

884
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:10,960
Me neither.

885
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,420
Not until that day.

886
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,340
But I can still see him now.

887
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,660
And I'll tell you what, it's a sobering image.

888
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,300
I remember thinking to myself, this is terrible.

889
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,040
How could Bob let this happen to me?

890
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,520
Does Bob really exist?

891
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,140
Am I worshiping the wrong Bob?

892
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:26,140
Why me?

893
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:27,100
Why me?

894
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:30,240
And then I realized that wasn't me asking those questions.

895
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,860
It was the evil, sinister, anti-Bob.

896
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,620
He was making me doubt.

897
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,780
He was down there in my subgenius, subconscious, calling out.

898
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:39,800
Go on, Bob's his laugh.

899
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,520
Where's your sense of humor now?

900
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,460
Where's your sense of devotion now?

901
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,980
I think it's hilarious.

902
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:46,020
Ha ha.

903
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,240
What's the matter?

904
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,060
Having doubts?

905
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:54,040
The doctors interrupted my thoughts and asked me if I wanted to tell my brother anything

906
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,200
while there was still time.

907
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,600
I didn't know what to say.

908
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,620
But they started to lift the crumpled up plastic so I could slip my head close to his ear and

909
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:03,160
whisper anything.

910
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:07,760
When I got underneath there, all of a sudden, my eyes swelled up.

911
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:07,760


912
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:07,760


913
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,640
My nose started to run.

914
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,360
I could barely breathe.

915
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,880
Benny had farted something awful.

916
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,060
Just the thought of it now makes my nose water.

917
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,260
Would you believe?

918
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,200
They still don't get why I laugh so hard.

919
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,260
But that's okay, friends.

920
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:26,900
That's okay.

921
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,640
Because Bob knows.

922
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,540
And somewhere up there, friend, so does Benny.

923
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,600
Praise Bob.

924
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:42,880
Oh, that's so sad and touching.

925
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:46,840
Well, friends, I guess we're going to be moving out of here pretty quick.

926
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:52,780
I'm going to get out on this short song here, Talking Interface Blues by Greg Keeler.

927
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:58,520
But before I do that, I just want to mention, as a service from the Nihilistic Anarchist

928
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:05,240
Gynecologist Society, NAGS for short, who says Bush is taking away our right to choose?

929
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:06,100
Right.

930
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:06,180
Right.

931
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:10,080
President Bush at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C.

932
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,680
And ask for your free coat hanger abortion kit.

933
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,100
We care about your freedom.

934
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,320
Thank you.

935
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:21,020
This has been the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

936
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,060
And good night.

937
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,680
Well, our wedding was high tech, or my life was wrecked.

938
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,280
We synthesized an organ and a flute.

939
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,080
You know, we were just talking about the fact that we were married.

940
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:36,080


941
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:42,120
Instead of holy men, they rolled in an IBM and it asked, do you or do you not compute?

942
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:46,820
I bought her flowers for her hair and lacy underwear.

943
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,020
Learned Pascal and basic just for her.

944
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,880
When she showed me her spreadsheet, our program was complete.

945
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,140
You should have heard my hardware start to whir.

946
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:04,500
But she's gone waltzing off to Texas with some hacker out of Reno who just nibbled Hera's

947
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,980
software on a dime store.

948
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:06,060
I'm not sure.

949
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:06,820
It was a floppy disk.

950
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,800
She called him user friendly, then pulled out a gun to end me.

951
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:13,720
Shot the mouse right off my apple when she missed.

952
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,320
Years back I took her from her mom.

953
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:24,380
When I returned from Vietnam, she upgraded all my systems just to pull the plug on me.

954
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,320
Now whether Lisa Mac or PC, all I see is charging VC.

955
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,240
I don't even have to log on no siree.

956
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:36,060
Guess with her Hayes macromodem, she'd seduce and then down the line.

957
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:36,060


958
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:36,060


959
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:36,060


960
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:41,620
load them her interface could print the chrome right off the trailer hitch she said that i was

961
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:49,420
sexist a complete edit this rexist in short i was one lost son of a bitch till she went waltzing off

962
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:55,600
to texas with that hacker out arena who just nibbled harrah's software on a dime store floppy

963
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:01,760
disc she called him user friendly then pulled out a gun to end me shot the mouse right off my apple

964
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,700
when she missed

965
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:27,960
the other evening she rode home through the modem on my phone she said her input output was online

966
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:32,520
but i was totally dismayed when she bragged about

967
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:32,680
it

968
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:39,520
and said his bit looked like a bite compared to mine so she's gone waltzing off to texas with

969
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:45,880
that hacker out arena who just nibbled harrah's software on a dime store floppy disc she called

970
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:52,000
him user friendly then pulled out a gun to end me shot the mouse right off my apple when she missed

971
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,760
shot the mouse right off my apple when she missed

972
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,480
born to humble parents somewhere in the midwest

973
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:31,520
the child bob experienced a traumatic close encounter with a ufo at the age of three soon thereafter he began to exhibit strange powers of persuasion by age six he had made his first million almost by accident in college he met and married his first and still his primary wife connie who is now revered by female subgenie as the blessed anti virgin

974
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,240
ONE Pork eaters

975
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:49,140
if you started wondering why you had to sleep so much

976
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:49,140


977
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,640
mind

978
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,920
where

979
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,300
he was

980
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:01,620
not

981
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:01,620


982
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:01,620


983
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:01,960
he was

984
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:02,460
piling up

985
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:09,960
seized up in the spirit by the hand of Jehovah One itself, the cosmic puppeteer of the Old

986
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:16,940
Testament, the wrathful alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy. In this timeless

987
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:24,000
moment, which we call the divine immaculation of the Bob, Dobbs received the first of countless

988
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:30,500
brain-curdling pronouncements which form the sacred pre-scriptures of the church. He was

989
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:37,060
shown a vision, a world where all humanity was equally wealthy, rich beyond imagining,

990
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:44,260
but without working. This experience, combined with his UFO-given sales magic, led him inevitably

991
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:50,300
into the religion field. He quickly discovered the golden rule embodied in his classic saying,

992
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:57,420
they'll pay to know what they really think. The true subgenius can learn to think for

993
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,480
himself, but only Bob can show him.

994
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:08,760
And so Bob Dobbs founded his church upon a sandy beach of common sense, sense of humor,

995
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,980
and dollars and cents.
