1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
Welcome to the subgenius

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,060
with no power

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,040
of slap

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,160
of slap

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,040
I better try and break it

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,180
These things can do nasty things to the brain if the pitch gets up into ultrasonics

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,380
You like that?

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,540
No, sir

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,400
Just keep thinking about that

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,900
It's almost beyond human understanding

11
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,640
Some fantastic invisible force

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,440
converted two men into jelly

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,440
Human!

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,520
Look, Dan

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,120
Look at this

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,940
Look what it's done

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,800
The whole...

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,480
The whole...

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,700
Just your structure's eaten away

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,760
The bone's powder

21
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,720
So it takes care of my supper tonight

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,000
Bob

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,540
But let's leave things of this world behind

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,060
and walk now down the path of Bob

25
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,020
for this brief minute of slack

26
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,640
from the church of the subgenius

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,340
This is Reverend Ivan Stang

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,820
I'm 31 years old, friends

29
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,160
Not an old man, a young man

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,980
Not too many wrinkles on my face

31
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,080
But I tell you, friend

32
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,920
The wrinkles on my old head

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,340
come not from worrying

34
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,800
but from partying

35
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,660
There's two kinds of people

36
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,880
The kind that gets wrinkles from worrying

37
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,540
and the kind that get them from partying

38
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,460
Now, my gray hairs come from kicks

39
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,560
And I can dig it

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,980
I'm a hip cat

41
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,720
I can enjoy myself

42
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,640
And I believe that's what the Lord God thing, Wotan

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,280
put us on this planet to do

44
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,920
is to enjoy ourselves

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
We were created

46
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,660
Therefore, there must be a reason

47
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,540
Therefore, that reason must be

48
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,480
to have fun and get slack

49
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,500
This is the logic of Bob Dobbs, friend

50
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,280
And it is inescapable

51
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,000
So, you can't enjoy yourself

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,260
if you're a hateful pink boy

53
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,040
who thinks that hurting other people is enjoyable

54
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,360
So, slack for thyself

55
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,800
and slack for others, friends

56
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,480
are not interchangeable

57
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,120
but interconnected

58
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,820
And so we find that there was a consistency

59
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,920
in the word of Bob

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,360
that was not visible before

61
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,620
And of course, it cannot ever be visible

62
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,180
to one who does not have the blood

63
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,620
of the Himalayan Yeti

64
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,400
pulsing through their veins

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
Let there be slack

66
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,240
and there be no

67
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,260
any

68
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,580
any

69
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,740
any

70
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,540
any

71
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,080
any

72
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,300
any

73
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,520
any

74
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:15,640
any

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,040
any any donÃ­t

76
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,900
Just Motorola

77
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,000
Four Blendra

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000


79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,480
to one

80
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,280
cha

81
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,680
to properly

82
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,460
by the Queejibo

83
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,740
Cartel.

84
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,800
Friends, it was

85
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,400
like this.

86
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,660
Welcome

87
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,380
ladies and

88
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,240
gentlemen, brothers

89
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,400
and sisters, friends and

90
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,100
neighbors, local

91
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,400
hits and out of town rubes.

92
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,260
Welcome one and all

93
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,700
to the 2002

94
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,720
Indie Vival.

95
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

96
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,720
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

97
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,320
I am your host,

98
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,460
Pope Fred, and on behalf

99
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,280
of the Queejibo Cartel

100
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,300
and the good citizens of

101
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,720
Indianapolis, Indiana,

102
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,360
I thank you.

103
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,580
I thank you. I really

104
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,100
do. I mean,

105
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,380
it takes a great

106
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,540
and wonderful thing for each

107
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,140
and every one of you to tear

108
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,320
yourselves away from your

109
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,440
mundane lives, to

110
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,660
come out here to buy

111
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,240
expensive drinks

112
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,120
and listen to music that you could

113
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,880
have heard on VH1

114
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,120
or better yet, download

115
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,060
from the internet for

116
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,760
free.

117
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,120
Indeed,

118
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,180
we have stiff

119
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,160
competition from this very

120
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,980
city to take away

121
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,080
your entertainment

122
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,020
dollar. And

123
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,840
in the interest of fairness,

124
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,200
I will give you a bottle sample.

125
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,680
You have a chance

126
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,280
to see the Ray Romano.

127
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,300
Yes.

128
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,100
TV's Ray Romano

129
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,140
from Everybody Loves Raymond

130
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,040
on the 26th

131
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,320
at the Clothes Memorial

132
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,760
Hall for a night of comedy,

133
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,600
comedy, comedy.

134
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,100
This weekend is the last

135
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,880
chance that you'll get to see

136
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,820
Scooby-Doo Live!

137
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,460
Scooby-Doo

138
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,500
Live!

139
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,120
On stage at the Murat

140
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,540
Theater this weekend!

141
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,360
You came here.

142
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,740
Rock, roll, raggy, and deep.

143
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,380
SoundTribe

144
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,200
Sector 9 is playing right

145
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,100
now at the patio.

146
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,520
Really? Really.

147
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,620
He's gone.

148
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,720
We got your ten bucks. Thank you.

149
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,000
Thank you very much.

150
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,600
And lastly,

151
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,040
Indianapolis offers for your

152
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,060
entertainment pleasure

153
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,740
John Mayer at the Murat

154
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,540
Egyptian Room, who has

155
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,680
and I quote,

156
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,680
a solid singing

157
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,500
voice that captivates crowds

158
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,620
and an obvious passion for

159
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,460
creating earnest songs.

160
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:30,880
End quote.

161
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,160
Now you can't beat that.

162
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,780
No siree.

163
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,720
What chance, what chance

164
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,680
does our little dog

165
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,220
and pony show have

166
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,480
against such a veritable

167
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,560
cornucopia of sights,

168
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,960
sounds, and amazement?

169
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,440
None.

170
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,560
Were it not for the fact

171
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,760
that our dog can spout

172
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,940
hellfire rants

173
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,060
that'll curl your nostril hairs

174
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,080
and our pony has been

175
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,100
trained to do things that you can

176
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,360
only see on the internet

177
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,660
or bachelor parties.

178
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,160
Plus,

179
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,180
our kids have hearts.

180
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,920
They care

181
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,060
enough to bring this show

182
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,580
to you.

183
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,340
Care enough to bring

184
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,220
acts as far away from

185
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,600
Pittsburgh if we could.

186
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,080
And we did.

187
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,360
Saint Anne and Sister Helena

188
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,080
Handbasket will give you

189
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,120
more bang for your buck

190
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,500
than any solid singing

191
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,080
voice could muster.

192
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,300
1 Jest

193
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,600
I thought of all the genious

194
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,220
a book why

195
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,040
I thought of Arnold Palmer

196
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,020
and his bleeding head

197
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,320
4ä½ ç¥é

198
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
my time

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,420
and live

200
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:15,720
well

201
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,300
and that they'd share

202
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,080
BEWARE

203
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,320
I thought of that

204
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,320


205
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,320


206
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,320


207
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,320


208
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,320


209
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,320


210
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,320


211
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,320


212
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,320


213
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,320


214
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,320


215
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,320


216
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,320


217
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,320


218
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,320


219
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,680
I thought of all these things and wondered if I cared

220
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,980
I pondered for a while, I pondered through the night

221
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,300
By the next morning I decided they were right

222
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,780
We got rhyme selections in a white array

223
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,060
Chaine, y'all bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, chaine

224
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,160
Ring in the news cause I punch your in mind

225
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,280
Use a microphone like Shazam, use tight

226
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,400
The party people scream, ring, ring, sing, ring

227
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,640
Cause I got a remote for my beat down

228
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,760
Ring in the news cause I punch your in mind

229
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,320
Word

230
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,680
I felt so relieved, it really was a rush

231
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,320
I am so happy that I'm a subgenius

232
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,280
Tired of playing normal and following the herd

233
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,520
I woke the next day to go and spread the word

234
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,700
The people that I talked to, they acted all afraid

235
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,080
They won't even listen unless they're getting paid

236
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,300
I really do hate them, these people hate me

237
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,360
The things of which I speak

238
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,500
They point it and they laugh

239
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,700
They said I was a freak

240
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,780
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak

241
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,700
Tick tock, so socialize

242
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,860
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes

243
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,940
Who in the world do you want to fight?

244
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,880
It's against the system, we should unite

245
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,200
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight

246
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,060
Now I sit here thinking of everything I've said

247
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,300
I really am a Bobby

248
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,340
My face is turning red

249
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,520
I thought I was finished

250
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,740
I wondered what to do

251
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,240
Ready to give it up

252
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,920
I didn't have a clue

253
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,540
Then it all came to me

254
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,200
I really should have known

255
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,620
There are so many like me

256
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,340
I'm really not alone

257
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,900
I found others like me

258
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,800
With whom I could converse

259
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,680
One day the subgenius will rule this universe

260
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,280
Break, break, break, break, break, break

261
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,680
One day the subgenius will rule this universe

262
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:16,720
Break, break, break, break, break, break, break

263
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,060
One day the subgenius will rule this universe

264
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,280
Ladies and gentlemen

265
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,140
Introducing

266
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,680
The man who sort of started this whole thing

267
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,820
A man who is a close personal friend

268
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,160
I love the man

269
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,120
He's the cream of my coffee

270
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,240
The sugar in my tea

271
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,080
The added to my Castella

272
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:50,120
The one, the only, Ivan Stagg!

273
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,360
You sit down there and shut up! Because there's something I have not heard out of you maggots and pukes yet!

274
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,580
Have I heard a god damn praise bop?

275
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,860
Praise who? I don't think I've heard it very loud.

276
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,000
No!

277
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:29,580
Ah, it's starting to sound like music. Like with a beat, it could be like praise bop!

278
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:35,340
Praise bop! Praise bop! Praise god damn bop! Praise bop!

279
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,340
Okay, that's enough. I'm done.

280
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,140
What's wrong with you bunch of bobbies or what?

281
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,820
Jesus Christ, you bunch of religious bananas.

282
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:47,380
Um, friends, well I guess that'll do for this sacred moment of noise. I got y'all yelling a little bit.

283
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:54,820
Friends, welcome to the very first in all history Indianapolis D-Vival. Praise fucking bop!

284
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:02,340
The conspiracy tried to keep us away from this being I can state, but by god we did it anyway!

285
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,560
Now friends, I suppose...

286
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:05,760
...

287
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,400
...this may be the very first subgenius D-Vival for some of you.

288
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,340
And some have come around and heard this sort of comedy thing.

289
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:20,000
Some are going, well, I'm gonna go there and make sure they're as stupid as I've heard.

290
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,100
By god, just so I know once and for all.

291
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:32,060
And when you come to a subgenius D-Vival, sometimes you see these amazing displays of behavior.

292
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,200
Abhorrent, abnormal behavior.

293
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,340
And you go, what the hell does that have to do with anything?

294
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,920
It has to do with Bob!

295
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,840
Well, it doesn't necessarily have to do with...

296
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,060
...have a damn thing to do with Bob!

297
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,560
Because really, all Bob wants for you is SLACK!

298
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,020
Now listen, they get all excited about slack.

299
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,740
Look, how many of you can tell me what slack is, hmm?

300
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,180
Indefinable!

301
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,900
There's someone with the correct definition of slack.

302
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,740
It is absolutely indefinable.

303
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,760
Those who know don't say, and those who say don't know.

304
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,120
As the Hells Angels used to say.

305
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,780
Which makes me think I probably shouldn't be saying that myself anyway.

306
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:16,340
But, um, I will come up and give a longer sermon later.

307
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:25,940
But I wanted to pump the newcomers up with just enough to get you to, well, either come or get frustrated and come back one more later.

308
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,760
So I'm gonna give you a very quick capsule description of this beautiful institution known as the Church of the Subgenius.

309
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,040
Goddamn Jesus!

310
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,560
There are only three things you really need to know, and then you'll have it down.

311
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,580
Bob, slack, and...

312
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,700
...the conspiracy!

313
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:47,280
Boo!

314
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,820
That sounds like I hardly need to explain anything.

315
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,920
But, oh, and the one rule.

316
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,360
There is, you know, most religions rely on an incredible number of rules.

317
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:04,360
Damn, man, I'm so distracted. I'm trying to read his, uh, uh, death sign down there.

318
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:10,460
There's, um, so many religions and things offer you all these complicated sets of rules.

319
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,580
And we do too, but they're all understood to be complete bullshit.

320
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:23,980
Except for the one really serious fucking goddamn rule in the Church of the Subgenius.

321
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,240
That one simple, obvious rule is, of course,

322
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,920
FUCKING IF THEY CAN'T TAKE A JOKE!

323
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,380
And, you know, the...

324
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,780
The damn weird thing about it is,

325
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:41,260
there's every now and then you stumble upon something that sounds like hilarious bullshit in the Church of the Subgenius,

326
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,160
and yet somehow happens to be true.

327
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,880
Well, most of them aren't always true.

328
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,280
But FUCKING IF THEY CAN'T TAKE A JOKE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN LIVE BY!

329
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,960
And in fact, it is the only philosophy you can actually live by.

330
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,280
Now, to give you a capsule summation about this man, Bob,

331
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,140
whose face you've seen in clouds,

332
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,820
tattooed on hookers' butts,

333
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:10,100
and sometimes, some of you have it so embedded on the retinas of your eyes

334
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,520
that even when you blink and close your eyes,

335
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,760
you see that negative version of his hideous, grinning visage.

336
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,940
But I find it hideous because he's my boss, okay?

337
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,060
I know most of you like Bob. I do too.

338
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,720
But imagine, you know, having to...

339
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,760
I have no words for the guy!

340
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,040
Anyway, Bob Dobbs, back in 1953,

341
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,140
founded this Church of the Subgenius

342
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,840
when he discovered...

343
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,300
Well, actually, he didn't discover, but he was...

344
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,940
He had this sort of a vision, my friends.

345
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,220
He was trying to make his own amateur TV set,

346
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,320
and he stepped in a puddle of water,

347
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,040
and GOD HIMSELF grabbed Bob up

348
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,420
and yanked him up by the scruff of the neck

349
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,860
and told him that there was a conspiracy of normal people

350
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,680
who had been robbing away the slack of the weirdos and abnormals

351
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,660
since the dawn of time.

352
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,200
Well, this wasn't actually God saying this.

353
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,960
It was this alien space monster

354
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,360
that has managed to convince most people it dealt with

355
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,780
that it was God over the centuries.

356
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,340
So what's the difference?

357
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,440
And so, and also this creature,

358
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,520
this monster from outer space

359
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,480
who is worshipped as God and Jesus by many people,

360
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:24,900
was...

361
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,840
It told Bob that the world,

362
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,920
the world was going to end July 5th, 1998,

363
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,420
by which fact we know that obviously that date has not come.

364
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,260
The conspiracy is a lot bigger than we thought,

365
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,500
and they started messing with the calendars

366
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,120
and God only knows how long ago.

367
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,040
Anyway, friends, he said,

368
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,280
Bob, I want you to get off your ass

369
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,620
and start yourself a do-it-yourself religion.

370
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,120
I give you a church to found,

371
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,000
not upon a rock,

372
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,180
but upon a sandy shifting beach of hypocrisy, friends.

373
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:56,840
If you don't believe me,

374
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,260
I'm going to give you a beautiful,

375
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,940
beloved hypocrisy,

376
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,920
for where would any religion worth its salt be

377
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,460
without its fair measure of hypocrisy?

378
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,320
It's the only thing that he knows.

379
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,880
Praise the Lord!

380
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,480
And Bob was a salesman before he was a prophet.

381
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,240
He would, in religion,

382
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,340
he decided it was the best product of all

383
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,840
because there was no manufacturing costs at all.

384
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,240
And so he created this disorganized

385
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,480
do-it-yourself religion,

386
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,680
a non-organization

387
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,000
for non-joiners,

388
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,260
which is why there's only about 100 people in here,

389
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,400
not 100,000.

390
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,540
Now, people who are the sinners,

391
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,080
the mutants,

392
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,160
the misfits,

393
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,280
the disbelievers,

394
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,240
or those who will believe anything.

395
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,500
Those are the people who like to draw flies, friends.

396
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,960
Now, here's the thing.

397
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,440
All subgeniuses are, in fact,

398
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,940
completely different from each other.

399
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,960
If you look around this room,

400
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,640
you'll go,

401
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,480
well, some of them are sort of what I expected,

402
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,340
but, ooh, that's my fellow subgenius, you know.

403
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,600
Well, friends, it's true.

404
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,780
The only thing that any of us have in common

405
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,000
is that we have nothing at all in common

406
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,900
with the conspiracy of the normal people.

407
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,760
Now, sometimes I used to feather that and go,

408
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,900
but now the normal people, they can't help it

409
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,160
because they, ah, who cares?

410
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,540
Kill them all anyway!

411
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,020
Let goddess sort them out!

412
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,940
I'm sorry, I have a pagan's t-shirt.

413
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,920
I thought that was real funny.

414
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,580
Let goddess sort them out.

415
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,920
Goddess is peaceful, not like God.

416
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,920
God's all mean and got a beard and lightning bolts, right?

417
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,540
And goddess is round and earth-like and sweet.

418
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,160
Well, then we'll let God kill them all

419
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,260
and let goddess sort them out.

420
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,880
And those who goddess sees

421
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,540
have paid their $30 dues in the church of the subgenius.

422
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,480
That's when that goddess rips her goddess mask off

423
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,980
and says, well, I was actually one of those hideous alien monsters.

424
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,380
And you're saved and you're going to be given the powers of God

425
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,920
and we'll take you up just like all that New Age crap,

426
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,140
except one of those religions has to be right, right?

427
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:08,860
Wrong!

428
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,960
What if it's this one?

429
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,180
Why not?

430
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,160
It's so damn crazy it just might work, you know?

431
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,060
How?

432
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,460
Because, you know, they say you can't beat City Hall.

433
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,780
Ah, well, I suppose.

434
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,380
Same person certainly can't.

435
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,020
Because it's only the crazy people, folks,

436
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,600
who are nutty enough to actually stand up and try to beat City Hall.

437
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,880
And you never know.

438
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,800
Sometimes it actually happens.

439
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,460
It seems too good to be true, though,

440
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,640
and that's why some people don't believe in Bob.

441
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,440
They think, oh, well, I understand.

442
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,620
I get the joke.

443
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,120
I'm not a sub-subgenius.

444
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,720
I get that.

445
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,320
I understand you guys are just making fun of those religious nuts, you know.

446
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,540
You're just pretending to be religious nuts.

447
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:54,820
No!

448
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,900
We are not pretending to be religious nuts, my friend.

449
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,800
You have not seen a religious fanatic lose his mind and lose all perspective

450
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,220
until you've seen a sub-genius in slack.

451
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,700
A sub-genius in slack does not think logically.

452
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,100
He does not think about, well, does it make sense?

453
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,720
Bob said in 1998 the aliens were going to kill the normals

454
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,360
and say that it didn't happen in 1989.

455
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,140
That doesn't make any sense.

456
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,640
Well, fine!

457
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,160
How far would Jesus have gotten if the Christians worried about making sense?

458
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:37,420
How well would yesterday's newspaper sell

459
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,980
if those newspaper editors worried about the news making sense?

460
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,820
My God, that's what it is when people look at the church as sub-genius.

461
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,180
They go, well, that's sub-genius.

462
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,240
That just means people just below a genius.

463
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,700
I don't know if that means they're stuck up or something.

464
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,740
Self-effacing or what?

465
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Friends, it doesn't have anything to do with intelligence.

466
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,600
It has to do with sense, common sense, sense of humor and the all-important dollars

467
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,940
and the harvest.

468
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,180
And friends, Bob did not become the high epop of the church of sub-genius

469
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,400
because he's some smart guy.

470
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,780
I mean, look at him.

471
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,800
He's not smart.

472
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,100
He's got what counts.

473
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,440
Luck, not brains.

474
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,720
How far did brains ever get you on a hot date?

475
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,680
Nowhere!

476
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,400
Even looks don't matter that much nowadays.

477
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,620
It's luck.

478
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,620
Luck being in the right place at the right time.

479
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,240
As Bob said, I'd rather be lucky than good any day.

480
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,700
And as a result, Bob has a power.

481
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,680
The power that other, that popes don't have.

482
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,920
The power to fail.

483
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,120
And yet, every time he fucks up, he makes a million bucks.

484
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:50,060
That's because he walks the path, the true path, the path of least resistance, my friends.

485
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,460
He surfs that path of least resistance.

486
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,480
And now, Bob has the superpower of luck,

487
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:02,440
but he does not have the great god-like power that some better connected deities have.

488
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,020
He cannot forgive your sins.

489
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,540
Because he doesn't give a shit about your piddly little pathetic sins.

490
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,820
He doesn't think you get anything worse than him going to the trouble of having to forgive them.

491
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,760
He won't forgive your sins.

492
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,680
Because he came here to excuse your sins.

493
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,420
He brought not forgiveness, but an excuse.

494
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,900
You don't use Bob as a crutch.

495
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,920
You let Bob use you as a crutch.

496
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,040
You do not ask Bob, hey Bob, what do you smoke in your pipe?

497
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,620
You throw yourself in that pipe.

498
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,120
You let Bob smoke you.

499
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,960
You let Bob light you up, suck you through that pipe into his lungs.

500
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:49,860
You let Bob smoke you.

501
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:49,860


502
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:49,860


503
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,720
You're part of Bob's brain.

504
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,160
You're one of those thoughts that might be the thought that made him get a little wood that minute.

505
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,460
Or it might be the thought that made him want to leave town.

506
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,020
Anyway, friends, that's the good news.

507
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,340
Then there's the conspiracy.

508
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,780
Tomorrow is Hitler's birthday, isn't it?

509
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,780
Speaking of World War II.

510
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,540
Oh my God.

511
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,020
That's 420, dude.

512
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,080
Oh man, 420.

513
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,640
You know what that means?

514
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,960
420, 420.

515
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,640
We're in 420 right now.

516
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,160
Jesus, I'm getting out of this.

517
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,320
I'm a skyscraper, man.

518
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,280
Tomorrow's Hitler's birthday?

519
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,320
Yeah, at 420.

520
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,900
Damn, I didn't get him a car.

521
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,360
Wake Branch Day, Vivian's death day.

522
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,100
I don't think my Nazi uniform fits me anymore.

523
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,560
I was a lot more trim back in my Bundeswehr days.

524
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,020
Well, you know, I'll be seeing our friend Father Joe Mama on Hitler's birthday.

525
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:39,860
Really?

526
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,120
About Saturday night at the Indianapolis Devox.

527
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,420
Papa Joe's coming up to Indianapolis, huh?

528
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:45,980
Yeah.

529
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,560
Wow.

530
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,380
Yes.

531
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,640
What could be more fun than strapping Papa Joe Mama in one of his Nazi suits down and

532
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,980
taking out one of those testicle crushers and just crushing them in front of everybody

533
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,580
and saying-

534
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,740
That's not a Nazi suit and those aren't testicles, Dave.

535
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,400
Oh, okay, okay.

536
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,640
I get them confused.

537
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,200
It's a satirical commentary on fascism.

538
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,380
Okay, but do you-

539
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:11,440
And a damn fine looking subgenius torture commandant outfit.

540
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,640
Yeah, but you should not grow pubic hairs on a commandant's outfit.

541
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,200
Those aren't swastikas.

542
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,360
They're three-legged pies.

543
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,040
They're nightstickers.

544
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,780
Oh, I thought they were.

545
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,000
Okay.

546
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,780
I confused them for pubic hairs once again.

547
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,160
Yeah, people are so ignorant.

548
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,320
They see Nazis everywhere.

549
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,320
It's a Russian uniform that the other folks have.

550
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,160
They wear it often.

551
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,880
Why would people see Nazis anywhere?

552
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,220
Are they having some kind of mass psychosis or something?

553
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,700
What would make them hallucinate Nazis everywhere?

554
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,720
I mean, Nazis, what?

555
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:36,540
Well, that's what I grew up.

556
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:43,200
When I was growing up in the 30s and 40s, that was what I was taught to fear and hate,

557
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,000
were Germans and Japanese.

558
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,340
Now, of course, I'm shiny white.

559
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,340


560
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,340


561
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,340


562
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,340


563
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,340


564
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,340


565
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,340


566
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,600
I'm not wearing my shoes.

567
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,580
It's weird how that's happened.

568
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,060
Thanks, Dink.

569
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:56,120
You see, now that you are tired of being part with these cigarette butts and these electrodes

570
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,060
are not doing too much for you, but you will tell us where the marquee is and you will

571
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,440
tell us very soon.

572
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,500
Oh, oh, oh, what's a marquee?

573
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,180
Oh, oh.

574
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:06,940
I'm sorry.

575
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,140
No, you're not.

576
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,800
You're not in the slightest.

577
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,600
Sorry, Dave.

578
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,200
I'm in the schley bell time.

579
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,740
You say that all the time.

580
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,200
That's a codependency thing.

581
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,320
I'm just trying to make it clear.

582
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,320


583
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,320


584
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,320


585
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,320


586
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,320


587
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,320


588
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,040
I'm still in Christmas, man.

589
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,660
I'm never leaving.

590
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,100
That's it.

591
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,720
I'm interested.

592
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,440
You vomit on Christmas.

593
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,720
Yeah, but sure.

594
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,880
It's one of the few times of the year I get to vomit freely and be complimented on the

595
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,560
colors and also my shades.

596
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,780
Oh, art.

597
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,420
I hate modern art.

598
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,260
So do I, but you know, the lizard people demand it.

599
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,100
Yeah, yeah.

600
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,220
Nazis and lizard people everywhere.

601
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,640
Ah, yes.

602
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,660
From south of the border, the Nazis and the lizard people.

603
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,320
Armageddon.

604
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,320


605
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,320


606
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,320


607
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,320


608
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,120
Brave boys are in Texas ready to attack Mexico City.

609
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,200
The evil empire of the Canadia creatures.

610
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
Look at them.

611
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,060
They have no knowledge of the past, no ambition for the future.

612
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,940
So lucky.

613
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,180
Why would you say something like that?

614
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,820
Can you even imagine what it's like to remember everything?

615
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,320
But it was a good day.

616
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,860
It was worth it to have thousands of people all over America believe because they heard

617
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:28,600
Papa Joe Mama say it on NPR that the church of the subgenius had indeed been behind the

618
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,280
Columbine.

619
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,000
One lie, friends, can be worth a million bucks.

620
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,820
As Bob said, there's no such thing as no PR.

621
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:47,160
And friends, I love just how evil and sick and incorrect politically is that man, Father

622
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,840
Joe Mama!

623
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,240
Wait, wait, wait.

624
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,300
Discerning from the nÃ¤mial commence.

625
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,920
Yes, dear friends, it is true.

626
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,660
The truth puns.

627
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,140
And now good friends, I think it's fair to say if there's a single ally in the world

628
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:17,140


629
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,760
world that we love more than any other?

630
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,620
It's probably got to be

631
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,100
Al-Qaeda.

632
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,960
And they have

633
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,860
a saying over there, friends, and it goes

634
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,660
like this.

635
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,880
He who tells the truth

636
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,860
should keep one foot

637
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,700
in the stirrup.

638
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,920
Now, whether he's talking

639
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,620
about gynecology, I don't know.

640
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,640
On to the sermon.

641
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,740
The sermon tonight

642
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,440
is entitled

643
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,660
Reparations.

644
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,740
Because there has

645
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,440
been a recent movement afoot

646
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,760
to sue various companies,

647
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,600
if not the government itself,

648
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,700
for slavery in the

649
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,980
1800s and before.

650
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,420
Lawyers figure

651
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,580
if they could work around the statute

652
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,300
of limitations and collect

653
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,500
$4 billion for the internment of World War II

654
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,320
Japanese, and then

655
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,200
sidestep the century-old Swiss

656
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,020
banking laws to squeeze out another

657
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,280
$4 billion for Jews who

658
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,240
lost their account numbers,

659
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,120
then some schmuck

660
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,700
should be able to extract

661
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,060
a few billion more from the powers

662
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,980
that be for the

663
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,040
kidnapping, rape, and enslavement

664
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,480
of various African ancestors.

665
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:30,700
So tonight

666
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,840
we're going to examine this controversial

667
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,920
topic and

668
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,120
consider the true ramifications

669
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,060
in regard to

670
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,460
this man, Bob.

671
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,740
Of course, any

672
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,260
subjection,

673
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,960
any genius worth their salt, can tell you

674
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,020
that slavery, the ramifications

675
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,660
for slavery, are

676
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,460
to put it charitably,

677
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,900
a joke.

678
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,020
It's nothing more than a

679
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,100
smokescreen to camouflage

680
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,780
the conspiracies,

681
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,780
ongoing enslavement,

682
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,860
of the masses today. Do I hear

683
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,420
praise Bob?

684
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,780
Praise Bob!

685
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,920
Attention

686
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,900
arguments!

687
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,220
Attention arguments!

688
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,900
Stand by for an important

689
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,760
revelation.

690
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,000
People do not

691
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,880
go to work on a

692
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,180
volunteer basis!

693
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,460
They are

694
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,220
compelled to go

695
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,180
and show up hat in hand

696
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,000
begging to serve

697
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,940
their conspiracy masters or else

698
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,000
they starve in the streets!

699
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,740
Oh sure,

700
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,860
you can call it

701
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,900
employment and come up with

702
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,120
all sorts of fancy, soundy names,

703
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,760
like free enterprise and capitalism

704
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,620
if you want!

705
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,160
Oh, but make no mistake about it,

706
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,020
it's still slavery, plain and simple!

707
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,560
Only now, my friends, they've repackaged it

708
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,220
and put it in a new container.

709
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,700
Now it's wage slavery.

710
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,040
Yes, because the conspiracy eventually realized

711
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,840
a very important little point.

712
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,800
They realized that it's always cheaper,

713
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,840
to rent,

714
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,080
than it is to own.

715
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,080
And we all know how they love to cut costs.

716
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,120
Do I hear praise Bob?

717
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,440
Praise Bob!

718
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,480
Praise Bob indeed!

719
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,780
The old time slaves, my friends,

720
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,920
they were never paid for their work.

721
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,700
Oh, that difference is true.

722
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,840
But they were also given

723
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,940
the bare necessities of life

724
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,940
so that they could survive.

725
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,660
Food, clothing, shelter.

726
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,700
Wage slaves, however,

727
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,380
they're given little pieces of paper,

728
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,320
which they're told are quite valuable,

729
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,620
but which the conspiracy, in fact,

730
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,940
mass produces like toilet paper!

731
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,820
Then, those same workers are expected to turn around

732
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,920
and fork over much of that same little pieces of paper

733
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,500
so that they can buy the same necessities

734
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,000
that they used to be given for free!

735
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,600
Oh!

736
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,680
Plus, they're also expected to give another 20 or 30%

737
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,320
for taxes!

738
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,180
For what?

739
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,140
To the conspiracy in order to control their lives!

740
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:19,780
Yeah!

741
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:20,660
Oh!

742
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,060
And if anyone refuses to pay the conspiracy its tax,

743
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,880
what happens?

744
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,320
It's off to the big house!

745
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,380
The house of pain!

746
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,800
Free enterprise indeed!

747
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,580
But now,

748
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,140
now there's always a certain percentage,

749
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,040
and we all know them too well, don't they?

750
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,460
They're made to be celebrities!

751
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,420
We're supposed to respect these certain workers

752
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,000
that work for the slave masses.

753
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,960
And that's just so much

754
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,640
that they earn extra pieces of paper.

755
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,380
They're allowed to retire

756
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,020
and stop working

757
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,680
to serve as motivational examples

758
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,980
for the rest of society!

759
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,000
If we work really,

760
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,140
really hard,

761
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,560
then we also,

762
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,800
we also might be able to retire.

763
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,660
And, we're told, if we follow the rules,

764
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,460
be just like them.

765
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,080
Better yet,

766
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,160
if we really make it,

767
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,520
oh, and this part's great, friends,

768
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,960
if we really make it,

769
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,440
we'll be able to rent our own slaves!

770
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,220
That's right!

771
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,180
Then we'll be just like Pinky!

772
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,400
We'll be able to afford our own servants!

773
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,160
Incredible,

774
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,880
but so, so true.

775
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,220
Yet, you see, friends,

776
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,800
the sad fact is

777
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,440
that money doesn't really matter.

778
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:40,880
Possessions

779
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,980
doesn't really matter.

780
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,100
The only thing in life

781
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,600
that really matters

782
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,160
is life itself.

783
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,600
We're all given only so much of it,

784
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,640
and the moment it's gone,

785
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,760
we die.

786
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,860
And no more free minutes.

787
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,980
The conspiracy,

788
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,040
the conspiracy knows this

789
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,920
and can't stand the realization

790
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,580
that they were given the same amount of time

791
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,460
as the rest of us.

792
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,360
So what did they do?

793
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,380
They immediately set out

794
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,660
and devised new ways,

795
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,100
in order to capture,

796
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:14,960
take away,

797
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,520
and control all the free time of others!

798
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,180
Yes, my dear friends,

799
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,420
that is how slavery began.

800
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,600
And they started to use it

801
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,100
so that they could get more goods and services

802
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,400
at the expense of others,

803
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,060
the so-called servant class.

804
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,500
Oh, a little problem occurred, though.

805
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,060
Over time, they started to realize

806
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,520
that slavery was more expensive

807
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,500
than it might otherwise be,

808
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,700
so they devised this new

809
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,320
rent-a-slave concept.

810
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,140
And it also had an added benefit.

811
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,260
There were no more escapees.

812
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,040
Remember that?

813
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,140
A few people might run away.

814
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,320
This way, with rent-a-slaves,

815
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,360
if they disappear,

816
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,940
another one quickly shows up

817
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,180
to take their place.

818
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,180
In fact, they'll even compete

819
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:58,980
for their privilege!

820
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,060
Incredible!

821
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,700
And yet, that's the beauty of their system.

822
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,480
It's a much more easier

823
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,760
and efficient way to do it, isn't it?

824
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,520
And best of all,

825
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,200
the slaves don't even realize

826
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,880
they are being controlled.

827
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,960
Oh, how that must have seemed

828
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,180
like the days of Camelot to the cotton.

829
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,220
The golden age of domination and power!

830
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,600
But then something terrible happened,

831
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,180
my friends.

832
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,220
A leader appeared,

833
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,080
who demanded in a thundering voice,

834
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,400
to let my people go!

835
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,640
His name wasn't Moses,

836
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,120
although he spoke with the authority

837
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,300
of Jehovah once.

838
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,680
His name wasn't Harriet Tubman,

839
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,040
although he ran an underground railroad

840
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,980
to freedom.

841
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,540
No, sir, his name was,

842
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,500
is, and shall never be,

843
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,300
J.R. Bob Dobbs!

844
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,900
And he won't rest

845
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,260
until the very last subgenius is free.

846
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,760
Will you give me a praise, Bob?

847
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,800
Praise Bob!

848
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,300
Now, if the African Americans

849
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,240
wish to legitimize

850
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,540
slavery by accepting a monetary payment

851
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,200
for the past,

852
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,260
that's their business.

853
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,680
Then the Khan will print up

854
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,200
more pieces of paper,

855
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,120
hand it over, and brag,

856
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,320
well, then, now that closes

857
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,220
the books on slavery,

858
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,940
we said we were sorry

859
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,620
and promise never to do it again.

860
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,440
Weak, weak.

861
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,180
So, uh, stop complaining

862
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,360
and get on back to work.

863
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,840
Now, if that's not bad enough,

864
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,540
my friends,

865
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,640
there are some pink conspiracy whores

866
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,220
who have even gone so far as to say,

867
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,380
that the blacks should be thankful for slavery.

868
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,180
They joke amongst themselves

869
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,420
that the lucky ones were captured,

870
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,260
domesticated, and transported

871
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,660
to a civilized nation

872
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,900
that offers plenty of social programs,

873
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,900
programs like five years,

874
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,920
five and higher long years of welfare.

875
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,500
Oh, aren't they so fortunate.

876
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,560
And if they were back in Africa,

877
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,560
they sneer,

878
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,240
the Negro might be starving

879
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,920
or swatting flies

880
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,580
or waiting to contract AIDS.

881
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,220
Oh, but they're not.

882
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:11,540
But now,

883
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,180
if he just follows the rules,

884
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,960
kiss plenty of pink little butt,

885
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,960
and doesn't cause any trouble,

886
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,940
he'll get a warm place to sleep

887
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,700
and a loose pair of shoes.

888
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,300
The arrogance.

889
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,020
The outrage.

890
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,740
Oh, how the conspiracy

891
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,120
could even dare to think such things.

892
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,120
That should be all the proof that we need

893
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,960
that you cannot compromise with the con.

894
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,920
No, sir.

895
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,420
These aren't rational beans.

896
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,220
They're monsters.

897
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,900
And they only understand one thing.

898
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,800
One thing.

899
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,760
And that's brute force.

900
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,860
Bob Dobbs knows this better than anyone else.

901
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,460
Yes, my friends.

902
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,280
And he's going to make sure

903
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,640
that he doesn't settle

904
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,280
for such a cheap cop-out.

905
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,300
No, sir.

906
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,960
The subgenius race

907
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,200
will not accept a settlement

908
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,480
for the past

909
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,900
or the present.

910
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,080
We refuse

911
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,520
a presidential apology.

912
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,280
And we will not accept

913
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,460
the pink

914
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,040
oh, we're so sorry

915
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,620
pink guilt platitudes.

916
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,560
We can't toss out words

917
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,440
and they won't be permitted

918
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,220
to just say

919
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,140
oh, we're sorry

920
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,320
and throw money our way

921
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,100
and then claim to be paid in full.

922
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:28,740
No, sir.

923
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,860
We demand payment

924
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,040
in a more precious commodity.

925
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,400
One that they could relate to, perhaps.

926
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,060
For every dollar

927
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,020
in a great lifetime taken,

928
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,220
we expect one to be forfeited

929
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,240
plus interest.

930
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,680
Now, I'm not saying

931
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,520
whether that means

932
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,020
the conspiracy slave masters

933
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,260
and their overseers

934
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,640
must be euthanized

935
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,560
or made slaves themselves

936
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,500
our next day.

937
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,160
That is, after all,

938
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,880
a question that

939
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,080
evangelicals and holocausters

940
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,800
are still trying to sort out.

941
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,100
But I will say this.

942
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,020
All subgeniuses agree

943
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,200
on this one premise.

944
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,800
And that is this.

945
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,980
We will never

946
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,380
forgive and forget.

947
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,380
Do I hear a praise, Bob?

948
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,940
Praise Bob!

949
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,980
Praise Bob, indeed!

950
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,580
The conspiracy is not the only one

951
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,660
who can hire certain bill collectors.

952
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,680
Bob Dobbs is bringing the entire fleet

953
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,060
of them here to Earth on X-Day.

954
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,960
And on that fateful day, my friends,

955
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,220
at 7 a.m.,

956
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,680
he's going to unleash the entire force

957
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,860
on the conspiracy.

958
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,040
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

959
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,080
Yes, the Pink's will then know

960
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,600
the true meaning of Bob's pipe

961
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,380
as they struggle and scramble

962
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,400
to pay the piper.

963
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,520
We, on the other hand,

964
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,040
will finally have our chance

965
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,360
to truthfully look towards the heavens

966
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,720
and sing in unison,

967
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,720
Free at last! Free at last!

968
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,040
Praise Bob Almighty!

969
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,180
We're free at last!

970
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,360
Here's the word of Bob!

971
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,880
Praise Bob, Amen!

972
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,060
Thank you!

973
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,240
nothing to me.

974
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,900
Bobbies are here to stay

975
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,480
and someday you will see.

976
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,700
I spent my 30 bucks.

977
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,900
I've got my minister's card.

978
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,860
I'm a Deuce Pay member

979
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,180
and it wasn't all that hard.

980
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,460
I'll start my own ministry

981
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,420
and it will be the first.

982
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,060
Bobbies are not so bad.

983
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,760
We really are not cursed.

984
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,080
Subgenius.

985
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,300
Subgenius.

986
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,420
Subgenius.

987
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,500
Subgenius.

988
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,540
So now you know my story.

989
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,600
There's nothing I've left out.

990
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,720
I try to tell the truth

991
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,740
of what it's all about.

992
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,100
Yes, I am a Bobby

993
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,060
and proud to say it's so.

994
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,380
Yes, I am a Bobby

995
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,520
and a flat-fell dynamo.

996
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,640
I am a true Yeti

997
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,720
and yes, it makes me proud.

998
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,100
I am a subgenius

999
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,960
and I'll say it out loud.

1000
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,120
I don't care much for paint

1001
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,280
and the things that they say.

1002
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,960
The Church of the Subgenius

1003
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,560
will soon have its day.

1004
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,000
Subgenius.

1005
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,000


1006
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:47,960
Subgenius.

1007
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,700
Subgenius.

1008
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,640
Subgenius.

1009
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,900
Did you really think we would give you two acts

1010
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,080
and walk away with your ten dollars?

1011
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,100
and walk away with your ten dollars?

1012
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:58,100


1013
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,660
No! No, my friends!

1014
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,080
The answer is no!

1015
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,700
We have much, much more!

1016
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,640
While any church would go for the easy buck,

1017
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,920
we are entrepreneurs.

1018
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,360
And we are nothing if not a value church.

1019
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,440
While other churches preach family values

1020
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,240
and Christian values,

1021
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,020
we give you one dollar's worth of entertainment

1022
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,160
for one dollar.

1023
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,920
One dollar's worth of religion for one dollar.

1024
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,060
And triple your money back if you're not a Christian!

1025
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,060


1026
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,500
You're not eternally saved!

1027
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,860
Praise Bob!

1028
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,060
YAY! YAY! YAY! YAY! YAY!

1029
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,200
Coming up

1030
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,400
to whet your appetite

1031
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,300
DJ Selly Out

1032
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,880
aka Stahlio

1033
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,620
will be spinning

1034
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,320
the wax fantastic

1035
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,940
in a barrage of collage

1036
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,200
and thumping his nose

1037
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,000
at such convention as copyright laws

1038
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,060
and good news.

1039
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,660
Now, I've only listened

1040
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,280
to about 40 seconds

1041
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,480
of his material

1042
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,200
and my ears bled,

1043
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,700
my bowels voided,

1044
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,160
and I could taste colors!

1045
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,240
Now, if that isn't product endorsement,

1046
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,360
I don't know what is.

1047
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,280
Boom!

1048
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,320
Woo!

1049
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:51,080

Then I'm gonna call her on the telephone

1055
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,160
First I'm gonna catch her when she's home alone

1056
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,560
And then I'm gonna call her on the telephone

1057
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,060
Who you gonna call?

1058
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,660
First I'm gonna catch her when she's home alone

1059
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,800
And then I'm gonna call her on the telephone

1060
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,780
I just called to say

1061
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,420
Boo! I'm gonna scare you

1062
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,740
Boo! Nanny poo!

First I'm gonna take a couple balls of slime

1066
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,340
And sneak them in her shoes and wash her wine

1067
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:51,880
Eww! Slime! She'll say

1068
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,000
Peek-a-boo!

1069
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,620
Peek-a-boo!

1070
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,180
Peek-a-boo!

Peek-a-boo!

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,260
Peek-a-boo!

Peek-a-boo!

Boo! But then you go boo!

Boo! But then you go boo!

Boo! But then you go boo!

1080
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,780
See this? Are they booing me?

1081
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,320
Nah, no. They're saying

1082
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,220
Boo-erns. Boo-erns.

1083
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,440
Then I'm gonna take a couple pieces of cheese

1084
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,720
And clip them to her shirt

1085
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:25,720


1086
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,040
And the socks on her knees

1087
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,180
Eww! Slime! She'll say

1088
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,780
Then I'm gonna open up a cage door

1089
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,220
I'm gonna break my rustic cage

1090
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,640
And all the mice out they'll pour

1091
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,640
Three guide mice

1092
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,260
Three guide mice

1093
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:46,160
Me and you and a doping

Boo hoo hoo hoo

1098
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:01,680
And then she's gonna run around in circles yelling

1099
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,320
Help me! Help me! Help me!

1100
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:11,080
Ha ha ha ha

1101
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,220
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

1102
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:20,560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

1105
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,460
But like a romco ad, there's much, much more.

1106
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,700
Yes, indeed, we have live mummification tonight.

1107
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,380
Live mummification tonight.

1108
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,420
They're being mummified.

1109
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,360
You don't see that every day.

1110
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,240
Crimson Mane will delight your senses

1111
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,760
with a performance that is both titillating

1112
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,020
and educating.

1113
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,140
Serving the Indianapolis area since 1997,

1114
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,520
Crimson Mane has been pierced, lashed,

1115
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,420
bloodied, suspended, gagged, bound,

1116
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,340
and burned more times than I can count.

1117
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,460
Winston Churchill once said,

1118
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:21,020
I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears,

1119
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:21,740
and suffering.

1120
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:21,960
I have nothing to offer but sweat.

1121
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,160
You'll have your blood soon enough.

1122
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,540
You have your sweat right now, as you can plainly see.

1123
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,900
And we will toil for you.

1124
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,820
Oh, how we will toil for you.

1125
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,680
Not just we humble preachers here on stage,

1126
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,760
but our bartenders over there,

1127
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,580
our cleaning staff wherever.

1128
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,740
Oh, we will toil.

1129
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,040
Such toil I cannot imagine.

1130
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,740
As for tears, we shall see.

1131
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:51,740


1132
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:51,740


1133
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:55,960
Here at the 2002 Indie Vival.

1134
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:01,300
And now, DJ Sullyout and Crimson Mane.

1135
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,600
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1136
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,040
Please help us.

1137
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,080
We're stuck.

1138
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:20,860
Don't worry.

1139
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:21,720
Don't worry.

1140
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,200
Just relax.

1141
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,540
I'll get you out of this gunk.

1142
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:28,780
Thanks.

1143
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:30,860
Okay.

1144
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,680
Let's make a break for it.

1145
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,240
We're almost there.

1146
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,520
Oh, no!

1147
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,360
Oh, no.

1148
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,440
Oh, no.

1149
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:42,440


1150
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:42,620
Thank you.

1151
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,480
Oh, no.

1152
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,560
Oh, no.

1153
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,780
Oh, no.

1154
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:50,420
Oh, no.

1155
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:51,720
Oh, no.

1156
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:51,720


1157
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:51,720


1158
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:51,720


1159
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:51,720


1160
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:51,720


1161
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:51,720


1162
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:51,720


1163
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:51,720


1164
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:51,720


1165
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:51,720


1166
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:51,720


1167
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,420
Great!

1168
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,140
Yes!

1169
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:15,300
Congratulations, warrior.

1170
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,520
You have succeeded in your mission.

1171
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,860
Your efforts have honored us all.

1172
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,380
Thank you, commander.

1173
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,340
But hold the party, mix.

1174
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,160
Because we haven't seen the last of the Pueblo.

1175
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:57,960
We have not seen the last of the Pueblo.

1176
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:57,960


1177
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:57,960


1178
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,740
They are full of...

1179
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,120
Slack!

1180
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,140
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1181
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,480
Oh, oh, slack.

1182
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,880
Yeah, that's why we're all here, ladies and gentlemen.

1183
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,160
We're here for slack.

1184
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,480
We're here for Bob.

1185
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,800
Let's hear it for Bob!

1186
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,120
Praise Bob!

1187
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,980
I love you trained monkeys.

1188
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,740
You're great.

1189
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,360
You're wonderful.

1190
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,580
I love you guys.

1191
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:19,400
I love you!

1192
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,500
I love you!

1193
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:20,900
I love you!

1194
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:22,360
All right!

1195
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:26,140
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, Jacob!

1196
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,300
The days are breaking.

1197
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,760
All the coffees are cooking and there's bread and bacon.

1198
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,900
Roll out, cowboy.

1199
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,700
I thought somebody was actually in the room screaming that.

1200
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,060
Get it while she's hot or I'll throw her out and spit in the skillet.

1201
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:47,260
If I can't whoop it, I'll go down.

1202
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:51,520
Oh, me and Gaggy Gag and the rest of the boys are sitting around the campfire window.

1203
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:59,740
Hey, lo virtually slugging off dry plant.

1204
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:03,020
But that's about it us two.

1205
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:03,540
Oh you properly capture and empty that there now, ey?

1206
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,960
Oh, we're still bad because the construction here is what trying to take over is.

1207
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:04,960


1208
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,720
I caught a lick of c manga and it's a random-

1209
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:14,780
Retriever that willarf's Ryan, time for your Okay Coffee Uhh, I forgot what he said, Nick?

1210
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,280
Baby, I'm Bob on High.

1211
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,000
I'm Bob on Yourì´

1212
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,380
booing.

1213
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:24,980
And when they opens the chute, I come out a-ridin' a panther

1214
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,160
And a-ropin' longhorn whales

1215
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,260
I've rode everything with hair on it

1216
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,080
And I've rode a few things, it was too tough to grow any hair

1217
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:40,720
I've rode bull moose on the prod, she-grizzlies, and long bolts of lightning

1218
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,480
Mountain lions are my playmates

1219
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,100
And when I feel cold and lonesome

1220
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,320
I sleep some of the dinner rattlesnakes

1221
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,640
Cause they always makes me nice and warm

1222
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,700
To keep alive, I eat stick dynamite and cactus

1223
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,340
The Grand Canyon ain't nothin' but my bean hole

1224
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:02,680
When I get thirsty, I drink cyanide cut with alkali

1225
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,360
When I go to sleep, I pillow my head on the Bighorn Mountains

1226
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:11,300
I lay in boots in Colorado and my hat in Montana

1227
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,440
I can stretch out my arms, clean out from the crazy woman fork

1228
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,780
Plumb over to the upper Gray Bull River

1229
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,620
My bed tarp covers half of the world

1230
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,360
Half of Texas and all of old Mexico

1231
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,940
But there's one thing for sure and certain

1232
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,520
And if you boys wants to know

1233
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,720
I'll tell ya, that I'm still a long way short

1234
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,040
Of bein' the Daddy of them all

1235
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,640
Cause he's full growed

1236
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,500
And as any man that really knows can see

1237
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,640
Well, boys, I ain't nothing but a bad boy

1238
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,740
I was suckled by a triceratops

1239
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:49,600
I coulda stopped with I can train tumors with my one good eye

1240
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,440
and I peed the Colorado River,

1241
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,920
but instead he had to go on for six hours.

1242
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,640
Hey, that's the way you do it.

1243
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,160
That's a bragging song, huh?

1244
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,220
I mean, a bragging poem?

1245
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:58,560
Man.

1246
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,100
This is the story of Good King Stank.

1247
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,360
I'm not going to go on with that one.

1248
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:05,800
Why not?

1249
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,620
You're a piece of big bragging.

1250
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,000
We ain't past midnight.

1251
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,400
Oh, yeah.

1252
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,380
We're not past midnight in some parts of the world yet.

1253
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,520
But first, friends,

1254
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:19,600
I shall tell you the story of Good King Stank,

1255
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:26,080
whose queen was renowned as the finest poontang.

1256
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,420
All across the land,

1257
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,680
10,000 miles around,

1258
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,400
none matched the beauty of the babe with the crown.

1259
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,420
Now, among those who admired the bounteous Princess Wee

1260
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,500
was one lowlife bachelor,

1261
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,900
they called Chris Lee.

1262
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,900
Chris Lee thought to diddle the thang

1263
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:54,100
that he knew good and well belonged to King Stank.

1264
00:52:55,020 --> 00:53:00,180
Now, we've seen fuckheads, assholes, shitheads, and turds,

1265
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,760
geeks, glorts, ninnies, and nerds,

1266
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,840
but the sorriest morphidite you ever did see

1267
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:11,200
was that chive-ass beatnik they called Reverend Chris Lee.

1268
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,280
Chris Lee saw his chance,

1269
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,700
set the X-Day drills,

1270
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:19,240
while the king's brain was muddled on potions and pills.

1271
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,900
Now, most faithful bobbies,

1272
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,200
Stank was loath to disparage.

1273
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,740
But that skunk married Wee in the short-nuration marriage.

1274
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,720
This brash move so raised King Stank's ire

1275
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,860
that he resolved to have Lee punished by torture and fire.

1276
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:43,460
First, he'd have Lee tied to a cigarro cactus stake.

1277
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:44,320
Then,

1278
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,440
in a giant microwave oven,

1279
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,800
Chris Lee's ass he would bake.

1280
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,260
In Lee's rump,

1281
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,060
Stank would roast a corn on the cob.

1282
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,480
He'd serve some to Nege,

1283
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,060
but he'd butter some for Bob.

1284
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,940
But even at the trial,

1285
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,880
Chris Lee showed such sass

1286
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,820
that he vulgarly winked at Wee

1287
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,340
as if to make a coarse pass.

1288
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,100
Seeing this made Stank so furiously mad,

1289
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,120
it almost blew out the one royal nab.

1290
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:20,120
And the kingdom heard Stank yell

1291
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,540
that Chris Lee will pay

1292
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,400
or shut up like hell.

1293
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,480
His lily-white ass I will churn like butter

1294
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,220
until, at polite apology, I do hear him utter.

1295
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:38,360
So untie his feet and untie his hand,

1296
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,720
cause I'm gonna whip that motherfucker man to man.

1297
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:48,440
Friends, they fought like devils and not like men.

1298
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:51,640
They gouged and they bit and they kicked.

1299
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:54,900
But then, something dreadful happened

1300
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,940
before the battle was done

1301
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,540
that left all the kingdom and even King Stank stunned.

1302
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,700
For, while they fought each other,

1303
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,700
into the setting sun,

1304
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,400
that fine princess Wee,

1305
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:12,180
off with Dr. Philo Drummond, had run!

1306
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,960
Friends, I should give a little tip of the hat

1307
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,200
to the great Rudy Ray Moore,

1308
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,620
Dolomite, who inspired that.

1309
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,060
I hate non-digital cameras.

1310
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,580
I want a lot of money

1311
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,980
so I can have a digital camera and a scanner

1312
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,320
and everything.

1313
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,280
Grrrr!

1314
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,520
doesn't fucking work.

1315
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,060
I got so many ideas and not enough cash.

1316
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,420
Grrr!

1317
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,260
Doesn't fuckin' work.

1318
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,460
I think every Cebulis has said that.

1319
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:55,560


1320
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,580
Grr!

1321
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,660
Doesn't fuckin' work.

1322
00:55:59,100 --> 00:55:59,740
Grrrr!

1323
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,100
I'd do something like that.

1324
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:01,980
Grr!

1325
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:11,280
Ah, yes friends,

1326
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,260
the indie-VIVO love of Apple.

1327
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:18,080
on April 20th, 4-20-2002.

1328
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,920
At the very beginning of this show,

1329
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:23,900
we heard some KPFA puzzling evidence strange mix

1330
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,400
and, of course, some ESO swamp radio

1331
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,340
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Professor Chaz Smith in it.

1332
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,860
But mostly we heard Pope Fred, Papa Joe Mama,

1333
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,000
St. Ann and Helena Handbasket,

1334
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:42,120
and St. Dalio or Stalio or DJ Selly Out.

1335
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,060
And here are some contact addresses

1336
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:49,620
or URLs, actually, on the internet for Stalio.

1337
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:55,820
Check out badtaste.gabber.org.

1338
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:03,060
That's badtaste, one word, .gabber, G-A-B-B-E-R.org

1339
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:06,660
for his Tuesday night radio show

1340
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:10,360
or his website is geocities.com.

1341
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:12,100
Geocities.com.

1342
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:20,640
That's geocities.com slash Soho slash 9024.

1343
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:25,000
Queejibo put that whole devibble together

1344
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,200
and they do the greatest subgenius magazine,

1345
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,580
printed magazine, which you can get by mail

1346
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:34,580
and you can get information about that from Queejibo,

1347
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:39,580
which is spelled, and this is part of a website address,

1348
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:46,240
Queejibo, Q-U-I-J-I-B-O.

1349
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:54,260
Q-U-I-J-I-B-O, Queejibo.walkingdead.net.

1350
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,380
Walkingdead.net.

1351
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:00,560
And for a postal address, you can write to Queejibo at,

1352
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:01,940
got that pencil ready?

1353
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:06,160
18 West Main Street, Apartment X.

1354
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,340
I've been to that apartment on 18 West,

1355
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:14,540
Main Street in Greenfield, Indiana.

1356
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:22,460
Greenfield, I-N-4-6-1-4-0.

1357
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:27,020
And St. Ann and Helena Handbasket can be CD-able

1358
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:31,300
at www.minitru.org.

1359
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:36,240
And Minitru is spelled M-I-N-I-T-R-U.

1360
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,720
No E. Minitru.

1361
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:40,660
M-I-N-I-T-R-U.

1362
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:40,660


1363
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:40,660


1364
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:40,660


1365
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:40,660


1366
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:40,660


1367
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:40,660


1368
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:40,660


1369
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:40,660


1370
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:45,020
And this in the background is the great Frank Marino.

1371
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,760
Friends, you can reach the Church of the Subgenius

1372
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,660
at www.subgenius.com

1373
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,560
or write to Bob for free information

1374
00:58:53,560 --> 00:59:00,580
from Post Office Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights,

1375
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:07,180
Ohio 44118, www.subgenius.com.

1376
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:12,740
If you want to email me, that's stang at subgenius.com.

1377
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,300
Praise Bob.

1378
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:14,660
Paul.

1379
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,480
Paul.

1380
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:29,080
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show

1381
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,500
and we're even more glad that some listeners

1382
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,900
have donated enough to help us keep on going

1383
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,420
for another couple of months.

1384
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,880
Not just this show, but subgenius.com

1385
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,440
and all the other archive sites.

1386
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,020
But if you truly love Bob

1387
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:44,280
and you want to help us keep on going,

1388
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,520
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1389
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:51,440
you should go to subgenius.com front page

1390
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,000
or especially the radio page

1391
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
or the catalog store pages

1392
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:58,320
and help out financially as best you can.

1393
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:01,740
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink

1394
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,720
of total poverty and we don't want any subgeniuses

1395
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,360
to make their own situations worse.

1396
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:09,280
But some of you still have jobs.

1397
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,640
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1398
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,260
even if it's only once a month.

1399
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,220
From enough of you.

1400
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,600
50 bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1401
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:24,460
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way

1402
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:27,380
of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1403
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:32,920
We also take checks and money orders to subgenius foundation.

1404
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:43,260
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44.

1405
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,240
That's subgenius.com.

1406
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:44,240


1407
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:44,240


1408
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:44,240


1409
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:44,240


1410
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:44,240


1411
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:44,240


1412
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:44,240


1413
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:44,240


1414
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,320
118.

1415
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:50,560
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
