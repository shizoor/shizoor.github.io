00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,980
From PR News in Washington, I'm burying an explosive device.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,640
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is moving toward a dictatorship.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,240
Clinton is saying, moving toward a military dictatorship.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,400
NATO says Bob has been charged with three counts of attempted holiday.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,620
I'm Bob.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,140
Pope Benedict says he will not run for a third term in office.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,020
Benedict has begun a series of individual meetings with Irish bishops to discuss covering up decades of sexual abuse of children.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,400
But he says it's time for him to contribute to society in a different way, such as PR News from Washington.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,060
Subgenius.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,080
Subgenius.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,120
Subgenius.

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,140
Subgenius.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,160
Subgenius.

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,180
Subgenius.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,200
Subgenius.

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,220
Subgenius.

17
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,280
Subgenius.

18
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,300
Subgenius.

19
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,300
Subgenius.

20
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,280
Subgenius.

21
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,280
Subgenius.

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:47,280


23
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,300
Subgenius.

24
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,240
Subgenius.

25
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,440
The Church of the Subgenius.

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,240
Hour of Slack.

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,000
We may make fun of capitalism and the conservative.

28
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,940
But we do it for capitalistic reasons.

29
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,220
We want to become so rich that we can buy the conspiracy.

30
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,920
Because that is frankly the only way to fight the conspiracy.

31
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,540
With its own weapon.

32
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,240
Money.

33
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:12,820
Green.

34
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,200
Cabbage and green, baby.

35
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,660
Then you didn't tell him what we believe.

36
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,340
Well, the chances of convincing a hard-headed sheriff seem pretty slim.

37
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:22,900
Very.

38
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,000
Are you sure we're not allowing our imagination to run?

39
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,020
Are you sure we're not allowing our imagination to run?

40
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:28,820
Are you sure we're not allowing our imagination to run?

41
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,400
Can you suggest any other explanation for the events of the past few days?

42
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,440
No.

43
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,500
No.

44
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:37,500


45
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,080
No.

46
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,320
No.

47
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,160


48
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,160


49
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,260


50
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,560
No.

51
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:42,660
No.

52
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,660


53
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,660


54
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,660


55
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,660


56
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,660


57
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,660


58
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,660


59
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,660


60
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,660


61
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,180
No.

62
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:56,600
I don't think you have an explanation for what is happening.

63
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:56,600


64
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,320
Then I put the detailed notebook all over C called if you have any matter of the

65
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,700

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560

67
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,800
shit завис Α cultural crisis prevails.

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,120
As a substitute.

69
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,260
We must continue to exercise our mutancy.

70
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,360
Remember, one human a day, every day, until X-Day.

71
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,300
Until the aliens decide to come and take us away from here.

72
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,460
Because the UFOs are in the skies and they are watching and I'm psychically connected to them.

73
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,320
And anything happens to me, someone...

74
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,520
Their blood will freeze in my hands!

75
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,440
Kill them, of course. But why stop there?

76
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,260
Why should only Batman and Robin die, while the society that created them goes unpunished?

77
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,920
Yes. If I must suffer, humanity will suffer with me.

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,620
I shall repay them for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.

79
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,840
I will blanket the city in endless winter.

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,040
First, Gotham.

81
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,460
And then...

82
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,120
The world!

83
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,400
Just what I had in mind.

84
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,220
Everything dead on Earth except us.

85
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,660
A chance for Mother Nature to start again.

86
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,360
Behold the dawn of a new age.

87
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,120
My mutant plants have the strength of the deadliest animals.

88
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,460
Once you have frozen mankind, these babies will overrun the globe.

89
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,420
And we shall...

90
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:34,960
We shall rule them.

91
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,400
For we will be the only two people left in the world.

92
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,600
Yes.

93
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,820
Adam...

94
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,220
And evil.

95
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,560
Yes.

96
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,300
Why should you care, then?

97
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,680
Because he...

98
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,100
Because he's a human being, that's why, said Susan, surprised at herself.

99
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,300
I don't see why people should be messed around like that, she added lamely. That's all.

100
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,380
Oh, I don't know.

101
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,040
He leaned down again until his skull was on a level with her face.

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,200
But most people are rather stupid and waste their lives.

103
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,780
Have you not seen that?

104
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,740
Have you not looked down from the horse at a city and thought how much it resembled an ant heap,

105
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,440
full of blind creatures who think their mundane little world is real?

106
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:30,980
You see the lighted windows and what you want to think is that there may be many interesting stories behind them,

107
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:36,040
but what you know is that really there are just dull, dull souls,

108
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:44,660
mere consumers of food who think their instincts are emotions and their tiny lives of more account than a whisper of wind.

109
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,100
The blue glow was bottomless. It seemed to be sucking her own thoughts out of her mind.

110
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,420
No, whispered Susan, no. I've never thought like that.

111
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,020
Death stood up abruptly and turned away.

112
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,960
You may find that...

113
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,360
I know that it helps, he said.

114
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,120
But it's all just chaos, said Susan. There's no sense to the way people die. There's no justice.

115
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,860
Ah! Are you too scared to change the world?

116
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,980
Death turned. The very sight of his expression made Susan back away.

117
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,120
You say that to me? You stand there in your pretty dress and say that to me?

118
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,220
You, you prattle on about changing the world?

119
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:34,560
Could you find the courage to accept it? To know what must be done and do it, whatever the cost?

120
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,040
Is there one human anywhere in the world who knows what duty means?

121
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,460
This is what I figure. You take songs coming out of the penitentiary.

122
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:57,240
Time up a little Beach Boys bow. Oh, for the dodo who don't know. Who knows now? Better now. Better than you thought.

123
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,620
I'm telling you, Jesus.

124
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,940
Go all the way back. Let's take it all the way back. In time, in plan. Another place, wherever he was.

125
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,200
The desert on the sand with the people that gathered around. They bothered to gather around.

126
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,080
He had God-sized love. He took them Romans. He said, give me them reins.

127
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:20,180
I'll show you how to take them chariots for a gallop of love. Here you go. Get him behind it. Get him behind that love.

128
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,120
See, I'm spiritually allied with a scorpion and a wolf.

129
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,460
You know about the wolf, don't you, baby?

130
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,460
See, spiritualism, that just, woo.

131
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,360
Boo.

132
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,980
See, see, see.

133
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,700
You got the spiritualism. Let it out.

134
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,260
Scares these people, you know, because they got their stereotype little church.

135
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,020
And they got to get the God. Get God. Get in the box.

136
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,820
Get in the box. Get in the building.

137
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,520
I'm just saying. I know, but I'm just saying. I'll be going, but I'm just saying.

138
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,860
I didn't know God had a side.

139
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,780
That's all I'm trying to say.

140
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,420
Did God have a pick and sides?

141
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,800
God, God, God, God, whatever you want to call it.

142
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,120
I don't even think it should have a name. You give God a name and it's gone.

143
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,160
Goes on. Goes on. The end of the ga- If there is an end to the galaxy, then what then?

144
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,100
If there is no end, is God at the end? Does God ever get back?

145
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,220
Does God give back? Does God stay there and not here?

146
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,580
Hey, God. Hey, God. God. You know, they're God.

147
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,180
I tried talking to the dude.

148
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,300
I'll just be here. You know.

149
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,320
I'm still here.

150
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,540
Yeah?

151
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,460
Still here. I'm still here.

152
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,420
Ah, you must be big almighty God. You know, when I got to make an appointment.

Hello there.

You know, I've been all around this wonderful world of ours.

170
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,280
And in all this world, nothing else is Bob.

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,860
time in more than a year.

184
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,940
All of the UN's offices have been shut down temporarily as a precaution.

185
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:20,100
On Wall Street 8595773, the first doses of swine flu are being distributed this week.

186
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,300
The New York Times is reporting that many doctors are being cut off today by people

187
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,260
anxious to get PR news in Washington.

188
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,980
They wouldn't be able to recognize love in the police lineup of love.

189
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,440
That's so uptight and high.

190
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,900
They come every Sunday, one day a week type 2s because they need the whole week to get

191
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,880
up inside them collars.

192
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,840
And we let it up underneath them robes?

193
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,020
Rattled up underneath them rosaries?

194
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,620
What would they think?

195
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,500
What would they think?

196
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,600
You understand what I'm saying?

197
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,680
Love.

198
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:53,840
They don't even have permission from their God to take a look down at the body of God.

199
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,900
I guess I was skeptical when I first met Dr. Martin.

200
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:13,740
He said we could build a baby out of DNA and although it was expensive it was legal in

201
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,220
the states where it wasn't banned.

202
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,660
It was Betty who suggested we cut out the parts of me that she can't stand.

203
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,860
So we made an appointment and Betty went alone.

204
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,220
They worked out the details and then called me on the phone to say congratulations dad.

205
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,100
Now things are getting better for Betty and me.

206
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,740
We're making us a baby that's just like me only better.

207
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,580
And Betty says he'll be taller and Betty says he'll be smarter.

208
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,120
And Betty says that our baby will be better than me.

209
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,560
Betty was pretty firm about our baby being human.

210
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,300
I said we should give him wings and a nice prehensile tail.

211
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,500
He could travel at the circus making money making friends with clowns.

212
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,160
Betty said that's stupid and for God's sakes would you turn that TV down?

213
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,740
Now I've seen Betty happy but she's never been like this.

214
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,100
She goes like someone else.

215
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,620
Katie,

216
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,880
she plans toweet Kat and they figure her out on some brand newiseness callignon.

217
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:40,880


218
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:40,940
We did it!

219
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,760
We did it!

220
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,660
Where do you want me?

221
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,460
Inside me thunders like a storm

222
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,400
And I hope to

223
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,880
That keep him in his comfortable and warm

224
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,600
I hope the nutritive solution

225
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,160
That they're feeding him

226
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,940
Doesn't make him fat

227
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,520
Betty's been spending lots of time

228
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,980
Out late with Dr. Martin

229
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,760
She says that they're working on the baby

230
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,660
Every night and Dr. Martin

231
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,740
Sends her presents like new underwear

232
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,280
And a bottle of wine

233
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,380
I'll just keep on writing checks

234
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,720
Until the day that baby is mine

235
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,400
He might have my mustache

236
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,260
Or my freckles or my eyes

237
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,200
Betty thinks it's better

238
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,640
To keep it a surprise

239
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,480
I hope I find out soon

240
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,580
Cause things are getting better

241
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,280
For Betty and me

242
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
We're making us a baby

243
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,960
That's just like me

244
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,940
Only better

245
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,260
And better

246
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:43,260


247
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,960
Betty says he'll be taller

248
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,740
And Betty says he'll be smarter

249
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,480
And Betty says that our baby will be better

250
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,340
That baby will be better

251
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,160
That baby will be better

252
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,820
Than me

253
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,100
Ah yes

254
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,740
Dear friends

255
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,840
And that was Jonathan Colton

256
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,100
The great

257
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,420
Jonathan Colton

258
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,920
And this is

259
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,600
Hour of Slack

260
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,260
Number one

261
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:13,260


262
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,460
Number one

263
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,660
One thousand two hundred and forty seven

264
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,060
That's how many we've done

265
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,240
Since October 1985

266
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,420
Princess We Are Doe

267
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,280
Is here in the theater

268
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,060
With me

269
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,500
And we're awaiting

270
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,600
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

271
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,080
Who should be arriving any minute

272
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,420
I'll do some credits now

273
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,460
Jonathan Colton

274
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,580
By the way

275
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,080
You can find more of that

276
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,180

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,000

Dr. Legume

280
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,260
You're listening to

289
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,800
Princess We

290
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,640
I can't hear you

291
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,480
Oh

292
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,400
Yeah I can

293
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,020
You have to

294
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,920
Is that it?

295
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,940
I don't know

296
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,620
Can you hear me?

297
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah yeah

298
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,960
I just have to

299
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,780
I have to pot you up

300
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,660
Pothead

301
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,600
Before that we heard

302
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
Not Charlie Manson

303
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,620
That was not actually

304
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,740
Charlie himself

305
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,260
But Jeffrey stable

306
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:20,840
Davies, the actor who you may remember as Michael Faraday in Lost.

307
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:29,240
Jeffrey Davies, it turns out, he played Manson in a TV movie, I think called Manson, which

308
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,220
we just saw recently.

309
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:37,620
But that stuff was from a demo tape that he did for another movie, an indie movie that

310
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,260
never got made.

311
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,640
He became Charlie Manson.

312
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,560
He memorized Manson's speech ways.

313
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,320
What is this?

314
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,840
El Queso All-Stars here in the background.

315
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,940
There's all kinds of stuff in the background.

316
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,220
Just, you know, friends, this may be the worst hour of Slack ever.

317
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,300
It just might be.

318
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,420
We're trying.

319
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,000
We're hoping.

320
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,660
Aside from the Mansonian material there, which was great.

321
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,620
We heard a little clip.

322
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:17,560
A little clip from the audio book of Soul Music by Terry Pratchett.

323
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,420
A little business of death there.

324
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,960
Some cut-ups by Lee Murr, as always.

325
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,960
You always hear stuff by Fernanda Nende, Lee Murr, chopped up things.

326
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:36,640
The El Queso All-Stars did not only this background, but also the intro.

327
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,720
This is the hour of Slack.

328
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,280
This is that.

329
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,800
Uh-oh.

330
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,140
I think I hear recordings from Winterstar.

331
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,860
This is the Spice Jam cabin at Winterstar.

332
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,460
Is that the wrong phone buzzing over there?

333
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,400
Why, I think it is.

334
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,800
It's the mystery phone.

335
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
I'm not going to mess with it.

336
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:09,600
I don't know.

337
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,180
Yeah.

338
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,340
We got back from a...

339
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,840
We got back from a...

340
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,720
A devival at Winterstar last week.

341
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,960
You'll be hearing the Winterstar show either before or after this one.

342
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,360
Edited stuff, but...

343
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,380
That doesn't sound like good, clean laughter to me.

344
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,420
The Space Jam cabin had a...

345
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,360
It had witch disco in it, and they had an echo mic on.

346
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,100
So that anybody in the room who made any noise, it all got echoed.

347
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,860
Oh, that's the space noise.

348
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,340
Oh, Dave?

349
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,500
Yeah?

350
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,200
Okay.

351
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,740
So what's the other phone that's ringing?

352
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,680
Oh, it's that thing that's ringing.

353
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,300
I'm sorry, Dave.

354
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,640
I got...

355
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,120
There's like five people trying to call here at once or something.

356
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,080
But it's not a real phone, Stan.

357
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,620
Don't worry.

358
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:09,800
Oh, thanks.

359
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,720
Oh, what a relief.

360
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,020
And this isn't a real broadcast.

361
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,760
We're not really on the air, right?

362
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,600
At least I hope not.

363
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,720
At least from what I've got to tell the public at large, I hope they don't get to hear it.

364
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,800
Because it could be very, very important.

365
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,280
Really?

366
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,600
No.

367
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,760
Actually, it's a bunch of drivel as usual.

368
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,100
No, it could be.

369
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,000
If you look at it with one jaundiced eye.

370
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,060
Or both of them.

371
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,920
Well, whip it out, Cyclops.

372
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:35,900
Okay, baby.

373
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,620
Here it comes.

374
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,240
It goes, as it were.

375
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:49,340
I think, therefore I stink, that the reason why we're embroiled in so many current crises across the universe.

376
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,720
I'm not just talking about here on planet Earth.

377
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
It's because the actual...

378
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,800
Excuse me.

379
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:08,940
The actual psychoseismospasmic urge, the inner urge of the mankind accordion is to spurt out venomous noise and bad stuff.

380
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:16,380
And therefore, what I'm coming from is that we're all bad at heart.

381
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,740
And born bad, rather than born good and corruptigated.

382
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:31,020
So I don't know what that has to do with Bob Dobbs, because I just keep on seeing pictures of a pipe going up and down where my mom once was when I came home one night.

383
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,600
And I knew that, you know, Bob was having his way with my mom.

384
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,800
Well, Dave.

385
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,520
Uh-huh.

386
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,320
Uh-huh.

387
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:39,340


388
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:39,340


389
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:39,340


390
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,340
Certainly, man is evil.

391
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,900
And in the church of the subgenius, we only want to destroy one race.

392
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,040
The human race.

393
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,700
Thank God it's not the Hunan race, or else I wouldn't have any black beans to prize.

394
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:59,160
But man was born with original slack.

395
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,780
And the conspiracy is what whips and beats it out of you.

396
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,340
You know, I mean, people are born both bad and with original slack.

397
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,260
The conspiracy doesn't beat the badness out, only the slack.

398
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,040
So the badness generally remains.

399
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,380
That is right.

400
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,680
That's the deal.

401
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,500
The balance is forsaken and forswollen.

402
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,920
There's no slack, but there is badness.

403
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:34,320
And those can coexist together quite harmoniously, given the right circumstances and the right environment which would flourish in.

404
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,680
Well, our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs, is an example of perfect.

405
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,340
Perfect.

406
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,340
Slack and perfect badness.

407
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:47,820
But Reverend Stang, you're always saying that all women are bad, and now you say it's man.

408
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,600
All women are bad.

409
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,900
That's true.

410
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,880
We did not mention that.

411
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,740
That's actually the title of a movie.

412
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,100
There's a movie called All Women Are Bad, and it's a bad movie.

413
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,920
All men are also bad, but it doesn't sound as good in a movie title.

414
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,220
How about this friendly misogynist view of my own?

415
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,040
All women are bad except for when they give you food or sex.

416
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,740
Now, that's chauvinistical.

417
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,660
It really is.

418
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,880
What if they give you bad food and bad sex?

419
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,080
Then they're bad at that, too.

420
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,180
Well, at least they're trying.

421
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,100
What if they're good at everything but food and sex?

422
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,920
Well, I don't want to have my socks darned.

423
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,640
I want to have my pickle turned, and I want double ketchup on the side.

424
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
Well, darn you.

425
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,240
You'll just have to rent one of those good women.

426
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,160
We'll wait for another incarnation.

427
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,640
I've been like Vishnu, man.

428
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,980
I've been sitting here looking at the lotus tree, you know, hoping for, you know, a thousand years go by.

429
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,220
I'm waiting.

430
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,320
I'm patient.

431
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,320
That's one approach.

432
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,960
The other approach would be to simply grab what you can and screw the other guy.

433
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,500
But what if you're incapable of it?

434
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,640
What if you're not gay?

435
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,640
Why are you going to screw the other guy, you know?

436
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,400
In that way.

437
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,520
In that way.

438
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,120
What if you were like a true bohemian of the old age,

439
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,320
and you thought, you know, I'm going to screw the other guy.

440
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,220
You know, even if such a thing were a bohemian,

441
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:17,460
it might make you not become, you know, that you wouldn't want to do that and so forth.

442
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,240
Are we...

443
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,000
We're probably treading on thin ice.

444
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,720
I'm not sure of what we're doing, but that may be one of the things we're doing right now.

445
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,920
We're exploring parts of the brain that don't exist.

446
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,700
Come on, man.

447
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,020
Good.

448
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,800
I don't want to...

449
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,260
Please don't ask me to explore any more parts of the body with you, Dave.

450
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,180
I mean, we're working on the hypothalamus right now.

451
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,940
That's fine.

452
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,360
It's a fine organ, isn't it?

453
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,260
You know, let's say, keep your pants in your own pants.

454
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,960
Keep your hand in your own ant farm.

455
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,580
Well, that's something that you don't want the viewers to listen to at all.

456
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,740
If they have any TV mind eye going on right now.

457
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,700
Speaking of listening to ants, and this is true,

458
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,600
I read a science article the other day on the BBC,

459
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,380
which said that...

460
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:09,980
Scientifically,

461
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:18,200
individuals are working on a way of miking and recording the sounds of microscopic animals

462
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,800
and microscopic events, tiny things.

463
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,220
In other words, when amoebas are, like, getting it on...

464
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,720
Well, amoebas don't really get it on.

465
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,220
They do it by themselves.

466
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,420
But you'd be able to hear them doing it, and the ants, we'd finally get the answer.

467
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,480
Is it fun or is it bad?

468
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,760
Is it like having an orgasm or having a baby or both?

469
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,440
When you split down the middle.

470
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,100
And cell mitosis.

471
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,620
But seriously, there are...

472
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,340
It's not exactly done with microphones.

473
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:50,160
It's done with lasers, which can react to tiny little movements.

474
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,900
And they can film the little movements and translate those into something like sound.

475
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,800
It wouldn't be what the animalcules hear.

476
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,720
It would be something we could understand as sound.

477
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,560
Isn't Einstein a great woman?

478
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,560
Just think about it.

479
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,680
Who's the idea?

480
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:16,040
He said that all such things are all vibrations and all part of the, you know, theory of light, as light is.

481
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,120
Now, some say that Einstein's old lady, his girlfriend and her vibrator,

482
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,740
were the ones who came up with half of that relativity stuff.

483
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,540
You better believe it.

484
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,200
And his relatives.

485
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,080
That is quite a strong possibility.

486
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,780
Because she was good at math, too.

487
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,820
And she could spend a long time at the blackboard doing what she was supposed to.

488
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,560
I bet she could.

489
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,360
I bet her.

490
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,600
I wonder if she could cook well or was sexy, you know, Mrs. Einstein.

491
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,200
Actually, it wasn't Mrs. Einstein.

492
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,040
It was his girlfriend before he got married.

493
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,600
Yes.

494
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,000
Mrs. Einstein kept her mouth shut in her place.

495
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,560
She was a shiksa.

496
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,480
She wasn't Jew.

497
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:56,840
Come on.

498
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,920
She was his mistress.

499
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,140
The shiksa mistress of him.

500
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:07,160
And, you know, I think that's where he got some of his good ideas, which is being able to take an enteebled walk.

501
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,660
Well, if she was the Jew...

502
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:08,800
She was the genius.

503
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,760
...she will urinate on things.

504
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,340
That's it.

505
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:17,280
If she was the genius, then we could let Einstein into the church of the subgenius.

506
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,600
If he was not really the actual genius, then he qualifies for the church after all.

507
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,440
Yeah, but I think this...

508
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,820
Stephen Hawking still, he's going to have to just...

509
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,820
Sorry, dude.

510
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,700
You're going to have to get some brain damage if you want to join our august assemblage.

511
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:33,880
Wow.

512
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,320
What a convoluted way of looking at it.

513
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,560
I was thinking that perhaps some great lofts...

514
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,160
Science had been broken, and we were such a sexist, misogynist community as a large,

515
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:48,420
that we actually allowed Einstein to take credit for his mistress's work.

516
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,440
And you just transpose it all into subgenius stuff.

517
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,520
That made me almost very angry for a brief moment.

518
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,560
Well, but that's what we do, isn't it?

519
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,120
We transpose everything into subgenius stuff.

520
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,180
We take something normal and good and make it subgeniously and bad.

521
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,580
Or vice versa.

522
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,700
We take something normal and bad, like a really awful movie,

523
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,020
and translate it in subgeniously.

524
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,980
You know, like this guy in the background.

525
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,500
Well, that's where our work with the hypothalamus begins and ends.

526
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:33,340
This is the alpha and the omega of where the organs and the glands do their work

527
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,880
to make the brain do something else it doesn't want to do.

528
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,380
The pineal.

529
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,640
The hypothalamus.

530
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,920
The hypothalamus and the hypochondriac are all related.

531
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,580
And they're related to pineal narco, our frequent contributor.

532
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,960
And pineal narcissism, too, who's another fine woman who lives around here.

533
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,340
Yeah.

534
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,420
We have to keep track of everybody and make sure that they're getting their work on time,

535
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,340
because a lot of the submissions are late lately.

536
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,340
If only they'd be even more submissive.

537
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,040
Oh, speaking of people, of their work, the music in the background,

538
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,620
Yeah.

539
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,300
is by the fine band called Mayan Ruins,

540
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,400
of whom we met one of the members, Christian, at Winterstar.

541
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,040
He handed me this CD, and it's going in the background.

542
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,100
And mayanruins.com, I said,

543
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,020
Oh, well, with a name like that, it sounds like it might be pretty music.

544
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,980
And he said, Well, yeah, it kind of is.

545
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,500
It sounds like...

546
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,660
It's music that would go with walking around in Mayan ruins.

547
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,120
Well, to a wolverine or perhaps some other feral creature like that, this is beautiful music.

548
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,180
Well, it actually is pretty music.

549
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,760
I wonder why he gave it to me.

550
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,440
Well, the objects of our ardor are sometimes strange to behold,

551
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,400
and I'm sure he found you strange to behold.

552
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,220
And he was ardent.

553
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,300
I surprised him so much.

554
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,080
He met me and gave me the CD on Friday night at Winterstar.

555
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,280
And the next evening, he said,

556
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,500
I bet you don't remember me, do you?

557
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,920
I said, Yeah, sure I do.

558
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,840
He gave me that CD.

559
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,980
And he goes, You don't remember my name, though, do you?

560
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,860
And I went, Yeah, Christian.

561
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,980
He went, Oh, my God.

562
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,180
You don't have nearly as much brain damage as I thought, he said.

563
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,380
Or was that another guy whose name I remembered?

564
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,240
They're so shocked.

565
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,820
Oh, but Reverend Stagg...

566
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,200
They're used to pot smokers.

567
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,420
See, they don't know froppers like myself.

568
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,060
They're used to pot smokers.

569
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,560
You can't remember.

570
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,420
I think you should have said,

571
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,100
You're the idiot who was smooching up my papal ring so much.

572
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,640
My hand is still full of slobber and so forth.

573
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:48,980
Oh, God.

574
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,380
Finally, I'd thought to say that.

575
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,580
Of course, then again, you know,

576
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,940
you could have the old Machiavellian politician's instincts.

577
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,140
You remember everyone's face and name.

578
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,160
You remember little bits of history about them.

579
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,400
So when you go up to them,

580
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,540
you can throw out that big, fat old hand and say,

581
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,900
Vote for me, this encumbering erection.

582
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,880
And give them a slap on the thigh

583
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,580
and a twist on the weasel, just like that.

584
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,980
Well, Reverend Machiavelli was right.

585
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,020
And because of that,

586
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,280
I watched my home movies of each X-Day before X-Day

587
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,460
so that I can walk up and glad hand these yo-yos

588
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,020
and go,

589
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,780
Oh, Reverend Funny Name,

590
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,420
you were here last year, weren't you?

591
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,780
And they go,

592
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,500
Oh, my gosh,

593
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,960
the Reverend Stagg remembered my name.

594
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,360
I'll go buy more stuff at the Swag Shack.

595
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,740
The subgenius Swag Shack.

596
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,460
I've got $5 left.

597
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,920
I wonder what I can get.

598
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,320
Oh, everything's $10.

599
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,180
It starts at $10.

600
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:51,460
Oh, speaking of X-Day and Brushwood,

601
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,480
where Starwood won't be this year,

602
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,660
we can announce for the first time anywhere

603
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,280
where Starwood will be.

604
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,560
Starwood Festival, the great festival

605
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,020
at which there's always a great subgenius revival

606
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,200
and about 170 others.

607
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,340
Other events, including music,

608
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,620
most of it actually good.

609
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,960
Starwood will be held at Wisteria Campground

610
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,360
in Southern Ohio.

611
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,200
In Pomeroy, Ohio.

612
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,460
Pomeroy, Ohio.

613
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,580
It's actually in the middle of nowhere.

614
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,680
South of Athens.

615
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,760
Athens, Greece.

616
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,180
30 minutes south of Athens.

617
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,440
And yes, July 6th through 12th.

618
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,860
And we can say that because we know that.

619
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:37,860


620
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:37,860


621
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:37,860


622
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:37,860


623
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:37,860


624
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:37,860


625
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,480
We don't make any money.

626
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,220
We help run that festival, but nobody's paid.

627
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,360
Hey, what is this?

628
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,480
Boy, that'll be a tootie-twister.

629
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,100
I can imagine.

630
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,020
I bet.

631
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,500
So we're all going to have to drive

632
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,580
at an extra distance.

633
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,660
Immediately after.

634
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,580
Well, wait a minute.

635
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,580
What are we worried about?

636
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,100
X-Day is the 5th.

637
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,220
If there's going to be a Starwood at all,

638
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,880
it'll be on my escape vessel.

639
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,400
Because the planet Earth will be completely destroyed.

640
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,400
We hope.

641
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:07,560
We hope.

642
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,180
At least for...

643
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,980
We...

644
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,660
I agree.

645
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,300
I agree.

646
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,740
Well, not completely destroyed,

647
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,760
except for the sections that subgeniuses save for themselves.

648
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,820
Which, unfortunately,

649
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,120
knowing the subgeniuses will mostly be

650
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,520
old used DVDs and tattered comic books.

651
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,380
Only a few of us have enough taste

652
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,640
to save the untattered comic books.

653
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,100
My space vehicle will be merely a cardboard.

654
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,140
A very, very, very large,

655
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,340
double corrugated cardboard.

656
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:37,920
A cardboard box

657
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,840
filled with many of the amenities

658
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,720
I'm accustomed to here on this planet Earth.

659
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,060
Only with a little bit more vibrance

660
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,520
and emotional hue.

661
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:46,760
To be fun.

662
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,560
My space vehicle will be on myspace.com.

663
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,580
My space vehicle.

664
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,640
Hey, Dave.

665
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,820
Have you got a Facebook page yet?

666
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,760
Or a MySpace page?

667
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,660
No, but...

668
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,040
I have a saxophone

669
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,640
implanted in the back of my head.

670
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,380
Everybody has to have one.

671
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,700
They don't have a Facebook page,

672
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,180
or they're not a real...

673
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,120
They don't have a proper face.

674
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,100
Or they call it front butt pa...

675
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,600
On alt.slack, I've noticed

676
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,200
the ladies call it front butt book

677
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,140
instead of face book.

678
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,680
Front butt book.

679
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,200
Well, mug puppies is what I call some of them.

680
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,700
But, see...

681
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,160
Squirty little honeys is what I call some of them.

682
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,020
My squirty little honeys.

683
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,260
Squirty little honeys.

684
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,260
I trademarked Joe Offrit.

685
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,940
That man has a bad reputation

686
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,080
for some of the things he's done to...

687
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,660
Never mind.

688
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,720
I won't even get into it.

689
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:49,960
No, it's not.

690
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,780
My tongue clicking is wearing out on this show.

691
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,160
What is?

692
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,900
My tongue clicking.

693
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,620
The clucking.

694
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,120
Tisking.

695
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,240
Tisking.

696
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:01,520
Tisking.

697
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,000
Tisking.

698
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,960
She's plucking your tongue?

699
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,540
She's tisking?

700
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,820
I've been tisking.

701
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,300
I'm listening to all this...

702
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:06,860
That's my trademark.

703
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,580
...terrible, terrible things.

704
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,860
You need not tiske when nigh is nigh.

705
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:18,400
Things are growing grim in the land of gloom and cry.

706
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,600
Things are on their way down.

707
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:28,220
But we're hoping soon to be re-re-re-resurrected

708
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,700
and removed from this place.

709
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,700
Just like that.

710
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,040
Hope.

711
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,760
Yeah.

712
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,340
Oh, yes.

713
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,500
But would you call this blither or blather that we're...

714
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:42,760
Nether.

715
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,220
I'd call it slather.

716
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,060
Slather.

717
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,980
The hour of slather.

718
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,180
The hour of slather.

719
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:53,980
Hey.

720
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,820
Reverend Slather.

721
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,000
Hey, I have some religious music I could play in the background.

722
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,000
Well, I love...

723
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,860
It's Princess Wee and Reverend Fat Man D singing

724
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,000
a...

725
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,080
a...

726
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,140
a Catholic-type song that I originally thought was a...

727
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,720
a...

728
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,620
a...

729
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,760
a Jewish mysticism.

730
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,960
I thought the Jews were conspiring against her.

731
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,140
Now, are you wearing a clothespin on your nose?

732
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,040
Uh, me?

733
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,940
No, that was her.

734
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,860
I thought your voice was a bit high.

735
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,140
You're her now, right?

736
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,180
That's Princess Wee?

737
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,580
Yeah.

738
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,440
That's Princess Wee and Fat Man D.

739
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,120
Can you believe that?

740
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,200
That's in a subgenius devival.

741
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,740
They sang this in a subgenius devival.

742
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,800
A Christian song.

743
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,840
It's delightful.

744
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,420
I...

745
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:52,920
I don't...

746
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,980
When I first heard it, I thought they were doing Jewish chanting.

747
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,920
I didn't recognize it was Latin, and I'm...

748
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,120
I'm...

749
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,760
You know, I'm kind of...

750
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,500
I wasn't really raised in that...

751
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,740
in the church, exactly.

752
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,400
Or a synagogue, so I didn't know the difference.

753
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,260
I was raised in a laboratory.

754
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,500
Yeah, you were raised in a swamp, for crying out loud.

755
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,560
In a laboratory.

756
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:14,940
Rather...

757
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,740
In a laboratory in a swamp.

758
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,200
A beautiful laboratory.

759
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,620
Run down on the swamp.

760
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,900
Yes, the same laboratory seen in Attack of the Swamp Creature, in fact.

761
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,780
That's where I grew up.

762
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,020
Well, in a certain way, think of it...

763
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,460
We all grew up there.

764
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,340
You know what I mean?

765
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,240
Listen to this rockin' Nova...

766
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,840
Donna Nova...

767
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:35,920
Yeah.

768
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:36,740
Yeah.

769
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,700
Nova Pacham, is that what it's called?

770
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,620
Donna Nobis Pacham.

771
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,760
Give us some peace, or give us some...

772
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,320
Dave, get this.

773
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,880
Suddenly, in the middle of this subgenius show,

774
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:55,840
these two ladies started singing John Lennon's Imagine.

775
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,740
And worse, the whole audience started singing along with them.

776
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,080
And even the worst of all, I got tears in my eyes.

777
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,560
I go...

778
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,480
I'm all worked up.

779
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,000
It was so sweet.

780
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,700
That is...

781
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,860
What the hell is this church coming to?

782
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:14,960
Slather.

783
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:15,780
Yeah.

784
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:22,920
Everyone has become too confident, too overconfident, and too repressed.

785
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,560
You know what I mean?

786
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,720
Of course not.

787
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,240
Because...

788
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,360
I didn't think so.

789
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,180
I just posited those idiotic things as a way of saying that perhaps people are becoming

790
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,400
a little bit more...

791
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,460
Oh, what's the word?

792
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,360
What is the word?

793
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,620
Lonesome?

794
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,640
Cowboy-ish?

795
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,500
No.

796
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,220
Davian?

797
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,420
Oh, so wimpy?

798
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,900
Not wimpy.

799
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,220
Pinky?

800
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,040
Pinkly-winkly?

801
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,080
Normally warmly?

802
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,540
Yeah, maybe a little normally warmly.

803
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,240
A little pink.

804
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,280
Not too pinkly.

805
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,620
Dave, do you ever listen back to the recordings of these shows and go,

806
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,460
Oh, so that's what I was saying?

807
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,300
On occasion, I do.

808
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,440
And other times, I go, I wish I wouldn't have said that.

809
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,720
And I also be like, man, I have to...

810
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,960
I have to think of something else to do.

811
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,420
I suck.

812
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,120
Life sucks.

813
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,140
I'm going to go and...

814
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,840
Oh, no.

815
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,580
Oh, no.

816
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,380
That's all true, Dave.

817
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,280
But yet...

818
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,360
No, no, there are brief times when I go, I am a bloody genius.

819
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,220
I love myself.

820
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,620
But then you listen for another ten seconds.

821
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,260
I know the feeling.

822
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,160
It's a constant battle.

823
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Up and down.

824
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,240
Yes.

825
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,380
A constant battle against fighting.

826
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,440
Like an ancient...

827
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,880
Psycho-emotional game of Pong.

828
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,740
Remember that game?

829
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,440
Of back in the...

830
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:41,800
Pong.

831
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,340
That's the only video game I ever learned how to play.

832
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,080
I'm still playing that one.

833
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,220
Who is this?

834
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,280
Reverend Circle Maker.

835
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,220
Hi.

836
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:56,960
I'm...

837
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,860
Oh, this is exciting, too.

838
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,960
Of a different kind.

839
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,440
Yes.

840
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,160
What a multi-talented young lad.

841
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:06,740
Oh, my God.

842
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,840
Now, that was...

843
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,740
Yes, our friend Reverend Circle Maker did this song, and he also did a lot of the crop circles

844
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:19,780
that people always assumed must be done by aliens, since Englishmen on speed could never

845
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,580
do such things.

846
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:20,920
Never.

847
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,540
In the middle of the night, when nobody's looking.

848
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,580
Well, it sounds like a lot of nasal drip going on right there.

849
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,040
Well, we're all getting over that cold, aren't we?

850
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,740
Didn't Snotty visit you as well as Princess Wee and I?

851
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,700
And implanted in my mind.

852
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,100
I'm in the vision of a sphinx.

853
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:46,180
That's the inscrutable sphinx, which means that I'll never, never untether the liquids

854
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:46,900
in my nose.

855
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,200
It'll go on forever.

856
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,820
You ought to do what I did, Dave, and have you...

857
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:56,180
What was the last time you had you a big old onion, garlic, and jalapeno sandwich?

858
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,140
I...

859
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,020
As I said, I'm remiss in eating one every day.

860
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,000
That'll clear those sinuses out, boy.

861
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,560
That's dead.

862
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,400
Raw onion.

863
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,540
I'm not talking no cooked.

864
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,360
I'm not talking no cooked onion or cooked garlic.

865
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:16,740
I mean a big old slice, like half an inch thick, of raw onion, and none of your little wimply

866
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,960
Vidalia onions.

867
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,280
I don't mean none of this sweetie-peatie stuff.

868
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:28,940
I mean manly, a manly sandwich of onions and a bunch of jalapenos.

869
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:33,800
It's unbelievable, Dave, what this man eats in the morning.

870
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,480
And slices of fresh garlic.

871
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:37,920
And green beans.

872
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,140
And assured salt.

873
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,120
And cherry tomatoes.

874
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,680
And that, your stuff is just too good to be able to.

875
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:45,680


876
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,200
It's it.

877
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:54,120
She's just a little, a little bit of��y knife.

878
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,120


879
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,180
Hey, let's see you if you're going to hurt or hurt someone.

880
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,180


881
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,300
Oh, before Washington hits you-

882
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,160
Then you're going to have to be late, your mother vitesse has been

883
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,340
And, Tom, Nikki, for shoe washing your pants, Nikki.

884
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,600
and I'm going to have you and George to work the

885
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,300
I already lost four of my daughters in my conferences.

886
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:04,380
And the nggak dick should get a place at the internet called

887
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,680
New York, Texas and then New acre'm Connection in Denver.

888
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,860
Oh, I like her.

889
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:15,800
The sound in the background is Ron Slade blowing into a beer bottle.

890
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,020
Oh, I thought it was a woman and I love her.

891
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,000
And burping.

892
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,000
It is funny.

893
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,540
Yeah, if you're high.

894
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,140
High on life.

895
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,120
This is from the Space Jam cabinet Winter Star again.

896
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:37,940
And then the...

897
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,840
High on funny sounds and laughter.

898
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,080
Wow.

899
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,080
Debauchery.

900
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,780
It is debauchery.

901
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,300
Those are the sounds of debauchery.

902
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,660
A room full of people laughing.

903
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,120
It must be something.

904
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,820
There's something bad going on in there.

905
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,640
If they're having that much fun.

906
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,420
Actually, there wasn't anything terribly bad going on in there.

907
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,260
Just sound effects.

908
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,300
Big old helium balloons, obviously.

909
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:17,860
Steve.

910
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,960
This is definitely a helium party where helium and...

911
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,700
You know, in the old days it would have been, but...

912
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:37,720
Some of us are so old that we don't even need the helium or the laughing gas or anything anymore.

913
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,740
All we have to hear is the echoes of our own laughter.

914
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,240
Especially at high speed.

915
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,340
And repeated.

916
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,160
Oh, there's nothing like that in the world.

917
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,180
I'm not a total.

918
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,120
Now that's true liquid refreshment.

919
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,520
Yeah, that doesn't sound like good, clean laughter, does it?

920
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,540
And what is good, clean?

921
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,860
I can't tell whether it's Princess Wee laughing in this room or on the tape.

922
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,220
It sounds like one very well-documented psychotic episode in an institution somewhere.

923
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,300
Where a doctor's really doing his work pretty damn well.

924
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:18,640
Yep.

925
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:27,660
He put the little electronic zyclode on the top of the man's foreskin and one inside of his ear by where the lobe meets the temporal figurine.

926
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,600
And blasted off a few hot...

927
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,500
Shots and checked it out and that's what came out.

928
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,200
Gimme, gimme shock treatment.

929
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:36,820
Treatment.

930
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,480
I think everybody...

931
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,180
I want shock treatment.

932
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,700
Mandatory shock treatments in our new healthcare plan.

933
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,360
I guess that's what they're saying on the...

934
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,560
I said shock treatment.

935
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

936
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:47,900
It's different.

937
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,520
Well, you know, I'm not known for getting...

938
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,340
I'm in the shock treatment.

939
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,820
Shock treatment?

940
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,240
Yes.

941
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,160
Shock treatment.

942
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:56,460
Yes.

943
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,300
Let's just shock your treatment.

944
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:58,860
Go on, shucks.

945
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,000
Oh, no, I thought that was getting...

946
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,900
Not taking your pills.

947
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,780
Then there's...

948
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,900
That's my secret.

949
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,240
...soap treatment.

950
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,860
I don't take my pills.

951
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:08,580
...soap treatment.

952
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,960
And how else you don't?

953
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,140
You are pills.

954
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,920
I am pills.

955
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,100
As Dali say.

956
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,680
Yep, right.

957
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,320
No, actually he said, I am drugs.

958
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,620
I am...

959
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,800
I do not take drugs.

960
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,900
I am drugs.

961
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:23,960
Butterfly.

962
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,060
Everything romping and yawping.

963
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,080
Good old Salvador.

964
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,040
I am.

965
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:32,740
He was a...

966
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,280
He would have...

967
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,600
He was...

968
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,100
Back...

969
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,820
You know, back before we had that fight

970
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,100
when he used to be on the show.

971
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,900
Those were the days.

972
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,540
I got to admit.

973
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,960
I mean, he was a jerk and a prevert,

974
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,880
but he was really funny on the show.

975
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,460
That was a golden era of hour of slack.

976
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:46,640
Yeah.

977
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:46,800
That was...

978
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,720
Hour of slack was really good back...

979
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,020
Yeah.

980
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:49,760
Yeah.

981
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,460
Yeah, but see, that's one reason he quit.

982
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,020
He thought that was not funny

983
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,040
when we pulled his mustard.

984
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,040
Well, he claimed it was abusive,

985
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,340
but his language...

986
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,040
His language...

987
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,740
His language skills, you know,

988
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,680
he sounded so silly in English

989
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,560
that, you know,

990
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,320
he should have known

991
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,900
that that's what he signed on for.

992
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,420
That was what the contract was.

993
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,560
Be yourself,

994
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,700
and we'll be ourselves.

995
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,120
Listen, here they are being themselves.

996
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,640
It's a room full of people now.

997
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,820
Well, they're definitely not human beings.

998
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,940
Is that the space onion again?

999
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:26,480
Yes.

1000
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:26,740
Yeah.

1001
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:26,860
Yeah.

1002
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:26,960
Yeah.

1003
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,020
Yeah.

1004
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:27,020


1005
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,760
That's the space jam cabinet winter story.

1006
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,160
I would say this is far spacier

1007
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,920
than any of the other onion jams.

1008
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,960
Well, the musicians quit,

1009
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,480
but they left their special effects mics on.

1010
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,240
There's some of your clicking.

1011
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,400
Uh-huh.

1012
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:45,840
That's your...

1013
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,600
A friend of mine told me

1014
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,920
he went to the beach in Florida,

1015
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,600
and he was contemplating

1016
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,860
on the nasal parts of Bob Dobbs,

1017
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,860
and suddenly on the beach,

1018
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,940
he saw thousands and thousands,

1019
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,020
literally thousands,

1020
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,040
upon thousands of micro crabs

1021
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,220
the size of quarters

1022
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,380
crawling towards him,

1023
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,400
making that same clicking sound.

1024
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,140
Cool.

1025
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,880
What a nightmare.

1026
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,380
What a nightmare vision.

1027
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,080
But I guess that's the way it is.

1028
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,920
Unless you're into...

1029
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,320
Some people are into micro crabs, Dave,

1030
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,460
because you caught my attention, finally,

1031
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,380
when you said that.

1032
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,120
Thank God they're not investigated

1033
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,640
in your pubic goatee,

1034
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,900
or else soon we'd be arguing

1035
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,540
about a different type of crab.

1036
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,960
Now, here's some more of that not...

1037
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,620
Here's some more of that

1038
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,040
not-good-clean laughter.

1039
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:39,040
Now, these people are definitely

1040
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,200
anti-cyclonic.

1041
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,340
They're spinning the wrong way.

1042
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,320
And that guy's evil, I can tell.

1043
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,200
Listen to him.

1044
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,120
He's giving us

1045
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,120
evil subliminal commands.

1046
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,840
You don't know how correct you are.

1047
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,640
Now, let's talk about

1048
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,960
all the kinds of limitless tricks

1049
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:01,960


1050
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:11,260
I don't want to be scammed

1051
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,140
by the people who are

1052
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:12,140


1053
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:16,220
public life off of buying

1054
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:22,520
echo cigarettes.

1055
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,260
So let's stop doing that,

1056
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,020
and try to get the right stuff out.

1057
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:27,020


1058
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:27,020


1059
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,700
This is mental illness music in the background.

1060
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,900
I made these noises with a program called Net Logo.

1061
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,040
These are very...

1062
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:45,500
You try little turtles to run around this cage and bang into musical instruments.

1063
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,300
You have a very cinematic feel.

1064
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,240
That's why as soon as I hear this stuff, this is yours?

1065
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,380
It's completely random, Dave.

1066
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,700
I know, but...

1067
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,440
I set the parameters, let me put it that way.

1068
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,820
But the way you done did it, and even the parameters you have set,

1069
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:09,200
make me want to create some sort of illusion for the listeners.

1070
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,620
A radio theater illusion.

1071
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,140
Perhaps a...

1072
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,400
Someone got out of the basement.

1073
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,160
In the garbage dump.

1074
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,440
Speaking of which...

1075
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,220
There's a fucking window in there.

1076
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:26,540
I read a thing in the garbage dump that said that...

1077
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,140
It was a study in Australia.

1078
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:37,940
They claimed that they discovered that long-term use of marijuana increased psychosis and hallucinations.

1079
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,100
Well, it's like, duh.

1080
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,060
If it doesn't, then you got ripped off.

1081
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:42,660
Right.

1082
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,200
But...

1083
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,980
Why are you doing it if you don't...

1084
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:53,380
The funny thing was, the study was based on 3,020-year-olds who had been asked.

1085
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,520
So their idea of long...

1086
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,680
Well, nobody gets to be 3,020-year-olds.

1087
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,620
Unless you're Mel Brooks in 1964.

1088
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,300
Well, that's the thing.

1089
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:07,700
I mean, it's like, their idea of how long-term of marijuana use can a 20-year-old be guilty of.

1090
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:08,380
Yeah.

1091
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,580
Most of them, it's like, the ones that started when they were 14,

1092
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,820
there were slightly more hallucinating psychotics among that group,

1093
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,240
and there were slightly fewer among the people who'd only been smoking marijuana for a year.

1094
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,260
But they were all 20-year-olds, and out of 3,000 people,

1095
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,280
that many people would have been hallucinating psychotics anyway!

1096
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:26,820
Right.

1097
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,160
Especially 20-year-olds.

1098
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,500
And there was no way to...

1099
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,460
You couldn't...

1100
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,420
Like, how exactly did this correlation work?

1101
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:39,080
Could it be that people who were already psychotic and hallucinating smoked pot

1102
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,280
because it made them hallucinate less?

1103
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,340
Could that be?

1104
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:45,940
Probably not, but...

1105
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:52,980
3,020-year-old psychotics revealed that the ones of those 3,020-year-old psychotics

1106
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,000
who smoked marijuana on a daily or a monthly basis

1107
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,680
were still...

1108
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:56,680


1109
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,340
Still psychotics.

1110
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,680
Isn't that what it says?

1111
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,320
For crying out loud, that lady should be beaten and smoked!

1112
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,420
You got any more of that landlady?

1113
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,680
Which landlady?

1114
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,600
Do you know where I can get some landlady?

1115
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,680
I don't know.

1116
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,440
I'm gonna have to cough and roll my eyes back in my head.

1117
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,360
Let's see now.

1118
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,440
Did you repeat the question?

1119
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,920
Do you know where I can get some of that silver landlady?

1120
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,660
You're looking for...

1121
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,740
An elderly girl with, uh...

1122
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,500
Landlady Hayes, man?

1123
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,820
Yeah, Landlady Hayes.

1124
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,880
You got any of the Landlady Hayes?

1125
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,380
How about Gray Landlady?

1126
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,920
Landlady, 47 years old, angry at her ex-husband.

1127
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,880
Would that, uh...

1128
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,880
Uh, man, I got some of this dead landlady.

1129
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,680
It's gray.

1130
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,520
Only take one, man.

1131
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,620
She'll never up your rent.

1132
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,460
Just take one, man.

1133
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:54,600
And...

1134
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,720
I do, man.

1135
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,200
I...

1136
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,040
Hello?

1137
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:58,920
Hello?

1138
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,240
Hello?

1139
00:49:59,460 --> 00:49:59,540
Hello?

1140
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,560
Are we...

1141
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:00,900
Are we...

1142
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:01,720
Are we on the air?

1143
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,460
Bingo.

1144
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:08,700
I warned the listeners that this would possibly be the worst hour of Slack ever.

1145
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:09,720
Did you really?

1146
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,100
Yeah.

1147
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,380
Oh, thank God.

1148
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,800
You start prepared for what's coming.

1149
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1150
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,620
See, I set it up perfectly.

1151
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,860
Man, we've come home!

1152
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,380
We've jumped the shark!

1153
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,520
I knew we could make it over that shark.

1154
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,380
Excellent.

1155
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,200
The shark under the bus.

1156
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,980
We threw the shark under the bus and then we jumped it, man.

1157
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,260
What a wind-up.

1158
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,160
What a pitch.

1159
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,400
Now a shark mush everywhere.

1160
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,820
You just remember I'm the pitcher, not the catcher, Dave.

1161
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:43,620
Well, right now I can only see sharks driving buses with other elderly sharks in the back of the bus.

1162
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:49,260
There's some angry young sharks at the beginning of the bus who are looking at each other like they want to rip each other off.

1163
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,340
And then a transit cop shark walking up and down the aisle.

1164
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,640
Making strange noises.

1165
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,860
Not strange, necessarily, to a shark or even to...

1166
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,200
Oh, never mind.

1167
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,040
Transit cop shark.

1168
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,720
Coming up next after Lost.

1169
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,280
Transit cop shark.

1170
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,340
Oh, yeah.

1171
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,380
I love that show, man.

1172
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,760
That is so over the top.

1173
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:18,160
Oh, my God.

1174
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,940
Remember the one time I was thinking with Sharky?

1175
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,920
He's back in the office.

1176
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:27,880
And he's flopping around in front of the desk.

1177
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,100
And then one Saturday, the guy's a captain.

1178
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:34,600
He's like, you know, hey, man, you know, get back in your cage.

1179
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:38,160
I know I saw it one time.

1180
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,800
Princess, if you're going to laugh that loud, lean back from the microphone.

1181
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:50,500
She was laughing at my face, I'm afraid, Dave.

1182
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,380
She wasn't laughing.

1183
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,080
She was laughing.

1184
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,400
I was making a...

1185
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,980
She was laughing at my face at what you were saying.

1186
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,060
And she was laughing at my face.

1187
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,600
That doesn't help our listeners much, though, does it?

1188
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:04,240
No, but it does give an idea of what your face probably is like.

1189
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:13,160
Try to imagine an old yeti or an old were-yeti with kind of pinched up, screwed up face in consternation.

1190
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,080
And yet bafflement.

1191
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,080
And bafflement.

1192
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,120
Yeah, bafflement.

1193
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,920
Maybe a Tory MP.

1194
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,200
Now, you'll like this.

1195
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,040
This background music, Dave.

1196
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,640
This is Purple Haze.

1197
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,400
It is.

1198
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,880
It's showing up here.

1199
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,220
On the sheets here.

1200
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,460
My daddy can see me now.

1201
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,560
Oh, boy.

1202
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,600
I can't remember.

1203
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:48,420
It's some Russian or Balkan instrument.

1204
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,360
It sounds like bagpipes.

1205
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:50,860
Yes.

1206
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,380
It actually sounds like an Ionian bagpipe.

1207
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:59,000
Bagpipe or perhaps it could even be like Sicilian or southern coast of Italy bagpipe.

1208
00:52:59,260 --> 00:52:59,960
It's not.

1209
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,740
I heard this once in a family thing and I thought, how silly.

1210
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,500
Bagpipes are everywhere.

1211
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,260
And the percussion is all strapped to one foot.

1212
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,420
It's stomping.

1213
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,240
Please.

1214
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,100
Excuse me.

1215
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,140
What is this guy?

1216
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,140
Mm-hmm.

1217
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,120
Mm-hmm.

1218
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:22,520
Mm-hmm.

1219
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,240
Mm-hmm.

1220
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:23,640
Mm-hmm.

1221
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:24,900
Yeah.

1222
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,140
I can't remember.

1223
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,600
I didn't write down the name of this person.

1224
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,760
I found it on YouTube.

1225
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:36,280
You could just do a search on YouTube for Purple Haze and click on the picture that

1226
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,760
looks the least likely.

1227
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,200
The one that looks the least like Jimi Hendrix.

1228
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,000
It was like a...

1229
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:49,980
It looked like an old sheep herder guy sitting by the side of a road or something.

1230
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,460
In an old stone shack or something.

1231
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:52,920
Yeah.

1232
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:52,960
Yeah.

1233
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,140
Yeah.

1234
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:53,300
Yeah.

1235
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:53,380
Yeah.

1236
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:53,380


1237
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:53,380


1238
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:53,380


1239
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:53,380


1240
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:53,380


1241
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:53,380


1242
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:53,380


1243
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:55,920
Yeah.

1244
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:55,980


1245
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:55,980


1246
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:55,980


1247
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:55,980


1248
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:55,980


1249
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:55,980


1250
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:55,980


1251
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:55,980


1252
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:55,980


1253
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,000
And it does not look easy.

1254
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,260
There are close-ups on his face and he's dripping with sweat.

1255
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,460
This is really a workout.

1256
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,780
He may well have been on Purple Haze while doing this.

1257
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,320
You don't know the inner politics.

1258
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,220
That's true.

1259
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:15,780
I understand over in the former Soviet Union, you can get all kinds of things.

1260
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:16,460
Yes.

1261
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,560
You'd be surprised.

1262
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,820
As well as vintage Hendrix albums.

1263
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:22,780
Yeah.

1264
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,760
Yeah, right. They have to bootleg everything instantly as soon as it comes out.

1265
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,000
This probably dates from 1967.

1266
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:33,180
Would you like to drive a car?

1267
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,880
Actually, Hendrix probably ripped this guy off.

1268
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:43,160
He was walking through Bulgaria and went, oh my God, listen to that, you guys.

1269
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,280
Quick, let's record that.

1270
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,080
Let's do that.

1271
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,300
What's he saying? Is he saying, excuse me while I kiss this guy?

1272
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,600
No, let's change the lyrics.

1273
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,200
Let's make it something else.

1274
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,880
She kissed the sky. Yeah, that's better.

1275
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,280
That's not so, you know.

1276
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,680
Unfortunately, I don't know.

1277
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:10,500
I think perhaps you've taken leave of your senses.

1278
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,700
I wish I could.

1279
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:14,580
Oh, how I wish I could.

1280
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:19,240
We'll be able to take leave of this radio station soon.

1281
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:20,940
How so?

1282
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,520
Just through the flight?

1283
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,820
Through the magic of time control.

1284
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,320
Time is a place.

1285
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,020
Time is a place for some of us.

1286
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:43,840
The past is over on the left and the future is over on the right.

1287
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:50,100
But if you don't get right with Bob, we're going to have to bring you to now.

1288
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,300
We'll have to advance you to first.

1289
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,000
Last place.

1290
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:58,000
I mean, if you ain't right with Bob, if you ain't doing what Bob said to do,

1291
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,420
we're going to have to bring you to now.

1292
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,100
That's what Charlie used to say.

1293
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:09,240
Charlie would, when somebody needed to get killed, for instance, he'd go,

1294
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,840
we're going to have to bring him to now.

1295
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,620
You know what to do.

1296
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,600
Well, who's Charlie Mansoon?

1297
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,940
Charlie Manson, you know.

1298
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,120
Mansoon?

1299
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,460
Reverend Manson.

1300
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,340
He's been in jail for a long time.

1301
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,520
You remember?

1302
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,980
He was the guy we first.

1303
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:22,440
He was.

1304
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,880
It was like our first mind programming experiment.

1305
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,240
Oh, yeah.

1306
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,120
And then we taught him how to program people.

1307
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,860
And then he went out and he kind of.

1308
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,480
Well, he wasn't.

1309
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,740
He didn't stay low profile enough like most of us do.

1310
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:39,540
Anyway, Dave, yes, the time of the end of the show is rapidly approaching.

1311
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:45,640
That means I have to say that this music in the background is, I think, by Artemia Salina.

1312
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,200
The subs go marching in.

1313
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,400
Yeah, I think that's it.

1314
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,240
And.

1315
00:56:52,600 --> 00:57:00,560
And this has been the hour of slack number one thousand two hundred forty seven live done the last day of February 2010.

1316
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,360
And if you need information, that's it.

1317
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:07,140
Information.

1318
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:13,580
You need information from subgenius.com.

1319
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:22,000
If you want to know about more of that, subgenius.com or post office box.

1320
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,920
One eight one four one seven.

1321
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,820
Leave Lund Heights, Ohio.

1322
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,220
Four four one one eight.

1323
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,740
Four four one one eight.

1324
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:38,720
And with that, I think we must fade Dave out.

1325
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,880
OK, but I want to remind you that that was pretty silly there at the end the way you did that.

1326
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:48,220
You could have you could have been a lot more forceful in making people do what they're supposed to.

1327
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,580
I'm not supposed to make people do what they're supposed to.

1328
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,560
You're supposed to not supposed to make supposed to.

1329
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:55,980
That's right.

1330
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,520
And I'm sick of being exposed to this nonsense.

1331
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,120
So I'm going to end it all now.

1332
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,740
Oh, and.

1333
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,560
Goodbye, fair listeners.

1334
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,680
Goodbye, fair show.

1335
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,140
And goodbye, fair Dave.

1336
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,440
And goodbye, fair share and hopeless, not driveling.

1337
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,480
All the rest.

1338
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:16,680
Good.

1339
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:22,380
I'll find that wonderful good evening across the United States to each and every one of you out there.

1340
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,340
On the hour of flag.

1341
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:29,260
I thought I told you before you paid me, man, what are you doing?

1342
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:29,720
All right.

1343
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,000
Oh, yeah.

1344
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:30,540
All right.

1345
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,220
All right.

1346
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,420
All this for.

1347
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,720
And you were gone.

1348
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:35,920
And I'll come in and.

1349
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,600
Up.

1350
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,140
inte not go nine, night out and one.

1351
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:45,540


1352
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:49,820
on.

1353
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,380
A because.

1354
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:52,540
OK if only.

1355
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,720
Cut off all the hair

1356
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,240
I don't care

1357
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,100
I don't care

1358
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,640
Because I got my old world to live through

1359
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,700
And I ain't gonna copy you

1360
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,620
That was Vic Verga doing the sixth lesson on Praise Ball

1361
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,260
You're hurting me
