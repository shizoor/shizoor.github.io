1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,540
Victory at all costs.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,160
Victory in spite of all terror.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,520
Victory, however long and hard the road may be.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,320
For without victory, there is no survival.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,860
John Sparty, you are fined one credit for violation of the verbal morality statute.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,040
Wow! I feel good!

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,160
I knew that I would not.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,720
I feel good!

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,160
I knew that I would not.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,340
So good!

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,180
So good!

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,720
I got you!

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,780
Wow!

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,460
If you're nice,

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:54,100
sugar and spice.

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,820
I feel nice.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,300
Sugar and spice.

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,400
So nice.

19
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,940
So nice.

20
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,960
I'm done.

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:17,620
I'm done.

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,240
Ladies and gentlemen, darkness seems to be falling about us

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,020
as the passengers are leaving.

24
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,220
The passengers approach the gate of death.

25
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,500
But everyone keeps moving along at a steady pace

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,920
as if there were a guiding light.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,320
For they are proceeding without fear of any kind.

28
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,860
Bob's my friend

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,520
And he's leading me somewhere

30
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,100
Is he waiting there for me?

31
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,500
Is he waiting for me?

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,160
Bob's my friend

33
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,700
And he's leading me somewhere

34
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,780
What could be waiting there for me?

35
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,000
What's waiting for me?

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,900
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me

37
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,280
Stop the aliens from killing me

38
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,580
Bob can help me

39
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,920
He can help

40
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,260
But will he?

41
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,360
Will he help me?

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,620
Got to get to the bottom

43
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,000
Welcome to the subgenius radio show.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000


45
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,380
Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

46
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,260
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

47
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,900
Subgenius Radio Show.

48
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,660
Subterranean desire.

49
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,040
This is an astonishing tape from the center of the earth.

50
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Rated XXX.

51
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:44,900


52
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,380
Okay, now we go to page 15 of the script.

53
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:49,740
Okay, now we go to page 15 of the script.

54
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,100
If you're following along in our 18 by 24 foot page script,

55
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,380
If you're following along in our 18 by 24 foot page script,

56
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,680
if you're following along in our 18 by 24 foot page script,

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,460
it's hard to turn these pages.

58
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,180
I have no cause because I have a very long arm.

59
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,560
I have no cause because I have a very long arm.

60
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:01,600
Yeah.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,840
It is only through a change in human consciousness

62
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,680
that the world will be transformed.

63
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,240


64
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,200
That the world will be transformed.

65
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,460
Castrate the masses

66
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:20,620
Castrate the masses

67
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,580
Castrate the masses

68
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,480
for the new shrinking world order.

69
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:28,980


70
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,740
The personal and the planetary are connected.

71
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,160
The personal and the planetary are connected.

72
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,640
As we expand our awareness of

73
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,800
body, mind, psyche and spirit

74
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,620
so also will the world be changed.

75
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,040


76
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,340
The human race is over.

77
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,900
The human race is over.

78
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,620
Castrate the masses.

79
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,460
Castrate the masses

80
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,620
Castrate the masses

81
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,800
Eliminate all gender

82
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,980
All hail the liberal agenda

83
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,880
The neo-nazi, sex offended

84
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,940
All human rights are hereby suspended

85
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,880
Cause it's over

86
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,780
The human race is hereby suspended

87
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:47,780


88
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,540
The neo-nazi, castrate the masses

89
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,940
Castrate the masses

90
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,560
This is our quest as we explore new dimensions.

91
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,760
Have you tried so many paths that you've become pathological?

92
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,960
Sampled so much personal growth that you're totally growthed out?

93
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,520
Do you think God probably loves you, but he's just not ready to make a commitment?

94
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,780
Do you think you might be confused, but you're not sure?

95
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,540
Do you think you might be confused, but you're not sure?

96
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:41,740
Well, stay tuned because we're about to speak with someone who can transform your depressing problems into laughing opportunities.

97
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:49,300
We've been reading that Bob is a joke that's been told too often.

98
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,720
That Bob isn't funny anymore.

99
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:59,080
That Bob should be more hip and less hype.

100
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,480
Oh dear listeners.

101
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,780
Oh dear listeners.

102
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,080
If you thought that Bob was a joke,

103
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,120
If you thought that Bob was a joke, that Bob was funny,

104
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,580
There's only one joke here and it's on you.

105
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,180
I'm talking to you.

106
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,380
Don't turn the radio off.

107
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,900
You know I'm talking to you.

108
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,460
You card-carrying members of the H.I.F.E.

109
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,440
First church of the cute and funny name of Bob.

110
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:53,660
The overweight, beer-drinking, thick-clenched, flabby-bellied boys clubs that have sprung up around the sublime philosophies of the church of the subgenius.

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,800
Sitting around wishing there were more girls interested in Bob.

112
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:12,020
When they've just done everything they can to make it completely uninteresting to the brilliant intellectual females who are surrounding them every day.

113
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,800
No, they sit around drinking beer and trying to think up ways to torment each other.

114
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,240
They ought to be out there kicking a few brains through their pinks.

115
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,800
Waking them up trying to stir them out of their lethargies.

116
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,780
To fist fight.

117
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,640
To push out a few dollars to send off to Dallas.

118
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,960
You can see I'm getting pretty fired up about this topic.

119
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:49,600
But these paid reviewers, these professional critics who get fat checks in the mail every month.

120
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:57,620
Every time they write a column tearing down something somebody else spent their whole lives trying to build up.

121
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:05,880
They've reached their pinnacle of creativity in destroying something somebody else dedicated their entire existence to.

122
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,820
And they get paid for it too.

123
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,460
Well if you don't think that's fair, well who said anything about fair in this world anyway?

124
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:25,620
I mean these people are, they don't care if it's Bob they're tearing down or if it's some other thing.

125
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,100
Some...

126
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,540
Something...

127
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,960
Silly or something important they just...

128
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:39,020
They gotta find some way of slamming everything that they see because let's face it friends.

129
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,580
They wouldn't be in that business if it wasn't for the fact that they're so insecure.

130
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,660
They just gotta stomp everything else down into the dirt.

131
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:54,040
So they can try to convince themselves that they're better than something at least.

132
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,600
When they look around the world and see how everything is going.

133
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:04,480
And how people are handsome and intelligent and competent.

134
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:18,260
And they're just twisted up for all soulless pitiful pimply faced hunchbacked four-eyed chinless scum sucking geeks.

135
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,660
Well naturally they got a slight inferiority complex.

136
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,820
Who wouldn't under those circumstances?

137
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:37,440
So you can't blame them for trying to tear down anything that might possibly make a difference in this world.

138
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,080
Including Bob and Bob is making a big difference.

139
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,920
The Church of the Subgenius why it saved more people from...

140
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,360
It's helped more...

141
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,580
Well it...

142
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:02,940
It's got more people to send one dollar to Box 1403-06 Dallas, Texas 75214.

143
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,020
Than virtually any other thing that there ever was.

144
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,460
Now you tell me that's not an achievement.

145
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,580
And these...

146
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,200
These people who sit around all day looking for...

147
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,460
Words that'll make big...

148
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,740
Things look little so they won't seem so little and...

149
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,540
And...

150
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,140
You know what I mean when I...

151
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,960
Just...

152
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,620
Just...

153
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,420
Send the dollar.

154
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,620
I got the number in my face.

155
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,040
Bob's my inner guide.

156
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
And he's leading my body.

157
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,160
He's even nice to my pets.

158
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,540
He's nice, he's nice to my...

159
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,960
Bob's that little voice.

160
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,880
And he's not just a dream now.

161
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,940
The mighty is who he is.

162
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,240
But...

163
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,880
But the aliens...

164
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,880
The aliens from killing me...

165
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,300
And their...

166
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:04,940
And their...

167
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,880
Excessive technology...

168
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,940
Oh yeah...

169
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,320
Oh yeah...

170
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,040
Can help me...

171
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,460
Oh yeah...

172
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,740
But will he...

173
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,300
He'll be...

174
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,880
He'll be...

175
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,680
Will I have to pay a fee?

176
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,820
Bobsy, Bobsy, Bobsy, Bobsy, Dobby, Dobby, Dobby, Dobby, Dobby...

177
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,540
Bobsy, Bobsy, Bobsy, Bobsy, Dobby, Dobby, Dobby, Dobby...

178
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,800
Who will dance with me?

179
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,760
Who will dance with me?

180
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,620
I'll dance in the mist...

181
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,720
Yee-haw!

182
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,260
Whee!

183
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,660
Oh dear friends...

184
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,180
Uh...

185
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,700
The Saigon twist there down at the end and...

186
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,300
What is this in the background?

187
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,040
Why it's Dallas's own...

188
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,220
The Potatoes.

189
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,860
And I guess it's time for...

190
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,220
With this lovely Nino Rota tune in the background...

191
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,220
Performed by the Potatoes...

192
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,220
We'll give some credits there...

193
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,260
Uh...

194
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,780
Uh...

195
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,180
Bob's my friend...

196
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,200
That last little song there by Dr. Onan Canobite...

197
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,420
This is a very Portlandian show...

198
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,220
Because the nice rant...

199
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,760
There about how Bob is not funny...

200
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,300
That was...

201
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,200
The great assassinated Nen Master...

202
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,700
Nen's Low...

203
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,960
Also a...

204
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,520
Portlandian...

205
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,040
And...

206
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,300
Oh!

207
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:33,260
There'll be more about the upcoming Universal Subgenius Pilgrimage Update Report Newsletter pretty soon...

208
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:38,520
We heard a little bit of material from a Swami beyond Ananda...

209
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,120
Or at least the introduction to him...

210
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,920
From some sort of tape somebody handed me at a convention somewhere...

211
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,560
The song...

212
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,640
The lovely song which you'll hear the end of soon...

213
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,300
Castrate the Masses...

214
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,200
Uh...

215
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,940
By uh...

216
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,060
John Bartels...

217
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,940
Our good friend John Bartels...

218
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,020
And uh...

219
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,920
Of course William Burroughs...

220
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,460
Doing...

221
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,160
I Feel Good...

222
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,420
The James Brown hit...

223
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,200
Actually that's not William Burroughs...

224
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,980
But a band called...

225
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,200
The Gomers...

226
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,080
Who do...

227
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,480
Among other things...

228
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:10,620
Uh...

229
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,400
Impressions of other rock stars...

230
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,380
Or famous people...

231
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:14,920
Doing...

232
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,940
Inappropriate tunes...

233
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,520
And we have...

234
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,300
Have a lot more of that coming up...

235
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,440
It's a beautiful, beautiful thing...

Music

268
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:30,460
I guess you could say, zilch is the noise made by falling globs of plastic that descend

269
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,880
from a burning bread bag.

270
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:39,300
You take a bread bag or a laundry bag or something, hang it in your doorway, set it on fire over

271
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:45,760
a bowl of water, and as the fiery globules pass through the air they make this sound

272
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,740
in stereo.

273
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,200
Zilch environments there by the great Jay Condom.

274
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,000
But friends, to get to this short sermon tonight.

275
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,740
You know it's just plain nonsense.

276
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
It's plain true that you can't see your own eyes.

277
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:24,640
And it's just as true that you can't think about your own brain.

278
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:32,900
I was out taking my exercise today in beautiful weather once again and pondering the nature

279
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,400
of intelligence.

280
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:40,580
And lately this sort of thing has been leading me deeper and deeper into a bad rut.

281
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,440
The more I ponder, the grumpier I become.

282
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,620
I had...

283
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,400
Had lately, to tell the truth, gotten so cantankerous that I was analyzing everything

284
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,360
that anybody said for the basic motivation behind it.

285
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,720
Asking myself what made them say that just then?

286
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,620
What really?

287
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:08,520
And when you examine people that closely, you inevitably arrive at the realization that

288
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:14,920
every single thing that comes out of their foul traps is said just to make them feel

289
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,740
like they're...

290
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,220
They're so cool.

291
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,040
And that's disheartening, friend.

292
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,900
To know that nothing anybody says is for any loftier purpose than that.

293
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:32,120
But what's even worse was when I analyzed my own thoughts about the whole thing and

294
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:40,260
realized that if anything, my thinking of that was even more venal, petty, jealous,

295
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,980
and self-serving.

296
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,120
If you really listen to yourself talk.

297
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,180
You'll realize what trash is emitting from your filthy sewer all the time.

298
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,660
And it's really depressing.

299
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,320
Also, it can't help but start digging you into a rut that gets deeper and deeper and

300
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,960
more vindictive until it becomes just a vortex of bitterness.

301
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,500
Now I know that this hatefulness can't go on forever.

302
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,860
And soon I'll reach a new level of hate.

303
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:15,100
A sort of epiphany whereby I realize, or at least rationalize, some no-brainer.

304
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,380
Some no-brainer.

305
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,820
Maybe it's not that.

306
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:32,360
самыеündlassesotfeasturingsnotteamled plungwrplainsor barrierthere to be passed, and a new realization.

307
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:38,880
If so, I wish it would hurry up and get here, because for the time being, it still appears

308
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,820
to me that for the most part, all people are inherently mean and paranoid, or almost as

309
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,640
much so as I.

310
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:57,140
And besides, what is the purpose of all this, uh, knowing of what fools we mortals be?

311
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,500
Where does it get you?

312
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:04,520
The whole line of reasoning seems so fruitless, yet all too horribly true.

313
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:10,740
You end up thinking, why, only a genius would be able to analyze people and see through

314
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:16,080
their charades like this, but only an idiot would actually do so.

315
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,180
And that truly, friends, is the dichotomy of the subgenius right there, the subgenius

316
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,680
philosophy in action.

317
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,020
Actually it's the subgenius emergentiles philosophy.

318
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:33,360
Because the other type of subgenius, the rewardian, for them it's just the opposite.

319
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:40,040
They're the only ones brutish enough to actually do it, but are incapable of it due to laziness

320
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,500
and sloth.

321
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:49,660
And friend, if you're like me, you go through life sometimes feeling, oh, real smart, uh-huh,

322
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,780
like some kind of high school lawyer, knowing that by the sheer insightfulness of your mere

323
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,000
musings and opinions, you're going to be a fool. And that's the kind of thing that I'm

324
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,000


325
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,000


326
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,540
saying.

327
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,220
Being a fool is the best thing, knowing to actually accept the truth, and knowing to

328
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,480
accept it.

329
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:58,480


330
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,620
When you're a superior being, you're a superior being.

331
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,060
You're a superior being, you're a superior being.

332
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:11,260
But that notion is constantly being heartlessly dashed and shattered as you face proof after

333
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:16,240
proof that you're instead, merely stupid, and crazy.

334
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,120
The best thing is probably just to out-and-admit it.

335
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:26,280
I'll admit it, I'm stupid and crazy a lot of the time, and I'll bet, I hope that you

336
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,880
are too.

337
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,000


338
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:34,240
But at least, at least, we get to be super intelligent geniuses some of the time.

339
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,340
Probably just enough to be dangerous.

340
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,040
But the others, they don't even get that, my friends.

341
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,940
Let's put on something more somehow lively.

342
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,960
There, that's more traditional.

343
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,880
Anyway, that's the way of the subgenius, friends.

344
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:59,500
The philosophy of the subgenius simultaneously vauntingly wise and sickeningly puerile.

345
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,060
Thus, it's the most realistic philosophy because it's more like real life.

346
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:13,600
And yet, is it not also the curse of the subgenius to bear this knowledge that our way is as retarded as it is lofty?

347
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:20,820
Truly, as Saint Hyperclete's pointed out, you cannot think about your own brain.

348
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,860
The subgenius.

349
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:27,240
Sometimes I think the only answer is to move to Micronesia and carve dugout canoes for a living.

350
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:27,720
Seriously.

351
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,060
It'd be healthier, more slackful, and you'd get more reading done.

352
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,780
You could read every classic in the Micronesia library.

353
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:46,940
Enjoying the time to ponder the wisdom of the ages instead of having to hurriedly skim every new trendy article in every new trendy magazine.

354
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,740
All of it about trivial ephemeral fads with no bearing.

355
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,520
And you're not even thinking about basic human reality or the nature of the universe.

356
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,220
I don't know, friends.

357
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,600
I shouldn't even be talking about thinking about your own brain.

358
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,460
It's going to sound stupid no matter what.

359
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,220
Simply because I am a subgenius and because it is true.

360
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:15,820
It's kind of like the more I learn, friends, in all my travels and travails through life,

361
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,300
the less I'm inclined to say anything about any of it for that very reason.

362
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,840
I sure am.

363
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,380
I really don't want to presume to impart any serious philosophy.

364
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,380
And even if I were actually to have one,

365
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:36,380
I should think, I should think that the divine prank philosophy that we all share under dogs

366
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:44,500
should be sufficient unto the pathetic unhearing and uncomprehending ears of any human listeners,

367
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,540
or rather eavesdroppers, that we might have tonight.

368
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,320
So, um, let's just change the subject.

369
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:51,840
Uh, first of all, I'm not going to be talking about the divine prank philosophy.

370
00:21:51,860 --> 00:22:02,760
But last week, we reeled off a long list of subgenii and rogue or renegade subgenii who died lately.

371
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,300
Kirby, Zappa, and so forth.

372
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:13,040
Well, this week it was Charles Bukowski, dead at the ripeness of 73,

373
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,380
proving, like Alistair Crowley and Keith Richards,

374
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,680
that Yul Gibbons and all those other anti-drug fanatics and health freaks,

375
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,900
are a bunch of chumps.

376
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,320
Zappa was famous for not touching illegal, dangerous drugs like marijuana.

377
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,760
He was a good boy.

378
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,820
He stuck with conspiracy street drugs like Winstons and coffee.

379
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,280
Lots of them.

380
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,160
And he died at 52.

381
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,380
Huh.

382
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,520
Um, but we must...

383
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,860
Actually, I should...

384
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,760
Well, I guess this music will do.

385
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,500
We have to add another name to the list, friends.

386
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,740
Robert Shea died this week of cancer.

387
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,980
And, uh, yeah, it's sad.

388
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,160
But this time it is actually very true.

389
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:08,680
Robert Shea was the co-author with Robert Anton Wilson of the groundbreaking Illuminatus trilogy,

390
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,320
which one might call the bedrock of quicksand upon which our own church was built.

391
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,820
And, uh, since that time...

392
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,620
I need to shut that.

393
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,640
That music's just...

394
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,400
I mean, this is...

395
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,080
This is serious.

396
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,400
Um, uh...

397
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:29,820
Yeah, Bob Shea's written a lot of fine books upholding the tradition of Illuminatus and so forth.

398
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,060
Ironically, while the rumor that Bob Wilson was dead was only a rumor,

399
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,240
this one is definitely not.

400
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
And, uh, I was, uh...

401
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,680
I've been lucky enough to sit and yak with Bob Shea several times in the last couple of years.

402
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,540
And he was a real nice guy.

403
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,540
On top of being, uh, you know, incredibly erudite and talented and...

404
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,080
Well, it's a bummer, friends, altogether.

405
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,680
It is indeed, uh, a bummer.

406
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:12,060
And, uh, however, I believe, I understand that, uh, uh, Pope Shea did indeed have religion after his own fashion.

407
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,960
And so has certainly gone to heaven or reincarnated or whatever.

408
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,340
Um, I'm afraid, uh...

409
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,260
That, uh, I won't be so lucky.

410
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,500
I can tell you that right now.

411
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,240
Because I don't believe in those things, friends.

412
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,820
You have to believe in heaven to go there.

413
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,240
And...

414
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,060
I don't know.

415
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,680
I'm just so grumpy lately that I don't believe in anything.

416
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,980
I just believe in me.

417
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,120
Yoko and me.

418
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,160
And Charlie Manson!

419
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,340
Yeah, Manson!

420
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,980
We were gonna free Manson, man!

421
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,460
Well, we forgot!

422
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,920
We were gonna free Manson!

423
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,140
We need to go back and do it!

424
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,160
Well, um, friends...

425
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:57,400
We're gonna find that tape we were playing, and, uh, we'll be right back after we free Charlie.

426
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,080
Thank you.

427
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,600
You're gonna dance with me, you're gonna dance with me, you're gonna walk through the night...

428
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,860
Our relationship is, our relationship is, our relationship is breaking down, breaking down.

429
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,000
Our relationship is breaking down, breaking down.

430
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,580
...

431
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:13,920
...

432
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,340
...

433
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:50,500


434
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,200
From my own arms,

435
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,340
I say, it always has been like this.

436
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,480
I will kiss you,

437
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,800
With my left side.

438
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:05,940
It's cake.

439
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,360
Who you know.

440
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,460
Wow!

441
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,500
I feel good!

442
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,180
I can feel that I'll walk...

443
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:18,820
...

444
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,280
I feel good

445
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,700
As I know that I want it

446
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,960
So good, so good I got you

447
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:50,400
So nice, so nice I got you

448
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:02,360
So good, so good I got you

449
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,920
It's a hard game today, today

450
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,280
Huh

451
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,480
Tell me

452
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,580
TAPE 174 MASTURBATION

453
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,640
Masturbation has been generally defined as self-induced sexual stimulation.

454
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:36,540
It's a very widespread and frequently occurring experience in both sexes.

455
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:43,100
It usually begins early and by when an infant finds touching certain parts of the body pleasurable.

456
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:48,960
In general, masturbation decreases when an adequate sex partner is found.

457
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,500
If a couple of green chocolate bars end up dieser age.

458
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,020
Should the吃 ganzi in your fault?

459
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,520
But remember,

460
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,780
Masturbation is not an endurance.

461
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,480
Masturbation 매� ABS strategy

462
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,240
Castrate the masses

463
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,360
Castrate the masses

464
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,100
Castrate the masses

465
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,320
Castrate the masses

466
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,360
Castrate the masses

467
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,840
No

468
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,040
Castrate the masses

469
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,320
Castrate the masses

470
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,860
thereby

John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

472
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,200
And this song here.

473
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:56,220
John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

474
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,780
John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:12,380
John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

481
00:33:50,580 --> 00:34:07,540
John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

482
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,000
John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

483
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,680
John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

484
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,400
John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

485
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,940
Tom Superintendent, the great John Bartles.

486
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,680
John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

487
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,220
John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

488
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,160
John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

489
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,560
John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

490
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,460
John Bartles, the great John Bartles.

491
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,760
Oh, but the conspiracy won't agree,

492
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,300
never in a million years.

493
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,980
Suggesting life may have been

494
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:21,040
better back then is revisionism. Or could it be, could it be, that the conspiracy has something to

495
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:30,260
hide? What? You mean like lie or conspire to conceal the truth? Oh no, not our conspiracy-run

496
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:36,000
government. No, sir, say it ain't so. After all, we've grown up with the conspiracy. It practically

497
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,460
raised us like a farmer and his cattle. The conspiracy oversaw every stage of our development

498
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:47,240
since we were born. Granted, it castrated the uppity males and milked the rest of us dry through

499
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,580
toil and taxes, but hey, it's better than living in the wild. At least that's what we've always been

500
00:35:52,580 --> 00:36:00,320
told. But consider, if you will, dear friends, the plight of the rabbit. Did you know that rabbits

501
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:07,620
forget how to dig tunnels after just one generation of captivity? It's true. Keep their parents locked

502
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,360
up in a cage for just one generation, and the offspring...

503
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:18,340
never learn how to burrow. In effect, they've become mentally dependent on their captors, though

504
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:23,880
physically they're the same as the rabbits that dug through the Stone Age. Only now, if they escaped,

505
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:31,960
they'd actually die, because they've lost their most basic knowledge of how to live free. It's a sad

506
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:38,540
truth, dear friends, but a plight not unique on two rabbits. Normal human beings depend on the

507
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,260
conspiracy more and more every day.

508
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:48,460
And wouldn't dream of living without it. Indeed, they couldn't dream of life without the conspiracy, because they've

509
00:36:48,460 --> 00:37:00,300
literally forgotten what real independence is. All they know is captivity is safe, and freedom is risky. And, for the

510
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:11,140
most part, they're right. After all, what could possibly be safer than a nice, warm cage? So, let us not

511
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,440
die.

512
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:11,440


513
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:11,440


514
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:19,080
Be too harsh onto the normals, dear friends. After all, they don't know any better. They've been born and raised on the

515
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:27,060
conspiracy. It's only natural to assume they would become attached. But, by the same token, let not the wise among us

516
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:34,960
continue to perpetuate a myth which common sense dictates to be false. Because we have no excuse. We do know better.

517
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:41,300
We must proclaim the grim reality of the current situation. We must.

518
00:37:41,300 --> 00:38:10,000
Face up to the ugly truth instated for all posterity. For this, dear friends, is no longer the land of the free and home of the brave. Instead, it has become a plantation owned and operated by fat, cat conspiracy overseers and worked by the most pathetic of all animal creatures. I'm talking about you and me.

519
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:18,880
The domesticated humans. Here endeth the word of Bob. Amen.

520
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:39,120
In recent years, a real mystery has grown up around the subject of feminine hygiene. Much of this is due to advertising of so-called hygiene products, which make us think that unless the American woman uses a particular deodorant or spray,

521
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,380
she is neither clean nor desirable.

522
00:38:42,780 --> 00:39:09,980
And so she's the one that they they they drew blood out of her and her blood had crystals in it and it made the doctors and the nurses pass out. You didn't hear that story? No. No. They they she went in the hospital and she had cancer of some sort. And they they took blood out and they noticed she had crystallized blood or crystals in her blood. The Andromeda strain. And then yeah, that's what I was figuring. And then and then they passed out and like seven people got sick from just being exposed to the

523
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:38,800
blood crystals. Yeah. My God. So sick. But I was thinking I was saying definitely alien gulfs the world. But were they blood crystals? Make were they? She was either an an abduction experiment, I figured, you know, and then placed back down on Earth. Right. Or or she's an alien who's who's human assimilation system or Haas, as we know it, failed. Haas failed. Not to talk over the heads of the listeners. Well, you scraped a little niche in my area.

524
00:39:40,000 --> 00:40:09,760
Sales in Sterno should go up because, you know, the only way to avoid that blood crystallization virus is to drink Sterno. Oh, we're not telling anybody. Don't get us wrong, listeners. We're not advocating the drinking of Sterno or becoming Sterno bums. It's worked for some of us, but we're not advocating this. It's just in case you get the virus where your blood crystallizes and the doctors and nurses all puke. Oh, and by the way, one of your sawdust. One to three Americans die each day in hospitals.

525
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,440
Due to medication errors or mix. How many? One in one to three. Oh, that's in each and every hospital.

526
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,960
That's acceptable. Just a mistake. A lot of people die. One lady.

527
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,960
Judge Carlin has a list of people, types of people you should never trust.

528
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,120
Brain surgeons who've won to lose tattooed on their arm.

529
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,100
Airline pilots with one black shoe and one brown one.

530
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,420
Lawyers who refer to the police as the federales.

531
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,780
Pimps who drive Toyota Corollas.

532
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:48,680
And anybody who mentions Jesus 18 times in the first three minutes after you make the run.

533
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,700
And friends, that brings me to a place to cut in.

534
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,880
Actually, I guess I should do some credits here.

535
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:05,600
You just heard Robert Anton Wilson quoting George Carlin.

536
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,700
And it's true.

537
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,940
A little bit of brain rot radiation.

538
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,560
And I'm not sure if that's true.

539
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:10,560


540
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:10,560


541
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,600
There may be more.

542
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,900
There's hours more of that on tape.

543
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,220
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Psychopath.

544
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,600
And Chaz.

545
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,080
Evil Chaz Smith.

546
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,600
Up from WCSB in Cleveland.

547
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:33,460
I'm working on a play called Brain Rot on X Day.

548
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,200
Someday we'll get it done and produced.

549
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,860
Sosodata sent us the interest.

550
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,960
We're going to get the interesting tapes of feminine hygiene.

551
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,700
And also the tape I'm about to play.

552
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,720
But I'll get to that in a minute.

553
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:52,320
Father Joe Mama there with a wonderful classic sermon on the domesticated human.

554
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,460
And I think that about covers it.

555
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,240
Well, what we've got here, this is an interesting...

556
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,960
Oh, it's a damning piece of tape.

557
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,460
Captured off the radio in New Jersey by the Sosodata technicians.

558
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,440
And it's...

559
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,680
Okay, I guess I should start at the beginning.

560
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,580
But not too far back in the beginning.

561
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,460
We at the Subgenius Foundation, and in fact all subgeniuses out there,

562
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:27,300
have been sadly ripped off by this twerp in Canada

563
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,820
who says he's our true guru, Bob Dobbs.

564
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,700
He's just a twerp.

565
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,560
He doesn't look like Bob.

566
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,480
Doesn't sound like Bob.

567
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,600
He made himself a little CD

568
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,980
that he's trying to sell.

569
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,080
Using Bob's name.

570
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,900
And he hasn't had much success.

571
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,020
So he started making...

572
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,940
He moved to New York apparently recently.

573
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,840
And has started making stupid, stupid prank calls

574
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:59,060
to WFMU, the noble station there in East Orange, New Jersey.

575
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:03,260
In fact, the first station to ever play subgenius tapes at all.

576
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,660
And the first one to carry the hour of slack outside of Dallas.

577
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,960
This is a recording of Bob's...

578
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,480
Bob Dean making stupid prank calls.

579
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,220
I mean, they're not even prank calls.

580
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:15,760
They don't...

581
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,360
They don't...

582
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,420
They haven't earned the hail name of true prank calls yet.

583
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,420
Calling the show of Chris T on WFMU.

584
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,820
Oh, you'll love this, friends.

585
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:30,480
Bye.

586
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:30,740
Bye.

587
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,260
Hello, welcome to the air.

588
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,880
Yeah, are you a holyopathic retrieval?

589
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,620
One of these days I'm going to find that man.

590
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:39,960
I'm going to...

591
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:39,960


592
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,960
I'm going to kick the livings out of him.

593
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:48,480
Oh, I should drop in and mention here that apparently this guy just every Wednesday or so,

594
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:53,320
whenever he can, he just hits redial over and over and over again.

595
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,440
They're in the middle of a...

596
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,960
It's a talk show that he interrupts.

597
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,360
And they usually have some interesting thing going.

598
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,600
They may not even be talking about Bob Dobbs, and yet it's still interesting.

599
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,140
But this guy just keeps...

600
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,860
Every time they pick up the phone, he goes,

601
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,360
Babs Media Ecology.

602
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,960
Which is the name of his stupid product.

603
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:18,760
And this was the longest time that they ever managed to keep him on the air, okay?

604
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,480
We'll continue now here.

605
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,100
The number here is 201-678-7743.

606
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:29,340
That man, he just better pray like he's never prayed before,

607
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,400
that I never, ever run into him.

608
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,760
Because it will not be good for him.

609
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,920
Hello, welcome to the air.

610
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,040
Yeah, are you...

611
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,380
Okay, the phone number here is 201-678-7743.

612
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:46,960
Listen to some music.

613
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,020
We'll be right back.

614
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,180
Hey, hello, welcome to the air.

615
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,920
Now, I know there's somebody there.

616
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,380
Hello, welcome to the air.

617
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,300
Yeah, Chris.

618
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,500
Chris, Babs Media Ecology.

619
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,520
You want to talk?

620
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,000
Yes, I do.

621
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,480
Actually, I would like to have you on my show,

622
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,420
but I don't think that you would ever come down here.

623
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,560
Oh, yeah, I do that.

624
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,120
I would like to have you down on the show and talk to you about this,

625
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,340
the topic that you feel so compelled...

626
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,420
Well, I'm Bob Dobbs.

627
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,280
Can you believe that?

628
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,800
Talking to you every Friday,

629
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,120
except for a month off in January to sell my...

630
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,120
Now, are you a guy that I heard Ivan Stang is suppressing a lawsuit against?

631
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:39,280
Did you do something that appropriated some Church of the...

632
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,100
some subgenius material,

633
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,400
and he's been trying to locate you so he could either press a suit against you or something?

634
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,700
There was something to that effect.

635
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,260
It had to do with a guy from Canada who's now living in the New York area,

636
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,320
and I was wondering if that was you,

637
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,680
if you're the fellow that Ivan Stang would like to get his hands on to sue.

638
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,540
Well, he's not...

639
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,420
Is that you, sir?

640
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,840
I mean, would you like to answer that question?

641
00:45:58,900 --> 00:45:59,500
Oh, yeah, that's me.

642
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:00,220
That is you?

643
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:00,620
Yep.

644
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,960
Okay, and you're not willing to reveal who you are or where you are

645
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,960
because you know that it would involve some financial difficulty for you and or a lawsuit.

646
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,380
Well, it doesn't involve me.

647
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,540
I had nothing to do with the album.

648
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:15,920
The album, like his book, is an interpretation of me by Nelson Thal and Dave Neufeld.

649
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,220
He thought I had something to do with it, but it's just they distorted some of my...

650
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,620
It's true, though, that you are a Canadian,

651
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,820
and you are this person who has been appropriating material

652
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,760
and doesn't really have an original thought.

653
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,320
No, I pretend I'm a Canadian.

654
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,020
I was born in Paris in 1922.

655
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:35,100
I think, sir, that my whole audience can tell just from your accent that you're a Canadian.

656
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,240
No, that was my wife who was talking to you.

657
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,340
That was my wife.

658
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:39,340


659
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:39,340


660
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:39,340


661
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,140
My wife was talking to me back at Christmas.

662
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,460
From the fact that you have nothing better to do on Friday afternoon

663
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,940
than to call me up and say those three words...

664
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,500
And Wednesday afternoon.

665
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,020
I also call Wednesdays.

666
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,440
Well, it just shows the limit of your...

667
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,120
The total limit of your scope as a Canadian.

668
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:59,320
You really can think of nothing more to do than to call up someone's phone-in talk show.

669
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,740
Well, as a Tetrad manager, I refuse to live.

670
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,520
As a what?

671
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,680
As a Tetrad manager, I refuse to live.

672
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,600
I'm the opposite of Zappa, who said the present-day composer refused to die.

673
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:08,980
Well...

674
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,720
As a present-day, yestermorrow Tetrad manager, I refuse to live.

675
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,180
Have you ever really listened to yourself?

676
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,540
Have you ever really listened to the crap that you babble?

677
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,300
Well, it's not me.

678
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,380
I'm talking technically.

679
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,400
I'm talking technically.

680
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,540
Well, the thing is that you think you're really being witty.

681
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,220
And it's just the opposite.

682
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,960
There are people out there who are listening to you going,

683
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,420
what a dick this guy is.

684
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,540
Well, I'm not trying to be witty.

685
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,060
I'm doing Tetrad management.

686
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,900
It requires a four-part process.

687
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,000
You know, you can read it in McLuhan's book, Laws of Media.

688
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,560
That's what I do is I run the secret council of ten.

689
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,040
You know that.

690
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,400
It's not a process of humor.

691
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,180
Humor is a situation of laughing and learning.

692
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:51,320
Well, sir, my show would like to bring some of that to the people who listen to it.

693
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,940
And you're just dragging it down.

694
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,820
You bring nothing to this program whatsoever.

695
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,200
Well, it's like a Michael Taylor song, you know?

696
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:58,740
I have to go now.

697
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,600
Thank you.

698
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,640
I'm sorry I entertained that as long as I did.

699
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,860
Obviously, these people have never read the Bible.

700
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,780
I would not be surprised if God,

701
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,140
did not give some of these people some kind of a horrible disease.

702
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,120
Now, they think that this can't happen.

703
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,240
You better wake up, folks.

704
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:22,040
You that are planning these calls and that are mocking and making fun of God,

705
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,320
you are not above God's law.

706
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,580
Don't be surprised if God's judgment doesn't swoop down on you swift and fast.

707
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,260
Oh, we've been going through this all week.

708
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,880
I tell you, this has been, it's been a circus.

709
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,200
These, what we have done, and so many of these,

710
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,360
these calls are coming from the homosexual community.

711
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,220
And it's obvious when they call, you can tell.

712
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,660
They don't understand, see, Michael, that true Christian people,

713
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:51,300
that the gift of discerning of spirits begins to work,

714
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,140
and we pick up what they are.

715
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:53,700
Yeah.

716
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,820
And they don't understand that we are laughing at them,

717
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,900
but they are a stench in the nostrils of God.

718
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,300
Sing along.

719
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,260
I hate you, you hate me.

720
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,060
I guess that's the way it was meant to be,

721
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,620
because you were in the stars.

722
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,640
You be in my arms.

723
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,760
And I am something else.

724
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,460
No, we always know that you should run out of the way,

725
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,040
all the others,

726
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,060
and the devil about to hurt us.

727
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,220
That's what they're like.

728
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,880
Oh, a little Olo-T there in the background.

729
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,220
And, oh, do we have time?

730
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,860
Sure, we'll go for it.

731
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,980
Friends, this is Reverend Sheldon DeWare,

732
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,500
sort of covering some of a similar subject matter

733
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,080
we've somehow pried open.

734
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:37,500
Thank you.

735
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,620
Thank you, Sheldon!

736
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,960
Now tonight I'm here to tell you about religion and sales.

737
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,520
Now, Bob, as you may well know,

738
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,860
merged sales and religion back in 1953

739
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:54,060
with the founding of the Church of the Subgenius.

740
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,700
Praise Bob!

741
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,960
But, friends, when Bob did that, he wasn't doing anything new.

742
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,300
He was pointing out the obvious, my friends,

743
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:07,080
because religion has always been about sales.

744
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,180
20,000 years ago,

745
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:09,180


746
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,720
if you wanted to reign,

747
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,800
you went to a rain god,

748
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,380
and you paid for that reign

749
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,140
with your prayer, your faith,

750
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,480
and the charred flesh of your sacrifices.

751
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:27,480
But these days, my friends, religion is a bit more complicated.

752
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,920
As a matter of fact, it's more like that huge corporation

753
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,360
bending over you and bending you over all the time.

754
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,280
They want you just to be an employee

755
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,360
of the company.

756
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:42,280
Going to church is your job, my friends.

757
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,160
Well, you don't have to do that.

758
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,300
You don't have to work for religion.

759
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,340
You can buy from religion,

760
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,280
or you can invest in religion, my friends.

761
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,460
Every prayer that you make

762
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,600
is an investment to the god of your choice.

763
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,980
And now that you know this,

764
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,340
how do you make your best of it?

765
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,960
Well, since I'm a preacher

766
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,260
and a pastor,

767
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,540
I'm a spiritual stockbroker.

768
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,620
I can't tell you too much.

769
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,320
However, let me tell you one thing,

770
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,260
a little hint.

771
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,700
Diversify your stock, my friends.

772
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,720
Diversify your stock.

773
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,760
Because if you buy ten stocks,

774
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,220
and some of them suck,

775
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:31,620
the three remaining shall make you rich.

776
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,220
Still make you rich.

777
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,900
So worship all the gods that you can.

778
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,440
Jehovah One,

779
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,120
Eric,

780
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,080
the wrong friend,

781
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,040
Mohandas,

782
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:42,600
Nunu,

783
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,400
Narnini,

784
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,060
Jill Katz,

785
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,280
Eshersaw,

786
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,020
Arnold,

787
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,320
Moe,

788
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,260
Jimmy,

789
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,700
Bob!

790
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,180
Worship them!

791
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,580
So go out there

792
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,320
and do your due test

793
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,080
to become filthy rich in the hereafter.

794
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,020
Praise Bob, my friends.

795
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,060
Praise Bob!

796
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,000
Praise Bob!

797
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,300
Praise Bob!

798
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,620
Oh, yes indeed.

799
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,480
Our good friend there,

800
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,440
Reverend Sheldon De Ware,

801
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,740
from his tape,

802
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,940
Hangnail of the Stark Fist.

803
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,080
And talking about diversifying

804
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,040
your religious stock.

805
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,820
And we suggest that you do that.

806
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,720
Buy into any religion you want to.

807
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,160
Except that of the false Bob,

808
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,780
the false Canadian Bob.

809
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,560
He must die.

810
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,320
He must die forever and over and over again.

811
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,860
Sivit, why don't you come over here and help me give the post office box number?

812
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:51,400
We bring the kids in here every now and then to help clean up the tapes that spill all over the floor

813
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,100
after the Nurk twins heard in the background are through with them.

814
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:00,640
But I know that you want more information about this so-called church,

815
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,740
and you can sure get it for free.

816
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:04,680
Yes?

817
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,660
Well, the first hits for free.

818
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:11,640
It basically tells you a lot more that gets you in deeper and deeper.

819
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:18,140
All you have to do is drop us a self-addressed stamped envelope and write to Bob.

820
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,440
You got that pencil ready for the address?

821
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,920
Sivit, do you remember the address?

822
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:24,620
No.

823
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:25,700
No?

824
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,440
No.

825
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,380
Well, maybe if...

826
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,160
Are you sure you don't remember the address?

827
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:32,760
Yeah.

828
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,660
Fair enough.

829
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,000
Friends, that address to write to is, of course,

830
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:49,080
Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

831
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:53,460
Once again, that's P.O. Box 140306.

832
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,060
Did I say that right?

833
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,280
140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

834
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,140
And I'm going to get us out of here.

835
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,300
Oh, we've got so much more brain rot.

836
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,240
And, oh, prank calls.

837
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:11,660
Oh, some new prank calls for next week from Radio Jihad in Austin.

838
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:20,560
And I should mention that our good friends, we're about to play in a minute, Lost Souls Incorporated,

839
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:25,380
will be doing a concert on April 1st.

840
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,280
No, I'm not kidding.

841
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:27,820
It really is April 1st.

842
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:32,500
A gig at the Commerce Street Bar, formerly the Profit Bar.

843
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,240
They're in Deep Ellum.

844
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:41,700
And, yes, at Lost Souls Incorporated, as heard.

845
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:49,340
Well, they've got a new sort of commercial-looking tape out titled, indeed, Lost Souls Incorporated.

846
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,280
Oh, here's their address.

847
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:55,780
Send inquiries to P.O. Box 121968.

848
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:04,060
Once again, Lost Souls at Box 121968, Arlington, Texas 760.

849
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,820
Our store, 112, and here it is.

850
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,400
.

851
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:13,460
.

852
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,800
.

853
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:28,920
.

854
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,280
.

855
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:29,480
.

856
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:29,560
.

857
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:30,560
.

858
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:30,660
.

859
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,380
.

860
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:32,480
.

861
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:32,560
.

862
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:32,580
.

863
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:32,660
.

864
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:32,660


865
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:32,680
.

866
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:32,680


867
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:32,720
.

868
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:32,720


869
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:32,720


870
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:32,720


871
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:32,860
.

872
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:32,860


873
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:32,860


874
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,080
.

875
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,080


876
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,080


877
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,500
and dreams

878
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,080
I was having the nightmare of the apocalypse

879
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:38,680
again

880
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,920
when you woke me with your phony bedside scream

881
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,920
they remind me

882
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,620
of a dinner bell still ringing

883
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,960
since Pavlov and his

884
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,220
dogs have had their day

885
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,800
we're drooling green and we

886
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,920
recycle everything

887
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,880
it's no one's fault there's nothing

888
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:56,520
new today

889
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,840
trying to steer the upside

890
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,020
of a down world

891
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,800
trying to ignore the entropy

892
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,520
trying to steer the upside

893
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,700
of a down world

894
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,540
talking about the 20th century

895
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:13,940
industrial

896
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,740
to information culture

897
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,960
from communist

898
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,580
to root of evil greed

899
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,800
the capitalists

900
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,400
gaining are still vultures

901
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,780
they smell a little blood

902
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,460
in a machine

903
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,880
trying to steer the upside

904
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,960
of a down world

905
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,440
trying to force down more than we can eat

906
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,500
trying to steer the upside

907
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,740
of a down world

908
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:41,740
still a little blood in our feet

909
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,340
upside

910
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:46,860
down world

911
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,760
fin de siècle

912
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,880
outside

913
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,240
down world

914
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,060
talking about

915
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,120
the end of the century

916
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,040
talking about the end of the century

917
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,160
talking about the end of this century

918
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,580
digital investigators

919
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:19,940
journalistic

920
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,660
horsemaster

921
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:21,680
wow

922
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,260
rebels

923
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,440
reviven

924
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:31,440


925
00:57:52,840 --> 00:58:00,380
We'll be right back.

926
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,100
We'll be right back.

927
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:40,520
We'll be right back.

928
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:12,620
We'll be right back.

929
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,760
They found a 300-year-old female skeleton that still has skin.

930
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:39,640
A much sought-after unpolluted air once in the coffin is gone,

931
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:43,980
but clues to what ended the woman's life may survive in her skin and hair,

932
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,120
preserved in a lead coffin.

933
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,600
NASA scientists from Langley, Virginia,

934
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:52,540
will continue searching for 17th century air in three lead coffins,

935
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,540
exhumed in 1990.

936
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:59,300
If modern air and water vapor have not seeped into the coffins,

937
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,100
the scientists can test.

938
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,300
They have their theory that human pollution has caused global warming.

939
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,800
In the deepness of the subterranean world,

940
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:13,780
a shallow fire satisfies some inquirers,

941
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:17,140
who, if two or three yards of the surface were to be digged up,

942
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:21,120
would not be content to rake in the bowels of profusely

943
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,360
or region toward the center.

944
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,860
Nature hath furnished one part of the earth and man another.

945
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,700
The treasures of time lie high.

946
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,120
There's no hospital.

947
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,780
There's no

948
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:52,360
But the practice of burning was also of great antiquity

949
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,540
and of no slender extent.

950
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:58,100
For not to derive the same from the Euclides,

951
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:01,340
examples exist in the annals of Gaul's days,

952
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:01,820
and in the same time in the annals of Spain's,

953
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,440
Sarmatians,

954
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,200
Swedes,

955
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:03,940
Mesopotamians,

956
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:04,920
Illyrians,

957
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:06,600
and even Americans.

958
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:16,040
And Cornelius Sallow burned the body of his son at Rome,

959
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,520
but manliest the consul didn't.

960
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:21,760
And so, well, that about wraps up another Happy Talk broadcast.

961
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:24,560
We are so full of you.

962
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:29,620
I hope we drank a lot of coffee and stayed up all night just to listen to this show.

963
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,420
Okay, now we're going to review a little bit of what we did,

964
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:31,420


965
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:37,940
the whole show for you now um well this is our ides of january show because of course

966
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:41,480
the ides of january is not the 15th as many people think but the 13th

967
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:46,700
since in the roman empire after the reformation of the julian calendar the ides of march
