Look out! God is right behind you!
The Subgenius Hour of Swag!
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye, Earth.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
Well, I sure do feel sorry for any subgeniuses that are listening to this show from Earth.
If any radios or transmitters are still working, and I know that some are,
but, you know, in theory, by the time you hear this, you'll be dead or wishing that you could die.
Actually, I don't feel sorry for you.
You knew about the 30 bucks and you just didn't have the faith in Bob.
I guess that Spice Girls connoisseur.
It was more important or something.
Now I've got Spice Girls sex goddesses if I want them, but I'm already bored with them.
I've only been on my escape vessel for a couple of days, and I'm already totally sated with pleasure.
Of course, I cheated. I used time control to turn those couple of days into a couple of months.
And I've already done everything I ever dreamed of doing, and then some. I haven't killed anybody.
Not specifically, anyway. I'm real proud about that.
Olivia
Hello, Brendy.
Nice tonight?
Man, it's time to go back home.
Hoping to continue my work here.
You know, not with Bosman.
Yep, sir.
fifth grade teacher that made me lose that spelling bee when she pronounced the word I was
supposed to spell several. She pronounced it serval. And she died for that. I had to bring her back to
life and then kill her. And I went back and scared the bee Jesus out of several old bosses of mine.
Just terrorized them and taunted them. Made fun of them for being cheap losers who thought 30 bucks
was too much for eternal life and pleasure. Sort of like a you.
Yes, as I look out from my huge view screen at the planet Earth far below me, it's all lit up like a
Christmas tree right now. But all those little lights are nuclear explosions. Those are cities
being nuked and then instantly reconstructed so they can be nuked again. It's kind of cool.
And guess what, friends? I didn't even use a tape recorder and microphone
to record this. I just used a tape recorder and microphone to record this.
I just thought about it. And the show is instantly finished. It's a good one, too.
I'm just thinking about what you hear me saying right now. And the WOM computer reproduces it as
a sound. All the way down to that trademark cheap mic tinny sound that I used to get in my Earth
studio.
I fooled you, didn't I? I'm not really on my escape vessel, folks. I'm actually recording
this 11 days before X-Day. And some of the stations are still on. I'm not really on my escape vessel,
but some of the stations are probably playing this before X-Day. And if it's after X-Day,
well, eh, no telling. But, friends, it's the last show I'll do before we leave for Brushwood,
New York, where the big X-Day gathering is for world Earth subgeniuses, soon to be ex-Earth
subgeniuses. I thought that this might be the very last hour of slack. And it might be for any
stations that still exist after X-Day. They'll probably all want to play nothing but hour of
slack in a vain attempt to kiss Bob's ass. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
And I suppose I could have the leftover dumbass bobbies send out reruns. I thought about starting
with hour of slack number one, which is really quite awful. And then when they get to this show,
which is number 637, they could just start the loop again. But then I thought, well, hell,
I might want to keep doing the show just for yucks, mainly for an escape vessel audience.
After all, it could be in widescreen 3D Technicolor and surround sound, and I wouldn't even have to
go searching for the tapes.
would all just fly together automatically.
So I don't really know what the future shows
will bring, friends.
I've been doing the ESO show on Thursday nights
as well as this show, and we have tons of material
from those that we might leave behind
for the Earth stragglers.
I don't know, we'll see.
In the meantime, hat friends,
this is the last Earth Hour of Slack.
So I should shut up and get on with the tapes,
of which we have plenty, actually.
We've got a Suzy the Floozies final X Day show,
which promises to be full of collages.
I've got me explaining X Day
to the High Times Radio Hour host.
That's, friends, it's proof that some brain cells
you probably do need to keep.
We've got recordings from the Papa Joe Mama's last preaching
and Jane Erslash's last preaching in the Atlanta Defival.
And so, friends, let us go deep, deep, deep, deep, deep.
And I hope to see you on the escape vessels
if you're hearing this before X Day.
If you're hearing it after X Day
and you're not on the escape vessels,
it's just too damn bad, ain't it?
Yes, praise, praise Bob.
Friends, I am getting excited.
I'm getting so excited.
10 days, 11 days.
And I shall be...
I shall be the lord of my own planet.
A planet of apes.
No, of beautiful, naked dinosaurs.
Yes, and yetis.
And yetis are president.
Friends, I'm hurt, Bob.
Oh, friends, I have to tell you before I forget,
I gotta tell you something kind of funny, kind of sad.
Yes, we are being...
We are being flooded with $30 memberships
and phone calls and faxes.
All of a sudden, now there's a week left,
and now they decide, now they decide
they want to interview Reverend Stang
or they want directions to Brushwood,
which indicates that they weren't members to begin with.
You know, they didn't really need to spend that X,
they didn't need to be subgenius ministers before.
And now there's something going on
and they're afraid they might miss out on it or something.
Now, at the very last minute, they're like, oh, well,







I'll decide, oh, now, just in case,
maybe I better get saved.
And you know what, friends?
That's just too damn bad
because we're kind of busy around here.
They may have to pay extra
to get that membership expedited, shall we?
You know, we haven't, we thought about,
we considered raising the price from $30
to $30,000 this week.
Maybe we should.
You know, Bob, I just wanted to give the dumbasses
one last chance, and sure enough, boy,
they are coming out of the woods.
They're coming out of the woodwork.
You find out when the world's about to end,
that's when you, that's when the dumbasses show their cards.
But I gotta give them credit.
They're not as dumb, a bunch of dumbasses
as the ones who just thought it was a joke
and never, you know, they'll,
I think that I'll bet you, I'll bet you anything
that we get thousands of orders for memberships
in the deserted post office.
I mean, I don't know if I'd be able to get out
of that post office box in Dallas, Texas,
in the week after we have left the planet.
Ugh, humans, God.
Oh, but look to the skies, Seekers.
Things are gearing up.
The exos are on the way to help us
immunize our eschaton.
Oh, and I'm lying here, sprawled on the red carpet
to greet our alien visitors.
I'm not even gonna start talking about that.
Gee, how would Uriel dress for this one?
Ooh, well, when in doubt, you know what they say, go naked.
Yeah, somehow flesh always goes with anything.
Which is lucky because I have more important things on my mind right now than my wardrobe.
Susie?
Oh, there's something on her neck.
Wild Boy decides to try to get Susie.
If he can only get the green disc from her neck, the spell will be broken.
Oh, but look what's happening.
Korhor and Zorad see them.
They are engulfing and freezing them in big yellow clouds.
It's easy to get your favorite New Age selection.
If you want the main selection, do nothing.
It will be sent to you automatically.
Those of us foolish enough to still believe that we are the only intelligent life in the universe
are very much like those who told Columbus the Earth was flat.
We present...
We present our next chapter in the New Age America video catalog, UFOs.
By 2001, the last barrier to space will be overcome.
By 2001, an interstellar spacecraft from the star cluster Pleiades will arrive on Earth.
By 2001, the Space Brothers will be helping Earth prepare to become the 33rd member of an interplanetary confederation.
Sound fantastic? It is. And it's true.
Greetings, friends.
I am Uriel.
And we are Unarius and preparing the Earth people for the great space fleet landing, the starship landing in 2001.
Read the script, you old bat. It's 1998. 1998!
Would you let the aliens land, please?
They might be here to pick me up.
Yes, there are unidentified flying objects because one did what he did.
One UFO did pick up Elijah and took him off.
I can tell you based on 2 Kings chapter 2 and Elijah, there is intelligent life on other planets.
They were asked to come over here to talk to these people.
They had in their mind that they... it was just a big joke.
Because after you've been taken aboard a UFO, it's kind of hard to top that, alright?
They have Alcoholics Anonymous. They don't have Alien Anonymous.

Uriel... how are you all doing?
Good... good.
Some new faces here.
Some new. Some familiar.
We are known as Allaisia.
We are a tenth dimensional entity.
You might say we are the light that permeates all existence.
Hey, if you're so light, how come you're so freaking fat?
Everybody has to have something to do.
Imagine that possibility for a moment.
The light that permeates all existence is channeling through an extraterrestrial walk-in
in this room here in Boston.
What extraordinary times you live in.
This must be a very extraordinary time to be in existence on this planet.
Do you find it to be so?
Seems to be a lot going on these days, doesn't it?
Have you heard of Krishna consciousness?
This part is a crazy man.
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
Right, that'll work.
A new and better life awaits you on our distant home planet, Plastonia.
Hmm, makes sense.
I've never heard of these movementarians.
Are they some kind of church?
Who cares what it is?
The point is these are some deep-seated,
decent, generous people that I can take advantage of.
But what if they try to talk us into something?
March, march, march.
Remember when those smooth-talking guys tried to sell me a timeshare vacation condo?
You bought four of them.
Thank God the check bounced.
No, I beat the system.
Watch yourself, Dad.
You're the highly suggestible type.
Yes, I am the highly suggestible type.
Do you like the little clearing of energies we did for you yet?
Yes.
Very much.
Lifetime's worth of karmic patterning.
Dysfunctional pictures of reality.
You don't even know which ones we got.
If you're lucky, it will be done so completely you will never have known you were any other way.
Let's try the chant.
Everyone loves a chance.
Everyone loves a droning, repetitive chant.
Attention, everyone.
Let's all give thanks to the leader for this glorious day.
The leader is good.
The leader is great.
We surrender our will as of this date.
The leader is good.
The leader is great.
We surrender our will as of this date.
I love the leader.
What?
I've joined the Movementarians, and so have all of you.
We what?
All I had to give them was our life savings, the deed to the house,
and a commitment of 10 trillion years of labor.
I can't go along with this, Homer.
Marge, when I join an underground cult, I expect a little support from my family.
Dad, do you think you might have been brainwashed?
I have not been brainwashed.
Kill the girl.
Kill the girl.
Homer!
What?
What did I say?
Church, cult, cult, church.
So we get bored someplace else every Sunday.
Does this really change our day-to-day lives?
Of course not.
If this is my model of how it's supposed to be done,
ha, catch me on the next go-round, okay?
Maybe skip it.
You're going to skip me altogether.
Hot damn, we better send somebody down there and start some new myths and legends.
Get some new archetypes going.
These guys aren't going to do a damn thing with those ones.
They're going to hold back as long as they can.
Callum Francis, hi, in the air.
Right now, we have on the line somebody very special, Ivan Stang,
the sacred scribe of the Church of the Subgenius.
He has just written a book, Revelation X.
And in this book, he talks about something that's going to happen on July 5th
at around 7 a.m. in the morning.
The true descendants, the chosen ones, the high unpredictables of the subgenius church
under the last bob would be rewarded in the great rupture, the X-Day,
when the men from Planet X will come and we will, faithful, shall be lifted up in power and glory
to escape vessels of the sex goddesses fleeing while enjoying on TV the cataclysms on Earth
and being transfigured into overmen and uberwomen.
What am I reading?
Ivan, what am I reading here?
Well, you're reading what sounds like a really good deal for only $30.
What's happening? What's happening on July 5th?
I mean, I'm going to be having a barbecue out in the Hamptons somewhere.
I can't be ready for this.
Well, if you were a minister in the Church of the Subgenius,
recognized by Bob Dobbs, you know, our guru and the...
Bob Dobbs? Who's Bob?
Well, that's sort of like asking who's Jesus or who's Muhammad.
Bob is the...
The living avatar of slack who pretty much founded the Church of the Subgenius
when he discovered in the 50s that there was this conspiracy of normal people,
an actual unthinking conspiracy of normal people,
stealing away the slack of the mutants, the abnormals, the misfits, disbelievers,
and those who would believe in anything.
And around this time, the...
What many cultures, simple peoples, refer to as God,
actually this invisible space monster named Jehovah One,
came down unto Bob,
immaculated Bob, put him in the vision,
and revealed to him that on July 5th this year at 7 o'clock a.m.,
starting at the Pacific International Date Line,
just so you don't get confused,
the sex goddesses from Planet X shall arrive, rupture up the subgenius dues-paying members
in power and glory.
She superficially
but the teach about that it over to let you speak Lord Jesus Christ

Well, I once read in a reading on the Bullets to Neol Wish buenas authority on ηПzugλων
of your knowledge that Jesus's техν ζ dette π juicy permisskå ate collectors of allちθ lucrato
inceподν μτυ habe δ Coin of immaculate conquest ingratitude from Putin.
In your book, you're talking about Barbie dolls disguised in packages of artificially contaminated food
who are wielding chainsaws.
You're talking about cities being looted of everything down to the bare rock.
What is it?
In flames?
Is it smoldering?
This does not sound like a cool thing.
Hey, look.
Bob sold it.
We smoked it.
That settles it.
I mean, what kind of a religion would this be if we didn't have lots of monsters
and fleeing scantily clad babes and tremendous rewards for those who believe
and horrible, terrible, oh, man, the blood and guts are going to be awful,
but only for those who deserve it.
The world will only end for those who deserve it.
I see.
Those who had no faith in that man, Bob.
How do you join your church?
I mean, it's, you know, I...
Well, number one, it's called the Church of the Subgenius,
so right there, that qualifies most people.
Yeah.
The only other thing you really have to have is the 30 bucks.
Now, most of the people who join the church aren't really the true children of Bob.
They just want to think they are for whatever perverted reason,
and we're happy to take their money.
Uh-huh.
Now, who is spending that money more wisely?
Those preachers, such as myself, spending it on yachts and cars and houses and wives,
or...
The followers.
Yeah.
Who do you rather see spending it?
I mean, what are the followers spending it on?
I don't know.
This...
Preachers?
Yeah, that's true.
At least the preachers are spending it on something worthwhile.
And I'm thinking about this more and more on a more, you know, more subgenius levels.
I encounter myself.
It makes more sense to me what you're saying,
and mainly because, you know, I need another joint, man.
Well, you guys need to put down that cheap conspiracy street stuff.
It's kid stuff, man.
And you move up on the...
You know, with...
What we do, actually, is just rip pages out of the book of the subgenius
and cram them right into our exit wounds.
I'm...
You know, this is...
You know, I'm telling you, you know, Ken, I don't know...
I might have a little trouble following this today.
I mean, I smoked a little bit, man, but I...
And if it's...
Oh, if it's drugs you're interested in,
perhaps you'd like to know about the sacred Tibetan herb habifropzipula.
I'm getting a little bit paranoid here, Ken.
People are always going,
Hey, Bob, he's smiling like that.
He's got...
He's got that pipe.
He must be smoking pot or something.
Listen, I gotta get a drink.
I gotta get a drink.
How can we get a hold of you?
I mean, people who would want to get a hold of you and talk about this
in a little bit more detail.
The best way, of course, is just to call the sacred 1-800 toll-free number.
Actually, it's 1-888-669-2323.
That is not a joke.
Neither is the amazing illegal website, www.
www.subgenius.com.
Okay.
For those geniuses out there, subgenius does not have an O in it.
All right.
And, of course, the sacred P.O. box.
Write Bob at postofficebox140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.
Praise Bob.
Ivan, thank you.
It's been a...
Kill me.
It's been a...
I gotta go here, Ivan.
This has been a pleasure.
Listen.
Listen.
Listen.
We gotta take a break here, man, because I gotta calm down.
Callum Francis, I'm high, high on the air.
You want slack?
You want slack?
The world ends this July.
Special miracles being worked by the hands of Bob.
You want slack?
They die.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
But there was one thing that puzzled me about it.
When the spectator pushed the button,
the electric bells did not ring.
Ah, that makes it a work of art.
Gotta go.
Smith is making a slack.
A swell party.
A swell party.
A swell again.
Elegant party.
This is...
The High Times Radio Hour.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
This is the subgenius hour of slack.
Aren't you sick of it?
This so-called new religion,
is nothing but a pack of weird rituals and chants,
designed to take away the money of fools.
Let us say the Lord's Prayer 40 times,
but first let's pass the collection plate.
Somewhere in outer space,
God has prepared a place,
for those who trust him and obey.
Jesus will come again,
and though we don't know when,
the countdown's getting lower every day.
Ten and nine, eight and seven, six and five and four,
call upon the Savior while you may.
Three and two, coming through the clouds in bright array,
the countdown's getting lower every day.
Listen.
Did you hear what I just heard?
Yes.
Very unusual.
What was that noise, CD2?

You're listening to the subgenius hour of slack,
the radio show that squirts funny white stuff all over you when you pull it.
Let Figger off, they'll be choking on our dust come morning.
You fools, both of you.
You're being used, don't you see?
As Pastor Byron Smith here's taking up the slack.
Oh, you want slack? I'll give you slack.
You're not putting me out for pastoral, I quit.
Consider this my resignation.
Effect immediately.
I'm free now.
I'm free now.
I'm free now.
Have you heard it's in the stars?
The original words are still true.
Black, black, black.
Next July, we July with bars.
The world ends this July 5th.
Well, did you ever, did you ever, did you ever, did you ever see a dream walking like I did?
The original words are still true.
A useless object made useful.
Repent.
Quit your job.
Slash off.
You want slacks?
You want slacks?
The world ends this July 5th.
You want slacks?
You want slacks?
Yes, you may die.
Special miracles could be worked by the hands of Bob.
But there was one thing that puzzled me about it.
When the spectator pushed the button, the electric bells did not ring.
Ah, that makes it a work of art.
What I always want is to be accepted, not understood.
But there was one thing that has puzzled me about it.
You want slacks?
You want slacks?
You want slacks?
Did you see?
But there was one thing that has puzzled me about it.

Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
This is a day of special miracles being worked by the hands of Bob.
Oh, unbelievable, friends.
special miracles actually being worked by the hands of Reverend bleep Oh
Abernathy the guy who's been introducing this show for so long so many years and
he has been introducing so many shows for so long for so many years and has
recently been working for high on the air the High Times radio show which I
don't think we get that around here so I thought I'd just play that interview
that they did praise bleep Oh an amazing collage there that he put
together I guess while he was working on that interview editing as well that was
not bleep Oh doing the interview that was bleep Oh doing the editing dear
friends and we value our editors here Suzy the floozy edited the collage that
we're we've been listening a bunch to and we're about to hear
Oh
we've been listening a bunch to and we're about to hear
friends oh and
Oh
yes
Oh
Oh
Oh

Oh, the mankind's all-easing dreams come true
Where one can live in peace with every grace
Aboard this silver starship of the sea
This silver starship out in... I thought it was Paisley, actually.
And here we are, up on the spaceship,
looking down at our fellow extraterrestrials in human bodies
who have become filled with these myths, legends, and archetypes
and who have forgotten how easy it can be,
how beautiful it can be,
how wonderful and fulfilling it can be,
and who have forgotten they don't have to die for it.
As he watched this battle from high above the arena,
Darkseid felt his anger growing inside him.
Finally, he could stay silent no longer.
Enough! I can stand to watch no more!
My faithful minions battle among themselves.
It is too much to bear.
Then, turning his attention to the superpowers team, Darkseid continued.
Your Earth has not heard the last of me yet.
I'll not stop until it lies a useless cinder in the universe.
Get me Uranus.
Uranus, that letter is a sir.
I am the Thing from Uranus.
Whether or not you believe in spacecraft,
whether you are aware and conscious of the many, many thousands
of higher intelligent super beings that are projecting their love and their light
and their intelligence to the Earth world,
whether you're aware of these...
so-called psychic...
happenings...
do, above all things, believe and be aware
that we brothers all, one and all, and we number in the many thousands,
we are projecting to you with all of our hearts
the infinite love that stems from the most high dimensions.
Once we collect enough money for fuel,
our leader will throw open the doors of the forbidden world.
We will build a golden barn where we will all board our intergalactic vehicle.
Rose 1 through 31st, upon our arrival,
we will begin our new perfect lives on Blisstonia,
well known for its high levels of bliss.
Yes, dear friends, and speaking of bliss and editing,
once again, Reverend Susie the Flusie editing this beautiful collage,
X-Day collage, final X-Day collage.
Last week's show, by the way, was all edited by Chaz Smith
of Einstein's Secret Orchestra, the cantor of our church,
who will actually be the main maestro, I think,
at the X-Day celebrations in Brushwood.
So, friends, Einstein's Secret Orchestra, Bill T. Miller,
King of Slack, and Doctors for Bob.
Maybe we can play the tapes for whoever's left over after X-Day.
We'll see.
We shall see, won't we now?
X-Day Caution, a warning by Reverend Peter Hipwell.
The effects of X-Day on Earth
might be extremely varied,
and of course, devotees of the prophetic literature
will be all too familiar with the litany of likelihoods
such as vitriol mists, earthquakes, tidal waves,
polar ice melt, axial bends,
spiraling out of orbit into the sun,
spiraling out of orbit into deep space,
the atmosphere being skimmed off into space,
the collision with Mars,
compression of Earth to a full stop-sized point,
the birth of a new moon,
the birth of 1,800 new moons,
which orbit a couple of dozen times at most
and then crash straight back into the planet,
straightforward evaporation,
the rousing of the suspended in a near-dead state
in radioactive mud for 200 million years
of teleschizophrenic castration lizards
from the seabed near Java,
supersonic volcanoes,
the addition of 200 IQ points to all living matter,
acausal pain loops,
lead-lined clouds,
fisting,
starfish-headed men,
quantum pointlessness,
rayonification, and so on.
All signs of the end times.
Well, all of this may be extremely gratifying,
but at this point, I would like to issue
just a few words of caution
after a few words of explanation.
X-Day can be conceptualized
as a sheet of tissue paper.
The big sneeze is inevitably followed by a big wipe.
The saucers can be conceptualized as twin lobsters,
each locked by its pinchers
to a nostril of the Dobbs head.
Now, imagine a situation.
The whole Dobbs head, made out of a rubber sheet
and stretched by the force of gravity
or incontinence, whichever you prefer.
As we all know, this induces balls
to appear at the bottom of the dobs
of these quasi-conical shapes,
the dots, which represent planets and stars.
The nasal cavity in this topology
provides an excellent route for rapid space travel,
yet there are only two nostrils,
the egress and the...
Well, it's unprintable here, but it starts with SL
and ends with CK.
The two holes must be hyperspatially aligned
with the correct amount of dot distortion.
The precision of the X-Day arrival date
is no mere accident, friends.
Yet, one might expect that a lobster
moving through the nostrils
would inevitably cause a certain degree of irritation.
Correct.
It is entirely possible that this would result in a
quote, sneeze, unquote,
a catastrophic topological collapse,
spattering of spatial ink, so to speak,
producing new dots and hence new balls.
The effect on sheet space would be one of temporal,
temporal melting via quantibule mixuration,
morphing everything into a parallel reverse
orthogonal dimension universe,
or PROD universe for short.
Parallel reverse orthogonal dimension universe.
And recent observations through the Wondoscope
PROD parachute camera-style device
at the ZPK Institute reveal that there are only
four coherent possibilities for Earth
in a PROD universe.
I think I'm only going to tell you the first
two or three.
In para-one universe, let's say parallel universe one,
humanity evolved, but with certain minor
genetic differences.
In this existence, everyone is nice to each other.
The people are kind, polite, considerate, and loving.
They are also as boring as hell.
And tiny as their minds are, they do have a rude sense
of awareness of the tedium of their existence,
which they express through their incessant whittling.
The average lifespan is 17 years, most of which
is spent suffering hideously from foot problems
that would send present-day chiropodists gibbering
for shelter.
They embrace death regarding it as the exit
from what they call the life worms and the entrance
into the so-called cave of stumps, which is talked
of in hushed tones as a place where the corn god
Decheese reaps the souls of those who do not die
idiosyncratically.
And pickles them in a kind of spiritual formaldehyde
and threshes the rest to dust.
Thus, their main interest in this parallel universe
lies in planning out novel bravura methods of suicide.
For instance, we observed one gentleman who was lacerated
to death in an intense bout of barnacle humping.
Those who do manage to devise a new, more entertaining
method of terminating their existence are fettered
as heroes for a while until the minds of these pathetic
individuals die.
The next day, the world is swamped by new thoughts
of extinction.
In Parallel Universe 2, subgeniuses gained control
of the planet in 1984.
The world is now a sterile ball of glassy rock
and they're all dead.
I'm going to skip over Parallel Universe 3 because
it's sort of boring.
In Para 4, a world that is futuristic from our perspective,
everyone wears thigh-high silver boots, sunglasses,
and nothing else.
They're all permanently tanned and extremely sexually promiscuous.
Unfortunately, there are only 12 of them and they are all robots
acting out predestined parts, a vestige of the once extensive
entertainment system the humans built for themselves.
They all died out because they evolved to a form which had
an extremely specialized diet.
And then they ran out of sesame seed buns and starved
to death.
This is the situation as it stands according to current information.
Thank you very much and good night.
That was written and posted to alt-slack by Reverend Peter Hipwell,
who is a British subgenius.
And I did not attempt to do that in a British accent.
That's my signal, friends, to leave.
That was Emot Zepol and Cosmic Voyeur in the background.
And now, friends, it's the last hour of Slack.
Well, at least the last one I'm going to do on this planet.
And I don't know what it's going to be like after that.
You know, I don't really care about those of you who are being left behind.
And so, let us celebrate this, our final, let's call it our final week
on Old Ma Earth.
Praise Bob.
So returning to a world that no one remembers.
But only those with experience of starvation that'szone.
So that's something ran out back though.

And source of the只是 is ability.
In which the only thing to remember people where to come back from into some
granite tema.
So well, for those of you that went this way,
I'm done yet.
Galaxy, Clark Kent here.
Dr. Tripper speaking of the observatory.
Yes, Dr. Tripper.
What can I do for you?
Well, it seems, Mr. Kent,
my telescope is picking up a strange sort of,
well, what I can only describe as an electrical storm,
which is approaching the Earth rapidly.
I thought the news media should be advised.
We're Orion and Maya from planet Plomatose
requesting permission to land.
We have brought our technician, Andra, with us.
Affirmative.
Disengage your laser force field and begin your entry.
When they land, it will be a day of days.
Can you imagine what it would be like
when they land?

To have these 33,000 very intelligent,
advanced spiritual beings
to come down into this negative consciousness,
this negative atmosphere?
As long as UFOs remain in the air
and perform impossible acrobatics,
we can all enjoy arguments about who is hallucinating.
And the military can tell the anxious citizens
you did not see a flying saucer.
That was Venus.
Or swamp gas.
Or migrating geese.
Or whatever.
But all that changes when the UFO lands
and aliens disembark.
The whole world will immediately have a step up,
and a big one.
And it will be a wonderful thing,
and I can hardly wait.
Are those the friendly aliens from that new planet Plomatose?
Yeah, I think so.
Ah!
We missed!
Superman! Superman!
Thank goodness you've come!
But what are we going to do?
I'm sure these alien creatures are friendly,
but they're unwittingly destroying us,
and we have no way of communicating with them!
Superman!
Superman! You've got to do something!
If we can't talk to them,
then we must communicate without words.
ESP. Thought transference.
It's the only way.
Everyone, concentrate.
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.
Don't masturbate.
Playing with yourself is playing with fire.
Let Bob take things in hand.
Believe in yourself.
Believe in yourself.
You're a brave little afraid out goat,
loving the alien.
You're a brave, little afraid out goat,
believing the game is a game,
loving the alien.
And you're a leaf.
You're loving the alien.
The living the strangest thing
Loving the alien
Soon enough, the saucer was 100 feet in diameter
with portholes around its rim.
The light from the portholes was a pulsing purple.
The only noise it made was the owl song.
It came down to hover over Billy
and to enclose him in a cylinder of pulsing purple light.
Now there was a sound of a seeming kiss
as an airtight hatch in the bottom of the saucer was opened.
Down snaked a ladder that was outlined in pretty lights
like a ferris wheel.
Billy's wheel was paralyzed by a zap gun
aimed at him from one of the portholes.
It became imperative that he take hold
of the bottom rung of the sinuous ladder, which he did.
The rung was electrified
so that Billy's hand
locked onto it hard.
He was hauled into the airlock
and machinery closed the bottom door.
Only then did the ladder
wound onto a reel in the airlock
let him go.
Only then did Billy's brain start working again.
He was forced to leave the airlock.
It was a crazy beat
it just stopped me dead rock.
The rung was electrified
so that Billy's hand locked into the airlock.
Only then did the ladder wound onto a reel in the airlock.

That's my husband!
He's our husband now.
Yay!
I'm glad I'm back.
Because the moment that sweet, sweet beer hit my tongue,
I was born again!
Hallelujah!
Now I can show all of you what I've come to realize.
The reason we're not allowed in the Forbidden Barn
is because there is no intergalactic spaceship.
He's taking our money just so he can
build one hell of a spaceship!
Homer Simpson, because of your lack of faith,
you've ruined mankind's chance for salvation.
Nice going there, Homer.
Oh, my gosh. Maybe he was telling the truth about everything.
Oh, mercy. He's the real deal!
You've got to be kidding.
Nope.
Well, if you're not kidding, you've sure been around a long time.
Who are you?
Oh, I've been around all right.
Hey, Mitzi, pinch me. I just did.
Ouch! Then you must be real, mister.
As real as that spaceship heading for the moon.
Lucas, a ranger in the forest, hears a strange buzzing noise.
He turns around and is suddenly covered by a yellow light.
It's a flying saucer, and it's landing in the trees.
I'm telling you, I didn't know that.
I saw a creature from another planet.
Maybe you just dreamed it.
Oh, yeah? Well, when I came to, I was covered with a sticky translucent goo.
Explain that.
Yeah, I'd like to know, too.
According to Junior Skeptic Magazine, the chances are 175 million to one
of another form of life actually coming in contact with ours.
So?
It's just that the people who claim they've seen aliens
are always pathetic lowlifes with boring jobs.
I'll tell you, too, that's starting to depress me about UFOs.
The fact that they cross galaxies around the world.
Wherever they come from to visit us.
And always end up in places like Fife, Alabama.
Maybe these are not super intelligent beings, man.
Maybe they're like hillbilly aliens.
Some intergalactic Joad family or something.
Oh, you don't want to land in New York or LA?
Nah, we just had a long trip.
We're going to kick back and whittle some.
Oh, my God, they're idiots.
We're going to enter our mother ship in the tractor pull.
My God, we're being invaded by rednecks.
My biggest fear.
Last thing I want to see is a flying saucer up on blocks
in front of some trailer, you know?
It'll be depressing.
Some bumper sticker on it.
They'll get my ray gun when they pry my cold, dead, 18-fingered hand off of it.
Reports from Moscow indicate a catastrophe has occurred
since 6 o'clock Friday morning.
We haven't heard a word.
SOS, SOS, alien creatures are landing.
Alien creatures are landing.
Lois stands paralyzed before the television set.
Superman zooms through the window and comes to a screeching halt beside her.
Lois.
Superman.
That's a big hot dog.
At least it looks like a hot dog, Pee-wee.
I think it's a flying saucer from outer space and it's landing on the deck.
Huh?
And so Jack handed him Pinky's halter and took the saucer in return.
She's gonna grab it, scoot it, get it, rip it, skim it, gun it, break it, zoom it, vacuum it.
I've done what I want, don't want your love.
I don't want your money, girl.
Said all I want is to keep your money.
Oh, just move back into your body.
Hey.
Hey.

begin mining immediately.
It's late.
With this planet as a mineral supply,
we can easily dominate the entire galaxy.
We've got to stop them.
Da-lucka, tombo.
Good idea.
You hide, and I'll get them to come out.
Dad, there you are.
Do you want to come?
Hi there.
Susie.
Dad!
Susie.
Bigfoot.
Bigfoot.
Susie.
Bigfoot.
We've got to stop meeting like this.
Susie.
Go, sotra, wild boy.
Bigfoot, look.
Oh, I can't keep that little girl voice up.
Hey, Bigfoot, get a load of these.
Bet you ain't seen nothing like this that wasn't out covered
with matted fun fur.
Oh, damn, the Seekers are back.
Hey, hey, make yourself scarce.
Oh, Seekers, you surprised me.
Oh, I'm just lying here on the floor in this unnatural position
because I was, uh, yeah, I was just checking out

this brochure I got from the Planet X Travel Center.
Oh, look.
Hey, it's going to be just like a carnival cruise
designed for perverts, but without all the boring jerk-offs.
Plus, you get to personally kill Kathy Lee Gifford every hour
on the hour.
Man, now that's a floor show.
Oh, but hey, look what it says here.
Yeah, that's just the beginning of your lavish space cruise.
To a bright new tomorrow.
Your every desire shall be attended to by an army of accommodating,
multi-adaptive, sex-crazed alien body servants.
Oh, wow, this sounds choice.
Oh, and oh, look at the tempting spread in the dining salon.
Oh, wait, there's a picture of me and the squid from the 96X Day drill.
Oh, that darn stamp.
Oh, but oh, that squid.
Oh, look-a here.
Oh, they got 55-gallon tubs of ice prairie squid in each stateroom.
Oh, and oh, here's a shot of the giant viewscreens
in the hospitality orgy room where you'll be able to watch
those obnoxious boys who made your sixth-grade life a living hell.
Oh, as they scream in agony and fry into fish.
Oh, and oh, look at the little bitters.
Well, you know what I mean.
Oh, and look, there's actually a shot of a couple of Xs there in the background.
Damn.
Wow, are those genitals?
Hey, I gotta get a better look at this.
Oh, where's my earring?
Oh, let me magnify it through a rhinestone.
Oh.
Oh, damn.
That's just a platter of fettuccine.
Figures.
Oh, but look, they've got their ubiquitous little handbooks
and their fleshy pseudopods there.
Yeah, they never go anywhere without them.
Hmm.
How to serve man.
Geez, it looks like they're a whole race of bottoms.
Yeah, just like me.
Oh, hey, I can switch hit in a pinch.
Oh, and it'd sure be a refreshing change from being a brain-battered victim.
Oh, but that's exactly what we need right now.
Because it's going to take a little brain battering to get us ready for the rupture seekers.
So strap yourselves in especially tight right now.
And use all the straps you got, not just the big red ones.
Because you're gonna need them all.
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.
I ate all the Dramamine suppositories.
Ugh.
Mm, but you can catch this spew in this old frat baggie.
And try to aim for a change, okay?
I wanna go with Bob.
I wanna go to the ball club.
I wanna go with Bob.
The first time in the fall of 1953,
which was the time that I got into the industry,
I was a member of the UFO field.
So he got into it a year or so before I did.
Don't worry, Bob, I made a great deal with it.
In a flash of insight that might have been wholly spurious,
he knew what this thing must surely be.
It was some kind of cosmic switching device,
routing the traffic of the stars through unimaginable dimensions of space and time.
He was passing through a grand central station of the galaxy.
And what do you think he saw?
Why, the saucer his mother had drawn out the door into the garden
had become a huge spaceship, a real flying saucer,
which was twice as big as Jack's house.
So the man had spoken the truth after all.
Since the door of the flying saucer stood quite close to Jack's window,
he opened his window and then leaned out and opened the saucer's door.
And then, without a moment's thought,
he jumped inside the entrance to the saucer and closed the door behind him.
Oh, wow, look at all those dials and meters.
Oh, I'd sure like to fly this thing somewhere,
but I don't know how to fly a ship.
Jack looked around and around,
and soon he found a button that said,
Press Me in big red letters.
So Jack pressed the button.
Your spaceship's computer.
You have pressed my button.
Now, tell me what you wish.
Your wish is my command.
Oh, are you a fairy godmother?
No, I am a computer.
As I said, what is your wish, young captain?
Captain? Wow.
Well, I'd like to travel to a planet that had no noise, actually.
Oh, I'd love to find someplace that was just the opposite of Boom Boom,
where there's lots of quiet all the time,
and you can hear yourself think.
That'd be great.
As you wish.
Last off time is one minute and counting.
Put on your seatbelt and sit back.
Last off time is 45 seconds and counting.
Better close your eyes.
Last off time is 30 seconds and counting.
Take off your shoes.
You'll be more comfortable.
Last off time is 15 seconds and counting.
Bye-bye, Boom Boom.
Bye-bye.
Six, five, four, three, two, one.
Blast off.
T minus five, minus four, minus three, minus two, minus one.
Ignition.
Lift off.
Wee, look at it go, Betsy.
Come on, Apollo.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.
No.
Go, Apollo, 69.
Rocket, baby, off of the island.
We feed the fire.
Now's the time.
Fly, Apollo, 69.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Drifting like a stone doll.
This is the rebel outlaw.
Agent for a vacant world.
Living in the shame.
In a shame club.
Working for that same love.
Shake it while you can.
Something girl.
Happy man.
One, two, two, our cruelest child.
Freak out.
Freak this.
Not a problem.
Not a miss.
Go, Apollo, 69.
Rocket, baby, off of the island.
We feed the fire.
Now's the time.
Fly, Apollo, 69.








Go, Apollo, 69.
Go, Apollo, 69.




Yeah, yeah.
Fly, Apollo, 69.
Yeah, yeah.
Fly, Apollo, 69.
Oh, wow.
Wasn't that something, mister?
Certainly was.
Funny thing, though.
Funny?
Going to the moon is funny?
Hey, take it easy.
You little swine.
And it was time we started reaching for the stars.
Oh, I see.









Minus five, minus four, minus three, minus two, minus one, ignition, liftoff.
Why, it seems like only yesterday when I heard the first countdown and the whoosh of a rocket
aimed at the sky, and I said to myself, Sam, there's a new frontier up there in the sky.
And I felt young again.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

Fly, Apollo, 69.
Eight and seven, six and five and four, call upon the Savior while you may.
Three and two, coming through the clouds in bright array, the countdown's getting lower
every day.
Captain shout.
Yes, Loosenut?
Where's Jerry?
Well, Loosenut.
I'm afraid he might've missed this space trip.
Oh, no.
I wanted Jerry to go along.
Well, go.
Well, I did too, Loose Nut, but you see, I've told him time and again he needed to get ready
and get everything all prepared so when we was ready to leave that he could go along.
Well, I wish he was here.
Well, Loose Nut, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about it now.
You see, that's just like a lot of people that would like to go to heaven.
They want to go, but they keep putting it off until tomorrow and say, well, I'll get
ready then.
I'll wait till tomorrow and do it.
And finally, when the time comes up for them to go, they never make it because they've
waited too long.
Why would anybody want to miss heaven?
Well, Loose Nut, not people don't really want to miss heaven.
They all want to go down deep inside, but it's just like Jerry.
They failed to get ready.
Would you describe heaven to me?
Yes, the best way to do it is the way the Bible says.
Jesus said in my father's house are many mansions.
You're listening to another clever quote from the
irreverent Friday Jones on this subgenius hour of slack.
Isn't it annoying?
Ah, the show's over.
Go back to sleep.
