1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,680
Hey, come on, honey. Will you take it easy? You're anticipating trouble.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,360
I'm a little too antsy to sit under a hairdryer and read all those soap opera magazines.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,400
Smile. You're going to have a good time.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,500
Everything is going to be absolutely perfect.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,420
It almost seems too good to be true.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,180
It's all part of the human condition.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,200
Something's wrong.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,820
There's something going on that none of us understand.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,000
I felt like that at first, too.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,660
You really think that you're going to go someplace, right?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,160
Work, I repeat.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,740
It's all part of the human condition.

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,280
Oh, yeah? Well, she isn't going to quit that job because she needs that job.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,280
They don't grow on trees, you know.

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,300
We can never leave.

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,780
Oh, isn't it wonderful?

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,340
Be a success.

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,380
And that's all he thinks about. That's all he thinks about.

19
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,780
You know, I longed so for success.

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,020
It's kind of hard to believe that it's brought me all these problems.

21
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,260
Listen, I hate to seem like the kind of wife that goes behind her husband's back with his boss,

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,120
but all that glitter and glamour don't mean anything

23
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,640
unless you have the seamy side to play them off again.

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,380
Do you really want to hear all this?

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,680
Yes, I really do.

26
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,400
It's all part of the human condition.

27
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,140
It seems to me that things aren't really the same anymore.

28
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,340
I mean, the morale seems awfully low.

29
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,500
And I get the impression that the men don't really have that much pride in their work.

30
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,100
I mean, you cannot combine your social life and your professional life.

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,580
It just doesn't work out.

32
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,800
Listen, I'm still the boss around here, aren't I?

33
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,580
As long as you act like one.

34
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,400
And you should believe that. I mean, with your religious upbringing.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,880
Yeah, I really envy her faith.

36
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,820
I can almost guarantee that that had nothing to do with it.

37
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,440
It's all part of the human condition.

38
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,580
Work. I repeat.

39
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:01,740
Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. I repeat. Work. I repeat.

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,260
Listen, I'm still the boss around here, aren't I?

41
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,420
We got work to do.

42
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,100
She got our roles in a play all mixed up with real life.

43
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,380
We can build a future on that.

44
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,680
She can fall in love with some romantic image.

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,640
I don't want to be in a play.

46
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,840
We can never leave.

47
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,980
Oh, isn't it wonderful?

48
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,800
You know, I feel so secure.

49
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,360
I admit it. I depend on her.

50
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,080
She saw me as so make-believe.

51
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,220
Not as myself.

52
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,680
She got our roles in a play all mixed up with real life.

53
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,440
Yeah, well, you had the initial group of minds that plowed through the conspiracy.

54
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,740
And then you had their devoted followers.

55
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,860
But soon, things fractured off.

56
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,020
And you began to get the dread followers who never understood.

57
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,080
But sensed there was something going on.

58
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,400
And that's why we look to this side and we say,

59
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,620
The Fifth Rule of the Church of the Subgenius.

60
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,160
This is...

61
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,980
No hip whimp!

62
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,000
No what?

63
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,580
No what?

64
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,500
No what?

65
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,560
No what?

66
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,040
No what?

67
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,480
No what?

68
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,320
Talk to me, children!

69
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,060
No what?

70
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,180
No hip whimp!

71
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,940
Thank you, children.

72
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,260
Give us a call. We're the lonely on the air.

73
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,300
On the other hand, subgenius people are not bad.

74
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,440
We like them.

75
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,260
Subgenius people? Why, they're the salt of the earth.

76
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,780
This is a great program.

77
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,800
You'd like to rub elbows with them.

78
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,720
Sound impossible?

79
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,680
Well, I'd like to rub salt.

80
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,280
Yes, you rub it between the forefinger and the, uh, and the thumb.

81
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,200
Say what?

82
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,460
You take the pinch of salt.

83
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,540
You rub it between the forefinger and the thumb.

84
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,500
Walk with a shim around a burning, decapitated child's head.

85
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,620
And then jump into the grave and say,

86
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,800
Hop on my thumb, hop on my thumb.

87
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,800
This is...

88
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,260
This is a problem I must overcome.

89
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,580
Throw in a dead cat, or a live cat that's not feeling well.

90
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,140
Then cover with the sod, and when the birds chirp on the third Saturday after Micklemas,

91
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,280
take a large dill pickle and insert it in the tumulus.

92
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,440
Insert it in the tumulus, the, uh, heap, the shambling mound over the grave.

93
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,160
And this time you will experience a divine regurgitation,

94
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,660
somewhat like unto the immaculation of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

95
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,280
the slain and martyred Epoph,

96
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,380
the Church of the Subdivine.

97
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,000
I believe it's something God puts in us.

98
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,960
It's something somebody put in us.

99
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,880
Fusion.

100
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,000
May help.

101
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,380
Hydrogen fusion.

102
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,440
Hydrogen fusion?

103
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,500
Hmm.

104
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,600
Well, it's...

105
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,880
Hydro-confusion.

106
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,480
Join the Church of the Subdivine.

107
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,020


108
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Hydrogen fusion, hyper-confusion, uh...

109
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,560
This material contains information affecting the national defense of the United States

110
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,220
within the meaning of the Espionage Law,

111
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,380
Title 18, U.S.C., Sections 7098 and 74,

112
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,360
a transmission or revelation of which in any manner to an unauthorized person

113
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,300
is inhibited and prohibited by law.

114
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,660
Welcome, dear friends,

115
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,080
to the subgenius hour of Slouch.

116
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,480
Lot of Slouch.

117
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:46,840
I pray

118
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,780
Oh, yes, dear friends.

119
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,360
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.

120
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,580
And once again, I've been answering mail all day and lapping up the slack of the others.

121
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:16,440
Which really cheers me up, because there's a lot of other mutants out there, friends.

122
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,040
A lot more than the conspiracy would have you believe.

123
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:29,460
Can be depressing, though, when you're not dealing with just those endless piles of amazing hideousness created by thousands of subgeniuses.

124
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:36,720
Sometimes, yes, even I, King Stang, have to go out into the world of the pinks,

125
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,940
try to make something worthwhile happen in their static, motionless universe.

126
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,020
And we often fail when we attempt this.

127
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,140
It's like mixing oil and water, dear friends.

128
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:02,060
Like mixing up all the equipment in a radio studio or in a video den.

129
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:12,520
So, friends, those of you who missed the supposed video of the revival at Mestral, be glad.

130
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,480
You didn't miss anything.

131
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,940
Those who did show up did.

132
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,260
Missed a lot.

133
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:27,980
It was, to tell the truth, the probably absolute worst debacle in all subgenius live performance history.

134
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,040
Oh, I suppose I could have played it safe.

135
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:38,340
Could have just shown the official subgenius video, but half of you seekers have already bought copies of that one.

136
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:44,100
We just wanted to give the audience their money's worth by using some of the old video on this VHS master,

137
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,580
with portions of the new video also on VHS, because the master's being finished on One Inch in California.

138
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,160
Mixed with the weirder of the commercial jobs by myself and many other subgeni.

139
00:07:54,020 --> 00:08:03,100
Mixed with the most mind-raping material, dear friends, from the personal hideous Stang collection of weird tapes.

140
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:12,980
But at Mestral, for reasons as yet unknown, perhaps conspiracy in nature, we don't know,

141
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,720
none of the half-inch tape would show on the big screen, friends.

142
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,220
Looked fine on the little monitors here and there.

143
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,560
But the big screen tape would show on the big screen.

144
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:24,160
That poltergeist got to that big screen after the show started like ten minutes.

145
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,120
First ten minutes, everything was fine, oh yeah.

146
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,140
The horror, the horror.

147
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,320
Meaghe attack.

148
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,020
It was, it was sort of like...

149
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,960
Well, the very next day, all hell broke loose, and I choose that word carefully.

150
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,380
Now I know something about demon tactics.

151
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,180
And working of Satan in the field of the supernatural.

152
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,500
But then I was very ignorant.

153
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,300
My education began the day after my very plastic so-called decision for Christ.

154
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,260
Johnny, I just ended a very odd phone call.

155
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,700
It was Sarah.

156
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,540
She said, I've just run into somebody who keeps saying she has to talk to John and Rosalie.

157
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,360
This woman...

158
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,360


159
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,360
This woman says John and Rosalie will help me.

160
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,140
Well, how does this woman Sarah's been talking about know us?

161
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,300
Well, that's the strange part, honey.

162
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,840
I've never heard of her.

163
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,320
Hm.

164
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Well, I'm curious.

165
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,640
Ask Sarah to send her over.

166
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,120
You know, I've just made a decision for Christ, so now I've got the inside track.

167
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,980
What are you talking about?

168
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,900
Well, for years I've been waiting for the UFO occupants to contact me.

169
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,660
I think they've just been waiting for me to plug in.

170
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,340
I think they've just been waiting for me to plug in.

171
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,520
You see, Christ is the magic word.

172
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:02,600
When that lady showed up, she was very large, overweight, and although she had a jolly face,

173
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,760
her eyes were a little wild.

174
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,840
You wonder how I knew your names?

175
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,720
Oh, yes, of course we wonder.

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,520
I was told your names.

177
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh?

178
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,460
Who told you?

179
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,600
The voices.

180
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,320
They said, find John and Rosalie.

181
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,320


182
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,420
And so I did.

183
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,200
Do you hear these voices at other times?

184
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,660
All the time.

185
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,280
They're telling me now that you are soon to be contacted.

186
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,380
It is terribly important to the eternal plan of the things of the universe that you should

187
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,160
be brought in at this time.

188
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,900
When the time comes for you to announce to the world that the visitors from outer space

189
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,900
have arrived, you are the one who will be believed.

190
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,760
You.

191
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,300
You.

192
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


193
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


194
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


195
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


196
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


197
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


198
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


199
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


200
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


201
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


202
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


203
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


204
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


205
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


206
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


207
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


208
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,300


209
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,200
Your love has never been given to you by the spirit.

210
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:51,880
You.

211
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,260
We.

212
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,480
Loved you.

213
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,560
If you'd believe that, you'd come along.

214
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,140
Yeah, but I don't want to look like a dummy.

215
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,680
Can't hear a word you say.

216
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,000
What's happening?

217
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,760
What's the matter?

218
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,200
What's the matter?

219
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,420
What's the matter?

220
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,780
Well, ain't the matter.

221
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,380
Just pass, scream, sound.

222
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,200
So, switch off, wheel, down.

223
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,460
So, dear friends, if some of you called Mistral and were told that it had been postponed,

224
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,520
because they did that for a while,

225
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,760
without telling...

226
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,480
without telling any of us,

227
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,680
be glad, because we should have known better, dear friends,

228
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,260
than to think J.R. Bob Dobbs would allow

229
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,180
any kind of true Church of the Subgenius manifestation

230
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,520
to occur in a veritable citadel

231
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,800
of ultimate pinkness

232
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,220
such as this place.

233
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,100
Besides the perhaps unavoidable technical problems,

234
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,980
it still could have been better, but for certain problems

235
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
best left undiscussed.

236
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,760
Only my own opinion.

237
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,440
I'm not sure if myself and our noble subgenius video expert, Chris Cave,

238
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,700
could ever know what really went down in that little booth,

239
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,720
although we're not very dignified people.

240
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,720
It would be far below our dignity to tell you the actual truth.

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,200
It would be cruel, like kicking your dog for messing the rug when he had diarrhea.

242
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,660
An apt metaphor in this case.

243
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,720
So we'll be doing it again at some point at the...

244
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,960
Oh, April...

245
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,600
For three days in April at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in Boston.

246
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,460
So get your plane tickets ready, subgeniuses out there,

247
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,880
because I don't think we'll be doing it at this same place in Dallas again.

248
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,020
But after all the work that we put into that thing, dear friends,

249
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,240
I'm bound and determined to show this video presentation

250
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,560
to the Dallas subgenius free of charge.

251
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,460
Dang it.

252
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,920
If possible.

253
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,860
And all we need is a place.

254
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,740
A place for about 50 people where they can all see a TV screen

255
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,720
that actually works.

256
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,220
A TV screen man enough to handle Stang's video collection.

257
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,420
Now, I've been told of such a place where we can abuse ourselves

258
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:43,300
without having idiotic stuck-up pinks trying to tell us how to ruin our own show.

259
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,040
But it costs a bit of money.

260
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,480
So if you out there know of anything large and cheap nearby,

261
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,040
please do call this station here tonight within the next hour.

262
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,580
828-9500.

263
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,900
And talk to the very will of Dobbs and tell us where we can have this

264
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,720
subgenius video beer drinking event for fun.

265
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,660
828-9500.

266
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,700
So please bear with me if sometimes this doesn't make much sense.

267
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,240
It's realistic.

268
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,800
Fantastic things happen.

269
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,500
And more are getting ready to happen.

270
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,660
This is because the planet on which you're residing has entered the space age.

271
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,940
You are a most unusual individual and decidedly in the minority.

272
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:48,660
Funny how the devil seems to wear a halo sometimes.

273
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,540
It's funny.

274
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,740
Get rich quick.

275
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,700
Yes.

276
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,020
Yeah.

277
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,600
Oh, man.

278
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,760
That's what happened to us.

279
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,920
Jesus just rushed right in and burned me.

280
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,020
What happened, Jim?

281
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,060
But the light was so bright, you know, 12-gauge shotgun,

282
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,340
and I stuck the barrel in my mouth.

283
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,340
The coup de grace administered by Satan himself.

284
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,320
Joe had a heart attack, put my thumb on the trigger.

285
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,820
At that very moment, Jesus just rushed right in and burned me.

286
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,920
What happened, Jim?

287
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,880
But the light was so bright, you know, 12-gauge shotgun,

288
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,220
and I stuck the barrel in my mouth.

289
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,180
The coup de grace administered by Satan himself.

290
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,240
Joe had a heart attack, put my thumb on the trigger.

291
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,720
At that very moment, Jesus just rushed right in and burned me.

292
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,800
What happened, Jim?

293
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,840
But the light was so bright, you know, 12-gauge shotgun,

294
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
and I stuck the barrel in my mouth.

295
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,080
The coup de grace administered by Satan himself.

296
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,100
Joe had a heart attack, put my thumb on the trigger.

297
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,600
At that very moment, Jesus just rushed right in and burned me.

298
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,860
Bob was right behind him.

299
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,580
What actually was happening behind the scenes

300
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,980
was well worth it, though, to us,

301
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,540
for its illustrative value in showing concretely

302
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,420
the difference between subgeni and pinks, dear friends,

303
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,520
the subject of tonight's sermon.

304
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,120
Uh, things that we, you and I, as subgeniuses,

305
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,840
recognize as convenient mental concepts,

306
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,340
are totally real to these poor humans.

307
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:30,500
Working with them on what should be a simple technical job

308
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,500
is, in a way, it's more telling than trying to write an ad for them.

309
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,640
It's hard for you or me to imagine being so rigidly locked

310
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,020
into these old behavior patterns.

311
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,320
And in our quest for ultimate truth, we often wonder,

312
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,780
nobody could really be that stupid.

313
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,780
It's got to be us that's crazy.

314
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,720
But friends, to feel that way is to give the pink way too much credit.

315
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,460
Because when I start to think,

316
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,580
oh, the normals can't really be that bad,

317
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,240
it's proved more true by some blatant example,

318
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,880
such as, recently, having a video projector go on the blink

319
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,380
is really just the icing on a cake already so rotten,

320
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,900
you could only laugh.

321
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,340
Seeing the two species in one place,

322
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,820
it was like, might as well have been Dennis and I

323
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,180
or the two cousins of two different planets.

324
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,240
I guess I haven't been around real mediocratons in a while.

325
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,080
It was like walking into that cartoon world again,

326
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,320
where the characters accept this obviously artificial environment

327
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:39,120
as real for the very reason that they are just that, characters.

328
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,320
Just as the characters in Hamlet never mention Shakespeare, nay,

329
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,860
the Barbies and Kens, likewise, cannot see to what extent

330
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:54,180
they depend upon our fantasies for their entire style of life.

331
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,640
They don't know it's fantasy at all.

332
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,220
We're seeing the bars of a cage they don't even know they're in,

333
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,520
but to them, oh, we look stupid,

334
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,640
because what we do, and indeed what I'm saying now,

335
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,080
does not make sense to them, and never will, nor can it.

336
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,880
It can't make sense to them, because friends,

337
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,140
if they only knew, if they knew what we know,

338
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,560
they would kill themselves.

339
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,640
There is fear.

340
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,580
Why there is fear?

341
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,940
Well, let me put it this way.

342
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,000
We have new and better speaker phones,

343
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,800
a data terminal that transmits ten times faster than telephones,

344
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,760
PBX devices with features like multi-line conferencing and music,

345
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,120
and we've got a new technology that can be used to control

346
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,120


347
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,120


348
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,600
the sound of a radio radio.

349
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,160
Well, we can only counter one point at a time.

350
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,560
This caller doesn't realize that we can only do one thing at a time.

351
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,840
We're not superhuman.

352
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,080
We're just more than human.

353
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,780
Just radio gods to you.

354
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,320
Yes, we're radio gods.

355
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,200
Not like the dim run of ordinary mortals.

356
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,120
Oh, your mama.

357
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,220
In Revelation, Bob speaks first of all of men,

358
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,080
and moves among them in order to invite them,

359
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,980
to feed them into his own company.

360
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,520
And look what happened when he did.

361
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,240
He got killed.

362
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,480
Thus the most intimate truth both about Bob

363
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,280
and the salvation of man is his central content

364
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,920
in the Revelation, which shines forth

365
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,680
or fully in the person of Bob.

366
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,800
He fathers forth whose beauty has passed change.

367
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,720
Praise him.

368
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,180
A collage of sins.

369
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,220
Praise Bob.

370
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,200
And the pure bright white light of stupidity.

371
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,880
Note the volcano, my son, a potent force of nature.

372
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,040
Into the volcano we throw our virgins,

373
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,180
and thus we encourage promiscuity and the spread of our kind.

374
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,680
The volcano is our friend.

375
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,200
Sometimes we see them carrying our children.

376
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,200


377
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,280
Sometimes we see them start a campaign.

378
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,180
A…

379
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,040
I want the ball!

380
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,040


381
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,340
You date soon?

382
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,180
It's a beauty.

383
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,180


384
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,880
FOLSOM!

385
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,940
Well, you know abouthad市 initial Chip!

386
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,760
Is «quick spicy chicken»

387
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,080
Definition neurotransmitter.

388
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,260
There was something quite disgusting to be found.

389
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,920
Oh, never, never, never.

390
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,960
Get me out of here!

391
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,280
This radio station has gotten scary all of a sudden.

392
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,940
Oh, no.

393
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,340
Now as the shades of evening are squiggling...

394
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,220
The salamander speaks in hissing voice from the flames upon the hearth.

395
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,020
And is almost too bright to look at.

396
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,100
Without any...

397
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,060
...could be measuring the eye.

398
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,180
You can get a retinal burn by looking...

399
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,920
Don't look at it, kid!

400
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,360
Don't look at it. I know it's bright.

401
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,060
Here, look. Look very carefully.

402
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,900
Yes, he's pretty, isn't he?

403
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,160
Twinkling in the flames of the fire.

404
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,340
Giant frogs! Get back! Back!

405
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,260
Frogs! Oh!

406
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,900
He's been frogged to death.

407
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,520
A disgusting way to go.

408
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:32,840
Try your best not to kill revive paarlu.

409
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:32,840


410
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:33,540


411
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:33,540


412
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:33,920
The":No super money.

413
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,600
Even as a young child, Dobbs felt the constant compulsion...

414
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,640
...to bring art and reality together into one inseparable...

415
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,260


416
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:47,060
He had sat on his mother's knee and gazed at the picture of Jesus cast and the money changers out of the temple and

417
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,400
Envisioned himself doing the same thing

418
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:56,920
He looked intently at the gold spilling across the temple floor in the painting and wished to be able to reach into the picture and grasp

419
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:02,420
The money in his hands pulling it out of the world of painted religion and into his pockets

420
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,720
in

421
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,940
Later years this drive to make art and commerce into one became his obsession to create the ultimate

422
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:17,540
Harmony of checkbook and church to make religion myth and wealth into a cohesive single work of art

423
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:22,840
This was the moment which he knew was his destiny on the morning of January 21st

424
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,460
1984 Dobbs awoke from sleep with the vision locked in his mind

425
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:34,620
He knew the single action that could bring all into focus his followers and the peoples of the world might never understand

426
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,540
But his need to create harmony

427
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,600
transcended such considerations

428
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,880
Harmony of rant and wallet inwardly. He could feel the engine of disquiet churn

429
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:53,040
Incessantly only at the moment when church and wallet merged would he find freedom as he walked out onto the stage of the Victoria?

430
00:23:53,040 --> 00:24:00,520
Theater his only thought was of the moment of truth to come his ultimate artistic statement his final gesture of love

431
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,220
All the arrangements had been made his second was ready with the handgun

432
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,640
He had

433
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,340
not once questioned Dobbs' decision. As he stepped out before the San Francisco audience, even as the

434
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,560
planted gunman rushed towards him, even as the trigger was being pulled, Dobbs gazed into the

435
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:21,860
cash register that served as a pulpit on stage and watched as the cash register swelled to fill his

436
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:29,120
entire field of vision. The dollar sign on the cash register became a vast star, a sun engulfing

437
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,820
all reality. As the bullets entered his brain one after another, Dobbs finally realized his goal,

438
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:45,660
his greatest moment. The harmony of religion and checkbook became, for an instant, the whole universe.

439
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:20,780
Yes, it's a hard Darwinian world out there, and one might hope that even now, puzzling evidence is

440
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:26,320
trundling over those back roads on its way to be here, but it may be that it's not written in the

441
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:26,940
book of life.

442
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:39,140
It could be that like the pesky mole he throws underground, the pause that refreshes, and his fist which he thrusts against

443
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:46,700
post-speeds, and still insists he sees the ghost. Yes, it's a real phenomenon.

444
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,920
$29.95 at subgenius retail outlets everywhere. Buy one today.

445
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,640
Hmm, tuck it in your bucket and take it to Nantucket.

446
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:58,960
Along with...

447
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,100
Yeah.

448
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:12,520
...the history of persecution, with which our yet-in-sinism curses us, we are also bequeathed within our tampered genes the potential for mystic powers and abilities unrempt of by street pinks.

449
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:28,260
To begin with, we possess the other five senses. However, these work on a purely subconscious level when they work at all, for they have been sequestered from us for the duration of the experiment, the trial by aliens.

450
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:42,440
But you may ask, what are these five subgenius senses, these subgenius senses that every subgenial geriosity employs in flying between the voids of the universe?

451
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:52,620
Well, first there's the third nostril, the life essence detector. It sees or whiffs auras, mental eye stenches, etc.

452
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,180
Very, very stimulating.

453
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,440
Yes, and the second one is the sense of slack.

454
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:57,800
Titillating, too.

455
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,700
Precognitive, clairvoyant.

456
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,060
It catches luck.

457
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,460
It catches the luck plane itself and the time stream images by sensing the echoes of slack particles.

458
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,820
The third, of course, is the psychic forklift.

459
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:19,420
With telekinetic powers such as levitation, spoon-bending spells, hex's will domination and mass hypnosis.

460
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,080
The fourth is classified in national security precludes discussion.

461
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,560
The fifth is the mystery sense.

462
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:26,920
...perile.

463
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,660
Not even Bob has developed this one sufficiently to know what it is.

464
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,640
The Hexists insist that it's there, though.

465
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:38,480
In some ways, the brain is less important to a subgenius than to a pink.

466
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,060
Being less intuitive, pinks need more brains than we do.

467
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:52,780
Their value system is based on intelligence rather than good sense, which is related not so much to thinking as to the feelings of the heart and the foot.

468
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,340
Sound foolish?

469
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,620
As mentioned before, however foolish it may sound...

470
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:01,820
The subgenius foot doubles as a gland and a very complex gland at that.

471
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,380
Don't you want to be treated...

472
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:09,780
You gotta fight for your right to party!

473
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,820
That's right, if Dallas folks were, you gotta stand up and fight for the right to party!

474
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,760
You gotta fight!

475
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,520
Look out!

476
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:25,360
That's why I'm asking everybody that made a pledge to Kay to win, do I win a pledge drive to make that pledge good right now?

477
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,600
Pick up your pen and write.

478
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,200
And write that check or money order out to K-N-O-N.

479
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:37,520
Mail it to Post Office Box 710909, Dallas, Texas 75371.

480
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,900
That's Kay to win.

481
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:45,820
Post Office Box 710909, Dallas, Texas 75371.

482
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:53,000
There is only one alternative rock and roll station in the Metroplex, and we need your support!

483
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,400
Give my head my way!

484
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,760
Hey my way!

485
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,100
I won't be lost, hey!

486
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,880
I won't be lost, hey!

487
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,480
I'll have my way!

488
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,840
Hey my way!

489
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,180
I won't be lost, hey!

490
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,840
I won't be lost, hey!

491
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,160
Whew, help me somebody!

492
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,220
Well, alright!

493
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,180
I'm finally getting used to it.

494
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,880
We're improving the station here like mad, but in the process it, it, uh, oh, it shakes you up.

495
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,820
You come in here each week, they've moved the control room into another room, and it all, it all works.

496
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,740
But it all works just a little bit different.

497
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:32,940
Uh, well, dear friends, the Popess Cecilia is actually in the studios tonight.

498
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:42,840
She has lowered herself to, to, to wade out amongst ye unwashed, and is here, the uber dominatrix of all Dallas.

499
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:52,300
And I believe she has, and the great Southwest, and I believe she has a, uh, a word for those of you who, who like the Nightman was saying,

500
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:52,900
Haint.

501
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,160
Cut that check.

502
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,560
Cut that check to the station yet.

503
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,260
Bobber slobber, gobbler goo, tell me, tell me, tell me do.

504
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,880
Magic mirror, tell me today, which one of these bozos hasn't sent in their pledge yet?

505
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:13,480
Whoa, I see Eddie, and I see Bob, and there's Mary.

506
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,820
You know, she went on ahead and went out night clubbing and honky tonk instead of sending in her pledge.

507
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,680
And how about Bill?

508
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,680
Uh huh.

509
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,140
I know what you did with that money, Bill.

510
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,460
And not to mention, hey Eddie, you're sitting right there by that radio.

511
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:29,820
Who did that?

512
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:35,060
Just sitting there sucking this up and not even thinking, oh, just totally forgot about it.

513
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:44,040
Well, well, well, come on darling, cut it out, pull it out, give it to Bob, Bob needs it, we needs it, or the baptismoid's gonna get you.

514
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,120
And no more hour of slack.

515
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,840
Help me somebody, help me somebody.

516
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,840
Help me cut them checks, folks.

517
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,100
We gotta, we gots to have that money.

518
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,800
You know you want this show, you know you want it, you got to have it.

519
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,340
And we got to have that money.

520
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,180
Good money.

521
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,400
Whip it out, friends.

522
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,860
That's it, friends, whip it out.

523
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:24,820
And now, oh yeah, by the way folks, those of you who've called to offer your homes, you poor dupes who've called to offer your homes for the immense subgenius of the show.

524
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,180
We're gonna have a subgenius party.

525
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,340
The phones don't work here.

526
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,940
If you've been calling, we just figured out, things are down right now.

527
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,160
But next week we'll figure it all out, don't worry about that.

528
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,280
In the meantime, we've got our first entry in the Win a Date with Brother Cleve Duncan contest.

529
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:49,040
Now if you don't remember who Brother Cleve is, he's the guy who does our amazing intro gospel show, Bob is My Load, and he's coming again.

530
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,880
Brother Cleve is also a member of the conspiracy rock band, the Del Fuegos.

531
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,120
He goes on tour with them, and he's gonna be in Dallas sooner or later.

532
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:11,340
And you subgenius ministresses and so on out there, you non-tool using primates can win a date with Brother Cleve Donut Duncan of Slackmaster Cleve and the Spurious Job.

533
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,960
And here's our first entry in the Win a Date.

534
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,800
You have to write an essay, see, about why you should...

535
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,200
It better be good, too, because I'm gonna have to beat mine.

536
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,820
That's right, here it is, folks.

537
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,200
Why she wants...

538
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,860
Why she doesn't...

539
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,920
Why she deserves the date with Cleve.

540
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:39,220
Oh, oh, oh, I know for a fact that I deserve the date with Cleve, because I am fascinating, well-rounded, stimulating, crazy, possessed, talented, and articulate phalanges.

541
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,880
Glossolabial musculature, I'm not pink.

542
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,400
Good mutant reputation, unquestionable yeti characteristics.

543
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,440
I'm intelligent, so it won't be no Swiss picnic, I guarantee.

544
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,680
I'm probably one of the few females in town who can keep him entertained.

545
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,400
Unless he only needs the pleasures that mere orifices can offer.

546
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,280
In that case, we'll cruise Harry Hines or industrial.

547
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,400
Assuming that mere physicality is the icing on the cake, I'm his woman.

548
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:15,520
Not to mention the indisputable fact that I am a slave of the foundation and the Bob toy.

549
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,420
Dr. Brother Cleve will have to root through a sizable pile of bimbos and lice.

550
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:29,080
Little pinkies before he finds a subgenial female with my qualities, abilities, and attributes too numerous to mention here.

551
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,820
An hour spent with me would be like centuries spent with anyone else.

552
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,720
I'm strictly unusual, geared toward the exceptional rather than the average.

553
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,900
Only one of this kind on the entire planet.

554
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,420
Flexible, able to grovel.

555
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,100
Will sublimate quality time for football, wrestling, etc.

556
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,400
Always up for bad fitness.

557
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:51,560
I'm a little too much of a film.

558
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,080
Profane, irreverent, irrelevant.

559
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,220
Irruptive.

560
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,660
Irresponsible for my lusts.

561
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,000
I can suck stardust.

562
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,020
Known for certain musical abilities, I'm better than prairie squid.

563
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,100
Friend of dinosaurs, seducer of beasts.

564
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,060
Beloved of spots and stripers everywhere.

565
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,600
A many-pleasured individual.

566
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,040
Choose me.

567
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,280
What's the thing that they're talkin' about everywhere?

568
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,620
Flex.

569
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,320
When they wanna be swabbin' their bananas.

570
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,520
Flex.

571
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,380
What's poppin' up the most from coast to coast?

572
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,060
Flex.

573
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,180
At your bongo party and your weenie rolls.

574
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,160
Flex.

575
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,360
Do you do or don't you don't?

576
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:04,980
Flex.

577
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,300
Head to lyin' if you say you won't.

578
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,160
Flex.

579
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,860
Some girls try it and go on a diet.

580
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,360
Then they worry cause they say they won't.

581
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:20,500
Flex.

582
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:20,920
They say they're too fat.

583
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,300
Who wants to ride on an ironing board?

584
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,940
That ain't no fun.

585
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,640
I tried me one.

586
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,300
Roll that meat all over your bones.

587
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,540
Work the wall with the local Jones.

588
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,080
And while you do it, remember this line.

589
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,540
The sniffer says it all the time.

590
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,360
The bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'.

591
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,260
The bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'.

592
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,680
The bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'.

593
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,300
The bigger the cushion.

594
00:35:53,640 --> 00:36:00,140
The bigger the cushion, the better the pushin'.

595
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,260
Flex.

596
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,500
Makes no difference if you're young or old.

597
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,420
Flex.

598
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,280
Don't you act like it's made of gold.

599
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,180
Flex.

600
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,160
Ladies, they need it just like the guys.

601
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,780
Maybe you could use a protein surprise

602
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,320
Anytime, anywhere

603
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,540
Why do you think it's growing there?

604
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,740
Some girls try it and they don't like it

605
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,800
They complain cause it don't last

606
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,240
Who wants to ride on the debutante?

607
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,660
They talk too much, they move too fast

608
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,940
Watch the scenery while you ride

609
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,240
You can be very warm inside

610
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,760
And when the train goes round the bend

611
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,260
Check the shrubbery on the other end

612
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,560
The bigger the cushion, the better the pushing

613
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,720
The bigger the cushion, the better the pushing

614
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,360
The bigger the cushion, the better the pushing

615
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,020
The bigger the cushion

616
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:31,460
Once upon a time, it was in Albuquerque, New Mexico

617
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,840
Alright, dear friends, that was Frank Zappa.

618
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,280
What was that album? Man from Utopia?

619
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,820
Yes, indeedy.

620
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,640
Yes, Man from Utopia. Thank you, Dean.

621
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,720
Based on a song...

622
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,940
A survey of 261 people.

623
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,360
Dear friends, this is a profile of the yuppie.

624
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,480
261 people ages 25 to 44 living in an urban area

625
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,680
Working in white collar jobs and earning more than $30,000 a year

626
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,740
Two Aggie University researchers say that typical yuppies

627
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,140
Get this, folks.

628
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,840
Drink more diet sodas than the rest of us

629
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,860
Figures.

630
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:13,020
Eat more often at fast food restaurants

631
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,040
Yes, fine.

632
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,180
Have more credit cards, own more microwave ovens, VCRs, and personal computers

633
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,000
Fine.

634
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,100
But here's the important part.

635
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:30,400
And they care less about nostalgia, religion, and sex.

636
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:37,400
They also read newspaper business sections more often than subgenius pamphlets

637
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,300
Seen here on camera 3.

638
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:47,540
And overtake me, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God.

639
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:56,100
So we're in the middle of a nightmare, and it may have been going on for many years.

640
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,540
That city is so wicked.

641
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,080
My God, the devil is moving there.

642
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,580
He grows.

643
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,280
And he gains.

644
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,380
So you can't get no blessing there.

645
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,660
Bless them, hallelujah.

646
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,140
They ain't got no Holy Ghost churches there.

647
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,260
That's a lie.

648
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,060
Let's say praise the Lord.

649
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,280
Cause God got a Holy Ghost church.

650
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,320
Somewhere.

651
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,240
Let's say praise the Lord.

652
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,920
Somebody preaching the word.

653
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,780
Somebody got the Holy Ghost.

654
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,420
Somebody praising God.

655
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,160
Somebody believing God.

656
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,220
Somebody standing on his word.

657
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,260
Somebody receiving a miracle.

658
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,920
Let's say praise the Lord.

659
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:30,800
Hallelujah.

660
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,520
Blessings shall thou be in the city.

661
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,620
That's the case in many of these homes in Essex County.

662
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,400
They were built on soil.

663
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,840
Contaminated with radium.

664
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,440
That's the stuff clock dials used to be painted with to glow in the dark.

665
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,440
I respect them.

666
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,600
That I care about them.

667
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,320
That I value the action in the church.

668
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,820
And Bob and Bob will give you slack.

669
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,880
Watch it over the drunkards, idiots, frothheads, and all such idiots.

670
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,600
Now once the Yucca Tisma has been evocated,

671
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,440
and once the energies have started to flow through you,

672
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,920
you've become to the centering of the sea.

673
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,820
Not the being, but the sea.

674
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:15,840
And the visualization of the true work.

675
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,820
The one thing you want to do so badly.

676
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,900
And now with the injection of this each force that you have received

677
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:30,680
through the regulation of the cash flow and the invocation of the Yucca Tismic forces,

678
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:37,240
and the true aesthetic beauty life death force of the universe is coursing through your veins,

679
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,900
we now look at our work and go through it.

680
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,140
Plan every step of it.

681
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,180
Every, every facet of it.

682
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,100
Until there it is.

683
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,860
Crafted, polished, completely, perfectly assembled.

684
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,320
The great jewel.

685
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,600
The great jewel of something.

686
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,700
Some great expression that we've wanted for so long.

687
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,460
And we focus it.

688
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,500
We examine it.

689
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,680
We look at it.

690
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,760
Holding it there with the energy from it feeding back to us, from us as it is us.

691
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,300
We are it.

692
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,120
And then we blow it all off.

693
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,940
That's like flames.

694
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,880
That moment.

695
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,400
We just blow it all off.

696
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,300
We stuff it out.

697
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,940
We throw it away.

698
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,740
We say, yeah, well, it could be done.

699
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
Could be done.

700
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,240
Could be done exactly that way.

701
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,120
I know I can.

702
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,680
So what?

703
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,460
Why should I?

704
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,680
When you blow something like that off.

705
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,280
Ah, the slack.

706
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,060
It doesn't dregle in flames.

707
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,440
It surges in.

708
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,480
It's a great injection of slack into your life.

709
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:55,880
Yes.

710
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,660
Millions of people get confused about how we're saved.

711
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,640
Whether we're saved by works or by grace.

712
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,120
One says, no, we're saved by grace and works have nothing to do with it.

713
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,480
The other says, no, we're saved by grace.

714
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:34,320
No, we're not.

715
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,800
So I have to be very clear about the value of what you do.

716
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:35,800


717
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:35,800


718
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,840
Then if you have faith in to show your love force with your soul and that confidence,

719
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:36,840


720
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:36,840


721
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,180
Now there is only one, the proud voice of the rockin' people.

All on KMON.

738
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,320
4.9 FM Stereo, the home of alternative rock and roll.

739
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,500
If you didn't hear it here, it is where?

740
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,160
I'm sick of work, and I'm tired of all this noise.

741
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,680
I want to play real music, and I want to win the game for sick of all.

742
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,400
I'm sick of all.

743
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,800
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of all.

744
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,240
This is the band that dare not speak its name.

745
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,980
I'm sick of it.

746
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,640
I'm sick of it.

747
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,660
Come on now, that's right.

748
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:06,780
Uh-huh.

749
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,280
You're walking down the street, you keep lifting your feet, but you never find a place to go.

750
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:16,940
Never find a place to go until suddenly, man, you never even knew what hit you.

751
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,860
I say what hit you was the back of your head.

752
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,480
That's right.

753
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,620
Uh-huh.

754
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,520
I say get off of the street, get off of the street, boy.

755
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,400
People gonna think, yes, they're gonna think.

756
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,080
People gonna, people gonna think you're a spy.

757
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:29,820
Yeah.

758
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,740
Come on now, that's right.

759
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:36,820
Uh-huh.

760
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,440
You're pretty shook up, so you're gonna get a cup of water just to calm you down.

761
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,280
But when you turn around, some joke or some jealous, stay yourself.

762
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,620
Hey, you know it was a mama's tea.

763
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,280
That's right.

764
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,500
Uh-huh.

765
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,520
I say get off of the floor, get off of the floor, boy.

766
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,260
People gonna think, yes, they're gonna think.

767
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,000
People gonna, people gonna think you're a spy.

768
00:45:59,320 --> 00:45:59,720
Yes.

769
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:00,780
Yes.

770
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:00,780


771
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:01,760
Yes.

772
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,080
Yes.

773
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:04,820
Yes.

774
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:05,360
Yes.

775
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,220
Yes.

776
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


777
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


778
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


779
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


780
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


781
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


782
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


783
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


784
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


785
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


786
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


787
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


788
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


789
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


790
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


791
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


792
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


793
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,220


794
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,520
Yes.

795
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,060
Yes.

796
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,700
Yes.

797
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,280
Yes.

798
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,120
Yes.

799
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:27,400
Yes.

800
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:27,400


801
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:27,400


802
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:27,400


803
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,020
I mean, do you call this music?

804
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,400
Is this really music?

805
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:02,820
I mean, do you actually claim to be a musician?

806
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,400
I don't know if you call this existence.

807
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:12,380
Do you call this existence where we sit around here and question each other's motives and breathe the same air, life?

808
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,380
Yes, I do call it life, as a matter of fact.

809
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,640
Well, then I call this music.

810
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,040
I call it music.

811
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,380
I don't know what else to call it.

812
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,320
Well, I certainly don't know what to call it either.

813
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,040
Okay.

814
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:29,620
I can't believe that our listeners have even put up with this show at all for this long.

815
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,100
It's a sickening thought here.

816
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,160
I'm going to go back to the...

817
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,660
I can't believe it.

818
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,620
...in the station.

819
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,860
Look at the front of the door.

820
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:54,600
His holy visage guards the door and holds back the demons.

821
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,880
Obviously, Bob is a religious figure.

822
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:03,760
He is perhaps, I think, the foremost religious figure of the 20th century.

823
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,200
He's not that well known yet.

824
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,960
But we can pretty surely say that Bob is coming.

825
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,900
At any given moment, Bob is coming.

826
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,960
Now, no one in the church has ever personally met Bob.

827
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:19,420
Is that true?

828
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,460
No.

829
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,140
Let me clarify that.

830
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,440
The Church of the Subgenius is a world-encompassing organization.

831
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:33,880
It includes some of the most powerful elite men in the world...

832
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,300
who do deal with Bob all the time.

833
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,980
The Subgenius Foundation, which employs me, is different.

834
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,540
And very few of us have met.

835
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,380
But I have never personally met the glory that is Bob.

836
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,400
And I fear Bob, in fact.

837
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,260
I don't want to.

838
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:56,340
But Dr. Philo Drummond in Dallas converses with Bob telepathically all the time.

839
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,700
And we do get Bob's wisdom that way.

840
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,860
And in that way, get it out into the world.

841
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,860
So you and Philo are merely sort of gunmen?

842
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,240
Gunrunners.

843
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,420
We're Bob.

844
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,360
Yeah, and...

845
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:06,860
Vessels.

846
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,320
Conduits.

847
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:08,960
Conduits.

848
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,460
Positive and negative wires for the great emissions of Bob.

849
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:14,380
Yeah.

850
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,760
And for that matter, Bob...

851
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,680
Soggy condoms for the open expression of Bobdom for the world.

852
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:21,500
Bob's love.

853
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,680
Bob's love.

854
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,920
Bob love, actually.

855
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,800
The love of Bob.

856
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:25,520
Yeah.

857
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,580
Oh, Bob, let your love...

858
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:33,860
Well, Bob himself, in turn, is just a vessel for the world.

859
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:33,860


860
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,500
And also...

861
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,200
Actually, Bob's a god.

862
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:37,200


863
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:37,200


864
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,880
He is a god.

865
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:46,640
quency price is created by a huh-s, by bow-in traverse.

866
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,780
Oh, were you...

867
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:48,100


868
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:48,100


869
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:48,100


870
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:53,920
When you say, God's one glory, then respect to Graham Fick, help apolitik

871
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:53,920


872
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,720
Jordan, a professor of science, and to esoteric ceremony authority.

873
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,260
So, Bob here is diverting.

874
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:55,680
Oh, my goodness.

875
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:02,580
This is aomi o like bro compound, and these are all�

876
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:02,700
this isn't Bob.

877
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:02,720
He's Rob Koch.

878
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,880
Too old.

879
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:09,580
that has played carries you on it's the coffin they carry you

880
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:26,820
hey where are we here I think we're in space somewhere look like the studio

881
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:31,320
where the bottom of something here oh there's a light that's passed look

882
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:35,440
there's a giant mouth opening up and it's swallowing the earth of a giant

883
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,620
pipe oh no it's a giant pipe

884
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,260
one day

885
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,740
one day

886
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:29,780
when he saw a dead cat and picked it up to eat he was chomping on this morsel this little scrap of

887
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,180
food

888
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:39,220
he suddenly stood up and said hey what you doing dude so he threw down the cat's corpse with

889
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:47,960
disgust in his face and he thought of himself as a disgrace to the human race he thought how could

890
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:55,020
you eat a poor little dead cat how could anyone in their right mind do something like that then

891
00:51:55,020 --> 00:52:01,100
he looked into the street to see a flattened toad he walked over and bent down

892
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:10,900
and licked it off the road friends these words from an anonymous subgenius signature I cannot even read

893
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:19,080
prove once and for all that this is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack

894
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:25,520
on k-n-o-n 90.9 FM here in Dallas Texas

895
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,220
yeah I praise Bob

896
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:31,660
not my friends

897
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:39,040
and it is proved more blatant everyday the real horror to me is when I think of how

898
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:48,120
dumb I myself am if they the pinks really that much dumber than me then that's dangerously

899
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:57,380
dumb my friends so dumb and or dishonest but they have to think they're smart if we were to judge them

900
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,840
by their own standards we'd hate them

901
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,660
and it's

902
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,240
It's sort of frustrating to know better than that, isn't it?

903
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:08,520
I can't just hate pinks because they have so little ability to control their own lives.

904
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:11,100
You really can't hold them individually responsible.

905
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:15,080
We can hate their system, the fact that we have to live in it because there are so many

906
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:20,260
more of them, but they continue to astound me more than anger me.

907
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:26,400
They're just a part of nature, just mindless shells that are a fact of life, like the weather.

908
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:33,700
When I say they're pink and I'm a subgenius, that's not a cutesy way of saying I'm a genius.

909
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,560
Subgenius really means not a genius.

910
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:42,940
We are implicitly admitting that we can screw up.

911
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,540
So big deal.

912
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:52,820
But the pink lives in constant fear of screwing up and that's why we're the inventors, dear

913
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:53,260
friends.

914
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,020
The explorers.

915
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:56,380
The inventors.

916
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:56,780
The inventors.

917
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:00,900
Those crazy enough to fight the conspiracy and yet they're just consumers, food tubes,

918
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,440
crawling media worms.

919
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,500
A pink naturally fears failure more than a subgenius because a pink's sense of self

920
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:15,360
depends entirely on his peer group's opinion of him, whereas we could give but a flying

921
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,360
hoot what the great unwashed thinks of us.

922
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,640
And this, dear friends, gives us the incredible power to learn from our mistakes simply because

923
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,680
we dare to make them.

924
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:35,000
The pink doesn't even crawl far enough out of his mental hole to risk the truly new.

925
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:44,640
And, friends, we'll continue this lesson in hate, why we are indeed so much better than

926
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:50,060
those crawling pink ones, those pathetic...

927
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,660
I wish I could hate them.

928
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,640
Popa Cecilia?

929
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,320
Yes.

930
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,720
Yes.

931
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,340
I wish I could hate them.

932
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:01,180
Can you say a little about the... the... the... being a popess in the Church of the

933
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:01,660
Subgenius?

934
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:06,580
Not to be confused with Pastor Bucknaker, the pope of all Dallas, and perhaps Texas

935
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:12,660
as well, I can't remember, the power to fail, the holy power that you have that popes of

936
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,880
other religions can only dream about.

937
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:16,600
Friends.

938
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,040
Darlings.

939
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:25,040
The pope sitting in the Vatican, the mere pope of the planet, the mere pope of the Christian

940
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:34,580
religion would give his eye teeth to be able to make a mistake, but no. No. He has to pull off

941
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:42,620
everything that he says as being divinely inspired. The word of, quote, God, unquote.

942
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:49,480
He can't do anything wrong. Nothing. Can you imagine how pitiful that must be?

943
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:58,440
Friends, when I screw up, it only reminds me that I'm really a little bit better than everybody else

944
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:05,680
because I can screw up. I can do anything. Bob is that excuse, dear friend. He sure is.

945
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:13,080
He is your excuse. He brings not forgiveness. You don't need to be forgiven. You only need an excuse.

946
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:18,120
And I've got a divine excuse that comes

947
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,460
with your forgiveness.

948
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:29,040
You can write for information, dear friends, to the Church of the Subgenius here in Dallas, Texas

949
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:44,700
at Post Office Box 140306. Dallas, Texas 75214. Let me say that again. Dallas, Texas 75214.

950
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:49,120
I'm so thrown off by this holy music. It's so different from the usual ending.

951
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:54,660
The hour of slack as we wait for Ron Lindsay to get here to do the soul oldies show.

952
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:01,000
Another voyage into slack. Another realm. Another universe. You can make your own

953
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:09,820
universe, dear friends. And so we all say, as we must say, as Bob makes us say.

954
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:35,780
I once knew a cowboy. His name was Bob. He didn't have a horse nor a gun or a job.

955
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:42,480
He didn't shoot your back, but his pipe was cool. Even though it smelled like a sweaty mule.

956
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,900
That's Bob. That's Bob. That's Bob.

957
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:55,360
He walked into town on the 7th of May. Sleeping with the livestock sheriff said,

958
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,600
He's gay. Gave him a ball, my hair cut it, charged him a dime.

959
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:03,240
Showed a nine-year-old girl how to have a good time.

960
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,520
That's Bob. That's Bob. That's Bob.

961
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,760
Went out one night and had too much to drink.

962
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,160
Town folks got mad cause he said they was pink.

963
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,640
Preacher said he's slackful. Sheriff said he's sick.

964
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,960
Doctor said he's bad, but you should see his brother Dick.

965
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:38,420
That's Bob. That's Bob. That's Bob.

966
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,240
Town folks was mad. They all said they'd had enough.

967
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:47,700
Bob says, I'll leave. Just let me get my stuff.

968
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,460
Sheriff says, no way. He said, I'll leave. Just let me get my stuff.

969
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,160
No way. We'll have a shootout on the grass.

970
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,720
So Bob took careful aim. Shot the sheriff in the arm.

971
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:59,160
That's Bob. That's Bob. That's Bob.

972
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:16,600
That's Bob, dear friends. That's the young technocrats.

973
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,920
Came at Bob, but he didn't blink an eye.

974
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,420
Just puffed on his pipe and watched the lights in the sky.

975
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,820
The exes came down and whisked him away.

976
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,380
Bob just waved down and yelled, have a nice day.

977
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:34,080
That's Bob. That's Bob. That's Bob.

978
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:41,040
Aw, thank you so much, young technocrats.

979
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,780
And they are young. They're a bunch of college students way out there in the distance.

980
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,020
We're all brothers in a birthday party.

981
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:50,920
In a perfect world, there's continuity.

982
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:54,420
We're all brothers in a perfect world.

983
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:57,760
There's no need for spontaneity.

984
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,560
Perfect system. We're all brothers to the end.

985

I can think. I have a mind.

995

They make me say things.

996
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,940
They torture me. They torture me.

997
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:50,200
I can think. I have a mind.

998
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:53,120
I hate this place. Don't let them kill me. Kill me. Kill me.

999
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:53,920
They torture me. I have a mind.

1000
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,100
Oh, you don't care.

1001
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:58,160
They torture me.

1002
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:58,680
I have a mind.

1003
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,660
Go ahead. Kill me.

1004
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,220
They torture me.

1005
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:04,640

Help me escape.

1010
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,960
They torture me.

1011
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,040
They torture me.

1012
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:15,040
They torture me.

1013
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:16,220
Kill me.

1014
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:19,740
Don't look at me.

1015
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:19,920


1016
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,700
Kill me.

1017
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,000
Do not talk to me.

1018
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,000


1019
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,000


1020
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,440
I tell you where I'm going to hide.

1021
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:32,900
I'm guеля.

1022
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:33,500
Kill me.

1023
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:33,500


1024
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:33,500


1025
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:33,500


1026
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:33,500


1027
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:33,800
Kill me.

1028
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:34,480
Kill me.

1029
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,820
Kill me.

1030
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:45,080
Real slack is free, even if it isn't always legal.

1031
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:46,960
So it's sad that we only have one minute,

1032
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:50,080
but it balances out in one great religious urge,

1033
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:53,340
one great religious evacuation of the senses.

1034
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:57,120
And I would recommend reading Prescripture 1714 and 3691.

1035
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:01,120
And friends, we need blankets and contraceptives

1036
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:05,020
for those boys and girls in the home for slackless children.

1037
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,640
Your contributions also keep those we hate starving to death.

1038
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:14,060
I command you to spill your gift seed pledge of 100 pounds and dollar bills on my lap,

1039
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,160
as this will buy so much for those poor children.

1040
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,680
Bob Dobbs will bless you for planting this seed faith,

1041
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,700
and now our announcer won't give you the mailing address of the Church of the Subgenius.

1042
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:25,640
Thank you, and let there be slack.

1043
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:46,980
I stumbled on this photograph

1044
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:50,300
It kind of made me laugh

1045
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,880
It took me way back

1046
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:56,420
Back down memory lane

1047
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,780
I see the happiness

1048
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,420
I see the pain

1049
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,260
Where am I?

1050
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,220
Back down memory lane

1051
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:08,620
Back down memory lane

1052
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:08,620


1053
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,040
I see us standing there

1054
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,740
Such a happy, happy pair

1055
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,740
Love beyond compare

1056
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:19,240
Look up there, look up there

1057
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:23,300
The way you held me

1058
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,580
No one could tell me

1059
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:30,060
That love would die

1060
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,040
Oh, oh
