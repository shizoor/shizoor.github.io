Alright, let's just pick a name at random.
Oh, right, out of the phone book.
That's a good idea. Leave it to fate.
Okay.
When I stop, you point.
Bob.
Great.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I understand. Goodbye.
He says he's pretty sure this isn't sabotage.
That he thinks there's something far more terrible than that in back of it.
The Soul Genius.
Power of Sack.
What?
But why did they come here?
Well, they're not friendly, we're sure of that.
No matter what the cost, it must be destroyed.
Oh, well.
Bob and Nipsey's Morning Laugh Factory.
Apparently Bob and Nipsey couldn't make it tonight, so I accept this award on their behalf.
That brings us to our final category.
But rather than compete for the coffee service,
let's take a short break.
And we'll be right back with the Man of the Year Award.
Now the time has come to present Man of the Year Award.
Thank you, Susan.
As you all know, this award is presented every year
to the radio personality that brings honor to our medium.
This year, that person is Bob.

Abnormal is right.
The collages in that section were both from the Dr. Musica project,
new contributors,
and the song Don't Shoot was the Spud Boys covering that Devo song at the 2010 Devotional.
The song before that was William Devo performing a song Devo, Devo, Devo.
All of those were taken from this year's Devo.
Covers compilation not necessarily beautiful but mutated, produced by Reverend Toth Wilder.
Friends, I had to get away from my cult and take a breather with somebody else's The Devo Cult.
I set out.
I make a show from the 2010 Devotional, which is the Devo fan event held here in Cleveland every year.
And there's enough for 300 shows.
So just to make it easier, I decided to gather up the Devo covers done by bands that are associated with the Church of the Subgenius.
Here are, for instance, the German Subgenius band Mutate Now.

This is a boy who went too far
Wash his eyes with yellow soap
He stole his daddy's microscope
All alone, in a crowd
Never say his name aloud
Now he wants to know your unit's name
Where you go and whence you came
He's a mecha-mania boy
This is a boy who never goes slow
He is the one who destroys his young
Everybody got a new way to go
All alone, on the telephone
He knows the time you spend at home
Oh no!
Never say I didn't tell you so
Wash his hands of his daddy's fate
He put himself in an altered state
In a crowd, all alone
No one's laughing anymore
Now he wants to know your unit's name
Where you go and whence you came
He's a mecha-mania boy
All alone, in a crowd
Never say his name aloud
Now he wants to know your unit's name
Where you go and whence you came
He's a mecha-mania boy

No one's laughing anymore


Now he wants to know your unit's name

Let's go!
Take a step outside yourself
Then you turn around
Take a look at who you are
It's pretty scary
You're so silly
Well it's a road thing
You're not much
Yet you're anything
Take a step outside the city
And you turn around
Take a look at what you are
Well it's a road thing
You're really nowhere
You're so wasted
It's full
So foolish
All big talk
Who said don't look back
Don't believe them
You go for that corner seat in a restaurant
Cause they're gonna try and get behind you
Don't you let them do it
You know what I'm talking about
You hear me talking
Well if you're so stupid
You don't have to be a police officer
It's pretty scary, it's so revolting
Take a step outside the country
Then you turn around
Take a look at where you are
Well it's amazing
Take a good look
You're no big deal
Oh you're so petty
Well it's a laugh
Take a step outside the planet
You turn around and around
Then take a look at where you are
It's pretty scary
I believe Poopy Necropondy and the...
Poopy Necropondy's cream based soup
I believe is coming up next
I believe is coming up next
And I read that in the newspaper by the way
They were in the Cleveland scene
That's how I learned I was supposed to be here tonight
Also, I noticed that there was a listing of the bands that were going to play
And one listing was one of my favorite bands of all time
The Mutant Mountain Boys
Now the funny thing is, in the newspaper, the spelling was a little funny.
They spelled, out of Mutant Mountain Boys, they spelled mountain without the A. So it
sort of looked like it was saying Mutant Mounting Boys.
Now, let me put the apostrophe on it.
Mutant Mountain Boys.
Does that mean they are boys who are mounting mutants?
Well, there's a lot of ways you can take that.
And that misspelling was another example of proof that in fact, Devo was right about everything.
I'm sorry if you're not aware of this.

The band, one of my other favorite bands, the Athery Squash, couldn't be here because
they're from England.
They do a great song called Devo Was Right About Everything.
Every time I read Yahoo News.com and then read the comments from the humans at large
that they had at the end of the news stories.
Devo was so funny.
He was very, very right about everything.
And it would be sad, but I think we've found a way to live with it, haven't we?
I'm going to keep this short.
I did have one observation.
The other day, I was preaching to the Freethinkers, which seems like a contradiction in terms.
It was the Cleveland Freethinkers Club, which means they're mostly a bunch of atheists.
I mean, by definition, they can't believe in Bob, J.R.
Bob Dobson.
This guy was sure.
Can you hear him?
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
That's not bad for the tavern part of the room.
That's good.
Anyway, I was preaching to the Freethinkers and telling stories all the insane weirdos,
and insane weirdos that I've met over the years working for Church of the Sentient.
I was a big fan of the Freethinkers.
They're a genius.
And, on a couple of occasions, working for that band, the Devo's.
Anyway, the guy that invited me to come speak, afterwards, he said,
I need to ask you a question.
When you get into something, say you get some new thing that you're interested in,
do you get into it all the way where you just study?
Do you study every little detail about that thing that you're into, to the extent that
you're like a complete and utter geek about it?
Well, yeah.
What's behind the Church of the Subgenius doctrine of short duration personal safety?
You know, I can't spend 24-7 worshiping Bob Dobbs.
He's just not that good looking.
Or funny.
Or funny.
Or funny all the time.
But, yeah.
And I realized that that's a defining feature of a lot of geeks and weirdos is when they
get interested in something, they don't just sort of listen to the hearsay about it.
They read the Wikipedia article.
They read every link on the Wikipedia article.
They go out and buy the book about the thing or the ten books about the thing.
They read all of them.
And I've done that my entire life.
It's like, I bet some of you are like that.
Maybe you are.
I've come to think of it, the fact that we're at a devotional that is devoted to this one
band and all the stuff they did.
And I would wager that probably most of you here could quote every lyric of every song
of every commercial release and the bootlegs.
And the in-between stuff.
But, you know, let's face it.
Yeah, sure.
We're geeks.
We're totally.
When you get into something, you leave no stone unturned.
Now, I was, I ended up making a list of what were the various things that I've gotten obsessed
with.
You know, the devo obsesso as our friend, Reverend Pilmer over there.
Oh, Reverend.
I know.
I know.
I know.














I know.
I know.
Praise Reverend Pilmer.
Thank you.
When I was a little kid in the 1950s, it was monsters.
That was the very first thing that I totally got into.
Monsters.
Dinosaurs, wolf men, Frankensteins.
They hadn't invented the living dead yet.
But you know where I'm coming from.
Monsters.
It got more specific.
I mean, I didn't know what I was going to do.










I was going to be a Ray Harryhausen monster.
In fact, one reason I'm so glad to be at this devo convention is so I can hear some new
music and get Bernard Herrmann's score for Seventh Voyage of Sinbad out of my head.
And then after the monsters, I guess I discovered weird rock music.
Frank Zappa and Jimi Hendrix.
There was a time when I was probably one of the world experts.
I'm Jimi Hendrix.
Then what was that weird band, the guys that played in the radiation suits?
Oh, Devo.
That's it.
That was another thing I was a complete intense fan of to the point that I actually read the
tiny print on the poster on the second album that gave their fan club.
Oh, no.
That was the one that gave my fan club address.
Well, anyway.
One of them had a fan club address and I sent them the very first So Genius pamphlet.
They were such losers.
They wrote me back.
And it was the beginning of a beautiful marriage of horror.
I was also a geek for underground comics like Robert Crumb used to do.
And actually, more Robert Williams was my favorite.
And the...
Anybody here ever heard of the Fireside Theater?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Anybody here memorize every single line of every Fireside Theater album script?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, I'm getting at it.
Anyway, there's been many things since then.
That was in the old days.
My most recent weird geeky obsession has been with microbiology.
My new hobby is monster watching.
But they're very, very tiny monsters.
I'm watching through them.
I'm watching through a microscope.
They're very basic.
They're very Devo, you might say.
Amoebas, permettrees, things like that.
Mosquito larvae.
Kind of cute when you get to know them.
But the bottom line, I think, that was in common throughout all of this stuff, the stuff
that the geek gets into, including Devo, the thread that runs through Devo.







Monsters.
Do there happen to be any other monster fans in this room tonight?
There's a few, yeah, a few.
A few monster fans.
I've looked at my list of great things,
things that I had felt I had to know everything about
or I wouldn't be able to go to sleep and learn those things.
And the bottom line, in the end, I ended up with a formula.
And here's the formula.
Devo equals monsters.
Praise monsters, praise Devo, praise Bob, praise the Devo Show,
and praise this mysterious thing that's about to happen,
which may or may not be,
from right here in Cleveland, friends.
Poopy.
Poopy.
Poopy.
Necropondy.
Poopy Necropondy's cream-based soup.
Woo!
Be super!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

Your baby dog.

devex you too, your belly's going up-
Baby dog.

Why did you do it, baby dove!
My favorite queen knows what she wants
And what I got is what is not
My baby dog

You look so good
You feel so good
You let me have it
Why didn't you do it, baby dog?
Baby dog, you look so good
Baby dog, you feel so good
Baby dog, you let me have it
Baby dog
Yeah!
Sixth grade, I took a D-45 in sixth grade to Mrs. Rowland's music class.
And put it on one of those school-issued deals.
And it gradually began to joco-homo.
And I was just sitting there going,
Oh my God, I'm going to get my ass kicked for this.
And I did.
But it's all good.
Because being a spud, you got to get tempered a little, if you know what I mean.
Right?
You don't want to skate through with those assholes listening to Halen with the cool hair.
Right?
All right.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
There's a vine of heaven waiting in the sky.
Bob in the sky.
Well, I bought the beast MVP.
Yeah.
It was bright and sunny day.
Well, I finished listening to it.
I put on some Q&A.
My turntable started jumping.
What is it I don't know?
Yeah.
Oh, let Bob.
Okay?
Bob O Spacef.


God bless you all.
Have a nice day.
Well, I bought a second coffee
Mr. Toothbread, I expressed
My girlfriend came home to me
She started taking off her dress
Oh, yeah, she must come in
I said, call me
With a sweet ass country voice
I just told her
Gotta wait now, girl
I'm listening to freedom of choice
Mm-hmm, where your record

That was Reverend Robin Rene singing in The Mutant Mountain Boys.
The lyrics of that song incorporate every Devo album and numerous song titles.
Tricky.
And now from the devotional, Jerry Casale and the amino acids.
Well, mostly the amino acids.
Get the amino fucking acids!
We've got amino acids up here so we can all get some
commingling of bodily fluids going.

There's a few remaining survivors
of the search party that was attacked.
They wanted to at least be uncovered
but many times the size they expected.
indicating that the monster has some strange power of rapid growth.
Exact description was...
The evolution just received.
According to a report not yet confirmed,
a beast of seemingly gigantic proportions
has been sighted lurking in the hills due northeast of town.
City officials have called for military help.
Planes and troops are expected to arrive within the next two hours.
Meanwhile, citizens should take rest within places of safety.
Cellars, farm shelters, as directed by civil defense and military,
are expected to be evacuated.

Just to wait against our steel
A man is real, not made of steel
But the Earth is all we know
We made a plane out of human waste

The beginning was the end
Of everything now
The ape regards his tail
He's stuck on it
It beats until he fails
Half a ghoul and half a god
A man's not made of steel
Twist away, now twist and shout
The Earth, it moves too slow
But the Earth is all we know
We made a plane out of human waste
Just to wait against our steel
A man is real, that's how he feels
The Earth, it moves too slow

Well, that's just great, Bob.
Yeah, congratulations.
Do you know where we are?
Louisiana.
No, I know Louisiana, but...
It's near the border of Texas.
Ah! You see? Texas!
I knew this, eh?
Texas, near!
Remember!
Well, I propose a toast.
Yeah, thank you.
