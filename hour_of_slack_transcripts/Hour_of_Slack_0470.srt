1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
Take off your jackets, your ties, loosen any belts you might have.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,080
Take off your shoes. Make yourself really, really comfortable.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,560
If there's anything at all in your clothing that's tight, loosen it up.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,360
Select a floor that has a rug and spread it.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,900
Bob will begin to move onshore, though, again tonight,

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,400
and spread with it lots of rain, up to 7 inches of rain for the folks in the Carolinas.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,560
For Saturday, a better day. Sunday, a better day still.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,360
Bob will begin to move onshore, though, again tonight.

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,320
Speaking with that pin.

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,020
Let's put that listener on the next show,

11
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,440
and take that listener from the pile over there and drag him over here.

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,520
That's a pretty healthy one over there, Doctor.

13
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,260
Hey, kid. What are you doing?

14
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,400
Oh, yeah? Well, put that down and come here. I got a little something for ya.

15
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,580
If you've got more than two brain cells to rub together,

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,660
you won't believe me when I tell you to listen to the subgenius hour of slack

17
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,120
with your ascended host, the cyborg handyman, Reverend Ivan Stang,

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,660
the lovely Robert Bob Dobbs, and an ectoplasmic cast of billions.

19
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,960
This lively little ongoing saga features exotic humor and skull-powering music

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,540
that will make you feel like you're in a movie.

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,380
This was not only banned in Boston, but used in Newark.

22
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,000
You'll be down on your hands and knees looking for your lost brain

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,320
after just one cat-sterilizing dose-off.

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,620
The subgenius hour of slack.

25
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,260
It's time for God's people to come out of the closets,

26
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,980
out of the churches, and change America.

27
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,460
That I endorse you and what you're doing.

28
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,180
And so the world continued to dance through another war.

29
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,740
And with a murderous song in its heart,

30
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,980
accompanied by the propeller blades,

31
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,000
this benevolent mankind, ha!

32
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,660
Used his greatest intellectual invention of the airplane

33
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:23,260
to deliver one of my greatest, boldest, most spectacular triumphs.

34
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,600
Subgenius Radio Ministry.

35
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,240
Hour of Slack.

36
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,040
Subgenius Radio Ministry.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,920
Welcome, human, to the Hour of Slack.

38
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,760
Of Slack.

39
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,600
Of Slack.

40
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,460
Of Slack.

41
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,460
Applause.

42
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,280
Hallelujah!

43
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,500
Applause.

44
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,700
Exactly.

45
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,240
God is above us all.

46
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,560
Glory to God!

47
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,040
Glory to God!

48
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,940
Glory to God!

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,980
I'm glad you could all make it.

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:12,140
I'd like to now introduce the man who came to host our show.

51
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,360
His illustrious career is known by everyone here,

52
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,220
and we're so glad he could make it.

53
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,940
Ladies and gentlemen, Ivan Stang.

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,360
Ivan Stang.

55
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,680
Oh, sorry.

56
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
That's right, Virgil.

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,420
It's me again, dear friends.

58
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,700
Trying to...

59
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,420
No longer taking the swag out of Swagger, I don't think.

60
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,880
No, nothing like that.

61
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,300
We're going to have a history lesson tonight, folks,

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,140
this time covering the entire story of mankind

63
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,740
and subgenius kind, both, all in one hour.

64
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,980
The story of everything.

65
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,020
Pretty much abridged for use in elementary schools.

66
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,420
The audio collages, which will frame my introductory capsule summation of the universe,

67
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,440
are compiled from three great tape wranglers,

68
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,540
often unheard on the hour of slack,

69
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,580
that being Mr. Zed of the Hidalgo Trading Company,

70
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,100
Dr. Chris Gross,

71
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,920
Erwin Chusett of WFMU in New Jersey,

72
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,860
Inhibiting Factor,

73
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,140
of Chicago, Haiti, and Amsterdam,

74
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,240
Chuck Wurstrom and Arnold Mathis.

75
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,440
They rearranged and added to our tapes,

76
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,500
and we consolidated those with the movie Story of Mankind,

77
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,000
which was shown just this weekend, much to our horror and surprise.

78
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,520
All background music is by Dr. Chris Gross' band, Men in Black.

79
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,200
Now, friends,

80
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,780
the intergalactic civil court of the gods is already in session.

81
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,760
Our only defense as a race is our excuse,

82
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,080
our mighty lawyer, Bob Dobbs.

83
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,400
He died, sort of,

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,020
so that he could defend us in that heavenly trial.

85
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,680
But even his superpowers of persuasion

86
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,380
will be ignored, lest we provide the evidence

87
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,600
to prove our planet not guilty.

88
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,720
Order!

89
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,380
Call the first witness.

90
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,300
Who then speaks for man?

91
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,500
I do. I am the spirit of man.

92
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,860
You may proceed.

93
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,820
Noble sirs,

94
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,660
if we are to be blessed,

95
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,000
we are believers,

96
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,400
and we most certainly are.

97
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,620
Speak for yourself.

98
00:05:59,680 --> 00:05:59,960
I do.

99
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,300
I do indeed.

100
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:03,980
Continue.

101
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,720
And without interruption.

102
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,940
Man was created in the image of God.

103
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,460
But there the similarity ends.

104
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,360
And Jim Baker's PTL television ministry

105
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,880
was the fastest growing phenomenon in religious broadcasting.

106
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,660
I'm sick and tired of hearing about all the things

107
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,000
that the media has to say about the radicals,

108
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,080
and the perverts,

109
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,540
and the liberals,

110
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,240
and the leftists,

111
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,860
and the communists coming out of the closets.

112
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,580
It's time for God's people to come out of the closets,

113
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,620
out of the churches,

114
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,360
and change America.

115
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,540
And change America.

116
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,200
And change America.

117
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,780
Oh, yeah, I feel the power.

118
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,700
Yeah, we want your back, Bob.

119
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,980
Bring some of that crap here.

120
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,920
I said the next time you come by,

121
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,460
bring more pills.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,980
Mortal, not immortal, are we.

123
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,140
Of the flesh, not of the spirit, are we.

124
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,000
Human, not godlike, are we.

125
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,560
But whatever our sins, whatever our shortcomings,

126
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,640
we believe the good deeds done by man on earth

127
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,960
far outweigh the bad.

128
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:22,600
And we believe that the good deeds done by man on earth

129
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:22,600


130
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:22,960
And we believe that the good deeds done by man on earth

131
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,240
are the right to survive.

132
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,600
Objection.

133
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,840
Praise to Bob.

134
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,160
Praise to Slack.

135
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:30,660
Praise to Bob.

136
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:30,660


137
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,440
We can prove the humans are to blame

138
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,280
and that we subgeniuses, for all our sins,

139
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,040
are still the innocent chosen ones.

140
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,420
So let's now get on with our brief overview

141
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,140
of the entire universe and all of time.

142
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,020
The 34 main points.

143
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,380
The, in fact, exactly 34 events

144
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,300
and inventions that really matter

145
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,300
in chronological order.

146
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,940
Number one, first thing that counted,

147
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,240
the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer discovers itself,

148
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,260
then invents God.

149
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,740
Number two, God invents the universe,

150
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,440
Jehovah One, the Exists, and the dinosaurs.

151
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,000
Main event number three,

152
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,320
dinosaurs discover egg laying on dry land,

153
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,820
but lose out to live birth,

154
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,360
establishing the law that what your DNA don't know

155
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,780
can hurt you.

156
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,880
Number four, mammals get bigger.

157
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,240
Number five, God-like ancient astronauts,

158
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,000
the Exists, of course, invent yetis,

159
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,920
or true full-blood subgeniuses.

160
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,320
And also Bob.

161
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,660
Number six, the yetis invent humans.

162
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,300
Number seven, Bob invents food.

163
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,540
Number eight, Bob invents a prop,

164
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,260
followed by money.

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,480
Main event number eight,

166
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,760
humans invent greed and covetousness.

167
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,600
Number nine, God notices,

168
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,880
foresees the implications of all this,

169
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,300
and has Jehovah One immediately banish the Exists.

170
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,880
And also he, or it, instantly devolves

171
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,600
both the yetis and the humans

172
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,340
into two different pathetic simian primates.

173
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,860
Number ten,

174
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,140
the larger gigantopithecines,

175
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,980
which had once been yetis,

176
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,700
deprived of all but their slack,

177
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,800
suddenly discover immortality,

178
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,300
plus the power of invisibility

179
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,280
and absolute truth.

180
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,300
Therefore, they seldom leave the forests

181
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,620
in their slackfulness for the next 60 million years,

182
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,120
except to occasionally seduce

183
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,540
the tree-going human descendants,

184
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,780
who are much smaller monkey-like creatures.

185
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,680
So, uh, the rest of this history

186
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,880
will concern the humans for, uh, quite a while,

187
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,260
in the next, uh, 020 main points or so.

188
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,860
So listen very closely to the collages that follow,

189
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,780
uh, in headphones if possible,

190
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,200
and try to grasp the cumulative meaning

191
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,360
of what you're hearing,

192
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,020
so that you can discern

193
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,860
what your personal instructions may be.

194
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,600
At the end of the hour, friend,

195
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,500
I pray, I pray that you'll know

196
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,140
what to do.

197
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,120
And we can help you.

198
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,840
Just call the station,

199
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,280
ask to speak to the Will of Dobbs,

200
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,160
and, uh, uh, we'll fill you in on, uh,

201
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,980
on what we can, what we can.

202
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,740
Of course, the best thing to do is write

203
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,620
the Church of the Subgenius for information

204
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,720
at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

205
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,160
We'll be giving that number again

206
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,000
at the end of the broadcast.

207
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,420
Thank you.

208
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,500
Uh, okay, that's it for Stupid Human Tricks.

209
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,940
Boy, what a curious,

210
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:48,840
uh, gentleman tonight.

211
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,080
That's not Bob.

212
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,780
No, it's Bob.

213
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,900
Where's Bob?

214
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,700
There's Bob.

215
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,160
He's hiding.

216
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,520
Let's go, let's go after Bob.

217
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Let's run after him.

218
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,940
Good job, Bob!

219
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,760
Oh, not again.

220
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,100
Well, I'll kiss every one of them!

221
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,160
All right.

222
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:08,700
Oh!

223
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,800
That could get to him

224
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,780
and touch him.

225
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,200
Never look at the job

226
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,240
in saying that this dead man

227
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,620
is going to be a half an hour late.

228
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,260
Are you sitting comfortably?

229
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,060


230
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,600
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

231
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,400
Whatcha bout?

232
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,720
Whatcha bout?

233
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,920
Whatcha bout?

234
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,080
Whatcha bout?

235
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,260
Whatcha bout?

236
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,440
Whatcha bout?

237
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,900
Whatcha bout?

238
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm trying to stretch my mouth, lad.

239
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,940
Whatcha bout?

240
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,400
I just can't reach it.

241
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,320
Whatcha bout?

242
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,100
Whatcha bout?

243
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,460
Whatcha bout?

244
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,120
Whatcha bout?

245
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,100
Whatcha bout?

246
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,960
I said I gotta stretch my bowel gland.

247
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,760
Whatcha bout?

248
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,160
I enjoyed the hell out of that.

249
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,340
You know, the doctor music trend

250
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,300
and anti-music has a lot to do with noise,

251
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,200
not music, too.

252
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:07,860
Hey!

253
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:08,760
Hey!

254
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,120


255
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,740
Hey!

256
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
I know, but the problem with doctor bands

257
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,500
and anti-music bands is sooner or later,

258
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,340
they learn how to play those instruments.

259
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,060
instruments.

260
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,360
All right, you're going to wake yourself up.

261
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:40,980
Yes, it's when the person gets on stage and lets Bob speak through it and just cuts

262
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,200
loose, it's the living tongue acting on the...

263
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,240
Exactly, it's the undirected energy of Bob spewing forth through the human carcass.

264
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,680
Satanic cults.

265
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,740
Play for us, please.

266
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:57,000
Police have found no proof, made no arrest, but that's no surprise, for nationwide police

267
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,720
are hearing strikingly similar horror stories, and not one has ever been proved.

268
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,040
But she kept getting nastier and nastier and nastier, and I finally just went...

269
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,360
I just had had enough, and I just started going, well, I'll just have to control your

270
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,800
soul.

271
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,120
What have you done to it?

272
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
What have you done to its eyes?

273
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,480
What have you done to him, you maniac?

274
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,480
People come first.

275
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,780
It's the way some people interpret the Bible, the book of Revelations, where it's written,

276
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,180
Satan can be identified by the number 666.

277
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,840
Bob's 999 is not an upside down 666.

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,020
It is the opposite of 666.

279
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,640
I'm sorry.

280
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:43,780
I'm sorry.

281
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,140
I'm sorry.

282
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,640
So, or not exactly the opposite.

283
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,240
It's not, he ain't, you know, Bob ain't Jesus.

284
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:56,560
He's just, uh, but he is certainly the anti-antichrist.

285
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,780
There was a routine inquiry which didn't discover what was going on here.

286
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:13,700
We inherited the earth and were blessed with certain rare gifts, an opposable thumb, with

287
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,940
which to build tools and weapons for survival, the capacity to speak, to think, to reason,

288
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,660
the ability to walk erect on two solid arches.

289
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,900
We were fruitful.

290
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,980
We multiplied.

291
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,060
We were resourceful.

292
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,820
We replenished the earth and subdued it.

293
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
These were the covenants.

294
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,320
These we fulfilled.

295
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,640
Unfortunately for me, you broke all of the Ten Commandments doing it.

296
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,780
I'm sorry.

297
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:43,780


298
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:43,780


299
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:43,780


300
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,100
Call the大ge.

301
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,460
Order in the court.

302
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,160
And so, the trial of man continues.

303
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:00,900
The gods will be reviewing these same main events in the history of man and subgenius

304
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,180
kind.

305
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:10,860
The 11th major event was when the once human, uh, and human to be again, uh, little ape-like

306
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,780
creature, pith extantriocus, reinvents the human humanity.

307
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:13,780


308
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:24,380
bipedal locomotion. Twelve, later the Australopithecines reinvent tools. Thirteen, Homo erectus masters

309
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:31,220
fire and reinvents language. Now all of those happened in Africa, so one might say that

310
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:41,160
the Africans invented walking, opposable thumbs, tool using, fire, and speech. The Neanderthals

311
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,360
then, number fifteen, rediscovered sex, superstition, and even rational thought as we know them

312
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:58,500
today. Number sixteen, the Cro-Magnon man discovers lying, drugs, war, rape, torture,

313
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:08,400
racism, genocide, pollution, and of course, the conspiracy. Number seventeen, women perfect

314
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,720
the secret laws of status.

315
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:18,560
And other methods of psychological control. Eighteen, the Sumerians develop money, cities,

316
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,200
and dirty jokes.

317
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,960
Order in the court.

318
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,800
There is one piece of evidence already referred to which has not been placed on exhibition.

319
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,660
The Bible.

320
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,240
Objection. That book has no place in this trial and no bearing on its outcome.

321
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,100
Objection overruled. Proceed.

322
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:48,500
The wicked worketh a deceitful work, but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a

323
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,780
sure reward. My lords, I rest my case.

324
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,960
Oh, not a very good place to rest a case, actually.

325
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:08,640
Nineteen, the Egyptians established the rudiments of work, income, sacrifice, and slavery. Number

326
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,140
twenty, the Chinese invent war.

327
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,980
Writing, philosophy, and military world conquest.

328
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:22,920
Twenty-one, fashion and pornography appear in India, which the Greeks later develop into

329
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:28,340
art, math, science, and unfortunately for them, nonviolence.

330
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,100
The Aztecs discover psychedelics.

331
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,700
Number twenty-two, as well as the concept of time, and unfortunately for them, again,

332
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,680
hospitality.

333
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:48,220
Twenty-three, the Japanese perfect international trade techniques, as well as unbreakable social

334
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,460
divisions based on income, honor, and machismo.

335
00:17:53,080 --> 00:18:01,680
Number twenty-four, the Jews perfect the first formula for a self-perpetuating and snuff-proof

336
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,380
religion.

337
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,140
Number twenty-five, the Romans perfect partying.

338
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,660
The Jews perfect the first formula for a self-perpetuating and snuff-proof religion.

339
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,040
This, of course, wasapa, who dedicated his life to worship God.

340
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,040


341
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:23,900
a mon ayuda de obediencia Gioserre that contributed to the development of charge at which he

342
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:30,340
spent his엔or, the last when he became an русin.

343
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:37,860
Number twenty-six, the Muslim land became the center of the human-human history.

344
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,280
The Anglo-Saxon Empire arrived much earlier than before.

345
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,640
It was under Berlioz' rule that Rome and quota were first understood as between Europe

346
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,660
The Knights Templar and other secret societies are invented by what are now human yeti half-breed

347
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:53,060
priests of geniuses formed in order to battle the conspiracy through disorganization.

348
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:01,480
28. The Arabs invent evangelical fundamentalism and discover the ultimate life or death forms of

349
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:09,360
haggling. 29. Russia creates the first foolproof government which can survive unchanged no matter

350
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:18,940
how often it is overthrown. And who overthrows it? It always remains just as it was. Number 30.

351
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:26,180
The English invent manners, escapist entertainment, modern pinkness, and the formula for linguistic

352
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,060
economic world conquest. 31.

353
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,460
This is the first time the British have invented a new form of government. The British have invented

354
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:31,460


355
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:31,460


356
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,840
a little-known one. 32. American Indians introduce tobacco to the invading whites,

357
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:45,220
initiating revenge through long-term biological warfare. 33. And we'll come back to the last

358
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:51,400
three or four most important events in the history of man and subgenius kind.

359
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:59,960
The last three having taken place in only the last hundred years or so.

360
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:09,560
34. In the matter of the story of mankind, this high tribunal has weighed most carefully

361
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:18,640
the good of man against his evil and finds that man is as evil as he is good.

362
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:28,120
35. Did you hear what he was saying? Did you hear what he was saying? I don't like that last sound.

363
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,320
36. The

364
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:41,300
Lord is my shepherd. 37. No, that won't do.

365
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:48,760
38. All right, close your eyes, please. And repeat this prayer after me, right out loud.

366
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,420
39.

367
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,580
40.

368
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,860
41.

369
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,340
42.

370
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,340


371
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,920
44.

372
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,160
45.

373
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,360
46.

374
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,360


375
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,360


376
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,440
49.

377
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:55,440

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,600

00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:56,600


380
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:56,600


381
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:56,600


382
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:56,660

383

472
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,280

40.

478
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,340
They have all types of perversion going on.

479
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,540
America is being affected.

480
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,200
I am not a piece of...

481
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,480
What are you smiling about?

482
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,200
Order me that six more demerits.

483
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,760
All of them were investigated by police, but usually without much result.

484
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,100
I hate that old demon.

485
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,180
Like just yesterday, I went to the store to buy shoes for my children.

486
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,560
And I was driving home, and it seemed like a force that came over me.

487
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,040
And when I woke, the shoes were gone.

488
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,320
And there was three empty blind bottles in the back of the back seat.

489
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,840
We stress it's perfectly legal.

490
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,140
And these are typical commercial outlets you'll find just about anywhere.

491
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:50,200
I think it is pretty sick in America when they're selling this junk over the counters

492
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,060
and it's done.

493
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,180
It's probably sick when Christians give their kiddies money to buy this stuff.

494
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,780
What would you do if Jesus walked into some of those homes of all the Protestant movement

495
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,840
and lo and behold, guess what's in the bedroom, friend?

496
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,660
The rapture is not going to be overcrowded.

497
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,840
I don't think we're going to have a traffic jam getting up to heaven.

498
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,320
What we need is to get them prayed through down here.

499
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:13,840
Amen?

500
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,900
When they're crawling through their radioactive rubble with their fingers falling out

501
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,160
looking for something,

502
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,860
a battery for their tape ditch or their flash box,

503
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,540
oh, then they want to get back to Bob.

504
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,760
Then they're going, oh, I got my $20 reference tag.

505
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,120
Where's that book of the subgenius that tell me what to do at a time like this, eh?

506
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,920
If you start listening for something, you're likely to hear it.

507
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,560
The symbolism is all there.

508
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,900
In a bookstore, my friend hit the shelf and a book fell out, and I caught it.

509
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,420
And it had a pretty weird-looking guy on the back.

510
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,720
It might be like the smile face of the 90s.

511
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,260
The baptism of the mighty fist face of Bob.

512
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:09,960
The face that can pile through eight-foot-thick titanium steel conspiracy Fort Knox doors.

513
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,840
The face that can burn through metal with that mighty pipe.

514
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,260
And I believe that that had a lot to do with it.

515
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,620
We can get a glimpse of his theories and his rituals in this 1970s,

516
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,880
documentary.

517
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,400
World of the future.

518
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:43,160
Yes, this bustling world of a thousand moods reflects the dreams of its ambitious inhabitants,

519
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,600
dreams already realized of man's triumph over nature.

520
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,160
First of all, just on their face value, they sound so good.

521
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,160


522
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,160


523
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,280
It's so unusual or bizarre that most people hearing that message really don't think that it's true.

524
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,840
If you start listening for something, you're likely to hear it.

525
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,880
He listened to the tape backwards, too.

526
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,300
Yeah.

527
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,380
I might have heard different things if you'd given me different phrases.

528
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,040
But did you like it?

529
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,100
Yes, Dear Friends.

530
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,980
Recent history has had the three most important of the 34 important developments.

531
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,860
Number 32.

532
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:51,140
Due to previously incompatible races being forced together in mutual exploitation in the New and rusty

533
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,140


534
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,140


535
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,140


536
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,140


537
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,140


538
00:25:51,160 --> 00:26:00,060
world, America refined showbiz, rock and roll, television, and double talk to an unprecedented

539
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,220
pinnacle, culminating incidentally in this show.

540
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:10,760
And with advances in communications, American false slack became the top world commodity.

541
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:21,580
Thus, the 365th Bob was finally for once born in the right place at the right time to bring

542
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,720
mankind the ultimate sales pitch.

543
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,440
Number 33, through Bob, subgeniuses rediscovered true slack.

544
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:38,860
Number 34, and this one brings us up to the present day, Doctors for Bob rediscover the

545
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,740
bleeding head of Arnold Pond.

546
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,680
And the next, number 35, what will it be, my friend?

547
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,760
Will it be that the world discovers Bob?

548
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,980
According to Bob's word, it will be anyway.

549
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,000
That had better be what happens.

550
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,760
Tonight's program is sponsored in part by the Athener Bookstore.

551
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,720
This is Ralph Fielding Snell on Dinosaur Island.

552
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,780
Hey Ralph, let's get off this island.

553
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,980
I would if I could.

554
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,580
Look, do you think these tickets are any good?

555
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,740
I paid a fortune for them.

556
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,500
Yeah, let's just get down to the airport and get out of here.

557
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,860
Well, look at that.

558
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,740
Clumsy, slimy, slimy.

559
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:40,740


560
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:40,740


561
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:40,740


562
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:40,740


563
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:40,740


564
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:40,740


565
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:40,740


566
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:40,740


567
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:40,740


568
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:40,740


569
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:40,740


570
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:40,740


571
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:40,740


572
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,360
Now, the cascade of dinosaurs towards the flaming waterfall is...

573
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:46,460
Oh?

574
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:46,860
Yes?

575
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,360
Are we still on Dinosaur Island?

576
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,800
Yes, this is Dinosaur Island base.

577
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,200
Oh, the base, eh?

578
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,660
What kind of people security kind of thing do you do?

579
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:01,960
Well, you see they all seem to be subscribers to the ancient custom of the moradito, the

580
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,900
bribe, the bite.

581
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,420
And when some of these big babies bite you, there ain't much left.

582
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,020
Yes, the giant jaw is gone.

583
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,720
Move, done, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, nine, ten, nine, ten, ten, nine, ten.

584
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:10,720


585
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:10,720


586
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:10,720


587
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:10,720


588
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,480
segmented legs through the primeval force.

589
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:20,000
Its carapace was made out of Echidna light, and its serine effect resembled the Adirondacks

590
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,800
or a similar chain of rock-balmed mountains.

591
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,380
Dwarf skin-blown toenails depressed the paleozoic earth, causing the tracks of the beast to

592
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,760
spread in a straight line from station to siding.

593
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:39,200
Finally, these prehistoric coprolites are extracted by a tractor in the Russian wastes

594
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,140
of Siberia and used as doors by an indignant population.

595
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:50,860
Thus we see the evolution of a stone, older than the pyramids of Egypt, but even more

596
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,700
undistinguished.

597
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,740
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?

598
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,280
I know.

599
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,040
I do.

600
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,620
What about you?

601
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:04,700
An enormous skin-blown toenail depressed the paleozoic earth, causing the tracks of the

602
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,020
beast to spread in a straight line from station to siding.

603
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,920
Yes, dear friends, even the dinosaur stations were not as horrible as this.

604
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,780
But then there came Bob, friends.

605
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,140
In fact, he may come again.

606
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,860
You could see him at any moment.

607
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,680
You know that, don't you?

608
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,640
You could meet Bob tonight.

609
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,600
Hey, everybody, look who's here.

610
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,720
Murderer maniac.

611
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,680
Rapist, pervert, matricide, arsonist, bigamist, and sometimes accomplished musician and singer

612
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,220
for all social occasions.

613
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,720
How can they speak of Bob that way?

614
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,320
Don't listen to the devil, my friend.

615
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,720
Don't listen to him!

616
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,760
Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.

617
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,780
Blessed are the meek.

618
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,720
For they shall inherit the earth.

619
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,960
Don't listen to crazy people either.

620
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,340
Who are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake?

621
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,940
Dead are they who serve not Bob.

622
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,840
You've made it.

623
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,540
You've made it.

624
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,980
And we've made it to 1984.

625
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,500
And beyond.

626
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,500
And who knows?

627
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,980
Who knows what future lingers just around the corner for you and I?

628
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,700
Considering what's happened in the past.

629
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,640
What hap- what happened before.

630
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,940
There's no telling.

631
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,760
But I know, I know in my heart, that sooner or later, no matter how long we have to wait,

632
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,660
he shall return.

633
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,660
Yes, he who is framed in quotes.

634
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:57,980
Ah.

635
00:30:59,300 --> 00:30:59,940
Our...

636
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,800
Our highly-bobbed J.R. Bob-Dobbs.

637
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,080
A secret report within the Guild.

638
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,800
Maybe this is the news now.

639
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,600
I see him walking down the road now.

640
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,060
I see that smile light up the street.

641
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,340
I see a trail of smoke behind him.

642
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,180
And a trail of money too.

643
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,740
Yeah, he'll be back someday.

644
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,560
Soon.

645
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,140
Someday.

646
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,880
Promo.

647
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,040
For the J.R. Don Nico, Bob-Dobbs.

648
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:04,260
Bob espe 유발 확인은 위염 because of dose drug overdose.

00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,060
나 traveled 전자 pig 사용 Aqui entreventa en dia principle

650
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:16,640
How can we tell whether a gospel is the true gospel or not?

651
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:24,000
Now we come to the next gift, diverse different kinds of tongues, the Old Testament.

652
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,600
And that, of course, is just not true.

653
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,300
That is not true at all.

654
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,940
We are running the risk of blaspheming the Holy Spirit.

655
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:44,980
In verse 22, or in verse, yes, in verse 22.

656
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:52,920
I haven't really made up my mind if one way or the other is acceptable or not.

657
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,280
We better trust the Bible and not the note in the margin.

658
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:03,400
With absolutely no biblical validation and with a total mistrust of what the Bible teaches.

659
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,920
And everything begins to feel...

660
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,960
I would feel very holy and I would see what I thought was the Lord Jesus.

661
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,000
And he would begin to speak to me from the Bible.

662
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,200
What could that be?

663
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:22,920
We know this happens through Ouija boards and tarot cards and haunted houses and that kind of thing.

664
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:29,080
Coming to the Lord Jesus Christ this and the Lord Jesus Christ that.

665
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,480
It may be simply that we're hallucinating.

666
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,040
Or that we had the...

667
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,500
Have the...

668
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:35,840
The...

669
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,200
We have...

670
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,840
You know, our minds are very tricky and it may be playing tricks on us.

671
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,500
Because he comes...

672
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,200
He comes...

673
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,160
Break?

674
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,400
We want to be...

675
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,500
We want to have no interest in that kind of activity.

676
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,160
Or...

677
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,160
Or...

678
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,120
And...

679
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,720
And...

680
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,060
Or...

681
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,180
Let me...

682
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,520
Let me give a modern day illustration.

683
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,480
57.

684
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,420
Or...

685
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,100
Or 40...

686
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,480
What is that, Luke 9?

687
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,740
57 and 62.

688
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,300
Verse 57.

689
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,020
Or...

690
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,720
Or 40...

691
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,060
What is that, Luke 9?

692
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,360
57 and 62.

693
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,880
Verse 57.

694
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,600
Or...

695
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,300
Or 40...

696
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,640
What is that, Luke 9?

697
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,940
57 and 62.

698
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,660
Verse...

699
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,940
By and by in the sky we'll maybe get there someday.

700
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,300
Now, this...

701
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,320
As we have said, this is one of the...

702
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,440
One of the more interesting...

703
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:05,820
One of the more interesting...

704
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,180
and wide-ranging forms of musical induction.

705
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,100
Another one, known to the ancients,

706
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:15,900
is the application of hot irons to the area of the back.

707
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,300
Now, science has since shown

708
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,380
that heat is an accelerated motion of the molecules.

709
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,680
Someone with hot irons on his back

710
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,380
goes through accelerated motions.

711
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,900
Doctors for doctors and Bob for doctors.

712
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,240
Let's go bobbing for doctors.

713
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,260
Put the doctors in the pan here.

714
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,560
Stick your head under and keep it there

715
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,940
while you get doctors.

716
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,420
If you find a piece under your bed,

717
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,380
then there must be something wrong

718
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,220
because the person who stole them

719
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,060
didn't put them under anyone's bed.

720
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,540
Although these stones are rumored to be semi-alive

721
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,740
and to move around

722
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,120
and just turn up in the oddest places you could imagine,

723
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,100
like at WFME.

724
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:04,520
Newark.

725
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,680
And it's only 20 minutes before 6 o'clock.

726
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,200
But not...

727
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,320
That is sort of a contradictory statement

728
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,820
because it might not actually be 6 o'clock.

729
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,760
I mean, look at your watch.

730
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,320
I mean...

731
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,500
Magazine of the year, which is very hard to read

732
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,120
because it just sort of floats away

733
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,680
and you can't print on it.

734
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,720
You know, it's really no point in doing it.

735
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,620
What do they care?

736
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,140
Yeehaw, that's what they said.

737
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

738
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,960
It may be the one thing capable of saving this cockeyed world,

739
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,160
yet you sit back there on your fat hoax

740
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,100
and tell me you'll kill it if you can't use it.

741
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,660
Well, you go ahead and try.

742
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,040
You couldn't do it in a million years

743
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,880
with all your radio stations and all your power

744
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,800
because it's bigger than whether I'm a fake.

745
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,280
It's bigger than your ambitions.

746
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,640
It is bigger than all the bracelets and flint coats in the world.

747
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,740
You bet it is, John.

748
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,880
And that's exactly what I'm going down there to tell those people.

749
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,640
Our party, our political party,

750
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,020
needs to start on the full Patreon site.

751
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,540
Anarcho-materialism.

752
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,160
Anarchic and materialistic.

753
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,500
Every yard a kingdom.

754
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,060
And my friend, every dog and child a serf.

755
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,480
This allows for diversity

756
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,020
from conservatives to the most frightening perverts

757
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,960
like Bob himself.

758
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,460
Gee, I can't wait till that Bob time train

759
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,840
comes around the bend.

760
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,280
Oh, look out, son.

761
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,800
Here it comes now.

762
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,860
Here it comes.

763
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,460
Here it comes.

764
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,040
It's the most important thing you say about a practice.

765
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,560
We got another number.

766
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,100
Three, two, one.

767
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:11,880
Big!

768
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:11,880


769
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,880
You couldn't tell him because he's a million and one things.

770
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,160
He's Mr. Big and Mr. Small.

771
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,400
He's simple and he's wise.

772
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,100
He's inherently honest, but he's got a streak of license in his heart.

773
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,340
He's seldom walked up to a public telephone

774
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,280
without shoving his finger into the slot

775
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,020
to see if somebody left a nickel there.

776
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:31,560
Big!

777
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:33,580
Big!

778
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,060
Big!

779
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,100
Big!

780
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:34,220
Big!

781
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:34,220


782
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:55,480
The monitors are your friends.

783
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,680
Depend on the monitors.

784
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,920
Work for peace.

785
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,260
Bob loves you.

786
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,540
Violence solves nothing.

787
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,720
Bob loves you.

788
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,220
The monitors bring peace.

789
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,380
Bob loves you.

790
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,480
Peace brings happiness.

791
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,200
James, stop this crazy thing!

792
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,200
James, stop this crazy thing!

793
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,180
James, stop this crazy thing!

794
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,320
James, stop this crazy thing!

795
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,540
Friends, it's true.

796
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,920
It's so true.

797
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,220
Sometimes you just...

798
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,460
You just want it all to stop.

799
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,400
You want all of...

800
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,860
You want history to just...

801
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,060
Get slack for a second.

802
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,740
For the bad news to quit happening.

803
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,100
For this show to stop above all.

804
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,900
The only way you can do that is to keep pledging.

805
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,700
Pay us to quit.

806
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,480
James, stop this crazy thing!

807
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,100
Trouble, I'm getting out.

808
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,680
And out of the same chaos came the breathtaking architecture

809
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,540
of the Lombardos, the dazzling art of Titian and Michelangelo,

810
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,140
and the free thought of the individual,

811
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:15,820
as so beautifully expressed by Tellezio, Machiavelli, and Campanella.

812
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,760
Is it to mankind's credit that he enshrines this alleged genius

813
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,140
who envisioned atomic destruction?

814
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,880
Can my colleague answer that?

815
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,560
Furthermore, can you deny the great influence

816
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,840
that such daring dreamers exerted on...

817
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,580
on...

818
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,840
Venturesome people like...

819
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,080
Like Christopher Columbus?

820
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,220
Boom!

821
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:38,900
No more ship.

822
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,240
Columbus showed the way, and mankind followed.

823
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,720
I concede the point, but to what end?

824
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,780
Murder? Pillage? Rape?

825
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:53,320
Does my noble colleague remember what happened within 30 years

826
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,960
after Columbus showed benevolent mankind the way to the new world?

827
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:02,760
Have you too quickly forgotten the slaughter of the Aztecs by Cortes?

828
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:10,620
This violent pattern set by the bloodthirsty Cortez all in all turned out to be one of my better jobs.

829
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,780
The slaughter of the new world was endless, but delightful.

830
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,560
They begin creeping up on you, trying to sell you something.

831
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,920
They get long claws, and they get a stranglehold on you.

832
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,740
And you squirm and you duck and you holler and you try to push them away, but you haven't got a chance. They gut you.

833
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,760
First thing you know, you own things. The car, for instance.

834
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,940
Now your whole life is messed up with a lot more stuff.

835
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:54,260
You get license fees and number plates and gas and oil and taxes and insurance and identification cards and letters and bills and flat tires and dents and traffic tickets and motorcycle cops and courtrooms and lawyers and fines and a million and one other things.

836
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,880
And what happens?

837
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,720
You're not the free and happy guy you used to be.

838
00:41:59,720 --> 00:41:59,720


839
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,800
You gotta have money to pay for all those things.

840
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,460
So you go after what the other fellas got.

841
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,800
And there you are. You're a helot yourself.

842
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,960
You win, Colonel. Here, take the fifty.

843
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,560
And go out and get rid of it.

844
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:20,400
You bet I will, just as fast as I can. I'm gonna get some canned goods, a fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.

845
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,660
Give away?

846
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,480
Hey, get me a pitcher's glove. I gotta get some practice.

847
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,140
Say, he's giving it away. I'm gonna get me some of that.

848
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:29,420
Hey!

849
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,100
Come back here, you helot.

850
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,820
Is that you going through there, Musgrave?

851
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:42,140
Now, why in the world would I be going through there, the dog?

852
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,920
Tevis, why do you hate Bob?

853
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,840
Because I hate him, hate him.

854
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,720
Bob is on your side.

855
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,140
Bob wants to make you rich.

856
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,260
I hate him, hate him, hate him.

857
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,900
Bob wants to give you slack, child.

858
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,800
I hate him, hate him, hate him.

859
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,040
I just don't understand the values of young people nowadays.

860
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,620
Hello, this is your Smith show.

861
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,320
And gin.

862
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,580
Oh, man.

863
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,140
Next time you learn, you shouldn't do that.

864
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,420
You shouldn't do that. You know?

865
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,560
Even though it feels good.

866
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,120
Even though it feels good.

867
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,460
Don't do it next time.

868
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,060
Don't do it next time, okay?

869
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,320
Stop hooking.

870
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,280
Stop hooking.

871
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:33,680
Get your booger.

872
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,800
Get your booger.

873
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,760
Tomorrow is a day for a morning horse.

874
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,740
Hold it. Hold it, Tevis.

875
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,140
What if Bob came to the door right now and rang the doorbell,

876
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,480
and you opened the door and Bob himself was standing there with his pipe hanging out of his mouth?

877
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,600
You wouldn't let him in?

878
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,500
If he was shivering out there in the cold?

879
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,940
If Bob came to hand you a check for a million dollars, would you let him in?

880
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:00,360
No.

881
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,080
Why?

882
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,100
Because I hate him, hate him, hate him.

883
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,980
It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood.

884
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,760
Hello, Mr. Rogers.

885
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:12,780
Hi.

886
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,360
Oh, Mr. Rogers, look at my new panties.

887
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,200
Mr. Rogers, what are you going to talk about today?

888
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,480
Mr. Rogers, what are you going to talk about today?

889
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,720
What's hanging out of you?

890
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,540
Oh, forget it.

891
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,780
I'm not supposed to talk about that on TV.

892
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,980
Mr. Rogers, Mr. Rogers, that's your wife's dress you're putting on, Mr. Rogers.

893
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,300
No, no, no, you got the wrong thing out of the closet, Mr. Rogers.

894
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,880
Mr. Rogers spanked me there in that special way.

895
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,740
Ha, ha, ha.

896
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,040
We smell Bob.

897
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,360
We smell Bob.

898
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,340
We smell Bob.

899
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,720
We smell Bob.

900
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,020


901
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,520
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

902
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,880
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

903
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,840
What do these people really believe?

904
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,960
And what does their message mean for the rest of America?

905
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,740
It's a boon to him.

906
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,400
He's going to come.

907
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,200
And we'll eat a boon.

908
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,340
He will bring us life.

909
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,100
You know the great thing about our family is that we're all different.

910
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:28,440
But there is unity in our diversity.

911
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:35,940
My hand and my foot are different, but they belong to the same body.

912
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:46,040
And as long as my hand and my foot are coordinated by my head, this body of mine is a wonderful thing.

913
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:52,080
And here tonight, I'm believing that the Holy Spirit is going to allow me to be a part of this.

914
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:05,240
Because it's easier for me to just show up without my promise.

915
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,220
This is for me.

916
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:11,500
If I say I'm involved in these things.

917
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:11,620
And I show up to live out this reality, there are people who don't have a need to be

918
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:11,620


919
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:11,620


920
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:11,620


921
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:11,620


922
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:16,680
sei the thoroughly into the gospel and and see their path cat.

923
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:16,680


924
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:16,900
You know, it's not just somebody to worship after worship now.

925
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:17,380


926
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:17,800
What do you deserve?

927
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:17,920
Why do they in fact justzy?

928
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:17,920


929
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,280
And accept the life of God just for the sake ofõ

930
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,060
Good, good, good, good, good.

931
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,700
No, I don't want to hear some of that.

932
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,480
Here's the way you want to get started.

933
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,700
Here's the way you want to get started.

934
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:38,080
Good, good, good, good, good.

935
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,600
I don't like it.

936
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,380
I don't like it.

937
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,220
I don't like it here.

938
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,320
I don't l-

939
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,400
The barometer is holding steady, and the skies for us, clear.

940
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,080
But to the south of us, Tropical Storm Bob, no longer a tropical storm.

941
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:04,300
At 5.30 this evening, Bob became the first hurricane of the season.

942
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:08,140
Bob will begin to move onshore though, again tonight.

943
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,700
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

944
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,240
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

945
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,920
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

946
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:16,920


947
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,540
Dr. Crash!

948
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,000
Hey, what's with the gorilla and the chicken?

949
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,240
Madam, I must make my meaning clear.

950
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,620
Peace or war?

951
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,460
Yes, that's it!

952
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:39,180
The only way to control you is to put the brain of this chicken in your head.

953
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:48,300
I have just received word that the warring armies have moved against each other then the law.

954
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


955
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:56,480
planet Earth. And in accordance with the destiny of time, the great Super H-bomb will explode

956
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:07,440
at exactly 11 o'clock. I direct your attention to the great clock of outer space. When the

957
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:15,060
clock strikes 11, the bomb will go off and bring an end to mankind, unless, as such decisions

958
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:23,420
are entrusted to us, we decide that the bomb shall not go off and that mankind shall survive.

959
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:30,120
Therefore, speak quickly, Mr. Scratch, and make your summations brief, for we must make

960
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:35,660
a decision before the clock strikes 11. Speak, Mr. Scratch.

961
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:43,260
My distinguished colleague rests his entire case on the so-called man of tomorrow. By

962
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,040
inference, he almost ignores the fact that the bomb is not going to explode at exactly

963
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,040


964
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,040


965
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,040


966
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,040


967
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,040


968
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,040


969
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,040


970
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,040


971
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,080
11 o'clock. He acknowledges that mankind deserves no better end than annihilation by

972
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:58,940
the Super H-bomb. And yet, weak and sentimental, as is all mankind, he introduces a sentimental

973
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:07,200
trick and hopes to gain the mercy of the court by introducing a pathetic last witness, a

974
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:14,800
child. I accept the challenge, and I shall use as my final summation the very witness

975
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:21,600
brought here by man. I call your attention to the witness, innocently playing with his

976
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:34,080
toys. This is mankind's bright hope of tomorrow, the hope of peace and virtue. Have you seen

977
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:42,000
the toys with which the child plays? A toy gun and a toy sword.

978
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,840
Who cares?

979
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,620
This is the US war between olha and the USA!

980
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,760
SHADOWS CON shelved, 준� employed, JAHRA attached.

981
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,280
Work the

982
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:02,740
partition walls of a fresh, new heaven and a wise end.

983
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,240
Now this way.

984
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:03,240


985
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,980
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

986
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:06,300
Stop!

987
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,600
Oh, beautiful!

988
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,920
Oh, monster!

989
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,040
In order to allow man more time to set his house in order

990
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,640
at the earliest possible date.

991
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,760
Take heed and listen well.

992
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,120
For time runs swiftly.

993
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,760
The fate of man is now laid at the doorstep of man himself.

994
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:43,620
By the villains you encourage, by the heroes you create,

995
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:49,280
you shall soon achieve eternal life or oblivion.

996
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:54,200
Therefore, it is the decision of the High Tribunal of Outer Space.

997
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,340
This court shall soon convene again

998
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,300
to determine finally

999
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:00,740
the fate of man.

1000
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,320
Whether mankind shall continue

1001
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:07,280
or be destroyed by the Super H-bomb.

1002
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:14,480
This choice is entirely up to you.

1003
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,320
Oh, that's right, dear friends.

1004
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,900
It's up to you to us.

1005
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:41,920
We're being judged by the very gods themselves, even now.

1006
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,080
That was a live broadcast.

1007
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,840
From outer space.

1008
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:52,660
And it all hinges on whether Bob can swing that deal with the gods,

1009
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,980
with the exes in 1998.

1010
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,820
But he'll fail.

1011
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,660
He'll fail indeed, unless we cleave to his teachings

1012
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:06,280
and spread subgenius across the globe and outer space itself.

1013
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:06,940
Oh.

1014
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,000
Oh.

1015
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:10,820
Oh.

1016
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:12,100
Oh.

1017
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,480
Oh.

1018
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,320
Oh.

1019
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,980
And you can get more information on the Church of the Subgenius

1020
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:35,100
from the Post Office Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1021
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,780
I'll read that number in a minute.

1022
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,220

something unwholesome about that crisscross

1058
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:37,480


1059
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:37,480


1060
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,800
don't look at it too close up little show

1061
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,400
there's kind of a capacity there for uh

1062
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,100
isolation

1063
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:50,100
yeah we thought we'd get as far away as we could and then give you a call so it's the bad show again

1064
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,920
well good uh we're going to take those chromosomes and dna fragments from

1065
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,140
and mix them all around

1066
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:00,000
somehow mediate a recombination between those two types of uh

1067
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,740
just plop them in the front classroom and let them realign on the wall

1068
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,780
why not why not

1069
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,240
close enough

1070
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,120
so we're gonna we're gonna take the resultant strain and inject it right into that golfer head

1071
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,600
that's the way it got head pub

1072
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,860
no no don't inject the head

1073
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:17,420
you bring it back to unholy life

1074
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:22,620
it started to float nimbus-like over the golf course leaving a trail of sizzling bloody

1075
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,000
hmm it's like a little snail trail

1076
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,880
decomposing tissues to interact with the microorganisms of the soil

1077
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:33,960
as the head floated and levitated along it kept uttering the word why

1078
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,220
and it realized it's true why

1079
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:36,940
it's a tragic loss

1080
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:40,560
the tragedy that it had invented for itself

1081
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,120
and sunk into a depression

1082
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:46,900
mumbling and muttering mindlessly camping with its jaws in a putrescent hole

1083
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,220
well mike you want a wotan tonight

yeah yeah

1086
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,420
we've got to get the dried blood off the walls

1087
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,620
the boyfriend brought a new truck just to drive out there

1088
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,580
well the door's kind of half filmed over

1089
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:02,620
as soon as we get that finished and get the razor cut

1090
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,500
we'll have that piedobecter come on down

1091
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,720
that's going to be a tough job

1092
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,060
we wonder if he shaved the pieces of that piano

1093
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,280
mhm well i think it is important

1094
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,360

1095
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,900

and cough for me

1097
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,660
listen you can hear his neck creaking as it turns

1098
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:19,760
oh that's silly oh i see what that is yeah i wasn't watching the monitor

1099
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,640
just a little

1100
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,060
well uh what kind of hullabaloo are we going to address here then

1101
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:28,000

1102
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,520

1103
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,340

1104
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,800
bleeding divine oracles

1105
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,200
come on that's a pretty unprofessional obsession right there

1106
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,980
well it's true but it's all we got

1107
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,900
well we'll just have to be cartographers of the head

1108
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,840
and it's our duty to explore the wilderness

1109
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,000
artillery like art

1110
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,820
this new grey matter preserve

1111
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,740
just don't look up it's neck stump

1112
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:57,180
you might see something you wish you'd never seen

1113
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,660
it was an ugly sight

1114
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:02,120
that's pretty romantic reverend stang

1115
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,780
yeah i know what you do with that neck stump

1116
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,320
pope sternodoc's kick haver

1117
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,240
well i've

1118
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,140
i know exactly what you've been doing with that neck stump

1119
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:19,560
i've detected the potential many times in the past and have been dazzled by the ill-matched intimidating circumstances that this relationship has provided for me

1120
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:27,960
it's a breath of abnormalcy amidst a normal atmosphere of you know inhaling deeply of the church air

1121
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,000
on the earth

1122
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,780
reverend sterno would you hang on just a second

1123
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,720
fine fine

1124
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,840
we're going to go to the caller hold on

1125
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:33,820
okay

1126
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,280
stop that

1127
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,300
why'd that nasty caller diverted before we could even get our hooks into it

1128
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:52,460
well he's probably trapped in a gas filled tunnel and when he's lifting his head at the scent of that golfer head and we're more and more interested to learn how far this mighty affair might have progressed

1129
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:58,380
might have that's the key i think for you listeners who are collecting clues as i'm often doing this show

1130
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:04,760
might have is the grass band caller that would have found the other side of the earth

1131
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,640
to be a possibility the clues are buried in the show

1132
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,500
but that board slid up like a christmas tree commander

1133
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:16,880
well the character and climate of the show no doubt have exerted a slight influence on his actions

1134
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,820
a tidal influence we would say
