1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:08,720
From the lost monasteries of ancient Tibet, amid the snow-capped Himalayan mountains,

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,620
comes the secret healing part of the subgenius power of the SWAT.

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,580
I have a holy table with pictures on it of Buddha and Christ and Maharaji, my guru.

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,120
I now have replaced him with Bob, and so in the morning I say,

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:38,460
I say, good morning Christ, hello Buddha, good morning Maharaji, hello Bob.

6
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:45,900
And I see how far I have to go yet, because after all, it is merely God in drag who's saying,

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,180
I bet you won't recognize me this way, will you?

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,560
My own first mentor in this field was a Jew.

9
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,800
A gentleman named Bob, who signed me the Koh-i-Mu by mail.

10
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,800
I'm sure that must be some sort of footnote to some sand handle somewhere.

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,720
All of a sudden, I thought to myself,

12
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,580
this holy list of Dalai Lama does not tell people to go to hell,

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,720
because if he did, they would, and he doesn't really want that.

14
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,200
Exactly.

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,140
So I asked Bob, I said, Bob, what did he really say?

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,000
Bob said to me, he said, tell him to eat s**t.

17
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,660
Nothing happened, huh? Nothing happened, Bob.

18
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,720
You didn't know?

19
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,260
That there is no self to realize that there is no, nothing there to be liberated from.

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,260
That's all, huh?

21
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,600
This is what I am. I'm this awareness. I'm not Bob. I'm not Aja per se.

22
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,600
I'm the awareness of Bob and of Aja.

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,420
I have to test it. I have to critically investigate it.

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,200
I have to examine Bob, the Bob-ness in there.

25
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,380
Look for Bob.

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,340
And then, if I don't find the Bob, wow, eureka.

27
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,020
Eureka.

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,280
Eureka. Wait a minute.

29
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,260
I was wrong.

30
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,560
Then, but I might still feel like that, but now I begin to realize that my feeling is an illusion.

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,840
My feeling is a mistake.

32
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,220
So I sort of, I'm self-correcting.

33
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,160
I'm beginning to find my mind.

34
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,600
It's beginning to dissolve under analysis, even as it's looking.

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,120
I begin to take the mind as the path.

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,220
The mind now is looking critically at the false sense of the mind.

37
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,040
And it's not finding it until it's beginning to smell.

38
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,440
Hello, Bob.

39
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,780
Ah, yes, dear friends.

40
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:53,480
That new intro was not by the great Fernand and Andy Lemur, but by a new contributor, Dr.

41
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,320
Fernand.

42
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,040
Phileas O. Fooey.

43
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,500
Or perhaps it's pronounced Phileas O. Fooey.

44
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,940
Fooey with an F.

45
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,740
A new contributor.

46
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:11,060
In fact, we have three new contributors in this particular episode of the Hour of Slack.

47
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,760
In fact, let me tell you what he says about that intro.

48
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,040
He says, it's been 10 years since I joined the church.

49
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,620
And praise Bob, thanks to the Wovid Terror.

50
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,300
I've had time to make some show.

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,940
It's some spiritual teachers mentioning Bob.

52
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:44,180
Dick Alpert, Ken Wilber, Krishna Das, UG Krishnamurti, Adyashanti, and Uma Thurman's dad, Robert Thurman.

53
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,020
He also sent a second track, which I'm about to play.

54
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,300
He says, this is from my ambience.

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:05,460
Ambient Project Transrational Science, with Navy pilot Dave Fravor describing the Tic-Tac UFO he encountered.

56
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,740
Hopefully, it's worthy of the Hour of Slack.

57
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:14,540
I'll send a sacred bribe as soon as the world stops ending or my conspiracy check comes through.

58
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,420
Show forever.

59
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,560
And now this, thanks to Dr. Phileas O. Fooey.

60
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,920
And I'll leave it to everyone to, it's up to you to believe, Bob.

61
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,080
I'll say this.

62
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,400
Bob's a normal guy.

63
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,520
Bob's not crazy.

64
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,900
He's not crazy at all.

65
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,180
Not at all.

66
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,140
That was the weirdest thing about talking to him.

67
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,400
But when you look at it and go, because I had asked Bob, I said, but now we go out and we have these things that are coming at will.

68
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,520
And there's nothing we can do about it.

69
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,980
We don't know what they are.

70
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,380
We have confirmed sighting by two air crew, four of us, two planes.

71
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,300
That said, look, this is not...

72
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,820
This is not an airplane.

73
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,200
This is not a weather balloon.

74
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,340
This is not a blip.

75
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,580
It has performance well beyond.

76
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,520
And then it became aware because it turned and it actually mirrored what was coming down.

77
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,000
It came up.

78
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,380
You know, so it was obviously knew we were there.

79
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,680
And I don't know if it was picking up energy coming off the airplane or what.

80
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,240
You know, I do know that I'm trying to lock it in actively.

81
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,800
It jammed a radar.

82
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,200
It's trying to get a range.

83
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,240
Can't do it.

84
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,080
So when it says ninety nine point nine, the radar cannot see this object.

85
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,340
It cannot see this object.

86
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,300
If literally if something can just shift.

87
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,740
Show up at will and do whatever it wants.

88
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,940
I'd probably at least pay attention.

89
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,100
What if you had the technology?

90
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,300
We still if what Bob says is correct, we still don't understand it.

91
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,140
And how fast would it take us to understand it?

92
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,320
I mean, if it's if it's driven by something that we don't even have on Earth, I think there's more out there.

93
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:50,020
And if I could get word out to anyone, especially the debunkers of one, quit trying to debunk it because it is what it is.

94
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,740
It wasn't a it wasn't a system glitch.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,880
I mean, this was a real incident that happened.

96
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,780
And number two is something our aperture a little bit and start thinking outside of the box.

97
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,740
Technology like that would be a game changer for me.

98
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,500
Completely.

99
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:10,520
I mean, it would literally develop a technology like this and keep it to yourself.

100
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,300
You've got something that no one else has.

101
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,560
And it's a huge leap.

102
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,100
I mean, it's a quantum bomb.

103
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,880
Do you do you share it?

104
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,220
Because it's it's a mankind thing.

105
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,040
Or do you keep it for yourself?

106
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,820
Right now, it's not for me to decide.

107
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,500
I'm just staying.

108
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:34,940
But really impressive to talk to him at the level that you can, which is, you know, for us would be an unclassified level.

109
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,320
But, you know, the stuff that goes on behind closed doors, there's reasons for it.

110
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:47,160
Because if a technology like that got out where someone could rapidly reproduce it after all you've done, you know, they got it first.

111
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,620
You take it to the atomic bomb.

112
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,320
You know, Germans almost had it.

113
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,100
We got it.

114
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,020
Russians were working on it.

115
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,760
We got it first.

116
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,240
We got it.

117
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,880
Change the world.

118
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,600
Literally changing.

119
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,260
I.

120
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,040


121
00:06:59,220 --> 00:06:59,220


122
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,060


123
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:01,840
I.

124
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,220


125
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,060


126
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:05,540


127
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:05,720


128
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:05,720


129
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:05,720


130
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,220
I.

131
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,220


132
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,220


133
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,220


134
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,220


135
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,220


136
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,220


137
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:06,540
I.

138
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:06,620


139
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:06,780
I.

140
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:06,800
I.

141
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,040
I.

142
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,960
I.

143
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,800
I.

144
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,280
I.

145
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,160
After some delay, the White House is now confirming the president is formally endorsing Anne Frank's first cookbook.

146
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,020
Without Trump, Anne Frank's cookbook might not have been published.

147
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,020
Anne Frank's cookbooks on baking children sitting on the PR news pile.

148
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,420
The president says the bill is a way to protect American workers who are willing to work for less PR news.

149
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,100
The Dow 40-20-20-22-22-7-41-3-5.

150
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,580
The Pentagon says this is PR news.

151
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,080
The Pentagon says this is PR news.

152
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,020
The Pentagon says this is PR news.

153
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,740
Join our regularly scheduled program.

154
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,200
No threats have been made.

155
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,960
He's better than that.

156
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,020
Why, you little...

157
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,100
He knows that I know that he can reach out and kill you anytime he wants.

158
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,900
Here, we're out of the country.

159
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,140
And he can.

160
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,860
So your physical presence is enough.

161
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,980
No way, because I'm not dying.

162
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,760
We'll just see about that. Let's go to town hall.

163
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,220
But why does he think a threat to us will keep him safe from you?

164
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,940
Because he knows how much I care for you.

165
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,280
You're a good wife.

166
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,720
Like having a werewolf for a butler.

167
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,840
Let yourself go for a couple of days.

168
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,640
You know, you know.

169
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,320
Live it up.

170
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,800
Well, you all gotta go jump, guys.

171
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,240
.

172
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,180
.

173
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,180


174
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,180


175
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,180


176
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,180


177
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,180


178
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,180


179
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,260
.

180
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:09,840
.

181
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,200

182
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,360

183
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,160
.

184
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,320
.

185
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,400
.

186
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:23,640

187
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:23,800

188
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:23,800


189
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:23,860
.

190
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:23,920

191
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:23,940

192
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:23,980
.

193
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,020
.

194
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,080

195

197
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:24,300
.

198
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,300


199
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,360
.

200
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,360


201
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,360


202
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,400

203
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,400


204
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,400


205
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,500
.

206
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:24,500


207
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:24,820
.

208
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:24,820


209
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:24,840
.

210
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,020
That doesn't sound like a great deal of fun to me, sitting in a hotel room all day going boom.

211
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,100
I'm not bumping right now.

212
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,920
Oh, no, you don't get the idea.

213
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:22,360
I don't get the idea.

214
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,060
Does anyone want to switch seats?

215
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,560
A lot of frame.

216
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,840
Vuba.

217
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,540
Vuba.

218
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,460
Vuba.

219
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,560
Vuba.

220
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:02,960
Vuba.

221
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,700
Vuba.

222
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,380
Vuba.

223
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,860
Are you...

224
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,560
You're alive, good?

225
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,840
Good.

226
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,060
Bye.

227
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,140
My life is fine.

228
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,020
Bye.

229
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:04,920
What?

230
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:07,820
Donuts.

231
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,420
Is there anything they can't do?

232
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,860
Well, my work is done here.

233
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,820
What do you mean?

234
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,820
Your work is done.

235
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,180
Son, you didn't do anything.

236
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,400
Didn't I?

237
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:29,980
You little...

238
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:40,260
Yes, dear friends, this is Hour of Slack number 1778.

239
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,000
And that collage, titled Anatomy of a Sample,

240
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,920
came to us from someone named Sheridan in Cleveland,

241
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,800
who said he or she should have gotten this stuff to us long ago,

242
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,380
and more of that will be forthcoming.

243
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,080
Dave's not here, man.

244
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,020
This is the third day in a row that we plan to do a show together,

245
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,020
but he put it off because he's not feeling so good.

246
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,640
A lot of people are not feeling so good.

247
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,960
I'm fine, and I'll be reading from our out-of-print book,

248
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,900
The Subgenius Cyclopean,

249
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,240
The Subgenius Cyclopean,

250
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,080
and I'll be reading from the Wikipedia of Slack, the bibliographon.

251
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,400
But first I have a little news that will interest about three of you.

252
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,800
My imprisoned sister has the virus,

253
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:38,400
as does pretty much everyone else in any prison in the United States of America.

254
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,560
My dog Buddy got bitten in the face by a rattlesnake.

255
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,680
But he's fine now and almost back to normal.

256
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,560
He would have died for sure,

257
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,020
had we not gotten him rattlesnake vaccinations every year

258
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:01,760
and taken him to the incredibly expensive all-night animal ER in the big city.

259
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,700
Those rattlesnake vaccinations are $120 a shot, but they actually work.

260
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,400
And no, there's no such thing for humes.

261
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,740
He also had to have two anti-venom shots,

262
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,860
which cost $1,000 each.

263
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,520
That would have been $5,000 each if it happened to me or you.

264
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,560
Plus he's in intensive care for three days, or he was.

265
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,460
So, ouch all around.

266
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,760
The important thing is he's still with us and begging for walks.

267
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:46,300
To keep rabbits out of my huge straw bale garden and snakes out of the yard,

268
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,760
I've spent the last three days installing chicken wire along the bottom of my yard.

269
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:50,900
I've spent the last three days installing chicken wire along the bottom of my yard.

270
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,100
His tubes don't actually fit off our livestock fence.

271
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,920
His tubes don't actually fit off our livestock fence.

272
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,500
Yes, I know it.

273
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,060
Yes, I know snakes can climb chicken wire and the small ones can just slither through.

274
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:58,700
yes, I know snakes can climb chicken wire and the small ones can just slither through.

275
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,180
Peers another pair of snake guards.

276
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:12,260
I would order four more pairs but I'm pretty sure the dogs won't wear them.

277
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,000
Here in Glen Rose Texas.

278
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,860
We're the only customers wearing masks in stores,

279
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:27,740
get extra funny looks because we wear masks made from the lower half of a Dobbs head t-shirt.

280
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,700
So you can see our eyes, but our nose and mouth is that of Bob's maniacal grin.

281
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,900
And we also caught somebody selling bootleg Bob masks and shut them down.

282
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:46,180
So far, there hasn't been one known case of Captain Trump's in our little county,

283
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:55,080
but I predict many in three or four months, seeing as how the pew packers are back to packing pews and going to honky-tonks,

284
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:05,180
a surprising number of them seem to believe that people are dying all over the entire globe just to make Trump look bad.

285
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:15,180
And yes, I am tired of winning, winning the contest of country with the most deaths and worst response.

286
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:24,720
Now, being a semi-hermit weirdo artist with a mail order business, living in the woods and married to somebody with a pension,

287
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:33,780
my lifestyle hasn't been affected that much aside from constantly worrying about my sister and a few thousand other subgeniuses who don't have it so good.

288
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,220
Dr. Philo Drummond also lives in the woods and is self-sustaining.

289
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:46,080
And we both literally owe our current safety to that man, Bob.

290
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,200
Praise Bob.

291
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:55,080
Okay, now I'm going to read from the Third Testament, the Bobliagraphon, which was published in 2006

292
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,440
and promptly forgotten when the publisher went out of business for other reasons.

293
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,900
You can still get copies on eBay for about a hundred bucks.

294
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:15,740
I believe I read the first half of the chapter on the conspiracy called Subgenius vs. Them a few hundred shows ago.

295
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,720
So this is the second half of that chapter.

296
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:26,420
Most of it's written by me, Nenslow, and Onan Canobite, interwoven and spliced by me.

297
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:38,260
Let me preface this by saying that I don't consider the current day Republicans and Democrats to be two sides of the same coin.

298
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,700
The Democrats are currently not deliberately pouring poison into their own well,

299
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,140
just in order to make Republican snowflakes upset.

300
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:58,400
The Democrats, even the idiotic extremist ones that are embarrassments to me,

301
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,320
are mostly saying, let's not pour any more poison into any of the wells.

302
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,560
But that attitude seems to be really infuriating to some Republicans who react with,

303
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,080
you can't tell me what to do.

304
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,120
So, okay, pour away.

305
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,620
I have my own well, and it doesn't vote.

306
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,940
But wait, if it doesn't vote, that means it voted for whoever wins.

307
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:26,340
Huh.

308
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,640
Dang.

309
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,180
Incidentally, I got a letter from a listener saying he wasn't going to listen to our slack anymore

310
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,180
because it had become, quote, quote,

311
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,280
The show is becoming unlistenable, unfortunately.

312
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,320
I don't want to hear a senile,

313
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,440
fat lady repeating her ice-cold political opinions week after week.

314
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,680
I get it.

315
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,100
You're fixated on mundane politics.

316
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,620
The Trump obsession is just so boring.

317
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,020
When I hear people talking about him, I just turn it off.

318
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm not going to devote my brain to thinking about a politician each and every waking minute.

319
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,420
I'm kind of thinking maybe he already is.

320
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,460
I thought you were better than that man.

321
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,420
It's sad.

322
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,680
It's sad.

323
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,280
It's sad to hear you align yourself with a dumb American political party.

324
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,960
It's sad because your show has given me a lot of joy over the years.

325
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,460
I'm not feeling that anymore.

326
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,420
Maybe you aren't either.

327
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,360
Anyway, I hope you get over it and get back to being interesting and fun.

328
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,720
Maybe that's impossible.

329
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,740
I don't know.

330
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,540
I responded,

331
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,920
I guess you're lucky you didn't have to pay for it all those decades.

332
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,500
I totally understand and believe.

333
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,420
Believe me, I'm way more tired of doing the damn show than you are of listening to it.

334
00:21:50,480 --> 00:22:09,600
I have literal tons, well, literal pounds of killer old subgenius written and illustrated stuff from the 1990s by many people that came along after publishing got too expensive and before the internet was usable by regular folks.

335
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,520
I would love to get back to that.

336
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,980
Books, in other words.

337
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,500
And that's why every other show.

338
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,060
I know lately has been a really old rerun.

339
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,180
I'm burned out and be the first to admit it.

340
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,180
On the other hand, I'd be a real wuss to just stop doing the show.

341
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:36,900
Your summary of the show seems a bit harsh and agenda laden, but I don't have the slightest idea who or what you are.

342
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,540
And you're not even a subgenius minister.

343
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,320
So I'll have to assume you're pissed off and riled up about something.

344
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,080
Besides,

345
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:52,940
I'm just this college radio show by an old man in the woods in extreme rural small town Texas.

346
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,620
As far as joy goes, I'm feeling plenty of joy.

347
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:03,520
It's just that it doesn't have anything to do with Church of the Subgenius or Fox News or Bernie Bros or Facebook.

348
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:14,120
I'm a junior scientist living and hiking in ancient woods and creeks full of other fossils like myself and studying everything everywhere.

349
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,500
So I'll know.

350
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,800
I'll know a lot before I croak and my whole brain is totally erased.

351
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,620
Sounds like you're the one who's worked up about a dumb American political party.

352
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,920
MAGA!

353
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,220
So there you go.

354
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:37,640
By the way, my sniffling is not due to Covfef 19, but allergies.

355
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,640
We really do live in the woods and it's serious allergy time.

356
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:42,980
Okay.

357
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,280
All right here.

358
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,360
I will get to.

359
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,760
Get to some random here.

360
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,380
Somewhere here.

361
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,900
Here, I'll just start in the middle.

362
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,860
The Soviet Union broke up.

363
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,380
Good.

364
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:03,200
Then by gobs, it's time for the USA to break up into the dis United States and then break up a lot more.

365
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,380
Household sovereignty is what we're talking about.

366
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:14,500
If you study chimpanzees or kindergarten children for a week, politics will suddenly make sense.

367
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,060
You mustn't let petty primate politics bring you down to their level.

368
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Rise above it.

369
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,420
Inflate.

370
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:37,500
Blow yourself up and float placidly high above the middle of the road from whence you can survey how silly they all look.

371
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,900
Here's Nenslow on politics.

372
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,320
This is just Nenslow.

373
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,480
Good day.

374
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:45,600
schon.

375
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:54,140
Nach an ardent

376
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:59,820
Forget it.

377
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,500
So.

378
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,760
It's veryalt.

379
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:04,820
Well.

380
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,240
Oftentimes these ones telling a story.

381
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,080
I like them.

382
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,500
I'll miss it.

383
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,540
Excuse me.

384
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,200
You're welcome.

385
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,860
to guffaw when we run into someone so naive they have to demonstrate that their behavior

386
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,900
is justifiable by using some sort of political ideology.

387
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,260
Politics is the stupidest thing there is.

388
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,660
It was invented by boring nitwits to make each other think they have some sort of control

389
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:43,720
over their lives and circumstances, an utterly idiotic idea that only a total boob would

390
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,820
ever possibly swallow.

391
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:52,860
And anarchism is absolutely the dopiest, drippiest, lamest type of politics, in defense of which

392
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,220
statement we need only remind you that it was invented by the French.

393
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:05,560
No anarchist will ever get the grudging respect of Nenslow without first acknowledging us

394
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:06,960
as king.

395
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,520
So just shut up, all of you.

396
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,320
Nenslow, 1994.

397
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,340
King Nenslow.

398
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,340
King of all the anarchists.

399
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,000
The system is a self-perpetuating idiocracy.

400
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,700
Well, I think this was written before that movie came out.

401
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:37,440
The system is a self-perpetuating idiocracy that utilizes the foolproof, time-worn, good

402
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,700
cop, bad cop technique to convince you that one side of the conspiracy is your own.

403
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:43,700


404
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,240
The other side is your buddy.

405
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:52,880
The big con gives you your own little con enemy to hate, and your own little con friend

406
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,160
to join.

407
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:00,480
It's set up so that we would appear to have only the two basic options, both of them slackless,

408
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,620
and neither of them there for any real reason but to control us.

409
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,960
In theory, the US alone should offer almost 300 million political options.

410
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,160
But, needless to say, they eliminated all of those in order to hide the only possible

411
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,620
correct option, the word of Bob.

412
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:28,280
The terms liberal and conservative are both practically meaningless.

413
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,920
Like Bible passages, they can mean so many different things that they cancel themselves

414
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,080
out in internal contradictions.

415
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:42,940
Each side uses the other, however, as an excuse to remove different contradictions.

416
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:42,940


417
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:42,940


418
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:53,940
And I'll teach you this student who prescribes also does that own most out of detail,

419
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,380
did this great job for many years, and can be a true alien committee supercomputer honor

420
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:55,380


421
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:55,560
Michelle Miller of the outlets of America hepaaraj slapped

422
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,960
you completely on the reasons why the party's social media was so bad.

423
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,140
It's the most obvious thing we can do about others coming to use all of their skinny money.

424
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,640
It's per sie 사건der thatReg Edison himself are set against and sentenced to thrown into

425
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,400
the weapons of tyranny for around year and a quarter of the physical but human malpractice

426
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:05,400


427
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,420
The only time we'll be lucky enough to be humourously let the rules of civil law go

428
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,640
way beyond this.

429
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,860
Here's some more nenzletic political theory.

430
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,420
If you want to see even the most intelligent and clear thinking of your acquaintances suddenly

431
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:30,940
gloss over and begin repeating whatever double or triple reverse conspiracy programming with

432
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,700
which they've been infected, just state the simple facts.

433
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,120
The conspiracy blinds its dupe with a cloud of dreams, makes them think that something

434
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:47,600
other than the profits of multinational corporations even matters in how the world wobbles along.

435
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:54,360
I blame the fraudulent concept of, quote, rights, unquote.

436
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:02,860
Onan once sadly quoted to me the wisest thing his progenitor ever said.

437
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,120
There's no such thing as rights.

438
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,560
There are only privileges temporarily.

439
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,540
Temporarily allowed because the conspiracy cannot at present turn them to profit.

440
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,600
Invisibility is your best defense.

441
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,060
There are three basic levels of conspiracy programming.

442
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,780
I'm going to read those three.

443
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,740
Number one, everything's going pretty well, so don't make waves.

444
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,100
This keeps the vast normal majority quiet.

445
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,760
Number two, everything's totally screwed, so burn it all down.

446
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:46,260
This gets dumbasses to make spectacles of themselves so the riot police know who to

447
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,600
get and club and arrest.

448
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,300
Who to gas and club and arrest.

449
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:01,460
Number three, lots of things are pretty screwed up, but if we work real hard, we can change

450
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,280
the system.

451
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:09,680
This keeps potentially dangerous people busy performing pointless tasks like volunteer

452
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,160
work for third party candidates.

453
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:20,960
And as Nenslow said in 2004, all you need to know is that the people who decide how things

454
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,460
get run put different puppets on stage every once in a while and let the drones have lots

455
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:32,120
of fun thinking they're the ones who decide which puppet it is and that it'll make a big

456
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,740
difference.

457
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,940
There's an illustration here of a snake.

458
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,660
I don't know if you've seen it.

459
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:39,660


460
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:39,660


461
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,100
It's a snake with a pipe saying, I can't tread on you.

462
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,420
And another picture, these are both by Lee Murr.

463
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,960
I am proud to be following orders to protect the hive.

464
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:58,020
My weapons of mass destruction can beat up your weapons of mass destruction.

465
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,560
Divide and conquer works.

466
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:08,700
We should know the countless smaller conspiracies, each with their own target captive audiences,

467
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:14,640
stay so busy fighting among themselves that the good old boys at the top with their pals

468
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,500
in organized crime have nothing to fear.

469
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:24,220
The minorities and weirdos compete against each other while the man laughs and the burning

470
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,060
man burns.

471
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:33,120
But all the while, Bob fropps and laughs, trout fishing from his rowboat of tranquility

472
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,780
in a placid lake.

473
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,680
While back on Wall Street, his assets values scale.

474
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:38,680


475
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:38,680


476
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:38,680


477
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:44,960
He loves sind感 and fish.

478
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,560
Kettle k lohs are long gone.

479
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:46,560


480
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:46,980
sports wrote and conscientious as Bob can be put to good use by people with識

481
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,400
Zai are young people.

482
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,540
Hair so fire insolvent.

483
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,520
So listen, a Dog watering the house gift.

484
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,820
As Bob said, it is QUITE as fun of a possibility.

485
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,520
I understand anybody's based onradDC and I.

486
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:03,520


487
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:03,520


488
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:03,520


489
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,780
That's why you do aTM inです I can eat the HiNc-MGaa d Ipforgsstopp apps for 3 minutes ,

490
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:16,420
According to Dobbs, any politician who does not have a subgenius membership card in its pocket is absolutely not to be trusted.

491
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:24,480
Any politician who has a membership card in its pocket is absolutely not to be trusted.

492
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,780
And here's a picture of a real button that actually exists.

493
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,900
Don't blame me, I voted for Bob.

494
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:41,840
Perhaps the republic goons and the democratins are already engaged in total self-destruction even as we speak.

495
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,780
Wouldn't that be nice?

496
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:50,420
Even so, they'd only be replaced by two more equally treacherous bear traps for suckers.

497
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,440
The refertarian party, maybe, versus the liberform party.

498
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,840
Certainly not patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism.

499
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,160
Anything but that.

500
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,880
Then what?

501
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,740
Then there'd be no conspiracy at all.

502
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:09,280
And if it weren't for the conspiracy, we would be the normals.

503
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:21,580
We, patriopsychotic anarcho-materialists, evangelical free-fropping sex branch, believe in divergity.

504
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,100
Whoever kills the other guy first wins.

505
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,340
Every yard a kingdom.

506
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,880
Just as diversity is essential to a biosphere,

507
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,260
or a porno mag,

508
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:39,180
there must always be liberal and conservative numbskulls to balance each other out.

509
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,520
As long as the great pendulum of history keeps on swinging,

510
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,800
and isn't stuck on one side,

511
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,540
that's a good sign.

512
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,660
The scurrying earth fools seem to require these distractions

513
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:57,280
as they scamper about performing their silly little mammalian puppet acts.

514
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,860
But we must learn to rise above the falseness.

515
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,300
The little conspiracies,

516
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,460
dangled like easy answers before our blinder tubes,

517
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,460
oh our droogies,

518
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,680
there is only one true conspiracy.

519
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,640
The conspiracy of normals.

520
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:23,340
As Bob Dobbs said to Onan Canobite in 1980,

521
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:31,260
How many conspiracies does it take to totally oppress all subgeniuses everywhere?

522
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,080
For all of history?

523
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,320
One.

524
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,160
Mutants must agree to disagree.

525
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:46,000
Mutant A can look the other way when El Presidente conducts secret wars,

526
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,340
loots savings and loans, makes deals with terrorists, etc.

527
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:56,800
And Mutant B can look the other way when El Presidente sneaks out with his illicit girlfriend.

528
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:01,240
But what in the name of God did all those brave soldiers do to get rid of the president?

529
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,160
What did the soldiers die for in all those wars?

530
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:11,840
For the freedom of little old ladies and frustrated eunuchs to castrate everyone who happens to somehow possess normal sexuality?

531
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:19,700
The freedom for crazy fundamentalists to decide what happens behind everybody else's closed bedroom doors?

532
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:28,960
The freedom for huge cartels of American drug dealers to addict children to the most insidious drugs

533
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,460
while destroying the lives of adults who use medications that happen not to be patentable?

534
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:47,340
Did all of those brave soldiers die just so that a secret royal gang of fat, bald, white guys could make yet more money?

535
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:58,940
Well, like those white crosses at Arlington Cemetery spell out when viewed from an airfield,

536
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:04,660
there's plenty more where these came from.

537
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:11,760
And as Uncle Sam says as he points at you from that poster,

538
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,140
I want your money.

539
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:28,800
And the music in the background was from Kenneth Anger's movie Lucifer Rising.

540
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:28,920
And I'm not sure if you've seen it.

541
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:28,920


542
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,080
It's a very, very weird underground movie.

543
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:36,860
Music by Bobby Boussoulet, who's one of the Manson killers.

544
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,420
This was recorded in a prison.

545
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:49,800
And Ken Anger specifically told me in person after I asked not to use this music with anything.

546
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,580
Because it's sacred music that goes just with Lucifer Rising.

547
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,400
But...

548
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,060
Uh...

549
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,400
As Bob asked,

550
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,460
Is anything sacred?

551
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,160
And now this.

552
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,240
Oh.

553
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,160
Hi.

554
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,600
We forgive each other.

555
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,240
Especially not if you don't need to live up to your name.

556
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,240


557
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,240


558
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,940
His sleeping beauty was

559
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,240
getting worse and worse.

560
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,200
This was my hair

561
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:50,200


562
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,240
Anyone who listens to this music

563
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:53,640
will find it is desirous in all rosy android Ontario.

564
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,000
But it's a waste of their own espacio.

565
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,360
But,

566
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:54,580
Yes.

567
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,860
Tell me about the administered abominations in our

568
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:57,860


569
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:06,900
You're talking in circles I don't understand

570
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:15,060
And why is this object you placed in my hand?

571
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:21,040
So you can levitate Since when can you do that?

572
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:28,700
I wish you'd stop it now You're frightening the cat

573
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:36,600
There's shooting laser beams And teleporting too

574
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:44,700
You can do anything I'm very nice to you

575
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,380
You're talking in circles

576
00:38:51,040 --> 00:39:02,240
I don't understand And why is this thing that you placed in my hand?

577
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,120
When you were my lover I knew what to expect

578
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,220
You ate up all my baby bells And never washed your neck

579
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,120
Now your helicopter Is hovering in my drive

580
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,900
I wasn't even sure That you were still alive

581
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:32,800
I'm not even sure That you were still alive

582
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,140
What are you doing here?

583
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,940
That's messing with my head

584
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:48,560
I liked you better when You were a memory instead

585
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,640
I'm not even sure That you were still alive

586
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:58,080
You're talking in circles I don't understand

587
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:06,200
And why is this object you placed in my hand?

588
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,880
You're laughing in wrong points Our lives are unclear

589
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,040
I thought that we had an arrangement

590
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,160
My dear

591
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:31,360
Well, that's yet another new contributor, David Morrison,

592
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,280
with that song, What Are You Doing Here?,

593
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,380
which was mixed by the Rudy Schwartz Project.

594
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,120
How about that?

595
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:47,240
And now, back to 22X Day with Dr. Howe.

596
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,400
I'd also like to point out, as far as the long, torturous, humiliating bus rides,

597
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,200
that's the access to medical care for maybe like 75% of the planet.

598
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,980
Oh, yeah, but that's true.

599
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,720
Actually, the funny thing is, my sister actually knows that.

600
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,380
She's probably one of the few people who actually does understand the conditions in the rest of the world

601
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:16,040
and does know that actually she's got it pretty good.

602
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,220
But it could be a...

603
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,040
A Turkish person.

604
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,000
I was about to ask, so she's been abroad and...

605
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,360
Well, no, you wouldn't go abroad.

606
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,800
She has a little bit, but mainly she's a well-read person.

607
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,960
She's got a scientific background.

608
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,740
With the family, right?

609
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,580
You know, yeah, yeah.

610
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,780
She knows history.

611
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,480
She just finished the Baroque cycle a second time.

612
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,480
I'm on my fourth reading of that.

613
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,640
Well, I was pretty impressed with that.

614
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,600
It's 3,000 pages long.

615
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,720
Oh, the new Neil Stevenson book, Fall, is unbelievable.

616
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:03,840
I hate him so much, I had to buy that book the day I read that it was coming out.

617
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,300
And I got it that day in hardback.

618
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:16,380
And it's really just as great as all his other ones and just as weird.

619
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,220
I hate it.

620
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,220


621
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,220


622
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,220


623
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,220


624
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,220


625
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,220


626
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,220


627
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,220


628
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,220


629
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,220


630
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,220


631
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,220


632
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,220


633
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,220


634
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:17,500
I hate him.

635
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,540
I hate him.

636
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,300
I hate him.

637
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,940
I'm going to cut his fingers off so he can't write anymore.

638
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,240
It has nothing to do with his fingers, dear.

639
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,240
It all happens between his ears.

640
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,100
Well, he claims that he wrote the Baroque cycle with a goose quill pen on paper.

641
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,300
He wrote it longhand.

642
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,600
Yes, but if his fingers were gone, he would find a way to continue writing.

643
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,460
Promise.

644
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,560
He'd dictate it to a eunuch who would write it for him.

645
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,720
Yes, yes, yes.

646
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,220
Speaking of eunuchs, I need a new chimpanzee.

647
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,060
A nutless chimpanzee at the office.

648
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:55,800
The one we've been using, Professor Yeti is wearing out.

649
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,520
He's old.

650
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,480
He's an old guy.

651
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,500
You need a new nutless chimp?

652
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,080
He wears a black Greek fisherman's hat.

653
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,300
A silver muzzle.

654
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,160
Yeah, yeah.

655
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,580
He's the one that makes the membership packs.

656
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,000
You need a new one?

657
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,920
I need a new nutless chimp to do the chimp work.

658
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,220
Actually, the chimp is a chimp.

659
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,020
Chimp work is my favorite part of it.

660
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,180
It's the only time I get to really just listen to stuff for fun.

661
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,240
Yeah, what's with needing a new one?

662
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,360
I thought you liked that part.

663
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:35,860
Well, it was a little tricky doing the 200 memberships last week in three days.

664
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,500
The sudden swell of last minute membership.

665
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,180
My neck is a bit stiff.

666
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,940
I'm a little damaged.

667
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,720
We forgot a few things.

668
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,500
Like a hammer.

669
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,260
And tarps.

670
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,960
And a tablecloth to hide our shame.

671
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,760
To hide our shame.

672
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,540
Really?

673
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,780
We usually do have that.

674
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,300
You know, I've had to get ready.

675
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,380
I've had a pack for X-Day 24 times now.

676
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,240
Not just for X-Day, but usually for X-Day.

677
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,160
Then followed immediately by Starwood.

678
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:16,800
Right.

679
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,660
Well, it didn't used to be that way.

680
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,740
But now they're married.

681
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,600
X-Day and Starwood got married.

682
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:23,740
Yes.

683
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,540
We like it that way.

684
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,200
Sometimes.

685
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,300
Joined ecumenically.

686
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,700
Joined at the festival.

687
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,660
X-Day is a lot easier, you guys.

688
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,840
At the wrists and ankles.

689
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,240
It's a lot easier.

690
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,400
We don't even have to think about insurance.

691
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,960
Or chem toilets.

692
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,700
Or making a profit.

693
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,460
Those things never even enter the picture.

694
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,240
Not anymore.

695
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,380
Or being a prophet, reviled in your own land.

696
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,180
Yes, being a prophet.

697
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,160
I told you not to give me any more pollen.

698
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,800
Oh, I forgot about the pollen.

699
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:02,340
That's right.

700
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,800
Actually, yeah, yeah.

701
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:04,780
Apollonogy.

702
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,040
Yeah, that would be good.

703
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,120
They use it everywhere.

704
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,260
I suppose.

Bye.

713
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,220
Bye.

Bye.

00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,280
Bye.

Bye.

718
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,200
That was The Psychoskeletons.

719
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,140
And now,

00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,620
Thank you.

Thank you.

746
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:28,700
Thank you.

747
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,180
Thank you.

748
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:10,140
Thank you, Sheridan, for that collage.

749
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,160
And friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

750
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,560
If you need more information about the Church

751
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,800
of the Subgenius or anything we've been playing

752
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,760
or pretty much anything ever,

753
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,260
you might look at subgenius.com,

754
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:32,320
which then gives you links to a million Facebook pages.

755
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,580
There are two.

756
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:38,720
The number of Subgenius Facebook pages is too damn high.

757
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,920
For those of you who are imprisoned

758
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,040
and can't get on the Internet or whatever,

759
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,400
you can write to us, request things,

760
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,260
at Post Office Box, well, just make it to Subgenius

761
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:57,920
at Post Office Box 807,

762
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:03,920
Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

763
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:08,040
I inherited the P.O. Box 807.

764
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,340
It used to be my dad's.

765
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,440
And I tried to get 808

766
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,020
because 808 spells bad.

767
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:16,360
I had a little bit of a problem with Bob,

768
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,880
but I couldn't.

769
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,000
Some other Bob had it.

770
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,240
And praise Bob.

771
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,740
Oh, here's some other Subgenius news.

772
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,000
No X Day, no Starwood at Wisteria.

773
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,520
Of course X Day will happen.

774
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,040
The X's know our addresses,

775
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:45,120
and we can rupture at home or go camp out in the woods.

776
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,020
I would say, though, that we're going to have to do that.

777
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,200
So on July 5th at 7 a.m.,

778
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,020
don't be indoors.

779
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,200
If you are a Subgenius minister,

780
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,040
even if it's pouring rain,

781
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,080
make sure there's not a roof over your head

782
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,720
at exactly 7 o'clock.

783
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,880
The way we're lifted up may be more literal

784
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:13,100
than even some Christian fundies think of their rapture.

785
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,100
There may also be decompression

786
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,900
as you rise up into the upper atmosphere,

787
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,340
and you might explode.

788
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,880
But don't worry, don't worry.

789
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,400
You're just, I mean, that's just like casting off an old shoe.

790
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,100
They'll have a new shoe for you

791
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,960
when you are on the saucer,

792
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,160
which, by the way, is not so much a saucer

793
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,360
as a reality that you get to run.

794
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,120
So, hope you don't freak out when that happens.

795
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,840
Yeah, yeah, it's true.

796
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,560
Wisteria is officially closed down.

797
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,600
That's the campground that we use for both these festivals.

798
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,060
It's closed down for July.

799
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,620
Probably a wise move.

800
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,600
Things are about to get worse.

801
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,700
And we will, however, stay tuned,

802
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,360
because we'll be doing all kinds of broadcasts

803
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,420
and Zooms and teleconferencing

804
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,600
and all that kind of crap.

805
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,120
I went to a paleontology meeting last week

806
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:23,300
with 40 people using that Zoom app,

807
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,780
and it actually worked.

808
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,040
Of course, they weren't subgeniuses,

809
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,860
so they weren't all talking at once.

810
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:36,200
We'll see how that works as we shift gears for X day.

811
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
As it is, there are forums,

812
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,240
forums that you can visit.

813
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,820
There's the subgenius diaspora chat.

814
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,200
It's just a general chat sort of thing for texting.

815
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:56,520
And then there's the Saturday weekly meetings

816
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,100
every day at 4.20 Eastern time.

817
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,360
There's a special place you can go on Zoom

818
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,860
and hang out with the host, Pastor Pressure,

819
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,300
and Princess Wee, and me,

820
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,440
and various other subgeniuses.

821
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:18,420
And it's really a whole lot like standing in the road at X day,

822
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,260
which is the best thing about X day.

823
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,440
And nobody's really talking about Bob or X day.

824
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:28,500
They might be talking about shoes or cats or, you know,

825
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,420
you just never know.

826
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:31,720
But the important thing is that subgeniuses

827
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,800
that are doing the chatting,

828
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,960
and most of them are really cool.

829
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,140
Probably all of them are.

830
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,820
They just aren't all cool to each other, you see.

831
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,660
For every subgenius, there's always at least one

832
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:47,420
that seems designed just to tick off that first subgenius.

833
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,020
There's a lot more than one of those in my case.

834
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,580
And I'm sure that goes both ways.

835
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:59,280
So, thank you, Ken Anger,

836
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,620
and don't sue me for using that music.

837
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,320
And now this.
