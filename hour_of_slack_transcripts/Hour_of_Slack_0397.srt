1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,900
...programming for a test of the emergency broadcast system. This is only a test.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,140
Oh my god, they're coming to get us! Run! The Russians! This is the end!

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,460
Nuclear weapons, everything they got! Water to New York! All gone! We're next!

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,260
Just a few seconds, it's gonna explode! Run to your shelter! Run!

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,060
Trap whole name! Builders put in! Screw your wife! Screw your children!

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:32,460
Eat every man for themselves! Red Trap terror! If you just see that deadly radiation, that explosion, you're gone!

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,660
It's curtains! Oh my god, what a terrible way to go! Your fingernails fall out! You're an air mouth!

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,040
You turn green! You vomit! You vomit all over the place! Just get in there and live!

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,900
Lock the other sucker out! You're the only one that matters!

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,760
President, that's all we got! Get with it, attack pack!

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,400
I wanna see the Russians blow off in a big smoke screen! I wanna see them die to save my women and I!

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,620
What's going on? I want my revenge! We're all gonna die!

13
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,740
We're all gonna die! We're all gonna die!

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,180
This was only a test.

15
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,220
The end has come for humanity. Not in the red of atomic fusion.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,260
Not in the glory of interstellar combustion. Not in the peace of white cold silence.

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,700
But that! That creeping, grasping flesh below us!

18
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:23,340
It is a joke, eh, Lewis? A great joke! The joke of the cosmos! The end of all mankind!

19
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:24,740
Well, why?

20
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,420
Because!

21
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:25,820
Because!

22
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,320
Because!

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,180
The Self Genius Hour of Slack!

24
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:43,320
It is a psychological technique whereby you, seated in the auditorium, actually become part of the action you see on the screen.

25
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,860
Let me show you something.

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,780
You will feel absolutely no pain at all.

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:50,740
Feel.

28
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:50,740


29
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,040
Things are pretty weird here in Dallas.

30
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,300
As you can tell.

31
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:04,160
I don't have the radio or a tape deck on. This is just the sound effects of the

32
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,720
downtown street that I'm driving down.

33
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,640
It's pretty confusing, really.

34
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,300
You can see why the Subgenius Foundation had its, the church itself,

35
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,160
had its birth here in Dallas.

36
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,960
I mean, I don't even know whether I'm going forward or backwards.

37
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,220
Sometimes it almost feels like a freeze frame, you know?

38
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,240
And on top of that, I've been editing film all month.

39
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,140
You know, I don't know whether...

40
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,380
I mean, sometimes I think I can just rewind my own reality.

41
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,680
Maybe I can even stop it.

42
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,300
But on and on they climb toward their hills of calvary, bearing their punishment bravely.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
What are you trying to pull?

44
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,300
Do you know what you are?

45
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,860
There's a very dirty word for what you are.

46
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,380
And a very dirty group of people running a very dirty business.

47
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,380
Oh yes, didn't you know?

48
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,000
We're highly organized.

49
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,780
The Church of the Subjeet.

50
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,100
The Church of the Subjeet.

51
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,920
The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.

52
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:46,800
Prudence is a rich, ugly old maid courted by incapacity.

53
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,280
The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.

54
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,680
The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.

55
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,280
Prudence is a rich, ugly old maid courted by incapacity.

56
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,160
The cut worm forgives the plow.

57
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,720
The cut worm forgives the plow.

58
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,600
Dip him in the river who loves water.

59
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,340
For a pink sees not the same tree that a subgenius sees.

60
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,020
For a pink sees not the same tree that a subgenius sees.

61
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,020


62
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,260
And a dead body revels there.

63
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,260


64
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,840
not injuries.

65
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,720
But if the fool would persist in his folly,

66
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,460
he would become wise.

67
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,760
Shame is pride's cloak,

68
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,380
and prisons are built with stones of law,

69
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,060
brothels with bricks of religion.

70
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,100
And the pride of the peacock is the glory of God,

71
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,900
the lust of the goat is the bounty of God,

72
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,220
the wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God,

73
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:11,160
and the nakedness of the woman is the work of God.

74
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,320
And the hour of slack is...

75
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,600
the...

76
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,080
the...

77
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,680
snotty handkerchief of God, my friends.

78
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,400
Those were actually some Proverbs of Hell by William Blake.

79
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,280
Reverend William Blake, written about a hundred years ago,

80
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:43,380
and welcome to yet another hour of slack show, my good,

81
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,080
good friends and prayer partners.

82
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,440
We'll be, we'll be finishing...

83
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,480
our, uh, discussion of the fall of Mutantus

84
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,000
and the creation of the humans by the Yetis.

85
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,660
Uh, tonight, we've also got some very interesting recordings

86
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,660
that I think you, you may en-enjoy.

87
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,720
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

88
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,400
I...

89
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,100
I...

90
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,240
I can't...

91
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,480
Someone beat us to it.

92
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,120
I can't...

93
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,060
I can't...

94
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,060


95
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,060


96
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,060


97
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,060


98
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,060


99
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,060


100
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,060


101
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,060


102
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,060


103
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,260
I can't...

104
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,260


105
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,880
Thirteen Catholic nuns on roller skates.

106
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,800
...Works out to be about $3300 dollars per man, woman, and child in this country.

107
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:30,800


108
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,740
Oh, it's a good philosophy.

109
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,020
Alright, I mean, the philosophy means a jaaast милли

110
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:46,340
Just keep out of that impenetrable sucking swamp bubbling with the sludge of credulity,

111
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,880
superstition and fanaticism.

112
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:56,360
So and as we travel along in our wonderful green and blue showmobile, even cooler than

113
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,740
Oscar Myers' Wienermobile, we shall avoid those flickering marsh lights, those false

114
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:07,240
friends, those unidentified and unhallowed floating or flying objects who weave and dart,

115
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,580
yawing and pitching their unwholesome ideology to each and every sapsucker and poebucker

116
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,140
who shuffles his size 12 brogans down the perilous and ever steepening pathways into

117
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,040
the foggy frog infested bog of no return.

118
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,600
Well, one of my terms here in which I've got to use on you guys is I've temporarily

119
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,720
got a disconnect here.

120
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,980
That's a sad term.

121
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,560
I don't care.

122
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,760
Yeah, we can see on the camera here.

123
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,220
Yeah, go ahead.

124
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,000
All right.

125
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,800
Well, ladies and gentlemen, pray for that, gentlemen.

126
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,220
Anyway, that didn't go out of order.

127
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,960
It went over the air, fortunately.

128
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,380
And it's unfortunate that we have jerks like that that will call and do that.

129
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,940
But you need to pray for them and pray that God will change them from a jerk to a born-again

130
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,580
person.

131
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,380
And anyway, moving right along.

132
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,180
Hi, Steve.

133
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,680
Hello, Jim.

134
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,900
Yes, how are you?

135
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,820
Yeah, I hate to say it.

136
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,400
I got bad news for you, sunshine.

137
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,940
It did, in fact, go out over the air because Jerry forgot to turn on the delay device.

138
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,800
Are you there?

139
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,500
Yeah, I'm there.

140
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,120
It's something that you really have got to check into if you're in the market for carpet.

141
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,260
Okay, thanks for calling.

142
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:13,820
Glad to be with you.

143
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,100
Okay, bye-bye.

144
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,500
Lines are filled.

145
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,440
Good morning, Bob.

146
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,540
You're on live at night.

147
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,300
Hello, Bob and Steve.

148
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,920
I'm awfully concerned about my wife.

149
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,160
She has joined somewhat of a cult organization.

150
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,620
I'm not sure if you've heard of it.

151
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,060
It's the subgenius organization.

152
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,220
Mm-hmm.

153
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:35,920
Yes.

154
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,780
The new ones are being launched.

155
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:36,780


156
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:36,780


157
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:36,780


158
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:36,780


159
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:36,780


160
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:36,780


161
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:36,780


162
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:36,780


163
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:36,780


164
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,100
Every day is trying to keep up with them.

165
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,100
Yeah, no kidding.

166
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,880
Well, it's funny.

167
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,920
You're Bob, and I'm Bob, and...

168
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,180
We've had three Bobs tonight.

169
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:46,900
Three Bobs, yeah.

170
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,980
Plus our guests.

171
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,760
Well, their god is kind of called Bob, too, and that has a lot to do with it.

172
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,600
She's kind of become confused, naturally, as being involved in a cult organization and

173
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,340
recognizes me as being Bob, the Bob of their cult organization.

174
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:06,760
I don't know.

175
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:06,760


176
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,960
I don't really know how to go about solving the dilemma.

177
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,020
Maybe you can help.

178
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,200
Bob, let me give you just a couple of insights.

179
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,040
First of all, let me just ask you very directly, are you a Christian?

180
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,300
Yes, I am.

181
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,600
Okay.

182
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,380
Number one, Bob, is if you're praying for your wife and you're praying for these people,

183
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,540
if you're praying already, double your prayers.

184
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,380
Double?

185
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,700
Yeah, double your prayers.

186
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,240
You're moving into tough territory.

187
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:36,180
Number two, write a letter to Dr. Walter Martin at Christian Research Institute in Capistrano,

188
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,540
California.

189
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,400
I don't have all of the address, but you can get it here at KPDQ, I believe.

190
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:40,900
That's right.

191
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,960
Write to Dr. Martin and get his response, because he is probably the clearest authority

192
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:54,340
on even cults that I've never even heard of, and get some information, if he does have

193
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,920
information on this cult, and exactly the proper way to go about handling it.

194
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,420
He is the unsurpassed expert in that area.

195
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,960
Well, what kind of insight can you give until that time?

196
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,760
I mean, I'm not sure what this will lead to.

197
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,220
I don't think it will lead to directly in the next few days, and it could be anything.

198
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:10,820
All right.

199
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,480
First of all, the insight is pray, Bob.

200
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,980
And I've already told you that.

201
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,260
Pray.

202
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:23,080
Number two, understand that everything, every cult you deal with has a spiritual, or has

203
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,300
their root in the spiritual.

204
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,300
Everything God says, now I'm probably going to offend some people, but I'm going to tell

205
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,160
you what the Bible says.

206
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,260
Jesus said, you're either of your father God, or you're of your father the devil.

207
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,440
There's no gray area.

208
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,240
It's black or white.

209
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,360
It's, you know, we can say it that way.

210
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,040
And if you're not a follower of God the Father through his son, the Lord Jesus Christ, then

211
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,520
you're dealing with something that comes directly from Satan himself.

212
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,040
So you're on spiritual ground.

213
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,680
Pray.

214
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,960
And right now you may have to walk a little bit on eggs around your wife.

215
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,700
Don't antagonize her until you get more information in your hands and what you can do on this

216
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,440
particular thing.

217
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,200
Well, I was wondering, Bob.

218
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,420
What's the difference between a spiritual and a spiritual?

219
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,540
I don't know anything about the, the, the, do you know anything about this figure, Bob?

220
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,260
I don't.

221
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,320
I really don't.

222
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,600
No.

223
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,020
No.

224
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,080
That's why I say write to Walter Martin.

225
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,180
In fact, you don't have to write to him, Bob.

226
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,100
If you want to invest in Long Distance Call, just call down there.

227
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,400
You can get information right over the phone so you know what you're dealing with.

228
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:25,540
Yeah.

229
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,840
Thank you, Bob.

230
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,980
I sure do hope things don't get too bloody before it all ends.

231
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,360
I'll give that guy a ring and see what happens.

232
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:33,820
Okay, Bob.

233
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,120
There are people praying for you and your wife, too.

234
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,420
Yeah.

235
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:36,660
Okay.

236
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,200
What's your wife's first name, Bob?

237
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,420
Um, her name is Betty.

238
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,140
Betty.

239
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,640
Yeah.

240
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,060
All right.

241
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,560
Thank you, Bob.

242
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,360
We'll pray for you tonight, Bob.

243
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:44,960
Thank you.

244
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,860
The fighting Jesus looked out over the bridge of the excess battle saucer, blood of Christ.

245
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,660
He looked and laughed.

246
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,600
He laughed and looked.

247
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,640
He looked and looked.

248
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,420
He laughed and looked.

249
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,200
He looked and looked.

250
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,720
He angel laid it on the' upright rake wall.

251
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,320
He looked up at his電aroom.

252
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,320


253
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,420
Ferrari coming soon.

254
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,680
Will he get his luck card?

255
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,740
This impresC smart prisoner still has a single maintenant.

256
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,560
I ran out of conveyor doubt, and I didn't bring the key to the front...

257
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,380
There's no future withoutApple.

258
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:25,380


259
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:25,380


260
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,540
dat feff

261
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:29,540


262
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:29,540


263
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:29,720
Good!

264
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:29,980
Hey there!

265
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,220
In my into look this hot steeds I know myим

266
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,240
You burning a big sound?

267
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:35,340


268
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,400
You'd like to know all that?

269
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:36,400


270
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:36,400


271
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,160
Jesus was in a psychopathically elated state.

272
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,800
His face resembled many of the perverse icons the humanoids of the dust moat painted of him.

273
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,220
They prayed to these for the salvation of their souls,

274
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,460
as if they had any souls to save,

275
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,260
as if anyone would want to save them, which they didn't.

276
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,560
A whole disgusting religion now centered around his murder.

277
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,660
They had to gall to nail him up like a common criminal

278
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,020
and then paint pictures of him enjoying it.

279
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,660
And they thought he loved them for it, that he was forgiving.

280
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,760
Oh, the anticipation.

281
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,260
He was sick to his stomach with glee.

282
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,540
He would show them the true face of pain and sin.

283
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,200
It had taken him 2,000 long years to return here,

284
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,480
and now he would pay them back for the scars he still carried in his hands.

285
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,360
Sweet stigmata.

286
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,680
Even the slightest thought of the scars made them glow red through his fists,

287
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,400
through the boxing gloves.

288
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,100
The whole of the spacecraft was manned with angels of light,

289
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,060
personally lent by Jehovah One.

290
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,420
They supervised the demon teams operating on all tangible destruction spectrums,

291
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,880
all in attack mode,

292
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,840
Nagas, Orzuma, Shiva, Horus, Aeons, the dark bodies,

293
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,640
and at a time and a half too.

294
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,960
It was expensive to ravage a planet.

295
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,360
When we were born

296
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,840
Into this life

297
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,380
We were destined

298
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,000
To make it right

299
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,020
And it's pretty

300
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,880
Turnin'

301
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,260
And this is our fate

302
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,900
We're singin' this song

303
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,220
So you can relate

304
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,120
We are goin'

305
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,560
To save the universe

306
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,880
We are goin'

307
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,260
To save the universe

308
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,460
We are goin'

309
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,060
To save the universe

310
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:53,900
Goodbye!

311
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,580
Hi, good morning.

312
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,020
What's on your mind today?

313
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,620
Um, well, I have

314
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:03,860
a conversation

315
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,640
about, uh,

316
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,560
I've been listening

317
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,320
to your show for a while

318
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,980
and I heard

319
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,080
the gentleman, uh,

320
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,860
Bob,

321
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,400
call

322
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,320
about, uh,

323
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,420
the problem he had

324
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,040
with his wife

325
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,100
in this cult

326
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,020
of the subgenius

327
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,900
and, uh,

328
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,300
how it

329
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,240
worshipped

330
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,000
a deity

331
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,340
or whatever you call it

332
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,040
named Bob.

333
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,680
And this

334
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,620
reminded me

335
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,060
of a good friend

336
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,460
I have

337
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,300
who's a Christian.

338
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,460
Do you have a party line?

339
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,860
No, I don't.

340
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,480
Okay, I was hearing

341
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,160
other voices.

342
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:33,680
Uh,

343
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:33,780
uh,

344
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,560
I don't know, yeah.

345
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,860
Anyway, this

346
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,280
this made me think

347
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,820
of my, uh,

348
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,680
friend who has

349
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,380
a passive interest

350
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,460
in, in a cult

351
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,520
and I called him up

352
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,820
and he's awake

353
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,700
and, uh,

354
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,000
and he told me

355
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,420
about this,

356
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,000
this Bob,

357
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,400
this Bob creature

358
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,080
and he says it's

359
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,940
from the cult

360
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,680
of the subgenius.

361
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,120
He just happened

362
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,800
to know about it

363
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,380
and it's from

364
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,160
Revelations

365
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,680
and it's in, uh,

366
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,440
Revelations 13,

367
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,140
verse 1

368
00:15:59,140 --> 00:15:59,740
if you have your,

369
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,360
your Bible.

370
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:00,700
Sure.

371
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Revelations 13, 1?

372
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,820
Yeah, you can

373
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,380
read it.

374
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:03,520
Okay.

375
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:03,820
Read along.

376
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,460
I'll quote this

377
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:04,940
if I may.

378
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,380
Okay.

379
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,300
And it says,

380
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,720
and I saw a beast

381
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,840
rising out of the sea

382
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,880
with ten horns

383
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,980
and seven heads

384
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,820
with ten, uh,

385
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,520
diadems.

386
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,780
What are diadems?

387
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,100
Those are crowns.

388
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,460
Okay.

389
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,940
Upon its, uh,

390
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,380
horns

391
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,220
and a blasphemous

392
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,220
name upon its head

393
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,480
and that name,

394
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,300
according to my friend,

395
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,180
the name upon

396
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,080
the beast's head

397
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,900
is Bob.

398
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,660
Huh.

399
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,300
Huh.

400
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,400
That's, uh,

401
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,220
that would have to be,

402
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,940
to be honest with you,

403
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,260
uh,

404
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:33,820
Rudy,

405
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,420
that would have to be

406
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,320
read right into Scripture

407
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,400
because that's not

408
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,260
given to us anywhere.

409
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,840
Yeah, I know.

410
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,460
It's not given to us.

411
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,260
That's just how this,

412
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,520
this cult has interpreted,

413
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,600
you know,

414
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,440
this is just,

415
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,620
this is really out of context.

416
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:43,960
Yeah.

417
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,360
It's just one small part of this.

418
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:45,960
And I,

419
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,760
and I am seriously

420
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,640
out of luck to explain

421
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,540
how this woman

422
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,400
has, um,

423
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,900
mistaken her husband

424
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,560
for this beast

425
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,360
with seven heads

426
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,000
with a bob.

427
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,120
Yeah.

428
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,640
Yeah.

429
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,060
Well,

430
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:57,820
yeah,

431
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,440
it's a,

432
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,920
it's a strange one,

433
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,160
Rudy,

434
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,780
that's for sure.

435
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,620
Thank you, Rudy,

436
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,100
for calling.

437
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,240
Bye.

438
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,080
I just said,

439
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,300
yeah,

440
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:04,980
just a little help.

441
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,060
I hope that man's still listening.

442
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:06,520
Good.

443
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,140
Okay, good.

444
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,800
Thank you.

445
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,700
There is noise

446
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,020
on that telephone line

447
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,240
and it's a mystery to me.

448
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:12,960
Yes.

449
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,320
Yeah.

450
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,420
Yeah.

451
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,360
Next, it's Gloria.

452
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:16,940
Good morning.

453
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,340
Yes, hello, Bob.

454
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,900
I'm pleased to be able

455
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,620
to be on your show

456
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,060
this evening.

457
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:21,980
Um,

458
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,120
I just wanted to mention

459
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,880
that as I was going

460
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,660
through my Bible

461
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,340
the other night,

462
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,680
I did happen to notice,

463
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,120
um,

464
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,000
some references

465
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,240
to the cult figure

466
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,760
that has been

467
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,820
popping out

468
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,800
throughout the conversation

469
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,360
this evening.

470
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,180
Um,

471
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,500
and,

472
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:33,520


473
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:33,800


474
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:33,800


475
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,300
Mark 1,

476
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:34,900
24,

477
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,840
or 23,

478
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,700
pardon me,

479
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,600
and immediately

480
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,800
there was in their synagogue

481
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,380
a man with unclean spirit

482
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,620
and he cried out,

483
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,460
what have you to do

484
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:43,800
with us,

485
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,920
Jesus of Nazareth?

486
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,440
Have you come

487
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,320
to destroy us?

488
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,520
But I know

489
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,120
who you are,

490
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,200
the Holy One of Bob,

491
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,720
but Jesus rebuked him

492
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:51,960
saying,

493
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,640
be silent.

494
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,300
Okay,

495
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,680
thank you for calling,

496
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,480
Gloria.

497
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,420
Next, Fred.

498
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,140
Good morning,

499
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,300
you're on KPDQ.

500
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,680
Bob,

501
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,400
this one's Coke.

502
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:02,640
Coke.

503
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,020
Well,

504
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,160
we're having a terrible,

505
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,820
I think you've just

506
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,600
broken the record,

507
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:06,940
Mike,

508
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,780
for taking,

509
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,260
uh,

510
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,280
strange phone calls,

511
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,260
but we hope we don't,

512
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:13,460
uh,

513
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,340
hear from him again

514
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,200
for a long,

515
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,640
long time.

516
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:15,780
Well,

517
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,040
it's interesting,

518
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,340
Jerry,

519
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,800
both times he's called,

520
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,460
he's mentioned cocaine.

521
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,580
Oh,

522
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:20,900
he did?

523
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,580
The first time,

524
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:21,940
he said,

525
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,880
lines of Coke,

526
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,780
and he hung up

527
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,340
it right there.

528
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:24,640
Yeah,

529
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,760
and he just called up

530
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,360
and he mentioned Coke again,

531
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:27,940
and,

532
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,320
uh,

533
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,420
obviously we're probably

534
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,260
dealing with a person

535
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,220
that may have a problem

536
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,660
in that area.

537
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,540
Uh,

538
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,120
very true.

539
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,440
I,

540
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,560
I did not catch that

541
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,520
until you mentioned it.

542
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:35,700


543
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,580
This gal calls in

544
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,080
all the time,

545
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,460
she says.

546
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,060
Aha,

547
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,020
so you know,

548
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,400
eh,

549
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,620
you must be a secret listener.

550
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,320
She says that,

551
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,060
but do you believe her

552
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,100
on a show like this?

553
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,080
All right.

554
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,720
Well,

555
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,180
of course,

556
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,260
your calls are recorded,

557
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:58,880
analyzed,

558
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,940
and shuttled into

559
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,220
a multi-index memory bank.

560
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,420
But you have to tell

561
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:01,840
what's not the key

562
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:01,840


563
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,640
to the caller

564
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,740
for the caller parade.

565
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,840
Jesus washed my skin away.

566
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,380
All this show

567
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,020
has to march

568
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,920
down the street

569
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,860
at 6 a.m.

570
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,120
Right?

571
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,220
Don't say the J word.

572
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,460
And now the caller police

573
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,420
are looking for you,

574
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,680
so you must join the parade.

575
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,620
And don't say the J word.

576
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:16,880
Hi, Don.

577
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,300
No, it's,

578
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,720
it's Dom.

579
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:19,880
Dom?

580
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,340
Yes.

581
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:20,800
Okay, hi.

582
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,980
Hi, how are you doing

583
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,360
this evening?

584
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:22,780
Fine.

585
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,440
Some fresh testimony

586
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,620
from Rich this evening.

587
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,960
I enjoyed that message.

588
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,340
Yeah.

589
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,620
Um,

590
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,680
I have a prayer request.

591
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,340
Mm-hmm.

592
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:30,880
Um,

593
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,000
um,

594
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,260
a friend of mine

595
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,080
has a girlfriend

596
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,020
who's in trouble.

597
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:35,980
Uh,

598
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,920
and I was just

599
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,580
kind of anonymously

600
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,320
and I was wondering

601
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,180
if we could,

602
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,580
if we could have a prayer for her.

603
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,520
Have a prayer for who?

604
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,100
For my friend's girlfriend.

605
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,320
What do you want me to pray?

606
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:49,760
Well,

607
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,600
they've,

608
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,660
there's been some sin

609
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,700
involved in the relationship.

610
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,620
Uh-huh.

611
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,240
Uh,

612
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,940
and I,

613
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,460
they have a big decision

614
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,340
to make coming up

615
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,060
and I'm hoping

616
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,360
that, uh,

617
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,080
the right things

618
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,380
are,

619
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,140
are,

620
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,100
are carried through,

621
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,400
so.

622
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:03,800
Well,

623
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,660
are either one of them

624
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,020
Christians?

625
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:05,760
Uh,

626
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,340
both are,

627
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,540
yeah.

628
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,180
Uh-huh.

629
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,220
Yeah.

630
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,240
And so what are they

631
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,640
going to be making

632
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,420
decisions about?

633
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,580
Well,

634
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,700
she's looking for

635
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,140
a good Christian abortionist

636
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,260
but her boyfriend,

637
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:15,700
uh,

638
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,440
doesn't like that idea.

639
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,020
Um,

640
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,060
thinks that,

641
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,360
uh,

642
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,100
she's looking for

643
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,200
a good Christian abortionist?

644
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:22,660
Yes.

645
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,460
Who's that?

646
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,500
There isn't any.

647
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:24,960
Uh,

648
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,500
well,

649
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:25,900
I was wondering

650
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,940
if actually you could help,

651
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,280
uh,

652
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,740
help recommend one for me,

653
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:28,980
but,

654
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,700
uh,

655
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,760
anyway,

656
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,300
we always get kind of,

657
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:32,480
you know,

658
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,020
jerks like that

659
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,400
on the air sometimes.

660
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,480
Uh,

661
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,760
I don't know why they call,

662
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,720
but,

663
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,040
uh,

664
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,400
pray for this guy.

665
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,400
Um,

666
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,860
he said his name was Dom.

667
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,000
I think I could give him

668
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,600
a different name,

669
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,040
but anyway,

670
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,640
we have still one line

671
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,020
available.

672
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,220
I don't know.

673
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,120
I think that's stupid.

674
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,400
I could be off

675
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,340
enjoying myself,

676
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,500
pounding my head

677
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,400
into a brick wall

678
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,460
over and over,

679
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
running down the street

680
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,180
with my brains

681
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,660
hanging out

682
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,700
in the back of my skull,

683
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,740
dragging on

684
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,520
the sidewalk.

685
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,260
Uh,

686
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,400
I don't know.

687
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,640
I don't know.

688
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,660
I don't know.

689
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:07,660


690
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,800
I don't know.

691
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,900
I don't know.

692
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:14,920
I don't know.

693
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,280
The male

694
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,800
out of place

695
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,440
is the female

696
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,620
displaced

697
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,920
and the children

698
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,980
misplaced

699
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,500
and ultimately

700
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,720
God replaced.

701
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,340
Come on.

702
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:26,900
Remember that.

703
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,540
So,

704
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,220
the lady now

705
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,160
feels to be

706
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,860
to get back

707
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,500
to that unconditional

708
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,100
love,

709
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,380
for love,

710
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,000
with God and with Adam she's doing everything to remain beautiful or to

711
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:46,120
stay please accept me I don't feel right I'm wrong I messed up hey let's cover

712
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:53,880
our shame by tying together our own fig leaves now God hadn't seen them yet so

713
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,920
they were hiding from each other who told you you were vulnerable who told

714
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,600
you you were under scrutiny they didn't even know they were naked

715
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,980
Robert I

716
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,900
praise the Lord

717
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:35,160
how are you doing this evening I'm doing pretty decent yeah just wanted to talk

718
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:43,020
about your theme of compromise of sin and justice I have a bit of a bit of a

719
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:51,560
problem I actually calling for a prayer request I have a tumor I need some

720
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:57,180
prayer for and I'm wondering how that kind of fits in with your discussion of

721
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,700
justice and natural

722
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:05,980
well seeing is that the adversary the prince of darkness and the temperature

723
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:12,600
has made his way into my very faculty for evaluating these kinds of subjects

724
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:19,460
okay well let's pray and where's the tumor in my brain okay I think did you

725
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:26,160
just find that out yeah all right so it'd be silly to ask how you're doing I

726
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,740
I would imagine you're doing all kinds of things,

727
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,720
sometimes being afraid and sometimes being peaceful

728
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,680
and sometimes being angry maybe or everything.

729
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,760
What?

730
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,840
I would imagine that you're experiencing a variety of emotions.

731
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,660
Yes.

732
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,240
Over it.

733
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,460
Yes, very much so.

734
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,640
Okay, Robert, let's pray.

735
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,140
Father, we just lift up our brother to you.

736
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,480
And, Robert, I am assuming you're a Christian.

737
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,020
Yes.

738
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,480
Okay.

739
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,620
Okay.

740
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,780
Father, we do lift Robert up to you and just amen.

741
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,380
Amen.

742
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,340
Yeah.

743
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:05,640
I hope that we'll take care of the demon, of the monster, of the hellion.

744
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,580
Thank you, Jim.

745
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,400
Thank you, Robert.

746
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,460
Try a new salad dressing.

747
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,780
Okay, please stay in touch with us.

748
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,280
Thank you.

749
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,080
Okay, good night.

750
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,800
All right, let's see.

751
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,280
Hi, Velma.

752
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,120
Hi, Jim.

753
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:17,620
Yes.

754
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,940
Hi, this is Velma.

755
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,640
Yes, ma'am.

756
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:29,600
I'm not calling for something that has too much to do with religion, but with my grandchildren.

757
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,240
Okay.

758
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:42,420
And I just want to say I had them over for dinner last night, and I was serving a very nice dinner of beans and macaroni and pork chops.

759
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,400
Go ahead.

760
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,420
Oh, excuse me.

761
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,100
Okay.

762
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,180
Velma, you can go ahead and give me a call back if you get a chance.

763
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,120
I'd like to talk with you.

764
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,080
Nobody was listening, fortunately.

765
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,140
We can march on in cleanliness.

766
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,020
That's quite all right.

767
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,020
You know, no one ever listens to any of these things I say.

768
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,920
I try to tell them.

769
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,540
I mean, I got the wisdom of the ages right here in the multi-indexed memory bank, but do they listen?

770
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,120
Oh, nobody listens.

771
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,440
I don't listen to the show.

772
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,600
Oh, no.

773
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,280
No, I'm kidding.

774
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,720
You sure know how to hurt a guy.

775
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,400
I know that is real.

776
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,240
Boy, that was a tough sock on the chin.

777
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,940
That's how you always cut me off anyway.

778
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:24,580
What?

779
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,140
I never...

780
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,320
You're slap happy.

781
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,660
I'm going to snip it right in half, and all the colors go floating away into beautiful dark space.

782
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,640
No one?

783
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,900
Hi, Herb.

784
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,620
Hello.

785
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,300
How are you?

786
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,100
I'm fine.

787
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,840
How are you doing?

788
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:45,100
Well, I have this terrible pain, and you know that major surgery I had ten years ago, and the in-laws, and isn't the weather awful?

789
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,900
Now, hold on.

790
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,880
What major surgery did you have?

791
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,180
The world situation has me so upset and nervous, and oh, well.

792
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,680
We'll probably all be blown up anyway.

793
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,660
Well, that's, uh, you talk about...

794
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:06,080
Listen, that man is, uh, he is, uh, negative.

795
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:06,720
How?

796
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,300
Well...

797
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,340
And I'm not so sure that that was, uh, that could have been a crank call.

798
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,880
I, I would think it was more along the line.

799
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,380
I think I recognized his voice.

800
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,220
He's been on before.

801
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,760
But let's not be deterred by that.

802
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,300
No, thanks.

803
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,360
Let's move right on.

804
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,040
Oh, yeah.

805
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,060
Oh, yeah.

806
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,660
Oh, that feels so good.

807
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,540
Oh, baby.

808
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,680
Oh, baby.

809
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,320
Go ahead.

810
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,420
Say it.

811
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,780
Say what?

812
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,060
Say it.

813
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,820
You know.

814
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,640
Bob?

815
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,840

.

817
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:47,700


818
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:47,700


819
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,620
.

820
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,620
Come on, Bob!

821
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:52,620


822
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,100
.

823
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,620
.

824
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,000
.

825
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,140
.

828
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,880
i just can't believe someone would call in and have the nerve to say things like that about

829
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,940
prairie squid i know not only that but they call somebody else's show i know using our air using

830
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,680
and our area code for that matter that you can bet it's going to be charged to its name

831
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:31,420
in in berkeley out in california oh they're hip out there in california oh yeah they're so hip

they've got oh they've got their crack so to speak yes their drugs and their wild sex

833
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:44,760
but but have you ever heard a person from one of these hot tubbers talking about a prairie

834
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,280
squid friends have you ever have never they haven't heard about those they've never heard

835
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:54,320
of it those organic boys and the with their avocado dips and they're city folks yeah they

836
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,660
don't

837
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,000
know about. Oh, they know everything.

838
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,420
They know everything. But they don't know that.

839
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,520
And if you told them, if you tried to tell

840
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,180
them about it, they'd think, oh, how quaint.

841
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,460
He's talking with his southern accent.

842
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,940
How folksy.

843
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,740
He must be near to the earth

844
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,820
or something. Yes.

845
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,480
But I'm an artist. I don't have to

846
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,980
lower myself to those

847
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,460
demeaning... I'm involved with

848
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,480
such incredibly cerebral

849
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,860
machinations over the

850
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,400
politically correct

851
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,320
aspect of my art and how it

852
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,300
applies to Barry Squid that I

853
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,500
don't really have to think about the humorous

854
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,420
side of these things, if there is a humorous

855
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,260
side, because I'm serious. I'm from

856
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,460
California. I don't have to do veiled

857
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,400
juvenile humor guising as

858
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,800
some sort of high

859
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,800
faluting environmental concern

860
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,060
citizen satire.

861
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,180
I'm not that kind of person. Oh, no, no, no.

862
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,120
Of course not. That's what they'll tell you every time.

863
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,320
That's the line they'll spring on you.

864
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,080
The sophisticated line.

865
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,140
The conspiracy is...

866
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,500
Their bourgeois line.

867
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,660
The conspiracy is insidious, friends.

868
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,040
Incredibly, they make you want what they

869
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,360
have. And they make you feel stupid

870
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,940
because you haven't got it. Yeah.

871
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,060
And they make you think it's better than what

872
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,780
you already have. That way,

873
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,760
once they get your attention

874
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,200
directed at what they have, they can get

875
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,540
your slack.

876
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,100
Your slack, friends. That's right.

877
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,980
And you're a prairie squid,

878
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,600
too. And if, as long

879
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,100
as you're the kind of person that can

880
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,940
still, you know,

881
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,880
if you can find one, you can go out in the woods

882
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,040
and have a short relationship with one of

883
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,800
these harmless animals. Or a long relationship.

884
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,600
I mean, you know, like, it's not...

885
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,840
There's no limited time. The tantric sex

886
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,900
magicians in India and

887
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,720
the ancient cultures

888
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,740
of the earth have known of...

889
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,060
I mean, these creatures are not just common

890
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,920
to the continental U.S. That's right.

891
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,940
And Reverend Stang, I don't know if you know it or not,

892
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,860
but in Tibet, they breed

893
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,020
in the temples a special variety.

894
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,980
Oh, the fattened special

895
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,420
prairie squid. The special prairie squid.

896
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,300
They call it. Yeah, it's the one that the Dalai

897
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,060
Lama has. Uh-huh. And

898
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,180
they still breed them there, and they have to ship

899
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,160
them out to India, where the Dalai Lama is

900
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,120
now, you know, the Chinese. They're fed than almost

901
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,100
anyone in Tibet. They're better

902
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,220
fed than most of Tibet

903
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,960
put together. And

904
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,100
friends, when

905
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,240
you become a member of the Church of the

906
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,740
Subgenius, you become eligible.

907
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,260
Yes. Eligible, friends.

908
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,940
We'll give you your very own

909
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,940
prairie squid direction and

910
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,980
survival package.

911
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,880
Give yourself to the feeling,

912
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,000
friends. I don't know.

913
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,900
I think that's stupid. I think that's stupid.

914
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,420
I think I just made... I think that's stupid.

915
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,280
And, uh,

916
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,400
I guess it's time to

917
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,520
to tell you

918
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,920
what you've been listening

919
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,600
to for the last half hour.

920
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,580
First half hour, anyway.

921
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,000
Uh.

922
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh, there's been lots of

923
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,580
uh, calls.

924
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,020
Yes, recordings of, uh, mighty

925
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,660
calls on,

926
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,540
some Portland, Oregon station.

927
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,860
Don't know who made those calls. I got

928
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,080
the tape from, uh, Jim Blanchard.

929
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,640
And, uh,

930
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,020
tip of the hat there to Reverend Blanchard.

931
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,720
Uh, amazing stuff.

932
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,720
The subgenius who made those calls,

933
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,840
as far as I know, it wasn't Reverend Blanchard.

934
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,140
Never sent us that tape.

935
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,800
Get it came into our hands.

936
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,880
It's in the, uh, pipeline.

937
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,780
The prank call trading pipeline.

938
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,140
Um.

939
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,860
Oh, starting from the beginning

940
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,980
there. Of course, there's interspersed with,

941
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,780
with the subgenius show from Berkeley.

942
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,420
We play lots of tapes from the

943
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,820
KPFA subgenius show

944
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,560
there, um,

945
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,640
uh, more than an hour. Less than a show

946
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,600
with Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence.

947
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,060
And, uh,

948
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,440
oh,

949
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,640
some, uh, readings about

950
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,040
the fightin' Jesus.

951
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,740
Uh, me, your host,

952
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,780
Reverend Ivan Stang, I read that, but it was

953
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,540
written by St. Palmer

954
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,800
Vreedies. Uh, we

955
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,840
heard a little clip of the Swingin' Love Corpse.

956
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,920
Uh, Saving the Universe.

957
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,240
Um,

958
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,560
some zoogs. The music, uh,

959
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,800
bits and clips of music

960
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,600
that you heard were zoogs rift.

961
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,580
The great zoogs rift.

962
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,620
Um, some clips from the good

963
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,480
Reverend Ott. Uh,

964
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,620
sent in by, uh, Reverend Jimmy

965
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,540
B. And

966
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,580
towards

967
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,520
the end there,

968
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,660
Dr. G. Gordon Gordon and

969
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,100
myself discussing, uh,

970
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,280
prairie squids.

971
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,040
And what we have coming up,

972
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,680
now last week we, uh,

973
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,700
I was, uh, beginning to read

974
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,060
from, uh, the new

975
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,620
Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon,

976
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,480
our ever-unfinished

977
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,340
book.

978
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,280
And, um, was reading

979
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,920
this, uh, to you, the scientific

980
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,000
section about the fall

981
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,120
of Mutantis. And,

982
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,160
uh, actually it was

983
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,680
the section we were reading was

984
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,780
the creation of the humans

985
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,180
by our ancestors, the Yeti.

986
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,020
And the mistakes

987
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,480
that were made in that self-same,

988
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,140
those moments of creation,

989
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,200
uh, as the Yetis

990
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,720
had, had, uh, discovered

991
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,900
the, the, the humans' joy in

992
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,500
hairless, spherical appendages

993
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,860
and soft, round

994
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,740
things, um,

995
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,600
uh, we learned

996
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,000
in, uh, Revelation X

997
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,940
how, oh, by the way,

998
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,000
in this, this material, the Yeti material

999
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,280
is, was researched primarily

1000
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,120
by myself with Dr.

1001
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,380
G. Gordon Gordon,

1002
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,080
uh, did quite a bit of the

1003
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,920
scientific research, and also

1004
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,700
uh, Princess

1005
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,120
Weardo, queen of all

1006
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,160
the UFOs, contributed a great deal

1007
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:33,820
of, uh,

1008
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,680
trans-channeling to these things.

1009
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,760
And, uh,

1010
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,140
as we'd been, uh, learning

1011
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,260
last week, the Yetis had discovered

1012
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,180
that they could make other things besides

1013
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,100
soft, round

1014
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,780
spherical appendages

1015
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,880
tickle the male human

1016
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,040
desire gland.

1017
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,620
But instead of restricting

1018
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,640
uh, inborn raw

1019
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,580
need only to the

1020
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,580
unfulfillable breed lust,

1021
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,760
uh, the, it could also

1022
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,500
be sublimated into

1023
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,560
devotion to some chore

1024
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,320
or even some mere

1025
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,220
symbol of a reward.

1026
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,900
So now we continue with, uh,

1027
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,200
the fall of

1028
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,060
Mutantis.

1029
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,400
...

1030
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,920
...

1031
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,880
...

1032
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,820
...

1033
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,860
After blanking the whole

1034
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,840
reward lobe and scouring

1035
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,680
it smooth for etching,

1036
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,860
Yeti owners could load

1037
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,140
their humans with directives,

1038
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,880
false memories, new instincts,

1039
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,660
talents, and proclivities.

1040
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,860
Reflexes for rote

1041
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,320
activities.

1042
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,320
Fears.

1043
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,860
Implanted by intra-humanists,

1044
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,420
uterine hypnosis, or even

1045
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,220
simple repetition, anything

1046
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,500
could be filled into that

1047
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,560
blank spot in the brain

1048
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,460
and used to trigger

1049
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,840
the reward secretion.

1050
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,600
Yeti mind

1051
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,260
designers created

1052
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,860
hypno-templates for countless

1053
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,260
archetypal images,

1054
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,200
command signals, and responses,

1055
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,980
experimenting to find out what combinations

1056
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,660
produce both the most

1057
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,900
pungent soul-flavoring

1058
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,400
and the most

1059
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,440
most progeny.

1060
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:21,700
...

1061
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,900
...

1062
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,500
Males and females were programmed

1063
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,260
not to want the same sorts of things,

1064
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,100
as some tension between them was thought to spice up the souls.

1065
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,520
To create a deep conflict of interest and thus spur them on,

1066
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:44,260
the females were made to want things that were difficult for the males to provide,

1067
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,260
but which they had to provide if they wished to touch anything round and soft, such as

1068
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:59,920
security, safety, the sharpest teeth on the strongest silverback, the warmest mud, the biggest spear, the most...

1069
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,640
... goats.

1070
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:11,220
Though the males were encouraged to enjoy the fantasy that they had some free will beyond the craving for feminine glandular outcroppings,

1071
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:20,240
and this hardwiring kept both genders busy storing up pain reserves while simultaneously ensuring that the male's body was safe and sound.

1072
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:20,240


1073
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:20,240


1074
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,440
...

1075
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:20,720
...

1076
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,120
... a high birth-rate.

1077
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,720
The yeti considered such weird behaviors a kindness.

1078
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,920
The humans would find vast fulfillment

1079
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,520
in obsessively doing whatever menial work was assigned to them,

1080
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,720
such as mining,

1081
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,920
picking the ticks off yetiyung,

1082
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:38,700
accounting,

1083
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,180
differential calculus,

1084
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:40,680
etc.

1085
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,640
Otherwise,

1086
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,600
the humans would have been suicidally miserable,

1087
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,400
knowing they were consigned to an endless treadmill of senseless toil

1088
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,540
for distant masters who, in the end, rewarded them by devouring their souls.

1089
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:02,580
But, since they were designed for it from the beginning, such a life would seem perfectly normal to them.

1090
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:09,280
They wouldn't comprehend that they were slaves because they wouldn't be capable of understanding what real freedom was.

1091
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,000
In fact, they would strive desperately to avoid true awareness.

1092
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:23,300
The craving to have someone else, some authority figure, make their decisions for them would be at the very core of their natures.

1093
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:31,220
They would always seek someone or something bigger to submit to and something smaller to dominate.

1094
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:38,980
The Yeti planned, by milking emotions out of their new herds, in a controlled and relatively merciful manner,

1095
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,680
to pay off the Elder Gods in only five or six million years.

1096
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,760
However, they recognized that without the divine Yeti spark,

1097
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:53,420
the intelligence they'd given humans could make them extremely dangerous animals indeed.

1098
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:59,800
Were they ever to somehow run loose with that blank spot in their brains, unprogrammed.

1099
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:07,760
So, the Yeti keyed in susceptibilities to certain diseases to prevent the human population from growing out of control.

1100
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,340
They thought their fail-safes couldn't backfire,

1101
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,660
that they had made the humans far too strong,

1102
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,180
that they were too small, frail, and stupid to live in the wilds without Yeti masters to guide them.

1103
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:26,800
Their hairlessness alone, it was assumed, would prevent them surviving even one winter outside the corrals.

1104
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:35,020
Needless to say, however, the Yeti proved themselves far too cocky in this respect,

1105
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:40,460
too certain that they would always be there to maintain human domestication.

1106
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:46,760
To them, the very idea that the sub-moronic humans could ever escape Yeti domination

1107
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:55,280
was almost as silly as the notion that their source of infinite power, the Great Crystal, might someday cease functioning.

1108
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,120
They didn't bother to make it genetically impossible for a human to crossbreed with a Yeti,

1109
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:10,380
for what Yeti could bring itself to touch one of these shriveled, hideous, bald, stunted pink gnomes?

1110
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,940
It would be like one of us having sex with a skin rabbit!

1111
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,700
Only the most depraved mind would even think of such a thing.

1112
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:35,220
Sadly, none in Mutantis foresaw the depths to which a certain frustrated, mentally impaired, hairless, deformed, dwarf albino Yeti would sink.

1113
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,440
And now we have to play this little bit of...

1114
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:47,960
well, from bedtime stories for little bobsters based on Prescriptures 190-378b.

1115
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:58,240
Bedeen, the lonesome Yeti, paced in angry circles out in the Game Preserve

1116
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,380
where he went to be alone with his precious pet humans.

1117
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:09,260
The other Yeti avoided him, not because he was a stunted, hairless albino that appealed to them.

1118
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,840
It was because he was so unpleasant and self-involved.

1119
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:16,280
As he paced, he muttered to himself,

1120
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:25,880
I... I could... I could... I could... with a... a human... and no one would know?

1121
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,200
But it'd be like coupling with a flayed animal!

1122
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,260
Am I that low? Am I an animal?

1123
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,320
Yet... yet be... because of my birth defects,

1124
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,240
these pathetic creatures think I am a human.

1125
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,900
I am a mightier, nobler specimen of their own kind.

1126
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,040
Why, even among the most brilliant of the humans,

1127
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,840
I, the retarded Yeti, am as unto a god!

1128
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,000
They'll be my... my children!

1129
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,140
I'll be their king! Their culture-bringer!

1130
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,680
I shall parcel out knowledge!

1131
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:06,020
And so rationalizing, the embittered, runt Yeti laid him down

1132
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,040
with the beasts of the field.

1133
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,220
And that, dear friends, was the fall.

1134
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,240
He was the traitor Yeti,

1135
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,200
the sick one who committed the first sin

1136
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,720
by contaminating the famed human seed

1137
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,740
with the higher divine spark that the Yeti alone is meant to possess.

1138
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,320
Alas, he was not the last Yeti sinner,

1139
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,860
for even in Mutantis as today,

1140
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,640
some of the youth were so jaded and spoiled

1141
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,160
that in their decadence they mimicked the traitor's disgusting ways,

1142
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,420
for they were of a reprobate mind,

1143
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,340
given over to vile affections.

1144
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:55,720
And so, millions of sins later came we,

1145
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,500
the Yetinsani,

1146
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:02,620
misbegotten spawn of the Yeti and Homo sapiens.

1147
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,840
The traitor fell so in love with his adopted humans

1148
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,200
that he plunged even further into depravity,

1149
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,580
teaching humanity the forbidden sciences,

1150
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,740
revealing to them many secrets of Yeti technology.

1151
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,820
He convinced himself that they could actually think and reason.

1152
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:23,860
He mistook monkey brightness for innate intelligence.

1153
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,860
But humans can be only knob-twiddlers.

1154
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,920
Incapable of original ideas,

1155
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,600
they depend on the inventions of subgenius,

1156
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,780
for all real technological progress.

1157
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,940
Any new thoughts the pinks do have

1158
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:42,180
are based solely on what occasionally vomits up

1159
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,700
from the buried archetypes implanted by the Yetis.

1160
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,320
The lonesome Yeti is therefore remembered as the Dark One,

1161
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,540
he who deceived and led astray

1162
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,220
the Prometheus of the Titans,

1163
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:01,680
who in his vanity brought man fire and gave him thought.

1164
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,220
And has been regretting it ever since,

1165
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,140
chained up on some mountaintop,

1166
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,680
getting his liver eternally picked by vultures,

1167
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:15,080
cursed with immortality of the very worst kind.

1168
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,280
But miscegenation and bestiality alone

1169
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,580
would not have meant the end of Mutantus.

1170
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,140
The first high Yeti, King Bob,

1171
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,740
and his love police

1172
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,640
could have taken action to halt the perversions.

1173
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,280
But an unnatural cataclysm was to divert the attention of the Yeti

1174
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,040
and allow the escape of the humans.

1175
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,580
The events leading to the destruction of the Great Crystal

1176
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,840
and subsequent disasters is a moving and tragic story,

1177
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,340
unfortunately we can only encapsulate it here.

1178
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,120
Suffice it to say that two Yeti in heat

1179
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,640
got carried away while in close proximity

1180
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,500
to that crystal which powered all of Mutantus.

1181
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,400
This was an aberrant lust.

1182
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,880
Mutantian law forbade the queen of all tarnation

1183
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,460
to consort with a lowly high janitor

1184
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,600
in the broom closet of the temple of the Great Crystal.

1185
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,640
Worse, it was the wrong season

1186
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,980
for these two particular Yeti sex-castes to mate.

1187
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,580
But they couldn't wait, so enamored were they.

1188
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,580
And while they enjoyed the throes

1189
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,380
of a freakishly powerful illicit,

1190
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,520
exogasm,

1191
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,400
their orgasmatic radiations produced

1192
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,360
violent, uncontrollable telekinetic effects

1193
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,660
like poltergeists the size of the Transamerica pyramid.

1194
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,600
The unleashing of these titanic forces

1195
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,720
shattered the Great Crystal.

1196
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,800
This triggered the great earthquakes,

1197
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,520
volcanoes and other cataclysms

1198
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,780
which caused the Earth's magnetic polarities

1199
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,720
to switch places,

1200
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,640
which in turn initiated another dreaded continental seesaw.

1201
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,160
The great landmass of Tarnatia

1202
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,620
began gradually to sink beneath the waves

1203
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:09,400
and the surrounding seafloors started their dreadful rise

1204
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,240
into the forms of the continents we inhabit today.

1205
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,020
During the fall of Mutantus,

1206
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,880
the humans, aided by the embittered,

1207
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,420
mentally deficient dwarf albino Yeti,

1208
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,960
bolted into the wilderness.

1209
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:26,340
Despite their weakness and plank brainpans,

1210
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,000
these Yeti-trained escapees,

1211
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,160
who called themselves the Fweegors,

1212
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,840
not only migrated away from the sinking continent

1213
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,580
and survived,

1214
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,900
but went on to mingle with less evolved hominids,

1215
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,860
further corrupting the Yeti seed

1216
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,080
and diluting it among every other

1217
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,480
vaguely bipedal species they could get their hands on,

1218
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,000
and then some.

1219
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,980
The Yeti's ultimate mistake, however,

1220
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,280
wasn't in creating the humans,

1221
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,720
but in creating them to be dutiful slaves.

1222
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,320
Once they'd fled the all-important guidance

1223
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,560
of their Yeti masters,

1224
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,900
the blank spot in the brainpan was wide open

1225
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,500
so the humans could fill it up themselves,

1226
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,800
usually with the first awe-inspiring thing they happened upon,

1227
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,820
like a frightened animal,

1228
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:16,980
their mom,

1229
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,720
hallucinogenic berries,

1230
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,020
a head injury or a medicine man in a scary headdress.

1231
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,200
No matter how crazy it was,

1232
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,700
they always thought they had finally arrived.

1233
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,120
They achieved free will by way of this

1234
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,020
a savior,

1235
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:31,680
god,

1236
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,580
or ritual behavior.

1237
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,000
And inevitably,

1238
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,000
the more wily ones found out how easy it was

1239
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,780
to reload the blank brainpans of others.

1240
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,540
If through ritual,

1241
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,680
a human could fill his fellow's brain gaps

1242
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,000
and thus convince them their lives meant something,

1243
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,960
they could be coerced into absurd activities,

1244
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,620
like building huge useless stone temples

1245
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:58,340
and tombs.

1246
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,480
Thousands of them could be made to mutilate their own bodies

1247
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,540
just so they could be part of the same club.

1248
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,320
But someone else would be giving other humans

1249
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,020
an opposite set of commandments.

1250
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,140
The various clans would ceaselessly fight each other

1251
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,540
and punish themselves without ever really knowing

1252
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,820
why they were doing any of it.

1253
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,380
Once they started programming themselves,

1254
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,540
the Hwee-gors were like a biological warfare.

1255
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,500
They had just enough intelligence and ability

1256
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,740
to manipulate tools,

1257
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,760
but also sufficient frustration

1258
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,560
to use those tools to tear to pieces

1259
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,660
anything in their path.

1260
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,700
As the humans spread across the earth,

1261
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:50,660
most yeti became nauseated at a world blanketed with pinks

1262
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,420
and voluntarily shed their mortal coils

1263
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,940
to move on to some much higher plane.

1264
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:57,700
But the Hwee-gors were not the only ones

1265
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:57,700


1266
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,020
to be killed by the Hwee-gors.

1267
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,260
Others, the shameful missing yeti,

1268
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,600
those who had sinned, fled earth.

1269
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,600
None know where they went.

1270
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,080
Possibly they were sent away by the Exus

1271
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,680
as punishment for ruining the plan.

1272
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:13,200
Forced to breed gas whales on Jupiter

1273
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,840
or to change the bedpans of the vacated Exus bodies

1274
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,020
in storage on Toxima Regulus.

1275
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:24,320
A handful of devolved yeti remain here on earth.

1276
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,520
Phase shifted halfway into the seventh dimension

1277
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,640
so that we cannot see them,

1278
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,500
appearing to us only rarely

1279
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,120
and only when there are no witnesses.

1280
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,100
reagents.

1281
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,460
Stay tuned at Beamos.

1282
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,400
I got a note,

1283
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,140
Oh!

1284
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,340
This is my first single 들rory recording

1285
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:14,600
and here are the names of the haters theoted

1286
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,540
all around the universe.

1287
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:20,000
Neither coconut or liquid folding

1288
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,560
nor something I use to thrilled as Patreon

1289
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:23,820
the real Bat Под

1290
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:29,560
covered in the book of the subgenius but basically in short the Uyghurs eventually

1291
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:35,760
formed to their own empire Mu the Empire of the Sun which stretched across what

1292
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,800
is now Asia and Africa with only a few hundred thousand within only a few

1293
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,720
hundred thousand years after the fall of Mutantis they had hunted all the

1294
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:52,080
dinosaurs to extinction Jehovah one could see where this was heading and

1295
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:58,640
displeased with the quality of his breeding stock wiped the slate clean by

1296
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:04,700
destroying the Uyghur Empire with another great magnetic cataclysm the

1297
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:09,700
space god preserved a handful of sample Uyghurs who incidentally were physically

1298
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:15,240
identical to modern man and teleported them 80 million years into the future

1299
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:20,260
where they suddenly popped into existence in the early Stone Age the

1300
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,900
majority of the Uyghurs were

1301
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:22,060
the Uyghurs were

1302
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:22,060


1303
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:27,380
forced evolved back down to the primal and for focus stage and evolution took

1304
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:33,740
over more or less as described in modern non creationist textbook it took another

1305
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:39,220
80 million years for humanity quote-unquote to painfully re-evolved up

1306
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:46,400
to the Neanderthal stage and at that point less than 100,000 years ago the

1307
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,440
small army of Uyghurs from the past reappeared on earth by divine

1308
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,000
intervention

1309
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:59,060
and promptly massacred or enslaved and bred out almost all the Neanderthal the

1310
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:08,420
modern conspiracy exists by exploiting that blank spot inserted in our cerebrum

1311
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:14,800
by the Yeti it is still there and that is why all over the world religions and

1312
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,980
nations keep descending to fiendish human sacrifice in one form or another

1313
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,980
usually this brutality is not the only reason for the Neanderthal to be so evil and the Neanderthal is the reason for the Neanderthal's death.

1314
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:26,600
currently as disguised as patriotism economic or fun

1315
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:38,280
can exploit the fact that the yeti gene never completely disappeared and can still be hurt by

1316
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,540
simplified the recording part for additional

1317
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:40,540


1318
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:45,100
pin those rare randy yeti couldn't resist sleeping out from the seven

1319
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,660
dimension 2 seduce or a Energy We northeast odi

1320
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:48,720
me

1321
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,160
could give up

1322
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,140
szintzi

1323
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:51,900
years of yeti

1324
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:58,320
lustfulness, persistence, and fiendish cleverness have maintained a constant small population

1325
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,360
of Yetinsani throughout history.

1326
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:06,560
The continuous family tree of we who carry on the taint.

1327
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:13,860
We the revenge of the Neanderthals, the heirs of the Yeti.

1328
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,660
Was then the conspiracy an accident?

1329
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:24,400
Bob himself has suggested that the Yeti were patsies, victims of a double cross.

1330
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,960
That the Elder Gods engineered all of it.

1331
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,220
From the mistakes in designing the humans and the wrecking of the great crystal, to

1332
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:35,880
the crazed degenerate interbreeding between Yeti and beasts.

1333
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:43,460
The starvation, despair, and turmoil which envelop our planet now are exactly what the

1334
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:47,160
Elder Gods have been lusting for all along.

1335
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:47,640
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

1336
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:55,460
All of our accomplishments as a species, all our great art, philosophy, and culture.

1337
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,760
For what?

1338
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:03,660
Just to keep us fighting and overpopulating and polluting so a bunch of discarnate beings

1339
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:10,140
in another dimension can cop a buzz off the pain stored in our souls?

1340
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,640
No!

1341
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,680
No!

1342
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:17,640
For Dobbs is he who takes advantage of us.

1343
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,660
And profited from these great mistakes.

1344
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:31,760
Only Bob has dared to stand up against the course of history and try to steer his people

1345
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,980
back onto the true road.

1346
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:40,760
Within our genes, we know that we are meant to cleave to the true Yeti blood.

1347
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:44,160
To reawaken the divine monad.

1348
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,220
To regain original slack.

1349
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:51,920
That's the grail towards which we strive.

1350
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,020
But we are frustrated at every turn except in our oozing and squirting.

1351
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,220
There it can be found.

1352
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,540
It's buried deep, but in the right circumstances one can access it.

1353
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,000
One can neither create it nor uncreate it.

1354
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:10,860
It is a matter of reaching it.

1355
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,520
Of being able to perceive it.

1356
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,800
Of tapping into it.

1357
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,200
Simply to know that it exists.

1358
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:17,300
To know.

1359
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:20,160
To fully know it's there.

1360
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,700
It's the first step.

1361
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,660
Then, then one can worry about approaching it.

1362
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,520
If you can conceive of it, you are practically free.

1363
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:37,620
You can begin to step away from the landscape and exercise true self-determination like

1364
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,020
a real subgenius.

1365
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,780
Though it might be postponed.

1366
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,960
Though it might be postponed, friends.

1367
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,300
Your biological destiny cannot be avoided.

1368
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,200
So, face it.

1369
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:58,340
You possess the jaw and teeth.

1370
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,440
The jaw and the teeth of an ape.

1371
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,480
But the skull of a human.

1372
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:08,780
You are Piltdown Man.

1373
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,120
You helped create the conspiracy.

1374
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,580
Now, 80 million years later.

1375
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,180
You are Piltdown Man.

1376
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:17,180


1377
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,280
You must help to destroy it.

1378
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,860
And dear friends.

1379
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:36,900
You can help destroy the conspiracy bar.

1380
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:40,380
Right away for free information from the Church of the Subgenius.

1381
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,100
I'm going to give that post office box.

1382
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,940
And all you gotta do.

1383
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,080
If you drop us a self-addressed stamped envelope.

1384
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,820
Addressed to Bob.

1385
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:50,880
Why?

1386
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:55,000
Well, you just have to see what you get.

1387
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,240
But there's a lot more.

1388
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,600
A lot more than this poor little radio show.

1389
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,020
And you can get that from Bob.

1390
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:07,920
Just write to Bob at post office box.

1391
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,100
1-4-0-3-0-6.

1392
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,200
Dallas, Texas.

1393
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:16,820
752.

1394
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:17,980
1-4.

1395
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,920
Yes, that's Dallas, Texas.

1396
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,620
752.

1397
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,880
1-4.

1398
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:27,820
And that post office box once again is box 1-4-0-3-0-6.

1399
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,500
Ugh.

1400
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,740
So beiiing rot everywhere.

1401
00:57:58,740 --> 00:57:58,740


1402
00:57:58,740 --> 00:57:59,460
I going to the pro wall.

1403
00:57:59,460 --> 00:57:59,460


1404
00:57:59,460 --> 00:57:59,460

1406
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,720
Nochnagh.

1407
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,560
Nochnagh.

1408
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,440
