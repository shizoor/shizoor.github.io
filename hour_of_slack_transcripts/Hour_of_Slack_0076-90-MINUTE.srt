I'm trying to make believe I'm you, trying to fix

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,140
Just a stranger on the outside looking in

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:18,200
People say that life is fun, but I don't know why

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:27,260
As far as I can tell, life sucks, life sucks, life sucks

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,900
Then you die

6
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:35,620
Within the last 12 hours, we have received a number of unconfirmed reports from throughout the nation

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,200
that may or may not be connected with this strange phenomenon.

8
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,320
Bob?

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,440
I'm sick and tired of the past

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,440
I can't talk to shit, don't wait

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,240
I'm sick and tired of the past

Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of the watch.

Brace for hyper misogyny.

The church of the subgenius bring you another 33 minutes of condensed raglik function.

Quality audio visual techniques.

Wow.

Oh, Dr. Sprint.

43
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:16,960
She said, cutting her own legs off in what was to be the foe-ment of a startlingly trend among the so-called punk de-tele-hensia.

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,280
Hensia.

45
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,760
Better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.

46
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,380
Enjoy life like Bob.

47
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,320
Get to your heads, Satan.

48
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,220
Do not be afraid.

49
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,080
I am not here to harm you.

50
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,480
I know you want to destroy me.

51
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,740
But listen.

52
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,320
Please listen.

53
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,940
I only want to help you.

54
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,740
I've chosen you.

55
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,460
Well, I'm sure that's very flattering, but I must get on with my work now.

56
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,620
I don't love you, Bob.

57
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,100
I don't love you like I do.

58
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,700
I don't love you like I do.

59
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:51,700


60
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,740
I don't love you like I do.

00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,680
I don't love you like I do.

62
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:09,320
Dear friends, you may call 823-7490 for a complete explanation of the church of the subgenius in under two minutes.

63
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,040
It's not just the wars and the awards that win them.

64
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,440
It's not just the dull and emptiness taste for a smothered culture that exposes us to the world.

65
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,580
It's not just the fires all around you and pools of its own wastes.

66
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,160
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu.

67
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,280
It's not just the child zombies that murder their mediocrity parents and then cruise the streets with bloody feet.

68
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:43,700
It's not just those starry old vecks on the park benches with looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars of Belsen and Auschwitz.

69
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,420
It's not just the anesthesiologist Phrenides.

70
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,260
It's not just the

71
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:06,680
It's not just the broken headlights, snapped antennae, and human excrement on your car hood.

72
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,540
It's not just that the old ways were best.

73
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,100
It's not just the bastardization and perversion of every honest means of self-expression.

74
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,520
It's not just the Pinoy snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop.

75
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,780
It's not just the widescreen technicolor corporate daisy chain that has defiled the entire planet.

76
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,540
It's not just Mongo in the Congo with fa-fa-fas the size of basketballs.

77
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,100
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness.

78
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,400
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland, nonentity son of a bitch.

79
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,920
It's not just the

80
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,340
It's not just the

81
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,220
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world that you certainly never made.

82
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,740
It's not just the doorway to doom.

83
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,520
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

84
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,820
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max.

85
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,920
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.

86
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,780
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum-show.

87
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,360
I put it to you.

88
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,820
He's on the square and a corking fine.

89
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,100
Business proposition.

90
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,720
He's the grandest thing yet and don't you forget it.

91
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,800
Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus, you'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there, if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.

92
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,600
No.

93
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,880
He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

94
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,880
In his back pocket.

95
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,460
Just you try it.

96
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:10,420
Thanks to G. Gordon Gordon for that one and this is Reverend Cleve Duncan.

97
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,320
Well, it once was a man.

98
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,760
It once was a man.

99
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,100
The world's greatest salesman.

100
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,640
A salesman.

101
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,920
And he had to pass the pain to keep the shackles from my feet.

102
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,400
Ah, yeah, but now he's gone.

103
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,900
A martyr for the cause, the cause is my own.

104
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,540
And he's comin' again.

105
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,880
Who knew that the first shot.

106
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:42,960
The first shot.

107
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,580
Was gonna be the last shot.

108
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,660
But he's got a hard driving pipe.

109
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,000
The gas smoke all through the night.

110
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:02,280
And although he may be hurtin' the universe will keep on squirtin' all the smoke.

111
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,340
No.

112
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,560
And he's comin' again.

113
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,220
Oh, yes, dear friends.

114
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,640
We're gonna build that spirit back up.

115
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,040
And we're gonna build the spurt back up too.

116
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,980
Now, you know, spurt and spirit sound the same for a reason.

117
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,440
They're both from the same root word here, friends.

118
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,920
And what a root it is.

119
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,040
What a root it is.

120
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,860
I want you to get out there and plant those roots, children.

121
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,780
Oh, yeah.

122
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,380
Bob is my load.

123
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,600
And he's comin' again.

124
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,020
Oh.

125
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,260
He can save us from the many and black.

126
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,860
We're just a shot from his mighty sack.

127
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,520
If only he could make it back.

128
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,240
From the land of the dead.

129
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,560
But until that happy day.

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,340
We can only drink and say Bob is my load.

131
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,060
And he's comin' again.

132
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,800
Oh, yeah.

133
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,200
We can make it.

134
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,240
Without him, we can't take it.

135
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,680
We'll lose the pieces of our minds to the big boys and the whims.

136
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,880
Until the day that he comes back.

137
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,560
It'll be a world without slack.

138
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,600
Bob is my load.

139
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,120
And he's comin' again.

140
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,920
Yeah.

141
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,120
Oh.

142
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,520
Oh.

143
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,320
Oh, Bob is my load.

144
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,000
Bob is my load.

145
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,780
The names of our life.

146
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:47,780


147
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:47,780


148
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:47,780


149
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:47,780


150
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:47,780


151
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,740
Yes.

152
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,380
Yes.

153
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:49,820
Yes.

154
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,240
Yes.

155
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,560
Yes.

156
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,360
Yes.

157
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:52,360


158
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,500
Yes.

159
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:53,500


160
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:53,500


161
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:53,500


162
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:53,500


163
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:53,500


164
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:53,500


165
00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:00,440
This is going to be about how Bob is our load.

166
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:00,440


167
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,140
This is going to be mostly for those of you who have been regular listeners of the show.

168
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,580
And the rest of you probably oughta just go away.

169
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,500
Go to the bathroom for about a minute.

170
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:15,360
five ten minutes then come back for more horrible type well I got a letter here

171
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,020
friends a letter from sister Mandy and I'm gonna read this letter here it's

172
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,640
pertinent she says I hope the show pulls in what was promised it would be a cry

173
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,460
and shame if you had to die again but then again what was this this this

174
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,460
excretive deleted coming out of my radio last hour of slack actually she's

175
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,720
talking about two hours of slack ago two weeks ago I can't believe you would rag

176
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,220
on native Texans cuz they're not as rowdy as some chowderhead Yankees are

177
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:55,400
now your friends let me intercede here and say that it's not y'all's lack of

178
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,000
rowdiness at all but the lack of airplane tickets that you would provide

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,080
to get other subgenius preachers down here for a show

180
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,440
you're not allowed to get on the show you're not allowed to get on the show

181
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,220
but sister Mandy continues now I don't know if you are a real Texan or just a

182
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:14,120
transplant I'm sorry I know I don't sound like I was raised in North Richland

183
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:21,200
Hills and Fort Worth but maybe you like cold winter she says and the way they

184
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,380
say peck pitch farm and clam chowder maybe now we women a Texas aren't good

185
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:33,000
enough for old Reverend Ivan staying anymore is that it huh well no comment

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,280
there

187
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,180
but Texans are Bob's chosen it's always been that way but that's why it's so

188
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,980
disappointing that they don't act like it I certainly do

189
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,940
Mandy continues I don't know I can't believe that the subgenius is of Dallas

190
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,060
don't have the say cojones to manage to put together a butt-kicking glass

191
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:57,760
grinding splendiferous type D Bible and friends it's it's not the cojones is

192
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,940
needed but the energy and the know-how the art scam expertise and the fact that

193
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,460
she doesn't know if she'sendas and say it's because they're Algun provide

194
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,660
additional educating measure license for her sorry no learns reen thirds

195
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,900
only something to help and I can you know this was a I did notice is capable

196
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:23,720
of it so crammed with Boston BS pains so you're leader garageBut friends I tell

197
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,600
which the evil

198
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,280
digging universe starts up to talk about one day you know what viva example of

199
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,420
that and then when create a together myselfnau

200
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,200
because tattoo articles never will be checks and don't know when rolling out

201
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,920
your own ten thousand dollars but I certainly choose no credit is pay a standards great al перden you know the kind for fish folks who let you do any

202
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,960
extra VHS tape deck, which you operate in your own home.

203
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,720
She goes, yeah, I realize that your rant was meant to inflame,

204
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,500
but all it did was, well, I can't say this, but anger people.

205
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,920
And friends, I know that's true, and it's because I delivered it poorly.

206
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,580
She says, I know you can do better than that,

207
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,120
and that's true, I've had enough sleep.

208
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,320
Do something, I can't read the something to them if they can't take a joke.

209
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,340
Do more than anger them.

210
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,460
Challenge us.

211
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,140
And friends, some did take it as a challenge, which is how it was meant to be.

212
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,820
She says, Dallas loves stupid.

213
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,240
Look at some of our swinging singles meat lockers.

214
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,660
Have a national devival or something.

215
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,200
Aim for Dallas's cojones and threaten to have them kicked by San Francisco or something.

216
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,920
Make yourself the most hated man in Dallas,

217
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,100
for without hate there is no love, and without love there is no Bob.

218
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,760
Bob equals hate equals love.

219
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,740
Did you say that, or was it me?

220
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,980
It was me, Mandy.

221
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,640
I don't remember, but do it, Stang, I know you can.

222
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,920
Well, you know, when I've had enough sleep and had a little bit of slack,

223
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,540
usually, oh, what did that mean?

224
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,300
The music stopped all of a sudden.

225
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,480
But it's true, I couldn't agree with you more about that after Boston hour of slack,

226
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,560
because after I'd finally gotten to bed and slept for 13 hours,

227
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,620
I listened to that tape of the show and went, oh my God, I sound almost drunk.

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,520
But keep in mind that stupidity is certainly no sin in this church,

229
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,940
and I was just plain burned out, tired, tired, friends.

230
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,520
And on top of that, I was being facetious,

231
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,520
but I just wasn't being facetious well, so it came off the wrong way.

232
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,500
Now, you know, when you go for four hours of sleep a night, it happens.

233
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,320
You don't get the slack.

234
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,620
But then when I got to Boston, my buddies, Doctors for Bob and I, did get slack,

235
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:29,440
although it was partly slack through overwork, which is an unusual form of slack.

236
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,500
But many of us...

237
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:30,500


238
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:36,620
See, Mergentiles have to get slack that way, as opposed to you Rewardium types of geniuses,

239
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,940
who I envy, by the way.

240
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,200
But number one, you've got to remember that by definition,

241
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,200
a subgenius preacher has not only the right, but the obligation, dear friends,

242
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,560
to make severe and even tragic mistakes.

243
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,380
Now, look at the rival cults in some of your local Christian denominations, let's say,

244
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,020
that preach total goodness.

245
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,260
They preach perfection.

246
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,140
They live, friends, in a false, dangerous fantasy world.

247
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,220
And when they show their humanity, as Jim and Tammy Baker did,

248
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,040
oh, they're castigated by their people.

249
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,000
They're fired off their jobs.

250
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,140
And they sure look stupid.

251
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,320
They make Christianity look even stupider to the average American, which is okay with me.

252
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,840
But in their smug, self-deluding pride, friends, they set goals that are not only impossible,

253
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,680
but actually ridiculously unnecessary.

254
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,360
And when they can't attain those goals, then they just get more fanatical

255
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,400
and can't admit that they couldn't cut what they set up for themselves.

256
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:50,100
And their people are so strung out between constant states of false happiness or guilt.

257
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,380
I don't know.

258
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:58,200
We now know that Jim and Tammy, for all those years, were actually only acting happy.

259
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,500
But living that lie...

260
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,640
just compounded their misery.

261
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:10,040
And millions of people do this to themselves because they think God is as ignorant, intolerant, and insecure as they are.

262
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,420
But then that's their idea of wisdom and goodness, I guess.

263
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,720
Hiding their real feelings, living a lie, deliberately short-circuiting their instincts, pretending.

264
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,880
That's what they do. They're pretending, friends.

265
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:30,500
Now, you can accuse the subgeniuses of pretending, but, you know, in a way, they pretend much more than they do.

266
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:30,500


267
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,500
Much worse than we do.

268
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,480
So, when I come on the air and sound like a vindictive jerk, remember that at least I'm being honest.

269
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:45,200
If I'm beat, worn out, I don't take speed like Tammy Baker to pretend that I've got superhuman energy.

270
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,120
I act like I feel.

271
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:54,500
I prove beyond a doubt that I can be just as overextended, overwrought, insensitive, and incoherent as any of you.

272
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:00,160
And yet, even with all these personality flaws, weaknesses, and staccato speech patterns,

273
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,500
Yet, even with all these personality flaws, weaknesses, and staccato speech patterns,

274
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,460
yet I know that Bob gives me an excuse.

275
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,040
He doesn't need to forgive me because I didn't do anything evil.

276
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,660
I screwed up.

277
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,200
And, and Bob, Bob loves me for that.

278
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,140
It's the power to fail, friend.

279
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,000
It's the power that is the power that the sub-genius Pope's have and these rival Pope's can't ever have.

280
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,240
The irony, friend. The irony.

281
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,960
It's like with the pledge drives.

282
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,140
The businesses at H referral from 50% pay forلي,

283
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,500
are 50% payed for right now.

284
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:36,520
hour, probably more by now, but yet now those gospel folks, they pledged and pledged. They

285
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:44,580
pledged and pledged because they were so full of faith and only 10% at best, in some cases,

286
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:50,940
6% bothered to fulfill the commitment because in Christianity, pretending and promising is

287
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,740
good enough. And that's what faith means, friends. It means you've decided to be satisfied no matter

288
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:03,820
what, because you're going to pretend everything's okay. Oh, it's God's will. So therefore you don't

289
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:11,820
have to do anything about it. Leave it to God, dear friends. Grace through faith, not words.

290
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:18,300
Jesus said, be like children. And you know, Tammy can't go to bed with her husband without

291
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:25,500
keeping her fake eyelashes, her bat wing size fake eyelashes on. I read that in the paper today.

292
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,620
That's how you keep.

293
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,040
Your husband wear makeup to bed pretending friends. Yeah, they're like children. All right.

294
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:38,480
But they're like seventh grade children, cruel gossiping liars and bullies that roam in cliques

295
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,280
and packs looking for weak, unsuspecting minority victims. Oh, they have faith. All right. Faith

296
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:51,020
that any nasty thing they do didn't count. If God forgave it in their head. And if you're having the

297
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,340
kind of fun they can't experience, then you must, that must be sin because in their eyes, friends,

298
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:03,660
slack is the ultimate sin. The devil hates slack too. And when you look at the basic beliefs and

299
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,580
behavior of a lot of these fundamentalist Christians, they have a lot in common with

300
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,260
the devil friends, a whole lot more in common with the devil than Jesus. Now, subgenius is

301
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:19,520
rationalized too, but our rationalization is so absurd that it allows us the slack to remember

302
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,720
that it's just a rationalization and there's still work to do. Praise Bob.

303
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:33,720
Oh God. Here's this Tammy Baker interview. Yes. She rarely goes to bed without her makeup,

304
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:39,080
swears by her false eyelashes and wears different wigs for her husband, Jim. And that still wasn't

305
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,600
good enough, was it? No, Jessica, Jessica Hahn. She didn't have to change wigs every night.

306
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:50,800
Jim very seldom seen me without makeup and hardly ever in my life without my eyelashes.

307
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:56,420
I think every woman ought to wear eyelashes. Yeah. I think natural born eyelashes are kind of good

308
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:02,540
for you. They keep the water out of your eyes. The sweat, if you're inhuman enough to sweat,

309
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:10,560
unlike Miss Tammy. Um, oh God. Well, I've got more of that rant to go on, but in the meantime, until then.

310
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:26,640
And let me tell you, friends, it's not just the swelling coffers of the elder bankers.

311
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,940
It's not just the truncated attention spans of the conspiracy glors scrambling to get that

312
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:40,600
ever elusive status symbol. It's not just the vapid shells of the chicken like models posing

313
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,080
on cue. It's not just the puppet rock idols playing into the hands of the hell spawned

314
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,740
image consultants. It's not just the cannibal zombies gorging themselves on self-interest.

315
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,480
It's not just the video pigs wallowing in visual

316
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,640
sludge. It's not just the mellow morons stuck in a time zone from the good old days, man.

317
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:09,500
It's not just the aerobic airheads working themselves into a cardiac arrest. It's not

318
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:15,940
just the talentless pinks hooked into a groove devoid of style. It's not just the fuzzy dice

319
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,900
brains rampaging like the Visigoths. It's not just the misguided gummy space creatures.

320
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,460
It's not just the oppression of the raging slabs of the lame leftists.

321
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,480
It's not just the frothy mouths of the reactionaries. It's not just the blank food tubes slamming

322
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,940
their craniums against the walls of their own creation. It's not just the empty youth

323
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:45,660
culture borrowing from the ABC computerized format of possible personas. It's that and

324
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,400
a whole lot more.

325
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,200
Thank you, Sister Chris. We love you.

326
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,840
And thank you, Cecilia.

327
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,720
Let's join us now, shall we?

328
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,720
Yes, join us at the ankles and hips.

329
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,720
Thank you. Now we're ready to hop off to our special sky ride.

330
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,480
The Japanese...

331
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,340
Don't you wish you were with us? Well, send in your money and maybe someday you can.

332
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:26,280
No, really, we're a fun crowd. You'd like us to move in next door to you. To you, we'd be indistinguishable.

333
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:37,160
From the others you might see in your town. Oh, maybe we'd have a wink in our twinkling eye or a smile or a leer on our lips, but otherwise we'd look like everyday Joe Lunchbale.

334
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:47,000
A good, solid, honest, cream-colored working man. Ready to move in next to you and send the property values soaring. How about it, America? Get in step.

335
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,480
Well, let's try it out, huh?

336
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,680
For a typewritten transcript of this show, you'd have to be...

337
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,800
What's going on? I feel so sleepy.

338
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,160
Disobedient to parents.

339
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,800
You are...

340
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,780
A subgenius.

341
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,280
Come...

342
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,320
Steals.

343
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,700
A subgenius.

344
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,040
Lies.

345
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,340
A subgenius.

346
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,760
Hater of God.

347
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,280
A subgenius.

348
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,000
Call me a subgenius.

349
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,560
Whisperer.

350
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,060
A subgenius.

351
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,140
Whore monger.

352
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,400
A subgenius.

353
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,980
I call me a subgenius.

354
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:12,980


355
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,000
A subgenius.

356
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,720
On a micro-media scale.

357
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:14,880
Pride.

358
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,620
A subgenius.

359
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,960
A backbiter.

360
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,280
Ambient.

361
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,400
A subgenius.

362
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:19,500
Environmental.

363
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,020
A deceitful person.

364
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,160
Instantaneous.

365
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,820
Radical.

366
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,940
A hypocrite.

367
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,980
A subgenius.

368
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,120
All.

369
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,560
Unmerciful.

370
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,980
A subplenius.

371
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,600
A false accuser.

372
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,160
A subbenius.

373
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,820
Come here, you little subgenius.

374
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,080
Well, I guess that about wraps it up.

375
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,000
That's your typical subgenius now.

376
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,940
And, uh...

377
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,040
Monk, I don't need Dobbs.

378
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,180
There's nothing wrong with me.

379
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,260
I'll make it my way.

380
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,680
Oh, good.

381
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,040
Good.

382
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,060
I must have been insane.

383
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,520
What can I say?

384
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,020
I'm lost without Dobbs.

385
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,800
Without Bob, I'm guilty.

386
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,360
Guilty.

387
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:47,780
From sound sheets.

388
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,740
Be not deceived.

389
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,020
Dobbs is not mocked.

390
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,800
For whosoever a man soeth, him also shall he reap.

391
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:55,960
Where's the tripod?

392
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:55,960


393
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,100
Where's the tripod?

394
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,100


395
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,100


396
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,320
Where is my shepherd?

397
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,780
I shall not want.

398
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,580
That's right, dear friends.

399
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,760
That's right.

400
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,840
Uh, thank you, Reverend Howe.

401
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,700
I hate that old conspiracy as much as it hates me.

402
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,440
But me and Bob will get him.

403
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,500
Just you wait and see.

404
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,260
For as long as they have run things, they have turned them into...

405
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:21,640
Bob?

406
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,580
The time has come to get him back.

407
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,080
Here's how I look at it.

408
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


409
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


410
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


411
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


412
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


413
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


414
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


415
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


416
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


417
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


418
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


419
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


420
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


421
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


422
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


423
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


424
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


425
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,080


426
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:33,020
That conspiracy is nasty and they take it for their patsies, but we know that they

427
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:41,400
are just a bunch of queers and when we defeat them, we will kill them, and we'll eat them.

428
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,000
And then we'll go and get ourselves some beers.

429
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,620
Now Bob has come to fight them.

430
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,060
That's how we know we'll win.

431
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,920
And we know to serve them is our only sin.

432
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,080
So please don't be any fun.

433
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,080


434
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,080


435
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,080


436
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,080


437
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,080


438
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:01,040
We won't have long to wait now, the end is coming soon

439
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:06,000
We'll march happy toward the future, cause we did what we must do

440
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,060
Underwater vacations, Bob will rule all the nations

441
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,920
We'll be farming vegetation out on Mars

442
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,680
Cause we killed them and we ate them

443
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,200
Said boy we sure did hate them

444
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,720
And then we made the rounds of all the bars

445
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,460
Thank you Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger

446
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,300
Great stuff

447
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,200
So what are you guys going to do at this revival meeting?

448
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,320
You're going to make fun of religion stuff, right?

449
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,920
We never make fun of religion

450
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,260
You must understand we're making money off religion but not fun off religion

451
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,820
No, no, no, no fun

452
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,380
We hope to raise the slack area in this part of the country

453
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,320
We are missionaries, this is hard work, it's brutal

454
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,740
It's brutal and gruesome work

455
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,520
And hopefully we'll

456
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,160
Let's move the position

457
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,080
Yes, sir

458
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,840
Really now, are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks or do you

459
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,720
Mr. Wilsey, isn't it a fact really that you've invented this whole thing

460
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,400
That you've thought up all these little gimmicks

461
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,260
And you're taking advantage of a lot of ignorant people by getting money out of them

462
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,000
People who believe in you and your silly preachings

463
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,600
No it isn't, Joe

464
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,300
I don't have to

465
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,700
The Illuminati will be on the air next week

466
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,220
Unmasked

467
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,700
And the subgenius cult will have a lot to do with that

468
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:34,220
Bob is going to see that the whole conspiracy, the Illuminati, the trilaterals, you name it

469
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,960
The guys that drive up and down the street selling ice cream

470
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,660
All of that will be exposed

471
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,600
That's what America needs

472
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,340
To have their brains washed

473
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,320
Clean out all that filth and all that garbage and all that fear

474
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,540
And all that sickness and perversion

475
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,680
And all that junk that comes from the pit of hell

476
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,100
Radio now

477
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,680
Radio now

478
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,440
Many friends of the real land

479
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,960
This is the old fashioned healing broadcast

480
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,420
Coming direct from the auditorium here in Dallas

481
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,520
This is a special night tonight

482
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,720
This is oil night

483
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,120
Would you love to have a heart like God?

484
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,180
Come out and be anointed with this miracle oil

485
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,580
That God has let me use for quite a few years now

486
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,100
And we're giving it out

487
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,740
Come and join the hundreds of people

488
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
Bring that bottle

489
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,840
And get some of this miracle oil

490
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,860
That's absolutely raised the dead

491
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,340
And has performed some of the greatest miracles

492
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,080
You name it

493
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,660
It's performed ever known miracles

494
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,740
that it's happening.

495
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,080
But look, it's...

496
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,800
Oh, hell, look out!

497
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,120
You clumsy fools!

498
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,500
What have you done?

499
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,100
The show is ruined!

500
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:35,920
Ruined!

501
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,460
Goodbye for all of us here.

502
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,800
This is Puzzle Day and its loveliest wrecks,

503
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,520
Reverend Howe and Reverend Earp.

504
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,140
We tried.

505
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,880
It's too late, and we trummed.

506
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,660
Goodbye, folks.

507
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,100
I have a moral workshop.

508
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,140
The whole thing's ridiculous.

509
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,420
Oh!

510
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,220
The U.S. Customs Service is waging war on drug smugglers,

511
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,240
and you can help.

512
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,240
If you see any unusual activity involving private boats or planes

513
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,380
that might be connected to drug smuggling,

514
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:11,260
call the U.S. Customs Service 24 hours a day, toll-free,

515
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,420
at 1-800-BE-ALERT.

516
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,740
You can remain anonymous, and you could receive a cash reward

517
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,880
if your information leads to the arrest and prosecution of drug smugglers.

518
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,820
Help stop drug smuggling.

519
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,180
Call 1-800.

520
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,300
Be alert.

521
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,040
I can't believe they gave me that cart to play on this show, honest to God.

522
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,580
Well, if you want to get...

523
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,400
If you want to be damned by Bob...

524
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,620
What's going on?

525
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,880
What's going on?

526
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,160
What's going on?

527
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,320
What's going on?

528
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:55,480
What's going on?

529
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:55,760
What's going on?

530
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,900
Let's talk about another one, which is a conspiracy that tries to control you.

531
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:00,500
What's going on?

532
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,000
What's going on?

533
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,260
What's going on?

534
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,880
Do you think that freedom in this great society, in this great planet, is voting?

535
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:07,800
No.

536
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,220
Say no.

537
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,780
No.

538
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,340
No.

539
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:09,420
No.

540
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,160
Didn't they get to vote in Haiti?

541
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,440
Yes.

542
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,040
Say yes.

543
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:13,800
Yes.

544
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,140
Yes.

545
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,260
Yes.

546
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,520
Didn't they get to vote in the Philippines?

547
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,380
Yes.

548
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:16,960
Yes.

549
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,340
Don't they get to vote in Poland?

550
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,180
Say yes.

551
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:19,640
Yes.

552
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:19,960
Yes.

553
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,160
Joe, didn't they get to vote?

554
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,660
We think they're going to be a plunder of legal when there's only one candidate in the U.S.

555
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:24,660


556
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,600
Say no.

557
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,320
Say no.

558
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,320


559
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,300
No.

560
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:27,300


561
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,160
Because, Joe, you know, the rest of the world perceives as freedom as consumer goods.

562
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,440
Of course, specifically American consumer goods.

563
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,460
And, Joe, we're drowning in consumer goods.

564
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,740
We're drowning in images as a country.

565
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:49,000
But, Joe, when you hear the 501 Blues and your heart sings, or you see Spuds McKenzie,

566
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,900
then high concept is getting inside of you, Joe.

567
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,640
It's getting inside of you.

568
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,180
Now, I know.

569
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,180
You're all artists.

570
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,300
You're all in the raw web.

571
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,620
You're a bunch of deconstructing fiends.

572
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,220
I know that, Joe.

573
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,840
I know you can sit there and watch those ads and you can say, ooh, look at that jump cut.

574
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,220
Woo!

575
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,580
Look at that computer animation.

576
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,220
Woo!

577
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,420
Look at that keybinder.

578
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,880
And you think by deconstructing it, you kept the message from getting into you.

579
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,320
But I'm going to tell you something, Joe.

580
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:14,920
Now, I'm right here.

581
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm here to tell you that we are not that sort.

582
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,860
That's right, Joe.

583
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,440
We're not that goddamn sort.

584
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,140
We are not able to resist those messages.

585
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,280
They get inside of us.

586
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,640
They work it up.

587
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,700
And before you know it, you're another high-debt dude out of the conspiracy.

588
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,740
I'm going to give you another example, Joe.

589
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:43,020
They say that in the NFL, between steroids and weightlifting, football players have gotten

590
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,520
so big and so fast that the human body can no longer sustain the impact they generate.

591
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,000
And the same thing is true by analogy, by extent, by metaphor.

592
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,380
In the world of advertising, the images they generate are so slick, we can no longer resist.

593
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,320
We cannot attain our will.

594
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,260
We cannot make a specific judgment.

595
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,780
We cannot simply ask the other to listen to us.

596
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,680
Oh, boy.

597
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,880
I have to cut in here.

598
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,580
Oh, that was Pope David Meyer two weeks ago in Boston, Massachusetts.

599
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,060
Pretty soon I ought to have a better recording of all the rants from there.

600
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,980
Jayner was there.

601
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,600
A whole bunch of good stuff.

602
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,320
Anyway, I had to cut in because the Will of Dobs just got a call from someone who said

603
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,340
that they had called the cult awareness group.

604
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:35,340
There's a group here in Dallas called Cult Awareness and had called them up just to see

605
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,520
what they would say about the Church of the Subgenius.

606
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,940
And the funny thing is that when they first opened, I called them up and said,

607
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:50,580
yeah, I'm kind of concerned about these insane cults myself, and I thought I'd send you some

608
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:50,580


609
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,180
of our material so you could refer people to us.

610
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,940
And apparently they didn't like the material I sent.

611
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,400
I'd never heard from them since then.

612
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,780
But they're now telling people, whatever you do, stay away from those guys.

613
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,880
That subgenius guy, man, that's the worst.

614
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,240
And especially what?

615
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,780
Keep your kids away from them?

616
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,460
Especially keep your kids away from the Church of the Subgenius because of the sexually explicit material.

617
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,580
Now, see, y'all that only listen to the radio show, you can't do that.

618
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:20,580


619
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:25,620
You don't know what you're missing.

620
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,420
And who don't order the tapes.

621
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,980
But I can't advertise that stuff.

622
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:40,960
And all you can really do is write for information from P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas 75214

623
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,660
for more information about Church of the Subgenius.

624
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,540
And for that sexually explicit material, which you don't get for free, by the way.

625
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,480
Not like...

626
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,440
I mean, you get this radio show for free and get our information for free.

627
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,500
And it's not very sexually explicit.

628
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:07,780
But like I say, those of you who've been putting off writing to P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas 75214,

629
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,540
fine, I don't care.

630
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,580
Honestly, I really don't.

631
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,000
I always end up getting the last laugh, dear friends.

632
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,060
I have total confidence that that will continue to be true.

633
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:26,280
So, you know, I can't tell you what the deal is with the money, but...

634
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,620
Gotta get some money!

635
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:33,300
That dirty, perky, shark-backed, black-and-wharton, filibuster-barton, perkaluma...

636
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,500
Only we know what we don't know.

637
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:43,300
And when we do know it, we shall find out later just exactly what it was that we didn't know.

638
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,640
But, in the meantime, we shall experiment.

639
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,440
And delve into the deeper recesses of the human mind.

640
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:58,420
To find out exactly what causes this device not to function properly.

641
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,320
Could it be a malfunction of the foot gland?

642
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,200
Or the nose gland?

643
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:13,180
Yes, possibly you did not know that the nose and the feet are true glands of the human body.

644
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:18,620
And only after permanent foot and nose...

645
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:19,940
...glandscaping...

646
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,040
...can you know how to make your feet smell and your nose run.

647
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,660
Which would mean, possibly, that you were backwards.

648
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,440
Or...built upside down.

649
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,520
But...you'll delve further into that...

650
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,240
...at the end of the broadcast...

651
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,200
...when you and I cannot hear each other.

652
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,140
Oh, that was Dr. Philodrumon, dear friends.

653
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,640
And we can get into this, too.

654
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,660
The psychoneurotic mastosurgery.

655
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:56,040
The techniques of which has been developed by the many great doctors...

656
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:02,040
...who have come over to Dobbs and from many of the other religious cults around the world.

657
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,020
I ain't been the same since I had my first little lobotomy.

658
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,800
And it's...we've got Europeans and Lithuanians and ice doctors and the big doctors...

659
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,040
...and the doctors of the trees...

660
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,040
...and the tree-walking brain socket doctors.

661
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,780
We can do a song about doctors.

662
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,320
And here...hyperclites...

663
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,560
Here it is.

664
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,020
Dr. Philodrumon.

665
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,900
Doctors...

666
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,820
...for Bob.

667
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,820
Doctors for Bob and everything real in my life.

668
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,820
Doctors and Bob and everything real in my life.

669
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,340
Oh, really, my life.

670
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:54,220
Damn pickup truck come out of the blue done run over my wife.

671
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,200
He's got the blues cause they run over his wife.

672
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,580
Some of you gonna get mad at me.

673
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,660
Jesus ain't in the church.

674
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,540
Don't turn the radio off. Keep it on.

675
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,280
And I wouldn't infer that, uh...

676
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,980
...that our Secretary of State...

677
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,680
...is Antichrist.

678
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,440
But I'm telling you that preparations are being made.

679
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:28,160
And that the very, uh...the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand.

680
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,540
And that if you plan to get saved...

681
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,420
...you had better do it now.

682
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,960
There will be a day not in the too far distant future...

683
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,220
...in which Antichrist will be revealed...

684
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,980
...and the mark of the beast will be introduced...

685
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,840
...and people will...

686
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,340
...have a number...

687
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,160
...in their hands and in their foreheads.

688
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,700
There will be given a...

689
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,040
...computerized number, if you please...

690
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,740
...that will entitle them to do business in this world...

691
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,860
...and with it, you can starve.

692
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,480
We have a lot to do in a very short time.

693
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,140
Boy, you aren't kidding.

694
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,600
And that's the way I've felt for quite a while.

695
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,900
Get ready to ease out of orbit.

696
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,880
Ah, you bet, honey.

697
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,780
That's what we're gonna try to do.

698
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,960
I have never flown a city before.

699
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,740
Many of you in this stadium have been deceived.

700
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,700
I think they'll pass the $10 bridge when they come back.

701
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,560
The original concept was that...

702
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,880
...throughout history, all great geniuses...

703
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,900
...had somebody at their side...

704
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,400
...that was kind of steering them.

705
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,300
You know what I mean?

706
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,640
So you say that person is...

707
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,960
That was the subgenius.

708
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,620
He was the guy that was really...

709
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:55,280
He was making sure the genius was used to his proper potential.

710
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:55,960
Right.

711
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,040
And for the right reasons.

712
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,360
That's why the name is misleading, you know?

713
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,400
Now, I want you to hear a little of the service...

714
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,240
...where the Holy Spirit was using me...

715
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,780
...with the gift of discernment.

716
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,860
I was ministering in the service...

717
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,100
...with the Spirit.

718
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,620
God was showing me things about people I didn't know...

719
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,600
...I'd never seen before.

720
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,160
But the Lord was talking to me.

721
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,180
God was talking and I was walking.

722
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,180
Listen to a little of this right now.

723
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,100
And you have come to the end of your rope.

724
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,540
I don't know which way to turn.

725
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,640
Give me money!

726
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,900
It's starting to affect your nerves.

727
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,200
Give me money!

728
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,920
And sleepless nights.

729
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,080
It's affecting my mind.

730
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:34,900
I want to kill my husband.

731
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,560
Today we're gonna put this in the hand of God.

732
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,440
Kill my husband.

733
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,460
In the Bible in two different places.

734
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:45,340
A handful of meal brought a miracle.

735
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,860
I want you to hold that envelope open.

736
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,100
Let's see if we save my life.

737
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,640
Save my life!

738
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,260
I'm gonna pour it in this envelope.

739
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:54,920
Ha ha!

740
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,540
Now.

741
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,220
The future of your usefulness to us...

742
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,320
...brought to you in living simulbursts.

743
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:14,220
From the depths of the third to simple lives of the Church of the Subgenius.

744

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,040

749
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:37,300
75214.

750
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:37,300


751
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,300
Read.

752
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,700
Moo!

753
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,560
Yes, ma'am.

754
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:42,560


755
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:42,560


756
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:42,560


757
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:42,560


758
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:42,560


759
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,180
We're available now on supplementary forms.

760
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,100
Through our offices in Dallas.

761
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
539

762
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:51,400


763
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,320
1-3-3-3-5

764
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,380
100-5-例えば

765
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,120
The money is in the envelope.

766
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,040
Slag.

767
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,140
Slack...

768
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,920
slow.

769
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,620
In some ways, the brain is less important to a subgenius than to a pink.

770
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:22,180
Being less intuitive, pinks need more brains than we do.

771
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:26,120
Their value system is based on intelligence rather than good sense,

772
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:31,880
which is related not so much to thinking as to the feelings of the heart and the foot.

773
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,460
As mentioned before, however foolish it may sound,

774
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,940
the subgenius foot doubles as a gland, and a very complex gland at that.

775
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:48,580
It leads you the way you need to be treated by intuiting the world around you

776
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,160
so subtly that you rarely notice its machinations.

777
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,240
It was discovered by Dr. Philo Drummond,

778
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,020
and he best explained its functioning in this excerpt from his daily radio show,

779
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,860
On the Road.

780
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,780
So named.

781
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,060
Because it is usually recorded in a car.

782
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:04,660
Or money.

783
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,180
Self-worth.

784
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,400
Or money.

785
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,400
To love people because they need it.

786
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,020
Or their money.

787
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,500
I believe it's something God puts in us.

788
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,060
Or what else does God put in us?

789
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,140
I wish he'd give us some money, huh?

790
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,240
Yeah.

791
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,640
Oh, the money.

792
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:28,280
Oh, if we could truly know nothing only.

793
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,620
Reinforcing the powers.

794
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,220
Of the brain and foot gland is a small secondary brain at the base of the subgenius spine.

795
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:42,360
The mighty stegosaurus also possessed this organ, which made it tweet like a bird.

796
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:47,420
It helped it direct the reproductive and eliminative systems that are so important to us.

797
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,080
Another gland unknown to normals is the peen gland in the brain,

798
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:59,920
which regulates the eight separate stages or character generations through which the subgenius personality evolves during an average day.

799
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,860
Literally, eight separate stages.

800
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:06,800
Eight different personalities each have control at the jessie helm of behavior at varied intervals.

801
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,360
We each contain eight people in our corrugated, rugated subconsciousness.

802
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,500
The actual average human has but four.

803
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,300
Good, bad, bland, and asleep.

804
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,660
The last thought by some scholars to overpower the others for up to 18 hours a day.

805
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:29,960
These different personalities account for the compartmentalization of the subgenius brain into eight distinct units or efficiencies.

806
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,840
In the descending order...

807
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,380
First, the left brain.

808
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:40,400
The peen brain, which controls paranoia, anal compulsion, overwork, or my thinking.

809
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,140
Then the north brain, the make brain or take brain.

810
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,540
It handles jobs and money.

811
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:53,000
The south brain, the fake brain or talk brain, which covers the grey and limbic areas of speech, writing and lying.

812
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,560
Then the hind brain.

813
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,740
The me brain.

814
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,460
The pivotal braille center brain.

815
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,680
The private view right.

816
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,460
Biggie back.

817
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,140
and is unaffected by drugs or religion.

818
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,700
Bob comes in on this channel.

819
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,180
Then the forebrain, the sane brain,

820
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,040
which covers love, friendship, traditional family values

821
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,620
called by some the tame brain.

822
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,020
The inner brain, or sex brain, is self-explanatory.

823
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,620
Finally, the right brain, or lame brain, or more brain,

824
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,860
depending on your orientation,

825
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,980
art, music, drug addiction.

826
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,040
And the eighth brain, the outer brain,

827
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,060
is a pseudo-physical shell,

828
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,140
encasing not only the other brains,

829
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,620
but the entire body.

830
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,480
This diffuse brain,

831
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:42,440
larger but far less controllable than the others,

832
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,620
is the nental life.

833
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,320
The nental life represents fully half of our brain power,

834
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,900
but because it is so independent from us,

835
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,520
we can rarely make use of it.

836
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,380
Occasionally, a subgenius comes along

837
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,020
whose nental life is the nental life.

838
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,960
The nental life is incorporated into his thinking processes.

839
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:08,240
Such less subgeniuses were Da Vinci, Einstein, and Curly Howard.

840
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,280
For most of us, however, the nental life is a separate entity,

841
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,060
a semi-conscious ghost twin

842
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,360
which mindlessly follows the physical vessel about,

843
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:23,000
but remains dormant throughout most of our lives.

844
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:44,920
but remains dormant throughout most of our lives.

845
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:53,920
Each of us has a hidden alien identity tint comfortably

846
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,440
The nental style does not appear to be familiar with the physical airlowner's issues.

847
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:56,440


848
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:56,540
The feeling of a reliant on some of something he or she it seemsüber novels

849
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,320
However, virtual and experience do not Democracy.

850
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,000
protagonist

851
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:06,860
Cause we got everything we want right here

852
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:16,220
We got great big heaping buckets of bullion here

853
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:21,760
Cause Bob Dob brought us here

854
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,160
Yeah, we're singing a praise to Bob

855
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:42,240
Cause he's done a mighty fine job

856
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,040
Cause I'm slopped up and silly

857
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,580
Like a ripped-headed slob

858
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:57,020
And all I got to thank is Bob and Ivan Stang

859
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,180
Well, yeah

860
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:58,740
Yeah

861
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,640
All I got to thank is Bob and Dr. Do

862
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:08,760
And all I got to thank is Bob and everybody

863
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,800
You can trust me

864
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,880
I'm Dr. Ivan Stang

865
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,200
And I'm prepared to take your money

866
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,700
And give you back your slob

867
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,120
So you can believe in me

868
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,660
I'm Ivan Stang

869
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,520
I never lie

870
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,820
And I'm always right

871
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,500
It extends throughout the rules

872
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,200
And has to do with the universe

873
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,720
Universalism

874
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:28,720


875
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,780
It has to do with Glenn Stadden

876
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,440
It has to do with Grady's

877
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:31,840
That's right

878
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,640
It has to do with

879
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,040
It has to do with

880
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,560
It has to do with

881
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,060
It has to do with

882
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,520
It has to do

883
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,640
It has to do with

884
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,180
Gary Gehrman

885
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,740
It has to do with

886
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,460
The anybody luck plane

887
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:43,660
It has to do with

888
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,860
The typical luck plane

889
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,140
I think memoir's custom

890
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,460
It has to do with

891
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:48,940
1921

892
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:58,520
1921

893
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,760
uje

894
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:57,920
씺

895
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,060
Oh, yes, yes, yes, dear friends.

896
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:07,940
Oh, we're coming down, getting sort of close to the end of the hour there.

897
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:15,500
And I'm going to continue talking about the aspects of preachers going crazy on the radio,

898
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,420
specifically here on the Hour of Slack, a couple of weeks ago.

899
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:28,100
Now, you have to understand, friends, that being a jerk, that's my outlet for artistic, I mean, religious expression.

900
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:40,340
After all, most preachers utilize the techniques of presumptuousness, orneriness, corniness, and a sort of posed intolerance.

901
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:45,960
And I also use stupidity and especially cantankerousness.

902
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:54,980
I can't really, you know, I can't relax unless I'm being cantankerous and inflicting my personal bile and spleen on others.

903
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,620
It's hate, dear friends, and you wouldn't interfere with my right.

904
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:02,340
To hate? To do my own thing? Now, would you? This is a free country.

905
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,700
And besides, how can you, since I'm the one that's transmitting and you're only receiving?

906
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:11,500
Only receiving, friends. Does that insult you, like last time?

907
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:20,280
Well, good! That shows that I'm succeeding in doing Bob's assignment of getting you to stop letting the conspiracy,

908
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,860
or even subgenius preachers, push you around.

909
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,020
This obscure church would be the next Inquisition,

910
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:37,760
not constantly training you through applied obnoxiousness to be in a continuous state of not merely defensiveness, but outright rebellion.

911
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:42,880
And if you let me get any more abusive, I'll have to kill you, because you'll deserve it.

912
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:50,440
It's like I'm like an anti-role model. That's what most subgeniuses, all subgeniuses should be, anti-role models.

913
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,900
Besides, how dare you criticize the judgments meted out by King Stang?

914
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,060
You mocked.

915
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:03,600
You mocked my total disregard for the broadcast niceties.

916
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,300
Oh, but have you thought about your soul?

917
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,940
Have you even got a girlfriend yet, huh?

918
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,060
Oh, my jibes have but barely begun.

919
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:22,240
I could rant a paragraph to you that would have every one of you listeners jumping off a high bridge to escape the mocking truth wielded by my tongue.

920
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,480
Or Jane's.

921
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:28,100
Now, I didn't start out this way, nay. I was a gentle man at one time.

922
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:33,080
But I've undergone teasings by the blackest minds of our generation.

923
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:42,800
If I can take it from the likes of Lies and G. Gordon Gordon, then you'd best urinate in fear at the thought of what I could dish out to you on the radio.

924
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,060
To the innocent and guilty alike.

925
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:51,960
For as my mentor, Dr. Drummond, told me, none are so blind as those who have no eyes.

926
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:58,200
He who dares to mock King Stang and rouse him from his torpid reveries and clairvoyance.

927
00:49:59,060 --> 00:49:59,780
And yet, he is a man of his word.

928
00:49:59,780 --> 00:49:59,780


929
00:49:59,780 --> 00:49:59,780


930
00:49:59,780 --> 00:49:59,780


931
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:08,420
Hath played out but the first move in a galactic game on which hinges the very fate of this physical universe itself.

932
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,140
Congratulations, dear friends.

933
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,100
You've now entered kindergarten in the school of terror.

934
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,120
Oh, don't worry. It won't kill you.

935
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:22,600
Indeed, it'll actually help you to keep your intelligence from decreasing at the same pace as your peers.

936
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,000
But, uh, but at what cost, dear listener?

937
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,580
At what cost?

938
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:28,720
At what cost?

939
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,220
At what cost?

940
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,960
Oh, I'm well aware of all your plans to assassinate me.

941
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,140
Ha! Oh, surprised you, eh?

942
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,840
Yes, I can see far, far more than you think.

943
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,400
More than you could ever imagine in your wildest LSD dreams.

944
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,960
Fine! Go ahead, kill me!

945
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,120
You would-be Judases and Luthers.

946
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:53,160
Make your blindingly imbecilic move.

947
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,720
Your mere hume attempt to wrest controls from the claws of this...

948
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,420
Stang demon you hallucinate.

949
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,860
Death would be but a step up in my ascension to ultimate power.

950
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,400
Next to Bob, of course.

951
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,160
And have you not guessed that certain contingency plans have been laid?

952
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,760
Thinketh you not of the children of the Stang?

953
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,000
Oh, I've read my Frank Herbert closely.

954
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:25,000
The Atreides conspiracy is but a high school prank compared to the all-reaching arms of the Stang octopus.

955
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,720
Oh, your science fiction has failed.

956
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,900
It has ill-prepared you for the next generation of the Stang Ones.

957
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:38,460
What to your undiscerning ears is but a lively boy of seven and a sweet little girl of six

958
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:42,700
have undergone since birth certain forbidden training regimens

959
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:48,620
which will render all your weapons, all your propaganda, and all your mental hexes impotent.

960
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,040
Utterly impotent.

961
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,460
Kill Stang One and the Emperor Xandar is unchained.

962
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,480
And at that point, you can kiss your world, your humans.

963
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,380
Your society.

964
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,900
Your innocent subgenius church.

965
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,020
Goodbye forever.

966
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:09,540
Or perhaps if by some accident of God the Emperor Xandar were eliminated, oh, then you

967
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,900
would face the Tev one.

968
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,160
And do you think they're my only offspring?

969
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,380
Have you fools never watched a Star Wars movie?

970
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:22,560
Just as Darth Vader's son Luke was kept from knowing of his own sister's existence, do

971
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:28,600
you think that I, the Darth Vader of Dallas, have shown all my cards?

972
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,820
Oh, no indeed, dear friends.

973
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,840
No indeedy, I say.

974
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,600
But you'll see.

975
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,080
Well, stay tuned for Ron Lindsey.

976
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:47,500
You've been listening to King Stang, ultimate stud groupie attractor and mystic psychic

977
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:53,560
power monger, the very left brain of Dobbs, the chosen bringer, dear friends of terror

978
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:58,580
and lawsuits, owner of the trademark of God on Earth, slayer of the world, and the only

979
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:58,580


980
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:58,580


981
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:05,020
creator of would-be scribe ship usurpers, subjector of all bobbies, decider of degrees

982
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:10,280
of fame of subgenius mortals, second chosen of the fishers of wallets, biggest-organed

983
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:15,140
and sexiest voiced entrapper of radio groupies, subduer of hecklers, butt-splitter of moonies,

984
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:20,200
exploiter of comedic idiot savants, master of the sardonic over-the-cubed, violator of

985
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:20,740
postal...

986
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,760
Oh, forget it.

987
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,540
Anyway, okay, okay, don't rush me.

988
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,400
Stop, stop, stop.

989
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,580
Sister Chris asked me to come down here.

990
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:28,580


991
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:28,580


992
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:34,400
She asked me to listen to the Church of the Subgenius cassette and, and, I don't know,

993
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,580
she said something like she wanted a normal reaction.

994
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,540
Well, that didn't sound normal to me.

995
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,520
At least it didn't sound like a church.

996
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,380
I mean, aren't churches supposed to be quiet and not really boring?

997
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,600
I mean, I could hardly understand what went on there.

998
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,180
I mean, was it, was it meant to be funny or what?

999
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,420
I mean, come on, tell me, is it serious?

1000
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,220
Like, you know, do you have to...

1001
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,560
Are they telling you to stop listening to the church?

1002
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:04,840
Listen to Top 40, give up things like watching Dynasty or eating Haagen-Dazs or maybe shopping

1003
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,920
at home from an Esprit catalog?

1004
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:09,680
What?

1005
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,480
Huh?

1006
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,060
What are you trying to say?

1007
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:12,280


1008
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,100
There's this note.

1009
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:20,040
Listen, stupid, stop babbling or I'll ship you to Dallas with a sign saying, U.S. Grade

1010
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,120
A conspiracy dupe across your forehead.

1011
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,260
Hey, I don't know what that means, but, but I don't like your attitude, okay?

1012
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,560
I mean, like, just...

1013
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,760
You asked me to come here and I mean, why did you even ask me...

1014
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:31,900
What?

1015
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,000
Just, just sit over there, okay?

1016
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,820
You try and experiment down here and it just doesn't work.

1017
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:54,220
You try to bring an opposing viewpoint, somewhat of a rebuttal and you never can tell.

1018
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,240
This is Sister Chris here.

1019
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,040
It's 1233.

1020
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:03,300
It's not 1233, it's two minutes till midnight.

1021
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,980
Four minutes till something like that.

1022
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:13,140
And this is K-N-O-N 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

1023
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,680
And you cannot leave either.

1024
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,500
No, you can't.

1025
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,640
No, you can't.

1026
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,380
No, you can't.

1027
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,340
Carson Hill 3 min.

1028
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:26,480
Stories Presented

1029
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,060
Den Franklin

1030
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:36,800
I wanted the woods and the Indians to sleep with me.

1031
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:41,200
But I was afraid of the cold and made them sleep outside.

1032
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:47,600
So I never felt the touch of a warm naked Indian, or...

1033
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,400
Or in a cold, naked forest.

1034
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:52,700
Den Franklin.

1035
00:55:52,700 --> 00:56:00,800
The only president of the United States who was never president of the United States.

1036
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,980
Was he an early drug user?

1037
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:05,500
Let's see.

1038
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:13,620
He wrote of it in Poor Dick's Conspiracy in 1761 while still an apprentice book baker

1039
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,780
in colonial Philadelphia.

1040
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:22,850
So, I betook me to the Hashfire Inn for a secret caucus of the hotheads, rebellious

1041
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,410
libertines all lusting for life and liberty.

1042
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:30,370
The real George Washington brought the hemp and all the evening cleaners.

1043
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:37,150
We quickly proceeded to get slandered and young Tom Everson goodly stretched by the

1044
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:40,330
hemp which smoked us all like Boston's scrub.

1045
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,070
What a fetid fervor of freedom.

1046
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:44,830
I say, let's go.

1047
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:44,830


1048
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:45,770
Let's have a revolution.

1049
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:53,210
Straight up blabbered Sam the tax collector to which Big Ben replied, fine Sam, then we

1050
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:55,470
can invite over a bunch of immigrants and make cars.

1051
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:03,870
Yes, 1761, hemp kindled the fire of American history.

1052
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,830
Never be clockwork villains.

1053
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:12,310
That's the ultimate history.

1054
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:14,830
That's the ultimate history.

1055
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:15,890
That's the ultimate history.

1056
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:16,550
That's the ultimate history.

1057
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:19,510
That's the ultimate history.

1058
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:19,510


1059
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:20,330
That's the ultimate history.

1060
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:21,230
That's the ultimate history.

1061
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:21,230


1062
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:21,230


1063
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:27,190
Oh, yes dear friends you've been listening to the Hour of Slack radio ministry produced

1064
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,590
by the Church of the Subgenius.

1065
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:35,490
As I said, this is K-N-O-N 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

1066
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:39,350
Stay tuned for Down Memory Lane with Ron Lindsey.

1067
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:44,830
And this is your host, King Pope Killian.

1068
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:52,370
Reverend Ivan Stang, arbiter of hipness, down-putter of talk show hosts in my mighty glibness,

1069
00:57:52,530 --> 00:58:01,050
son of the king of bull shatterers, he who hath been copied by David Byrne and Garrison Keillor,

1070
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:08,930
payer of royalty checks to type running buddies, contract signer of all paying subgenius projects,

1071
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:14,870
president of the corporation of all Dobbs PR, 48% owner of the Janer tongue,

1072
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:20,170
first interpreter of the dogma, enrager of pinks and lesser subgeniuses alike,

1073
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:26,350
living embodiment of hate, slack under Dobbs, keeper of the original Dobbs image,

1074
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:37,290
carrot dangler of long-promised magazines, and returner of compliments, you faithless.

1075
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:40,830
Many.

1076
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:51,690
To open

1077
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:06,890
is nothing but pride.

1078
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:07,110
Arise.

1079
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:07,530
Be!

1080
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,450
Con soldier.

1081
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:30,430
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1082
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:34,470
This is Li Yijing, a Chinese subgenius.

1083
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:37,830
And you are listening to the Hour of Slap.

1084
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:43,310
Remember, Bob is a comrade of all people.

1085
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:47,010
He is a Chinese, just like in America.

1086
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:49,490
And people need slap.

1087
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:53,990
In Chinese, we call slap le ting tang.

1088
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:59,790
But it must be true slap, not the best slap of our conspiracy.

1089
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,830
Boy, will you look at that guy's slap.

1090
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:03,710
Help me somebody.

1091
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:07,110
Help me somebody. Thank you, Li Yijing.

1092
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:08,430
Yes, my friend.

1093
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:11,870
We have the great Ivan Stang here tonight.

1094
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:19,030
Ivan Stang himself, the grand auditor and chief inquisitor of the subgenius faith,

1095
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:23,690
who has every subgenius' name on his special basement computer.

1096
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:30,510
And he's here tonight to make the hour and a half of slack seem like, well, like forever.

1097
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:35,690
Ah, yes, dear friend. So good to be here.

1098
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:36,910
Say it, Ivan, say it.

1099
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:37,470
Feeling the power.

1100
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:38,690
Yeah.

1101
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:42,370
In this hideous, hideous place.

1102
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:44,030
Bob lives, friends.

1103
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,690
Bob lives. Don't let him tell you otherwise.

1104
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:47,490
He ain't dead.

1105
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,490
Oh, what is this?

1106
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:49,390
I should know.

1107
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:55,790
I'm the guy that has to read sooner or later all the mail that comes to that P.O. box

1108
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:58,170
that you probably thought was just made up.

1109
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:05,590
The opinions expressed by Ivan Stang do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the staff and management of this radio station.

1110
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:08,050
The other staff, the relations,

1111
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:10,910
and spouses of the staff and management,

1112
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:13,750
or the staff of this staff and staff.

1113
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:19,150
That's really true, Al, but he doesn't know that it's all over the place these days.

1114
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:22,630
He dragged out of the Victoria Theater with these eyes.

1115
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:28,050
These deadlights looked on Bob, and the light was dripping from them forever.

1116
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:38,050
There's saint of failed corpses dotting the landscape all the way from Little Rock to Berkeley here.

1117
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:39,750
I don't know what the big deal is.

1118
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:45,570
I mean, that just cause, just cause there's a Dobbs corpse there doesn't necessarily...

1119
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:47,650
I mean, can Bob really die?

1120
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:57,810
I'd say yes, Ivan, and I think you better grow up and face the sick truth that this Bob of yours isn't necessarily everything that you say he is.

1121
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:01,210
I'm sorry. There have always been Bobs.

1122
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:05,170
There has never been a world without a Bob.

1123
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:08,050
There's never, just as there's never been a Bob without...

1124
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:13,010
A Dick, his corresponding evil twin brother, Dick Dobbs.

1125
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:15,050
After a mental mutation...

1126
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:20,350
The demons you may see during the initial hallucinations are not real.

1127
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:22,830
Erotic carnival tale.

1128
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:26,410
If you do not panic, this phase will end after a few minutes.

1129
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:27,570
Jab room.

1130
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:32,470
So always resurface from the hypgnosis slowly, dear friends.

1131
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:34,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I...

1132
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:35,470
Huh, huh, huh!

1133
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:38,110
No, you know, I want it better that right.

1134
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:39,330
Gary, that should be a...

1135
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:39,390
Huh!

1136
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:40,350
Huh!

1137
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:41,630
Okay, that's good.

1138
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:42,530
Huh, huh, huh!

1139
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:46,450
Well, yes, I was gonna make, I was gonna make serious funny noises.

1140
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:51,970
Because, because we all know that Bob is the man that makes all the ladies go...

1141
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:52,710
Huh!

1142
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:56,310
He's the man that makes all the men go...

1143
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:57,910
Well, let's take a little rest.

1144
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:02,290
It ain't an om-chanting laid-back universe, dear friends.

1145
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:03,470
It's a...

1146
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:04,410
Take a little rest and...

1147
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:05,050
Universe!

1148
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:05,890
Shh!

1149
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,090
An action-packed universe.

1150
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:08,090


1151
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:09,090
What's it?

1152
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:09,830


1153
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:10,310
What's it?

1154
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:11,050
Yes.

1155
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:11,490
Hmm!

1156
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,710
A boring and streaky universe.

1157
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:16,890
A purulating and...

1158
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:20,770
A universe where everyone has the orange glow coming from the holes between their shoelaces.

1159
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:22,030
Just because.

1160
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:23,850
A pure, relating, and putrescent, biologically active universe.

1161
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:23,850


1162
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:26,810
Enormous bioplasm that stretches throughout infinity.

1163
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,790
Oh, did you get some of that, too?

1164
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:31,330
Yes, it was delicious.

1165
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:32,290
It's...

1166
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:33,030
It's...

1167
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:33,770
It is...

1168
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:33,790
It is...

1169
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:34,170
Honestly, Mr.

1170
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:35,690
this big ugly piece of meat.

1171
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:41,130
He was a little short chubby guy

1172
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:43,130
and that's where Bob got the idea.

1173
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:46,090
They say he came in with checkered pants on,

1174
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:47,750
but I just don't remember.

1175
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:50,670
He was allowed to eat all he wanted.

1176
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:52,610
Anything he wanted.

1177
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:56,590
Bob's big boy was a real person.

1178
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:57,210
That's true.

1179
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,670
There was a real Bob

1180
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,130
and this parable goes to show

1181
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:05,670
that there is indeed always a real Bob.

1182
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,650
There has to be a Bob, dear friend.

1183
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:11,190
Even the things which you cannot possibly believe in,

1184
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:12,670
Bob's big boy indeed,

1185
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:15,370
turn out to be an actual historic person

1186
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:17,690
and as it is with Bob's big boy,

1187
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:20,330
surely it is with the far more impressive

1188
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:22,430
and major deity we know as

1189
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:24,510
the avatar of all slack.

1190
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,050
That's how we know him.

1191
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:30,090
Others call him him or Monger.

1192
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:32,190
Others call him a demon.

1193
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:33,110
Or your mom.

1194
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:33,330
Or your mama.

1195
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:34,150
Indeed.

1196
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:36,350
And the children of Bob are everywhere.

1197
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:39,170
Bob lives on in his millions and millions,

1198
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:41,570
literally millions of illegitimate children.

1199
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:43,670
All of them pressing lawsuits

1200
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:46,430
against me personally.

1201
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:49,510
Well, doctor, I'm sure you're used to it by now.

1202
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:52,350
When I took on the job as sacred scribe

1203
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:52,710
at the church,

1204
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:58,290
I had no idea what I was going to be getting into.

1205
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:00,450
We had 500 employees in 1980.

1206
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:02,930
Now it's just me and someone else.

1207
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:03,110
I don't know.

1208
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:06,650
Well, that's just the Reagan-esque spirit

1209
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:09,750
that's been enjoying this guy for its own sake.

1210
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:12,690
And yet they say that Bob doesn't even exist.

1211
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:15,550
There are some who say that there is no Bob.

1212
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:16,830
If there's no Bob,

1213
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:19,810
then where did all of those dead bodies come from?

1214
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:22,570
What about all those ads in the 50s

1215
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:23,670
that he posed for?

1216
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:24,330
It says right here,

1217
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:25,570
the body store,

1218
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:27,930
dead Bob's for any occasion.

1219
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,150
Oh, put that away.

1220
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:30,550
That's not impressing anyone.

1221
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:31,370
No Bob too big.

1222
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:32,370
No, really.

1223
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:34,370
Really, guys, all kidding aside,

1224
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:36,030
I must admit,

1225
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:40,050
at least the official father church,

1226
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:41,630
the subgenius foundation,

1227
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:44,390
which we don't expect any of you

1228
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:47,130
except the stinking Bobbies to cling to,

1229
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:48,730
nevertheless,

1230
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:52,270
we have the only true word of Bob,

1231
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:53,610
the original apostles.

1232
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:55,810
And as far as I'm concerned,

1233
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:58,750
this whole thing about Bob being dead

1234
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:59,990
is a ruse.

1235
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:02,270
Bob staged that whole thing himself.

1236
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:05,230
It was fashionable in the 60s.

1237
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:08,630
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1238
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:13,750
It's the same frontwards and backwards, friends,

1239
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,970
and there's a reason there's an O in the middle.

1240
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:19,870
A hole in the middle between those two Bs.

1241
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:21,310
It's symbolic, friends.

1242
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:23,470
You can look through that,

1243
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:26,850
the center of that O in Bob's name

1244
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:29,310
and see the future and the past.

1245
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:30,250
But don't look...

1246
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:32,250
I think you guys are afraid of J.R.R. Martin.

1247
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:32,970
Bob, Bob, Bob.

1248
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:36,230
So you've been doing this show for almost five years now,

1249
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:37,830
disrespectfully,

1250
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:40,930
making fun of your high E-pop,

1251
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:42,950
the man who brought you slack.

1252
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,990
What do you mean, Bob?

1253
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:48,430
Died for your sins nobody knows how many times.

1254
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:51,250
The only thing that ever brought me slack

1255
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:53,130
was leaving Paul in St. Louis.

1256
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:54,890
I'm not scared of Bob.

1257
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:59,750
That was the only slack I ever got out of this damn church

1258
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:01,850
and it cost me $3,000 to have it shipped.

1259
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:02,450
I'm back.

1260
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:04,650
Well, most people don't fear Bob.

1261
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:06,050
Don't fear him a bit.

1262
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:09,390
Oh, they think Bob's always gonna be their buddy.

1263
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:12,150
And then as soon as they think Bob's dead,

1264
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:13,450
they turn around.

1265
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:14,750
They think he ain't looking anymore.

1266
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:16,990
They turn around and go to the pinks.

1267
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:19,330
Going to the pinks, every one of them.

1268
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:21,690
Oh, friends, he's just testing you.

1269
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,690
He's been testing you for two years.

1270
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:26,470
He knows if you've been bad or good.

1271
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:27,310
Oh, yeah.

1272
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:29,150
But more people are frightened of Gary

1273
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:30,190
than frightened of Bob.

1274
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:31,230
Anybody want to go to an amusement park?

1275
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:32,230
Why does this situation...

1276
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:32,230


1277
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:32,610
persist?

1278
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:36,250
Well, it's because of the general loss of faith

1279
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:38,730
which accompanies the modern feeling.

1280
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:41,970
And a feeling that one can no longer support,

1281
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:44,750
the credulity, superstition, and fanaticism

1282
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:45,770
of an earlier time

1283
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,410
when one might well have believed

1284
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:50,070
in the smiling, pipe-smoking, benevolent figure

1285
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:52,150
known from the book of the subject.

1286
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:54,190
That's right.

1287
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:56,290
That was really beautiful.

1288
01:07:56,330 --> 01:07:57,510
Very touching, man.

1289
01:07:57,630 --> 01:07:58,710
That was just beautiful.

1290
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:01,470
Could you repeat that?

1291
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:03,690
Let's go.

1292
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:04,850
Escape from Alligator.

1293
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:08,290
Ivan Stang, 15, shows scars after being attacked

1294
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:11,030
by an alligator near West Palm Beach, Florida, Monday.

1295
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:13,810
Ivan and a friend were swimming in a lake

1296
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:16,610
when suddenly he was grabbed by the head

1297
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:19,830
and pulled underwater by a giant sharp-toothed saurian.

1298
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:21,890
I couldn't see anything but teeth

1299
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,590
and didn't know what had hold of me

1300
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:27,070
until the gator let loose and swam away, said Ivan,

1301
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:31,110
who suffered wounds requiring 41 stitches.

1302
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:34,270
This is supposed to be a religious show.

1303
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:37,430
Now what is the interpretation of this parable, my friends?

1304
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:40,910
The alligator is the worldly mob, the rabble,

1305
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:46,290
who always seek to devour and assimilate the holy men of the church of the subgenius.

1306
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:49,810
The lone swimmer, buoyed up by the fluid element,

1307
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:52,050
represents, upon the other hand,

1308
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:56,410
the striving outward force of the church of the subgenius,

1309
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:59,210
which requires 41 stitches,

1310
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:03,550
the same number as the number of bullet holes in Bob's bullet-reddled body.

1311
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:06,450
Praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob.

1312
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:08,030
What are we going to do?

1313
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:11,510
Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocrities?

1314
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:12,210
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

1315
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:17,290
These pink boys, these box-dwelling Barbies and Kens,

1316
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:20,710
these normals who have made normality the norm?

1317
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:24,190
Well, no, I wouldn't like revenge on those people.

1318
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:25,570
I'd like revenge on you, Ivan,

1319
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:26,070
because...

1320
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:28,530
You've taken one too many $20 check from me.

1321
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:30,450
I've never got...

1322
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:30,850
I want my slack.

1323
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:33,750
Let's see your subgenius membership card, hmm?

1324
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:35,350
Now let's not get into...

1325
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:38,230
I mean, say the influence came a little bit soon, Gary.

1326
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:42,230
Do you think you'd make it on the escape saucers of the sex goddesses

1327
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:45,010
without your little subgenius membership card?

1328
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:45,910
I'd sure try.

1329
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:49,750
This is a great example you're setting for the people out here.

1330
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:52,050
I've got my Bob Amira card here.

1331
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:53,710
It says that I'm paid up to...

1332
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:55,730
$19.97?

1333
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:56,390
$19.97?

1334
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:59,970
You see, Gary is the Rasputin of the Church of the Subgenius,

1335
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,370
often thought for, but rarely encountered.

1336
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:05,990
And it is this self-same learning for slack

1337
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:08,330
which separates us from men.

1338
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:12,590
At the hip, the human may live out his entire life

1339
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:14,770
in a grinding cycle of slacklessness,

1340
01:10:15,030 --> 01:10:16,310
yet he never feels cheated.

1341
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:17,850
He thinks it's natural.

1342
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:20,810
I suppose we could pity him,

1343
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:23,450
but they're nothing but half-witted cattle

1344
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:26,330
racing each other to be first.

1345
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:27,550
They're just a slaughterhouse

1346
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:30,050
stampeding you along with them.

1347
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:31,170
But what do you care?

1348
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:32,530
Oh, you've got slack.

1349
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:35,250
Anybody want to go down the slide?

1350
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:37,950
Oh, get along, little bobbies.

1351
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:41,130
Go head on down to Dobstown now.

1352
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:44,250
Get on in that Dobstown corral,

1353
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:45,470
you little bobbies.

1354
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:47,450
He, he, he, he.

1355
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:48,170
Mmm.

1356
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:50,790
Ooh, what's that?

1357
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:53,210
Oh, there's a nice fat one.

1358
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:56,150
Yes, he'll be a good trading...

1359
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:58,390
commodity come the bargaining session

1360
01:10:58,390 --> 01:10:59,790
with the exes.

1361
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:03,970
First up, I notice y'all don't talk about religion much.

1362
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:06,210
I guess it's real hip out here in California.

1363
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:10,450
It's a more humanistic approach to Bob.

1364
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:13,950
No, we believe in just letting the holy benediction of Bob

1365
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:16,650
flow out like pus from a pustule.

1366
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,570
You just don't understand the true power of the show.

1367
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:24,630
Oh, it's very fashionable to say Bob is a good man.

1368
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:25,890
Oh, he's...

1369
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:30,390
He was a prophet, but, uh, the son of Jehovah One.

1370
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:34,670
No, well, I don't go for these superstitions you say.

1371
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:35,110
Certainly not.

1372
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:35,870
Very fashionable.

1373
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:41,190
It hath not been my use to pray with moving lips and bended knees,

1374
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:45,690
but silently, by slow degrees, my spirits I to Bob compose.

1375
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:51,610
In humble trust my eyelids close in reverential resignation.

1376
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:55,670
No wish described, no thought expressed.

1377
01:11:56,410 --> 01:11:58,090
Only a sense of suffocation.

1378
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:03,510
A sense, for all my soul impressed,

1379
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:06,730
that I'm out in the street undressed.

1380
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:07,050
Beautiful.

1381
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:10,650
Church air, one soul per breath.

1382
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:13,450
Church air, one soul per breath.

1383
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:15,610
Get your breaths right here.

1384
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:18,710
Don't need oxygen.

1385
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:22,510
By the Bob's early light,

1386
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:25,610
that too loudly,

1387
01:12:26,530 --> 01:12:27,570
we'd scream.

1388
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:34,030
In the toilet, blaspheming.

1389
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:36,010
Whose clogged eyes and dark ears,

1390
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:38,410
This is supposed to be a religious show.

1391
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:41,390
I thought there was a separation of church and state.

1392
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:42,350
Bob and country.

1393
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:43,730
Bob and country.

1394
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:44,370
Oh, the one that was night,

1395
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:46,250
where the hamsters were splashed,

1396
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:48,250
And, of course, frothel pie.

1397
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:50,990
are in the air.

1398
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:52,050
Not a Melvinchy thing.

1399
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:53,530
The Elf's a joke, too, don't you think?

1400
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:55,110
Funny joke.

1401
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:55,590
Bob and country.

1402
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:55,590


1403
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:55,590


1404
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:55,590


1405
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:55,590


1406
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:56,950
Bob's a funny joke, here.

1407
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:58,910
Bob and country.

1408
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:04,950
You've certainly been leading your radio listeners down the great path here.

1409
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:06,550
A big old joke.

1410
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:09,750
I guess the conspiracy's a joke, too.

1411
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:10,270
Oh, slack.

1412
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:11,270
I guess that's a joke.

1413
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:14,050
Well, as they say, pinkness is next to greenness.

1414
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:15,850
The green of the cabbage.

1415
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:17,930
The green of the buckwheat.

1416
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:18,890
The $30 bill.

1417
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:20,070
The $30 bill.

1418
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:20,510
The $30 bill.

1419
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:22,730
The $30 bill.

1420
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:23,830
The true, you're tasting.

1421
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:24,910
The true, you're tasting.

1422
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:25,570
It's gray.

1423
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:31,830
I feel skillful today.

1424
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:32,430
Let me at him.

1425
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:33,250
Let me try.

1426
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:33,610
A baby.

1427
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:36,690
Eh, he's not true, sir.

1428
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:37,350
Walk him around.

1429
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:42,510
Congratulations, Dr. Gabow fan.

1430
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:44,490
I'm gonna deliver it myself.

1431
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:46,410
Wait a minute.

1432
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:47,290
Don't give no keys.

1433
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:48,250
I'm about to say, him after date.

1434
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:51,750
I don't even know.

1435
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:53,650
This whole thing, it's like...

1436
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:56,290
What happened to the organ music?

1437
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:59,010
Give me a can of sound effects while you're at it, would you?

1438
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:01,090
Oh, yeah, and some show stretchers.

1439
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,470
And listen to them.

1440
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:05,210
I need some show stretchers back.

1441
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:08,070
Yes, friends, little did many of you know,

1442
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:11,610
but this isn't the only subgenius show.

1443
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:21,370
In fact, there's six weekly subgenius shows now in New York, Beijing, New Jersey,

1444
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:25,510
Jersey, Richmond, Virginia, St. Louis, Dallas.

1445
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:26,570
Come on, hurry now.

1446
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:28,410
We have to catch the last bus home.

1447
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:32,770
This, I'm afraid, does not count as an orthodox subgenius show.

1448
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:33,990
I mean, I had no idea.

1449
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:37,890
I had thought that, I mean, the sermons and the prayers

1450
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:42,410
and the sending up of praises and killing.

1451
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:43,850
It just don't happen that way.

1452
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:45,170
You're in Berkeley, Ivan.

1453
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:45,910
You're in Berkeley.

1454
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:46,690
The sacrifices.

1455
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,210
Oh, we have the sacrifices.

1456
01:14:48,470 --> 01:14:48,950
The ritual scars.

1457
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:50,330
We have those.

1458
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:53,610
You used to have ritual scars on your forehead.

1459
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:55,270
You've had them removed.

1460
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:57,070
Oh, I didn't have them removed.

1461
01:14:57,310 --> 01:14:59,350
Trying to fit in, I guess.

1462
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:01,750
The rat ate them off in my sleep.

1463
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:06,390
Oh, the cage.

1464
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:08,130
The cage.

1465
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:10,730
I got to lock myself in the cage when I was sleeping.

1466
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:12,750
No wonder the rats died.

1467
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:14,010
Once again.

1468
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:20,390
Now, Dr. Stang, when we reflect upon the evils in this world,

1469
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:21,170
why?

1470
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:24,930
Why is it that Dobbs permits such Yehuism to exist?

1471
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:28,550
Can you answer this spiritual conundrum for our listeners?

1472
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:34,950
Well, Bob does not permit Yehuism to exist.

1473
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:37,470
I thought he had to deliver the permit.

1474
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:39,450
He allows it to exist.

1475
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:42,810
He forces it to exist.

1476
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:48,670
It is part of the bulldada matrix of which the...

1477
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:51,070
But what about the cowdada matrix?

1478
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:54,550
Why must we always look at the male angle?

1479
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:57,750
Isn't it more interesting to look up a cow's dada?

1480
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:06,350
An ancient art form turned into an illegal act.

1481
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:09,050
The Aztecs went out for it in a big way.

1482
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:16,470
Bob does not desire a monolithic one-world subgenius inquisition.

1483
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:18,170
I mean, we don't...

1484
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:18,570
We don't...

1485
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:21,330
We don't have to bow down...

1486
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:21,770
to him.

1487
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:25,850
You know, or bend over to him, as the bobbies do.

1488
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:27,250
The bobbies.

1489
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,190
Yeah, there's some of these bobbies here.

1490
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:30,190
Get the odd by these.

1491
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:32,350
Bobbies.

1492
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:33,330
Bobbies.

1493
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:34,930
Little bobbies.

1494
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:35,310
No.

1495
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:37,930
Those little collars.

1496
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:40,110
That's right.

1497
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:41,590
You slack vampires.

1498
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,390
We'll get a reading on you.

1499
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:46,110
Yes, you can speak to Ivan Stang himself,

1500
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:48,350
or the great Gary Gubofram,

1501
01:16:48,490 --> 01:16:50,250
or even your humble narrator,

1502
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:53,830
your howling hierophant of the airwaves, Dr. Howell.

1503
01:16:54,230 --> 01:16:58,270
We're all broadcasting on behalf of the lurching Church of the Subgenius.

1504
01:16:58,490 --> 01:16:59,570
Help me somebody.

1505
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:01,870
Salvation or salivation.

1506
01:17:04,710 --> 01:17:07,710
You are receiving the Church of the Subgenius show

1507
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:10,290
if you are within the sound of our broadcast.

1508
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:13,930
For whatever reason, you are tuned into our transmission.

1509
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:18,390
Be you an habitual listener or even a serendipitous insomniac

1510
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:20,230
ranging the radio spectrum to the radio,

1511
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:20,230


1512
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:21,950
you are to allay the tedium of sleeplessness

1513
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:24,690
who happens for the first time upon our broadcast.

1514
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:29,890
Do not attempt to adjust your radio.

1515
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:32,870
I'll have Jack Daniels and Seven Up, please.

1516
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:38,690
This show bears a patented Dobbs Drome PowerShell time code,

1517
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:42,590
which may cause some home radios to react unpredictably.

1518
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:47,970
Although only a small percentage of radios or their owners have suffered permanent damage, or...

1519
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:50,150
We're not responsible, friends.

1520
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:53,490
There's no... We're not gonna be responsible for what happens.

1521
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:56,610
But what I want to know is who is responsible?

1522
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:59,570
Who's responsible for this suffering?

1523
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:02,490
Well, Bob is, of course, Hal. Haven't you learned yet?

1524
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:05,590
Pain and sickness and death lies the IRS.

1525
01:18:06,030 --> 01:18:07,950
And a headache that lasts all year.

1526
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:11,870
And a lot of checks in the mail, dear friend.

1527
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:14,490
These pets in their homes.

1528
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,830
But what does it all lead to? What does it all mean?

1529
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,310
You fear the feathered creatures with their sharp teeth.

1530
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:23,650
An ever larger bank account for the Subgenius Foundation Incorporated.

1531
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:26,730
Dobbs did not die because he had to.

1532
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:32,150
Wellman chose to kill him on the stage for you and everyone, but mainly for his own reasons.

1533
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:36,410
This man was handed over to you by Dobbs' set purpose and knowledge.

1534
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:41,570
And you, speaking to the people of Dobbstown with the help of Rugo's pinkish ones,

1535
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:45,970
put him to death by nailing him to the crosshairs of Wellman's gun site.

1536
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:48,170
But Dobbs regurgitated.

1537
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:51,930
Freeing his impoptitude from the agony of slacklessness.

1538
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:57,810
Because it was impossible for knee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to keep its hold on him.

1539
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:06,650
Now his agonized spirit roams this earth, howling in outer darkness.

1540
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:10,310
But hoping to regain its early hegemony.

1541
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:13,870
The frog monsters are after me.

1542
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:18,150
But the cross or wolf's bane or a sickle through Dobbs' throat,

1543
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:18,150


1544
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:21,570
or a stake through Dobbs' heart, can keep the Epoch at bay.

1545
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:25,990
Remember, the monsters are out there.

1546
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:28,330
And it's either you or them.

1547
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:31,630
This has been a public service message from the Subgenius Show.

1548
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:35,950
I don't understand. Either you can take your stake and you can eat it, or you can pound it through Dobbs' heart.

1549
01:19:36,150 --> 01:19:38,390
It has to be frozen, rigid and hard.

1550
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:38,650
I prefer using a wet spoot.

1551
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:47,590
I'm sure you all recognize this beloved melody as the ever popular oldie but goldie classic,

1552
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:50,470
slap your chops shut baby with a Stilson wrench.

1553
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:55,390
But did you know that the same haunting tune was also Splat It Over Rich's

1554
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:59,230
eczema cantata number 12, opus 99 in C magus?

1555
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:03,890
Now you and your entire family, including kids from 6 to 60,

1556
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:09,170
can enjoy this and other classic masterpieces of the world's longest playing music in your own home,

1557
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:10,210
whenever you like.

1558
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:17,010
Expose your youngsters to the impotent world of symphonic overkill at any time and at your own convenience.

1559
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:18,150
You want to go someplace where...

1560
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:20,910
You can only spend about as much as you would for a really good set of luggage,

1561
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:26,330
or a year of education at one of the more prestigious institutes of higher learning in this great land of ours.

1562
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:29,970
Every week you'll receive another high-tech 78 rpm album,

1563
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:36,190
each in its own permanent storage case of semi-permanent, non-biodegradable sturdy fiberboard.

1564
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:38,910
And at first, you need pay nothing.

1565
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:43,330
Later we'll demand more and more, but you receive your first mutilaginous masterwork,

1566
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:45,230
The Cuspidor Concerti,

1567
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:47,650
by G.R. Robertini,

1568
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:48,390
Dabzini.

1569
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:54,910
Giovanni Rodrigo Robertini's Dabzini was director of chamber music to the Duke of Wellman.

1570
01:20:55,090 --> 01:21:00,310
He lived in dire poverty and suffered from yawns, jaundice, syphilis, gout, rotten teeth,

1571
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:05,650
and an unknown debilitating disease which caused deaths of blindness, deafness, and madness.

1572
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:11,430
Dabzini fathered 49 children by his second wife, Connie Maria Anna Hugeltoffler.

1573
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:15,510
To support his large family, he wrote 467 symphonies,

1574
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:20,990
98 concertos, 48 known motets, 19 operas, and two concertini.

1575
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:27,110
His European fame was based above all on the sensitive sweetness of his Adagio movements.

1576
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:32,730
Do not attempt to flip the show when you reach the end of side one,

1577
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:35,970
no matter what you're told by later instructions on the show.

1578
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:40,810
There is no side two. However, if you do discover one, don't listen to it.

1579
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:44,030
Theologians have debated the existence of a side three,

1580
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:48,970
but this, as well as a hypothetical side four, are only in the realm of conjecture.

1581
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:54,910
My friend, if you can reach side three of this show, then you will know you are already in life.

1582
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:57,490
Help me, somebody! Praise God!

1583
01:21:57,550 --> 01:22:00,610
My leg went far. Pull the lever down and you go!

1584
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:02,570
Copyright 1986, J.R. Martin, please.

1585
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:07,450
Yeah, did you ever look at that Monty Python record? It really did have three sides.

1586
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:13,470
Well, perhaps if you tried to get side two of the show, you'd just get side zero of yourself.

1587
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:17,230
I try to get to the other side, but there's no oxygen over there.

1588
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:25,770
You open up the gates to your lower self, the lower self you share with all other subgeniuses.

1589
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:30,210
Simply because I happen to share a lower birth with many subgeniuses,

1590
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:39,110
I refuse to consign myself to an eldritch cleaving to laws far beyond our disposition, which may indeed ice my soul.

1591
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:44,010
And these starving subgenius refugees seen here, crammed in here,

1592
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:48,030
together in these Rolls Royces, being sold off.

1593
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:55,210
Uh, Dobbs' whole collection of Rolls Royces now being auctioned off in Dallas.

1594
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:59,390
Hey, here's a little news thing our listeners might be interested in.

1595
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:05,270
Actors and musicians are invited to audition for the lead role in a stage show, Dobbs.

1596
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:09,810
Words and music. The first bob is authorized to be done around them,

1597
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:11,890
which is made up entirely of

1598
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:14,850
25 bobs.

1599
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,290
This is like a story we heard earlier.

1600
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:20,470
It is as if it were ordained from the beginning of time.

1601
01:23:20,510 --> 01:23:21,950
It says here you have to go to Malaysia to audition.

1602
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:25,190
Wait a minute, I'm not getting any royalties for that.

1603
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:29,390
I never heard anything about a Dobbs stage show.

1604
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:32,270
Too late, it's already on its way.

1605
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:34,970
I'm afraid the Dobbs...

1606
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:37,110
Well, it's right up your trademark.

1607
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:39,650
Legal notice is a trademark.

1608
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:41,770
The name subgenius is a trademark.

1609
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:48,770
I personally wrote a check for $400 to get that face trademarked.

1610
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:50,130
Look at this fictitious...

1611
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:53,770
This is true subgenius stuff you're hearing, folks.

1612
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:56,330
This is the real thing. This is no razzmatazz.

1613
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:59,770
This is no tomfoolery. This is the real Ivan Stang,

1614
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:01,210
and he's telling you the straight poop.

1615
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:03,490
So stand up and pay attention.

1616
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:05,410
The MG finishes...

1617
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:08,350
Oh, they're making money all over the place off of Bob.

1618
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:09,370
It's like the Spock...

1619
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:10,990
Look at this smiley face now.

1620
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:13,350
The smiling face of the 80s.

1621
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:18,230
The following corporation is doing business as Dobbs Image Incorporated.

1622
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:21,350
Here's another one right here on page 59.

1623
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:27,610
It says the following person is doing business as Bob's Brain.

1624
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:29,010
Ukabonga.

1625
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:32,570
How many of these people are sending you money? None of them.

1626
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:35,610
You ain't fooling me, Philo. I know you're out there. You're listening.

1627
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:37,990
I want you to call them boys off.

1628
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:39,350
My boys will meet you.

1629
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:42,870
I'm gonna meet your boys behind the old church down there in Jonesboro.

1630
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:47,690
Now you can bring all your minions and your evil conspiracy devils.

1631
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:49,610
We're gonna have it out, boy!

1632
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:52,290
No, no, no. That's not how it happened at all.

1633
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:54,950
Doc Holliday stood over here by the fence,

1634
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:59,110
and they were never actually in the sub-G corral.

1635
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:02,930
The famous gunfight actually took place over here by the hotel.

1636
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:08,990
Now, Kirk Douglas played the part of Doug Willman in the 1954 movie.

1637
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:13,370
And, uh, these souvenir boots have been stuck in the street ever since.

1638
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:16,030
That's what we did, and now we're better than anybody else.

1639
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:19,790
The Dobbs model was built by Carlo Rambaldi.

1640
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:24,510
And it's articulated. It can make 27 smirks and sneers.

1641
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:27,830
With the guys, big Bob's voices died.

1642
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:30,350
It has big, friendly plastic eyes, too.

1643
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:32,910
Big, friendly eyes.

1644
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:33,950
I'm sorry.

1645
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:35,490
Experience time travel.

1646
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:37,070
Anvil possession.

1647
01:25:37,290 --> 01:25:38,110
Past wives.

1648
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:39,230
UF odors.

1649
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:39,910
And big feet.

1650
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:43,450
Here on the mysterious hour and a half of misery and darkness.

1651
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:48,210
Yes, you're hearing the authentic spewings and spoutings of Ivan Stang himself,

1652
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:50,430
as well as Gary Gubofram.

1653
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:55,250
And the evil Dr. Howell.

1654
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:58,170
Burn him. He's evil. Evil.

1655
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:02,310
And the guidance, the firm, intelligent hand,

1656
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:05,270
the guidance of Mobius Rex, Dr. Mobius Rex,

1657
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:08,090
who has led us unerringly.

1658
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:09,710
Never gave...

1659
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:12,270
Down the primrose path, I would say.

1660
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:13,810
...the lip of the tongue that would offend anyone.

1661
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:16,790
There's many a drip twixt the tongue and the lip.

1662
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:18,870
...Mobius Rex, I think...

1663
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:20,610
Yeah, I think I heard that one.

1664
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:23,830
Actually, it's a lot better than the last subgenius.

1665
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:27,710
I am the pea shooter and you are the pea, I think was the line used in there.

1666
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:29,030
Just as we can tune our radio...

1667
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:30,090
Well, yes, there is that.

1668
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:31,350
...in the chosen stations.

1669
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:34,090
So can we attune our consciousness...

1670
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:34,790
Oh, gosh!

1671
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:36,130
...to a higher and more powerful subgenius sound.

1672
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:38,030
Well, that's the funniest subgenius sound.

1673
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:39,430
Hey, goof off, man.

1674
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:42,330
There's a lot to be said about not receiving any West Coast money.

1675
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:48,390
Because you understand, the money you receive has to be filtered through the West Coast Church.

1676
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:49,970
Because it's West Coast money.

1677
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:52,610
I don't think it would do you any good if it came directly to it.

1678
01:26:52,670 --> 01:27:00,370
I think that us laying our glands on the money perhaps does a lot more than you just getting it directly.

1679
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:03,070
You would just waste it on something like paperclips.

1680
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:04,330
Or money.

1681
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:07,250
We take it down to the Emeryville mudflats

1682
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:10,230
and just throw it on the spot where you found that dirty, nasty head.

1683
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:12,870
What is money, anyway?

1684
01:27:14,190 --> 01:27:19,770
Indeed, all is chaff which blows away in the exhalations of Jehovah One.

1685
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:21,030
I could ask Guy Dool that question.

1686
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:27,750
It only gains its true power at the moment that it passes from your pocket into Bob's.

1687
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:35,990
And since Bob isn't here, you can still send for that information from the Church of the Subgenius.

1688
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:37,690
And they need to be laundered.

1689
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:38,510
We have the pocket of Bob here.

1690
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:42,430
And they smell like they haven't been washed in months.

1691
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:44,590
But look, Connie did this embroidery.

1692
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:48,710
Through this, the envious Wellman slashed.

1693
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:55,110
And as he plucked his cursed steel away, mark how Bob's special ichor followed it,

1694
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:59,730
as rushing out of doors to be resolved if Wellman so unkindly knocked her no.

1695
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:01,870
It was too Wellman.

1696
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:04,170
Then fall, Dobbs.

1697
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:05,510
Bob's slavered you.

1698
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:07,670
Then first a mighty fart.

1699
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:10,990
Great Dobbs he fell.

1700
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:14,850
I'm not going to be able to let my kids listen to this show now. Way to go.

1701
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:20,330
Why, it's just an ancient Anglo-Saxonism from the early history of our race.

1702
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:22,450
Meaning to hit or strike.

1703
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:27,490
Yes, as in Farquhar. Farharhardenfartinhardenfartin.

1704
01:28:27,490 --> 01:28:27,710
Oh, here we go.

1705
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:32,830
How many of you pyroflatulate? You've blown off pyroflatulate.

1706
01:28:32,830 --> 01:28:35,290
Don't be embarrassed. Come forth and testify.

1707
01:28:35,490 --> 01:28:35,490


1708
01:28:35,490 --> 01:28:40,950
Just call us at 848-4425. That's 848-4425.

1709
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:43,450
We release all gases through our lungs with the sound of .

1710
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:46,910
Call any time, day or night, if the spirits are moving.

1711
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:51,890
Remember, there will always be a subgenius pastor there to hear your words and receive your heart.

1712
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:53,790
Untuned to JR Bob Dobbs.

1713
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:55,850
Professionals welcome. Women discouraged.

1714
01:28:56,370 --> 01:28:57,270
Tom, you need me?

1715
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:01,910
Oh, yeah, the Good Sex for Mutants League, and now stationed in Utah.

1716
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,830
Say, I see a little light here on our board.

1717
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:06,770
It looks like we have a caller after all.

1718
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:10,530
Oh, whoop-de-doo. A caller. A slack vampire.

1719
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:13,150
Maybe, but maybe one from France.

1720
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:14,930
Hello, you're on the air.

1721
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:16,850
Listen, I've got a problem.

1722
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:17,930
Uh-oh.

1723
01:29:18,130 --> 01:29:21,170
Every time I die, something happens.

1724
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:24,350
Cowards die many times before their deaths.

1725
01:29:24,530 --> 01:29:26,890
The valiant never taste of death but once.

1726
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:27,170
Okay.

1727
01:29:27,610 --> 01:29:33,450
And, you know, if Bob lets you know for sure that there was an afterlife,

1728
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:36,630
half the people in the world would commit suicide.

1729
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:39,150
So there's an evolutionary reason for this.

1730
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:40,670
We're interested in the...

1731
01:29:40,670 --> 01:29:42,730
And the other half would kill themselves. It's a real drag.

1732
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:45,030
It's the before life that concerns us.

1733
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:48,370
That's right. It's the pre-life, the pre-existence.

1734
01:29:48,370 --> 01:29:52,910
The sub-life. Something which is a plane of existence below our own life.

1735
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:55,770
Hanging around in the ethereal nothingness.

1736
01:29:55,930 --> 01:30:00,290
The underwear lurking beneath the clothing of existence.

1737
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:01,310
Subligacular.

1738
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:02,070
Wait a minute.

1739
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:04,130
We've forgotten the customer again.

1740
01:30:04,370 --> 01:30:04,830
Oh, yes.

1741
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:07,890
Dear lady, please express your opinion.

1742
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:09,010
Please.

1743
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,410
What should I do?

1744
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:14,410
Open your mouth.

1745
01:30:14,530 --> 01:30:16,190
Donate your heart to Bob.

1746
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:17,650
Yes. Open your mind.

1747
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:18,990
In a figurative manner, of course.

1748
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:19,970
And open your wallet.

1749
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:21,670
Yes, and bend over.

1750
01:30:21,970 --> 01:30:23,050
And touch your ankles.

1751
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:25,030
And receive the word of Bob, dear friends.

1752
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:26,370
And he speaks to you through the voice of Dr. M. Brady.

1753
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:29,130
You will be changed. You'll be a new being after that.

1754
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:32,050
You'll have giant, powerful television sets and be able to...

1755
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:32,050


1756
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:33,290
You'll be able to walk through walls.

1757
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:34,710
I am dedicated...

1758
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:35,710
That sounds wonderful.

1759
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:40,390
Say, could you tell me, are you as beautiful as all the women here in the Bay Guardian want ads?

1760
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:41,890
The relationship ads?

1761
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:43,850
Uh...

1762
01:30:43,850 --> 01:30:46,690
Poor Dr. Cabofram is a lonely soul.

1763
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:47,090
I feel better already.

1764
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:48,910
I feel better already.

1765
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:49,350
Thanks.

1766
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:51,050
There is a sub-life.

1767
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:51,510
Wait a minute.

1768
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:51,790
Wait.

1769
01:30:51,850 --> 01:30:54,510
Before you go, tell me, are you fantasy color?

1770
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:54,670
You could be all the power.

1771
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:56,310
Definitely.

1772
01:30:56,590 --> 01:30:57,650
Pink around the collar.

1773
01:30:58,430 --> 01:31:01,850
Well, let's check out then this other...

1774
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:02,030
I'm a little bit...

1775
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:02,030


1776
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:02,030


1777
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:03,110
You're a blinking...

1778
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:03,650
Goodbye.

1779
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:04,370
Apothegm.

1780
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:04,690
Goodbye.

1781
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:05,750
Put your hands...

1782
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:07,950
Lay those hands on the radio speakers.

1783
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:09,430
Make love to your radio.

1784
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:09,670


1785
01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:10,830
Hello, you on air.

1786
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:11,550
Lay your hands.

1787
01:31:11,650 --> 01:31:14,110
Yeah, I just saw Bob's body on the freeway.

1788
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:15,250
Not again.

1789
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,410
I told you, private.

1790
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:18,230
We get those calls in Dallas.

1791
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:18,710
That's why we get...

1792
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:19,010
Okay, now look.

1793
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:20,790
I'm not going out this time.

1794
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:22,350
One of you guys go...

1795
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:25,910
I went out two times and nobody else did it the last time.

1796
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:26,650
Somebody else...

1797
01:31:26,650 --> 01:31:27,050
We'll just call the Animal Control Board.

1798
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:28,410
Go out and pick that thing up.

1799
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:30,010
Call the Animal Control Board.

1800
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:32,010
I mean, I normally eat road kills, but I'm...

1801
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:32,630
I don't know about...

1802
01:31:32,630 --> 01:31:33,410
Smith and...

1803
01:31:33,410 --> 01:31:34,350
A smashed dog.

1804
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:38,050
We'll have to send one of those animal control trucks over.

1805
01:31:38,210 --> 01:31:38,850
It's no good.

1806
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:40,090
It's destroyed, man.

1807
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:40,790
It's destroyed.

1808
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:43,570
50 cars ran over it before anybody was stopped.

1809
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:44,190
Well, I'd say it's probably...

1810
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:45,590
Well, you know, but the cells can still...

1811
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:50,010
One cell carries all the code information to create a new Dobbs.

1812
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:52,650
You cook that thing just like you cook abalone.

1813
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:54,070
You peel that dog's corpse...

1814
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:54,210
Abalone.

1815
01:31:54,210 --> 01:31:54,990
...right off the road.

1816
01:31:55,070 --> 01:31:57,470
You dip it in egg and a little bit of flour...

1817
01:31:57,470 --> 01:31:57,610
Eggs.

1818
01:31:57,670 --> 01:31:59,550
...and cook it in olive oil...

1819
01:31:59,550 --> 01:31:59,590
Mmm.

1820
01:31:59,590 --> 01:31:59,730
Mmm.

1821
01:31:59,870 --> 01:32:00,390
...or butter.

1822
01:32:02,010 --> 01:32:05,330
And then you put it in a big old bowl of fried dead body of Dobbs, dear friends.

1823
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:07,210
We call it Bob's Birmingham.

1824
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:08,490
Bob's Birmingham.

1825
01:32:09,210 --> 01:32:09,870
That's right.

1826
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:11,690
It's the most delicious of all road kills.

1827
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:14,590
Much better than skunks, squirrels, or kitty.

1828
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:17,390
Or squished ferrets and weasels.

1829
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:19,250
But Bob's spirit lives on.

1830
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:24,870
You can talk about these Bob corpses, like I said, but he lives, because he's more than

1831
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:29,570
just a dead body with a grin on its face and a broken pipe in its mouth.

1832
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:31,930
He represents something, dear friends.

1833
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:33,010
He represents...

1834
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:33,930
And all of the checks...

1835
01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:37,810
Due to some P.O.

1836
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:42,410
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1837
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:47,290
Remember that address, folks, because later on during this program, we're going to have

1838
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:48,950
a special bonus.

1839
01:32:48,950 --> 01:32:52,030
So, Sonya the seeing poodle wants to get on the mailing list.

1840
01:32:52,570 --> 01:32:54,050
Well, let's put her on.

1841
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:57,170
I keep trying to send $20 in, but poodles can't write.

1842
01:32:57,570 --> 01:32:59,790
Well, why don't you write for her then?

1843
01:32:59,910 --> 01:33:01,250
We did get a subscription from...

1844
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:01,690
Holly helps us.

1845
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:01,870
...a subscription from...

1846
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:01,910
I'm sorry.

1847
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,910


1848
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,910


1849
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,910


1850
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,910


1851
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,910


1852
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,910


1853
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,910


1854
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,910


1855
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,910


1856
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,910


1857
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,910


1858
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,910


1859
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:02,010
From...

1860
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:04,770
And I hope you'll tell her hello from me, Dr. Howell.

1861
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:07,570
Only I think she was kidding.

1862
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:08,870
I think that was a fake name.

1863
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:12,210
Some people use fake names in this show.

1864
01:33:12,230 --> 01:33:13,750
They hide behind a pseudonym.

1865
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:16,890
They're afraid the conspiracy's going to come after them.

1866
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:21,410
Just because the conspiracy gets their addressable friends, I'm the one who's got access.

1867
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:27,690
Me and only one other person on this whole planet, someone else, has access to the identity

1868
01:33:27,690 --> 01:33:30,870
codes for all of you, all the listeners of this show.

1869
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:32,770
Cue Night of Slight shooting tape.

1870
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:42,170
All right, now we're going to check out the movies on TV here, and we'll have a report

1871
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:45,170
about agricultural instruments and...

1872
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:46,010
Oh, no.

1873
01:33:46,050 --> 01:33:49,710
Are they showing subgenius video, the movie, again?

1874
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:51,550
Yeah, I believe so.

1875
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:54,230
...be so out of it that you don't even know who Bob Dobbs was.

1876
01:33:54,230 --> 01:33:58,270
Oh, they're looking for a pay-stub artist to take the pieces of Bob's brain and try

1877
01:33:58,270 --> 01:33:59,770
to put them back together again.

1878
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:00,250
Of course.

1879
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:00,850
Oh, that's our...

1880
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:01,230
It's art nowadays.

1881
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:05,170
You put a pipe, you take any picture, put a pipe on it, it's art.

1882
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:08,050
Get 500 bucks or so for it, New York.

1883
01:34:08,290 --> 01:34:10,190
Of course, it is subgenius art.

1884
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:11,450
Got a pipe.

1885
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:15,010
My kid does better art than that.

1886
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:15,670
Art.

1887
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:15,990
Art.

1888
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:16,470
Art.
