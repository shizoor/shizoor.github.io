1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
Get your father in the room, look at the lawn, you're out.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,260
Huh. Funny light tonight.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,960
Look at my shadow.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,600
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:27,180
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,820
The subgenius.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,860
The power of slack.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,480
There is absolutely no other possibility.

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,660
Now, let me introduce your tutors.

10
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,180
Reverend Ivan Stang.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,920
She's also been to Nicaragua.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,020
To Nicaragua.

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,880
In the sausage.

14
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,100
In the serum.

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,320
By the way, she may also speak Spanish.

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,660
Oh, that's right, dear friends.

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,720
We're back again with everything all changed around and...

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,900
Still my shadow, but...

19
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,620
It's still...

20
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,460
There's no shadow here that I know.

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,620
That's the whole problem, you see.

22
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,600
But we're going to have a special subject for the show tonight.

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,800
For some of you...

24
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,660
People who haven't been up on your subgenius terminology lately.

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,060
We're going to investigate the subject of doctors.

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,320
Doctors.

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,260
That's a rank in the church of the subgenius.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,840
Yes, there's doctors out there, all right.

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:42,900
Doctors.

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,900
Yeah, I could...

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,900
I don't...

32
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,400
Well, it can...

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,440
No one can define the doctor syndrome.

34
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,160
It can only be illustrated by example.

35
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:55,800
Yes.

36
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,800
And be glad you can't see this show right now.

37
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,740
Except on Channel X.

38
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,500
We're having enough trouble as it is.

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,360
It has been a fun Easter, friends.

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,880
You know, last year the Easter pterodactyl brought the little eggs for my kids out in Glen Rose.

41
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,900
And this year, unfortunately, it wasn't quite so easy.

42
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,300
It was the Easter vomit ultrasaurs.

43
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,720
Huge eggs.

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,460
Huge eggs.

45
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:21,880
But...

46
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,140
I mean, you can hear them in the background.

47
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,740
Just how bad it was.

48
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,240
So...

49
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:36,380
Dallas viewers, may call the number on your screen, 823-7490, for information.

50
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,320
For disinformation, just keep listening.

51
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,640
And, uh, thank you.

52
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,640
It's just been a heck of a war so far here.

53
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,160
We're trying to march all the slack squads back to their barracks now.

54
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,900
And they're a little bit hard to deactivate.

55
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,140
They get belligerent late at night.

56
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,820
But they seem to be able to make it back to the barracks here.

57
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,960
Look, they've started now.

58
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,360
Yes.

59
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,780
This is what we call the, uh, monster beach party.

60
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,180
Oh, hey.

61
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,800
Well, so welcome to the subgenius beach party.

62
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,580
Yes, last week it was in Houston on KPFA.

63
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,880
You'll never know where the subgenius beach party is.

64
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,260
And don't you wish you did.

65
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:09,720
Oh, dear.

66
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,300
That ding.

67
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:10,620
Felt great.

68
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,440
Well, Dr. Howell, is there any way you can fight through the sound effects and tell us about the...

69
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,060
the relationship between the demopods and the...

70
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,960
Well, the demopods and the myriapods got together at the early...

71
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,440
No, the demopods and us-a-pods.

72
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,940
Oh, the demopods.

73
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,800
It says right here on the script we're supposed to...

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,520
I didn't understand that.

75
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,580
I thought you meant this script right here.

76
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,220
The one with the red lines on the cover.

77
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,060
Listen, never read anything with red dots.

78
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,660
I never believe anything with red dots.

79
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,440
It says read addresses to people you don't like on the show.

80
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,200
I'm coming in from all sides.

81
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,220
Too many buttons to push, too many tape recorders to watch.

82
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,640
Mobius ranks at your service.

83
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,660
Frankly, I don't give a damn.

84
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,920
Dead center.

85
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,260
Yes, liberty ranks.

86
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,220
I can't stand things that fight me.

87
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,260
That don't make any sense.

88
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,500
Come on, let's get out of my brain.

89
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,340
I am a subgenius, and by that virtue I am in touch with forces greater than man.

90
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,800
I dare you to kill me.

91
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,960
I am not a dupe of the conspiracy.

92
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,340
I know more than they do.

93
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,220
I am a subgenius.

94
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,700
That's all I need to be.

95
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,920
I'm one of the good guys.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,720
I shall prevail.

97
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,340
Let out the crazy man inside you.

98
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,340
He knows what's what.

99
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,860
Smile when you call me a fanatic.

100
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,660
Me primate.

101
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,620
Me overman.

102
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,940
I say to the pigs, give me your money.

103
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,780
You won't need it.

104
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,400
The future offers you not but destruction.

105
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,620
What do they believe in?

106
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:19,660
Everything.

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,120
Who do they believe in?

108
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,420
A mysterious character named Bob.

109
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,440
A character named Bob.

110
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:32,700
Bob.

111
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,680
A character named Bob.

112
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,540
Bob is what will bring slack to planet Earth.

113
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,380
And to you, young man.

114
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,360
And to you, if you will send a dollar.

115
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,860
If you send a dollar.

116
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,660
Who do they believe in?

117
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,660
A mysterious character named Bob.

118
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,800
Bob is the gun, and you are the bullet.

119
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,200
The showdown is fast approaching.

120
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,700
The church is still unknown, but its infectious doctrines spread across continents.

121
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:12,820
Church headquarters, the first megaphys temple lodge, is housed in this Dallas skyscraper,

122
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:18,240
from which Dob's secret mandates are issued to his agents in the dreaded Brotherhood of Bob.

123
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,500
But this mighty edifice represents but the tip of a wandering rogue iceberg.

124
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,780
The words, hymns, and sounds of Bob's voice are the only things that are heard.

125
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,920
The sound effects of Dob's are disseminated on a weekly basis to thousands of devout radio listeners in most major cities,

126
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,700
even as far away as China and darkest Africa.

127
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:43,260
This show is so popular today, we're studying it from all angles, and you can even watch this show on Channel X.

128
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,620
As Hal plays the microphone, it flies backwards around the other side of the planet.

129
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,760
The subgeniuses in China have to listen on shortwave radios, very hard to detect.

130
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,780
You'll notice we've switched to spewage music for the background for this episode.

131
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,380
The show is a segment of the, uh, uh, show.

132
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,620
As the psychic surgery is performed, the doctor's sweaty brow is wiped by a small nuclear explosion.

133
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,780
Oof. All better now.

134
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,500
Oh!

135
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,540
Hello!

136
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,800
You're improving, Jack. You just can't seem to get rid of that streak of honesty in you.

137
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,580
He gave you a vision of moral justice.

138
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:25,760
He gave you a vision of moral justice.

139
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,920
He gave you moral order in the universe, and there isn't any.

140
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:37,640
Those stars twinkle in a void, dear boy, and the two-legged creature schemes and dreams beneath them, all in vain.

141
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,480
All in vain, Jack.

142
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,900
You hear anything?

143
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,960
Listen to me.

144
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,560
The two-legged creature won't believe anything, and the more preposterous, the better.

145
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,400
Whales speak French at the bottom of the sea.

146
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,740
The whole world is a mess.

147
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:02,420
of Arabia have silver wings. Pygmies mate with elephants in darkest Africa. I have

148
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:08,140
sold all those propositions. They were all fools and none of it matters.

149
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:18,580
For whatever reason you refuse to feel this space we're in, to know its insanity,

150
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:24,940
really know it, whatever your particular anesthetic is that you hold on to so

151
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,220
desperately, the thing I mean that makes you think you know who you are, whatever

152
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,380
that thing is you allow to keep you sane, your ace in the hole, the psyche that

153
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,720
keeps you from trying to guess at what your pimp has in store for you, whatever

154
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,120
keeps you from screaming out at this very moment in absolute and sheer horror,

155
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:54,800
whatever that is, whatever that is, it's a lie. It's a lie. Give reality your

156
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:54,920
power.

157
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:01,840
Brain, you fantasized son of Walt Disney. It's a lie. An old off-the-street pimp's con

158
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,560
game, the magic for turning human blood into US steel, the thing that seduces you into

159
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,740
being satisfied and pointing to the last tiny patch of flesh you have on your bones as proof

160
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,400
of your humanity and keeps you satisfied thinking yourself human because you live a fraction

161
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,100
of a fraction of a fraction of a life.

162
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,600
I know you.

163
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,240
No.

164
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:31,540
Because you live here in his space as I do, are his image and play his game on each other,

165
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,080
thinking it's your own. I know you.

166
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:35,580
No.

167
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:42,380
You can't live in an insane asylum, play an insane game with a madman and be objective,

168
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:42,860
brother.

169
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,280
No.

170
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,800
Hope? At least prostitutes get paid.

171
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,960
No.

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,220
Yes, while you pin your hopes, your sanity, and most of all your individuality on that rickety old man,

173
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,220


174
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,220


175
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,220


176
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,220


177
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,220


178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,140
you're a little too old for the kind game, a web of words.

179
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,080
No.

180
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:04,100
While the master pimp helps you paint your individual death wish in your head, feel who you are.

181
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:04,640
No.

182
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,220
Feel for a split second the obscenity of who you've got to be.

183
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:10,720
No.

184
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,980
Really. In actions, I mean.

185
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:23,560
Defined by, ordered up for, and delivered to your jobs on Monday morning, the greatest eight hours you'll spend in your entire life, ho.

186
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,360
Is a colored television really worth that?

187
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:36,720
In this filth, this insidious insanity, this nightmare of deception and hypocrisy, in this United States of America,

188
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:45,940
careful not to awake on sleeping, we, you and I, wander around through a sea of our own rotten bodies,

189
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:53,520
in this pimp whore's game, you pretending it's everything else, in this sewer in which no one can escape,

190
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:53,540


191
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:59,140
playing, it's normal for brothers to pimp sisters and wives because their fathers pimped them,

192
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:05,860
or for television stations to pimp their audiences for perverted sponsors who whore for their own commercials.

193
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:16,900
And, until the authorities catch on, even common normals can purchase The Word of Bob itself in condensed form,

194
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,720
the legendary book of the subgenius, available in bookstores everywhere.

195
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:30,260
But the only certain way to receive the Dobbs teachings in uncut form is to tithe directly to the church.

196
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:38,160
Do you really think you've freed yourself of America's special insidiousness of being inside you?

197
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,120
No, brother, America's a condition.

198
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,480
One thing's for sure, a sheep is not a creature of the air.

199
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:51,540
But at the same time, we will be intent on searching out the truth of all evidentiary components,

200
00:10:51,540 --> 00:11:02,800
which ostensibly have posed a threat to our constitutional processes, in particular, our concept of freedom and our electoral process.

201
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,520
Good bread, because I was making, uh, two seventy-one an hour.

202
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,780
Well, as a member of the Stock Exchange, I would suck their brains out with a straw.

203
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,480
The easiest way is to write a postal card and ask them to mail you all their leaflets.

204
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,940
They'll put you on, and forever you'll have everything.

205
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,940
Even after it's over with, you'll still get it. They're very happy to do so.

206
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:40,220
You will be ordained as a card-carrying minister, and receive the huge official magazine of churchly news and doctrine,

207
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,660
The Stark Fist of Removal.

208
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,780
I'd just like to say a few words about The Stark Fist of Removal.

209
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,400
This is the official newsletter of the church, and it's got all kinds of great stuff in it.

210
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,520
It's got, uh, proof of the law.

211
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,420
It's got a picture of Bob with Ronald Reagan in there.

212
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,460
It's got, uh, all important instructions to the subgenius.

213
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,660
Illiterates can purchase their choice of dozens of inspirational cassette tapes.

214
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,960
And there's even a line of casual subgenius wear to fit every size or budget.

215
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,240
Why don't you sprit their nostrils open with a bowtook?

216
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,340
Well, that's not a very good answer. You're heightening my concern rather than lessening it.

217
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,180
It's embarrassing.

218
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,520
It's moist.

219
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,420
It's moist. It drips.

220
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,900
It squirts.

221
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,460
It's liquid warmth emitting from your body.

222
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,960
It's, uh, it dribbles. It spits.

223
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,060
It's nasty.

224
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,920
But yet it's beautiful in its own wet, slimy, squirting,

225
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,780
and embarrassing way.

226
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,460
He did. And he did it the subgenius way, too.

227
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,700
He got, it wasn't, he had already gotten a short-duration marriage.

228
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,500
That's right.

229
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,360
From Pastor Naked, an official one.

230
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,960
He already had the paperwork. He did have the paperwork.

231
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,120
He would have sanctified couplings, friends, for the last few years.

232
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,480
But their short-duration marriage ran out, and rather than send Buck any more money,

233
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,820
they went to Las Vegas and had one of those parlor chapel, as Norm just told me they're called,

234
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,140
a parlor chapel wedding.

235
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,880
Marriage parlor.

236
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,900
And when he left the chapel, this, this accolade,

237
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,080
came running, you know, it was one of those ten-minute ceremonies.

238
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,280
This guy actually had the gall to come running out going,

239
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,400
uh, sir, there's supposed to be a $25 tip, quote, tip, unquote,

240
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,800
to which Pope Sterno threw down a dollar and said, sir, kill me.

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,320
That's right. But we should say congratulations to Pope Sterno

242
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,440
and his faithful ubermatrix, that is to say, Miss Dottie.

243
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,580
That's right. And they're creating more little yetis, friends.

244
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:45,960
Yes, sir.

245
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,560
They are further contaminating the gene pool.

246
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,880
Yes, sir. Little tiny artisanian yeti babies.

247
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,220
The way he became a subgenius was his father was one of the guys who had to stand

248
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,380
on the Nevada desert and face nuclear tests from about half a mile away.

249
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,040
That's right. Wearing only goggles and a lead-shielded jockstrap.

250
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,140
Mm-hmm. Duck and cover, baby.

251
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:05,840
You betcha.

252
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,680
But they weren't allowed to in those days, and the result is thousands of subgenius children

253
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,240
of those, those selfless servicemen who gave their genetic structure for...

254
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,100
Genes. Gave their genes for...

255
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,200
For nuclear dominance.

256
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:17,940
There you go.

257
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,720
...to study OSR in the hydrospeed, Zotesh.

258
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,920
Uh, yeah.

259
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:39,920


260
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:39,920


261
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:39,920


262
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:39,920


263
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:39,920


264
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:39,920


265
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:39,920


266
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,860
What did you say?

267
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,260
H jocks

268
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,900
arders?

269
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,820
Humanflies?

270
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:43,900
Uh-uh.

271
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,360
We've heard that when we're scrolling through radio stations in the world we think

272
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,580
we're probably off our spider's web.

273
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:46,580


274
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,320
Yeah, it's just cool to see how fascinating Sci play's been at this height.

275
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,200
An interesting!'

276
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,860
Wow long hi.

277
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,900
Ta-na'wa.

278
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,880
Uh...

279
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,080
If we want to eradicate the very concept of money, it's going to take money and tons of it.

280
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,780
But money is to burn.

281
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,160
Here come tons of money now.

282
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,740
So we're asking, and we can start with yours.

283
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,400
Okay.

284
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,400
Mr. Listener.

285
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,460
All the listeners now are putting their money in a big pile.

286
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:16,460
If we can take all the money and burn it, then we can start a free anarchist society.

287
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,600
But we've got to have all the money first.

288
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,900
We're the only people who can take the responsibility for this project.

289
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:32,980
Yes, air and liquid both emit from this new type of tool, which we have now begun to provide to the ministers and those who would spread the seed of Bob.

290
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,860
The seed, my friend, of Bob.

291
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,660
It is true there is a thing here I do not understand.

292
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,320
There's a pain between my ears.

293
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:59,080
And so the confused initiate was led to Dockstock, Dobstown itself, Dobstown, Malaysia, where he was shocked to discover the most primitive possible living condition.

294
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:07,560
Earth was inhabited by a species from another dimension with certain chance from the book sacrifices.

295
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,580
This race, the old ones, can be brought back.

296
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,260
And mankind?

297
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,180
Destroyed.

298
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,020
To say what.

299
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:29,620
In the vast continuity of school parks, There seemed to learn evil within.

300
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,880
There were people there, with sensible hills.

301
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,000
And there were children there, with no rooms of distinction.

302
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,580
There were women there, with no room of justification.

303
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,820
Who was thought of as virtuous

304
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,440
For they contain the blood

305
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,320
Of the ruling class

306
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,560
Of Suropat

307
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,060
I said men cry

308
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,280
Baby it's time

309
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,940
Children fell

310
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,980
Men sigh

311
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,240
Babies cry

312
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,720
Men die

313
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,060
Children fell

314
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,800
Women suffer

315
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,260
People die

316
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,920
They wanted repentance

317
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,080
And victims they wanted to escape

318
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,400
Yeah they just wanted to escape

319
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,720
He should know about it

320
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,000
He should know about it

321
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,620
He should know about Suropat

322
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,540
And the winter solstice

323
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,260
And the winter solstice

324
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,480
And the winter solstice

325
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:20,960
And the winter solstice

326
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,700
I said men cry

327
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,880
Babies die

328
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,500
Children fell

329
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,960
People were hurt

330
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,160
They died

331
00:18:46,280 --> 00:19:16,280


332
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,100
fans. Ah yes, People's Temple.

333
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,580
I'd say

334
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,200
there's about four months

335
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,740
before what?

336
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,240
Before there's a delightful smell

337
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,940
in the universe of charcoal's mankind.

338
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,100
You really mean four months?

339
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,220
According to the temperature rises in the last

340
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:52,900
few weeks, yes.

341
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,080
So that's the message, is it? About another

342
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,360
300 deadlines. Is that what we say in tomorrow's

343
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,420
paper? Tomorrow we report the news, the facts.

344
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,380
We leave prophecy to the street corner cranks.

345
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,260
Some purchase thousands of

346
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,320
Bob's handy pamphlets with which to recruit

347
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,180
the worthy and to perplex

348
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,180
the normals. To fill their minds

349
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,120
with questions. Questions that only

350
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,100
Bob can answer.

351
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,400
To his chosen apostles, his fishers of wallets.

352
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,480
And what is money?

353
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,800
Merely another tool of the conspiracy.

354
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,040
Except when it gains power

355
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,600
by passing from your pocket to Bob's.

356
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,160
I've got a cash in Bob

357
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,880
and if you have a problem with your cash flow

358
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,240
it's because your cash is not flowing

359
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,800
towards Bob.

360
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,200
This is the first industrial church.

361
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,480
We're not a tax write-off

362
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:36,780
scam.

363
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,020
We are an

364
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,060
incorporated profit-making foundation.

365
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
If there is

366
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,600
such a thing. We're profits and we

367
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,260
want profits.

368
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,380
So you've got to come back to the old

369
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,820
American way, yes?

370
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,620
You've got to come back to quality goods for your dollar.

371
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,840
A righteous purchase.

372
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,540
Now let me ask you some questions. How many of you have been

373
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,100
tithing unto Bob that

374
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,540
which is truly Bob's? Tell me that, children.

375
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,600
How many of you have been giving 10% of your

376
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,620
worth of goods to Bob?

377
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,480
I don't care who you are or where you come from.

378
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,460
If you haven't sent your $20 into Bob

379
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,800
you're going to burn.

380
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,500
Mother Teresa,

381
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,600
I don't care how many people she's helped.

382
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,200
If she hadn't sent her $20 into jail,

383
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,800
Bob Dodge is going to burn in hell.

384
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,620
And Bob offers a guarantee that can't be beaten.

385
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,700
Eternal Salvation.

386
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,560
Or triple your money back.

387
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,240
Bob will protect you.

388
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,160
Bob is protecting the genetic future.

389
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,040
Let him. Let him into your life.

390
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,600
Let Bob protect you. He wants to protect you.

391
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,960
He must protect you.

392
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,340
He has to protect you.

393
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,440
Jehovah One says Bob will protect you if you send a dollar...

394
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:48,760
.

395
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,160
.

396
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,920
.

397
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:55,920


398
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,040
.

399
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,160
.

400
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,160


401
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,160


402
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,340
.

403
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:09,200
. . . . . . . . .

404
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:16,340
. , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Pr lengths.

405
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:25,720
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

406
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,280
Make sure she is approached to Quand

407
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,280


408
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,280


409
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,620
my baby my baby

410
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:35,160
my baby my baby

411
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,140
my baby my baby

412
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,160
it's not the same thing anymore

413
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,620
there you go

414
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,320
that's another place friends

415
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,640
it's not the same thing anymore

416
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,040
where you can get those

417
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,740
prairie squid

418
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,740
drinks you can actually get prairie squid drinks

419
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,680
yeah they put them in a blender

420
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,980
with protein powder

421
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,940
and just turn them into a really thick

422
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,000
it's kind of like a daiquiri

423
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,560
in texture

424
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,680
but it's not the real prairie squid

425
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,080
it's the flash frozen stuff

426
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,700
nobody does it with a live prairie squid

427
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,800
praise Bob

428
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,160
well dear friends

429
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,620
it's time

430
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,120
for a moment of

431
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,360
melody and melody

432
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,520
yes if you'll turn to page 5 in your program

433
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,580
well

434
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,780
I'm going to lead you in the hymn

435
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,080
which we call

436
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
Bob is my story

437
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,380
this is a hymn which is usually performed

438
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,500
in moments of extreme stress

439
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,880
and such I judge this to be

440
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,360
it's very easy

441
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,200
and you can support me on the second verse in the chorus

442
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,380
if you choose

443
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,860
so we'll sing Bob is my story

444
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,440
page 5

445
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,440
I saw a man with a pipe and a grin

446
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,600
all in the new morning light

447
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,080
smiling at me like a madman till he

448
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,100
made me uptight

449
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,380
I told him don't bother me anymore

450
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,640
but he kept on just the same

451
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,740
till I was totally brainwashed

452
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,480
Bob is his name

453
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,660
this is the chorus

454
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,420
he is my story

455
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,420
he is my story

456
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,940
Bob is my song

457
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,540
Bob my amphetamine

458
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,820
all the day long

459
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,520
I won't tear my poster of dogs down

460
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,340
I'll feel no sadness or shame

461
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,780
till I rejoin him in dog style

462
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,640
Bob is his name

463
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,060
he has no lack of his patented slack

464
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,400
he has no lack of his patented slack

465
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,840
and for those of his following four

466
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,260
he is a friend of whoever will send

467
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,180
green back for gold

468
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,340
he's growing stronger and stronger

469
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,380
but he keeps redder than flame

470
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,540
I'll be a pink boy no longer

471
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,880
Bob is his name

472
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,740
Bob is my story

473
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,180
Bob is his is your story friends

474
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,340
and Bob is your fame

475
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:31,340
Bob is the glands that keep you feeling the way you do

476
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,820
keep your squid juices pumping

477
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,280
as they say

478
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,980
Bob stop that

479
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,740
how many more times do we have to listen

480
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:52,160
how many more times do we have to hear the worst song ever

481
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,760
this band is terrible tonight

482
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,540
they just wanna fall asleep

483
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,680
yeah the audience is going in every different direction possible

484
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,740
they're sick of them

485
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,620
they're sick of the cafe depresso

486
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,920
yeah they're sick of everything here

487
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,980
they only know three chords

488
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,140
but you're only gonna see them play one

489
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,360
I'm so tired of these guys

490
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,460
this band's bad

491
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,020
it's no surprise

492
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,160
I wish they'd just pack it up and go away

493
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,400
well how many times

494
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:43,820
do we have to play this same song over and over and over again

495
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:51,280
well how many times do we have to play these same four notes

496
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,860
over and over again

497
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,720
when I came down to this nightclub

498
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,620
I thought things would be a little bit different

499
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,400
it's just the same old band

500
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,640
in the same stupid shirts

501
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,680
in the same stupid police ahead

502
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,460
you'd think they could do something new after all these years

503
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,640
but they just play that same song

504
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,340
they just play that song all day long

505
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:33,120
well how many more times do we have to play this same song over and over again

506
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,940
so you just think of us

507
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,700
well it's one chord up one chord down

508
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,760
won't that music get me down

509
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,000
I played in this band for

510
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,600
ten hours or so

511
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,200
I ain't seen my check

512
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,560
where's my check

513
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,820
oh where's my check

514
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:04,180
well how many times do we have to ask for this same check

515
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,360
over and over again

516
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:15,540
well how many times do we have to play the worst song in the whole world

517
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,980
over and over and over again

518
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,080
over and over and over and over again

519
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,100
I put knives in the blood

520
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,780
and made one ready for a little of the old out in out in

521
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,080
leave it in when you're finished

522
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,720
yes this is what we do

523
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,620
monks we are monks of Buldada

524
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,080
and though they will not let the grass thrive here

525
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,440
nor the trees

526
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,700
Buldada shall live

527
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,660
because Buldada having never been alive cannot be killed

528
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,980
so in this paradox we find a third

529
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,500
and a pure and simple answer

530
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,400
an answer to the question

531
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,580
of what to do tonight

532
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,260
Friday night

533
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,620
ah yes it's Friday

534
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,320
yes you can start sinning now brother

535
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,660
you can sin from now till Sunday morning

536
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:12,000
you've got a good 48 hours of solid sinning

537
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,680
in front of you

538
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,720
and by gobs end after it's all over with

539
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,660
you can sit there with a hangover in church

540
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,180
and have it all washed away

541
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,560
washed away in the blood

542
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,120
the blood of the lambs

543
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,700
and the blood of the wolves for that matter

544
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,140
for is not the lamb of Jesus now being eaten by a black wolf

545
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,860
an evil wolf

546
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,780
a wolf of conspiracy

547
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,460
conspiracy my friend

548
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,720
a wolf that would take the good jokes of Jesus

549
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,980
the sublime teachings of Buddha

550
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:43,900
the

551
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,700
the small business business

552
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,420
the terrible of dogs

553
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,380
and twist them

554
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,900
distort them

555
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,980
for their own aims

556
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,260
yes that's the way it is now

557
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,420
it's true

558
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,840
they try to do all the bad things I've done

559
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,120
we've gotta save the universe at this moment

560
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,680
if we'd have been the single nose we'd have all died

561
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,260
there's no corpse there

562
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,520
and lo, many

563
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:32,280
elephants and rhinoceros came to destroy their huts and villages

564
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,020
and to step on their albums

565
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,000
and lo, the Lord was angered that they did not give their money

566
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,900
and great panic and broken guitar strings

567
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,460
don't follow anything

568
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,920
Look at it when you take a break from listening.

569
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,100
But for now...

570
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,540
What is a rant?

571
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,240
A rant's a revival.

572
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,120
And a rant is part of a revival as an atom is part of a molecule.

573
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:56,660
Yes.

574
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:01,220
It's when the person gets on stage and lets Bob speak through it

575
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,220
and just cuts loose.

576
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,920
It's the living tongue acting on Bob.

577
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,400
Exactly.

578
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,760
It's the undirected energy of Bob spewing forth through the human carcass.

579
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,700
We need a few of the initiates, please, to squat in the dirt

580
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,060
and let us have their chairs.

581
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,600
Will someone help move the bodies of those stunned by the music

582
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,220
back to the back by the beer?

583
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,260
The pile is out front.

584
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,580
No, back. Excuse me.

585
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,840
And for everyone...

586
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,940
We're throwing them in all directions.

587
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,860
Their body is worth approximately $12 and it's falling fast.

588
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,920
Everyone that dies tonight is thrown on a cremation pile.

589
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,240
Every subgenius that is carrying his car gets a cut of that $12.

590
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,520
We need the glands for those experiments.

591
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,420
And we're talking about the...

592
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,040
Foot glands.

593
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,240
The most important one in your body next to you-know-what.

594
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,900
And yet nothing could still the ranting tongues of the high priests of the subgenius.

595
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,600
No lack of material.

596
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,560
No complete embarrassment could stop their ever-flapping,

597
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,240
petulantly vibrating, ranting tongues

598
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,640
from continuously speaking the word of Dobbs.

599
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,740
Even though no one was listening.

600
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,960
Even though their drugs had not kicked in.

601
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,320
Boys.

602
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:16,900
And the darkness.

603
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,900
Even though their brains had finally completely left them.

604
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:28,320
Even though their tapes had run out and had to be flipped in order to continue the lessons in...

605
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,780
Just how doctors for Bob...

606
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:32,920
Orphous...

607
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,300
Not your physician for Robert.

608
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,360
None of that fancy stuff.

609
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,720
Just your straight doctors for Bob.

610
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,440
How they use anti-music to surgically change what was previously in your brain.

611
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,540
Oh, there went some of it.

612
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,380
Thank you.

613
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:48,920
As the...

614
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,060
We tried to donate at the sperm bank, but they wouldn't let us.

615
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,720
Praise Bob!

616
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,540
Praise Bob!

617
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,560
There's people here, there's people here, who, you know...

618
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,320
Can't donate to the sperm bank, because they're underweight.

619
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,120
Okay?

620
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,180
That's alright.

621
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,180
Let us just have just a few cells from underneath your skin so we can begin the cloning experiments.

622
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,680
Let us just have a chocolate.

623
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,060
I would like to clone that young lady in the front row, because I know in about 14 years she'd be so cute!

624
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,320
We bring them up behind us.

625
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,040
We're gonna just, you know, think you'd have a companion.

626
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,460
If you're gonna be exposed to radiation, let's go all the way.

627
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:25,160
You know, if you're gonna do it, then just sit in front of a color TV with your legs widespread watching Mr. T cartoons,

628
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,560
and you can have a boy just like Jayner!

629
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,160
Yeah, that's right.

630
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,760
It's the MRAs!

631
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,280
It's the MRAs!

632
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,020
Jayner's power...

633
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,860
Make the tires fall off your car, I'm sorry, Bob!

634
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:37,000
Jayner's power is next to the largest industrial waste dump.

635
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,080
It's a Jayner device.

636
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,240
It's a Jayner device.

637
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,580
It's a Jayner device.

638
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,360
Adam hooked up to a Jayner device.

639
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,220
Jayner, the perfect prince of the church, speaks.

640
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,980
Adam plugged into a Jayner device.

641
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,480
Eyebr 105.

642
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,340
That's a beautiful thing to come in of a Jayner device.

643
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:47,420
Yeah, yeah.

644
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,980
I don't drink with my Karen, but this isn't43total.

645
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,640
I kinda like drinking with my dad.

646
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:08,320
Well, my mom can try some of his raw

647
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,620
dad comers.

648
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:09,840


649
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,500
and, you know, if I take a bunch of cans back,

650
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,420
well, they don't like that kind of thing,

651
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:18,340
and, you know, well, I could probably just pour all the beer out of it,

652
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,580
but, well, that'd probably kill my grass,

653
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,520
and, yeah, I don't want to do that.

654
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,460
I could trade in for the aluminum,

655
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,840
but, yeah, it wouldn't be really worth the price of the gas

656
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,680
driving down to the aluminum recycling plant.

657
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,880
It'd probably be worth, you know,

658
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,880
yeah, that's what it is.

659
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,520
I could take them in for the aluminum, you know,

660
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,820
because if I drank them, well, it'd probably be worth more

661
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,660
if they were just the aluminum.

662
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,080
No recycling plant's going to buy aluminum with beer in it,

663
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,240
so I probably would have to drink it,

664
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,740
and, well, it, you know, helps wash down my food,

665
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,980
and it's probably, you know,

666
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,840
if I, you know, didn't drink any today,

667
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,660
well, five more days from now,

668
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,620
it'd be Sunday, and I might want some

669
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,200
and wouldn't be able to drink any,

670
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,400
so at least I could say, well,

671
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,140
hell, I got blowed off my ass last Monday,

672
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,760
and, you know, well, these pop tops,

673
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,300
well, some little kid could step on them,

674
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,900
or, you know, even though they are still full of beers,

675
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,260
and, well, yeah, they are in my refrigerator,

676
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,160
but, you know, by some twist of the imagination,

677
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,980
this little boy's foot could conceivably,

678
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,720
I'm not saying that it's impossible,

679
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,980
but it could probably come into my refrigerator,

680
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,440
and he could, you know, cut his foot open,

681
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,120
and, well, if he sued me,

682
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,980
or something like that,

683
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,320
the hospital bill would be far greater than this beer,

684
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,200
is it probably even worth it,

685
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,840
if he did step on it,

686
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,460
and, well, as, you know,

687
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,800
so if I would drink it,

688
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:51,600
and properly take care of the beer cap,

689
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,160
the beer can tops,

690
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,660
and that'd be one less thing,

691
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,680
one less thing on my mind

692
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,060
that I wouldn't have to worry about,

693
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,820
and if I did get drunk,

694
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,180
well, I probably wouldn't have to worry about it anyway,

695
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,900
even though the fact that the beer can,

696
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,200
the can tops might be in, say, a trash can,

697
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,240
along with the beer can,

698
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,620
oh, yeah, but, yeah,

699
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,500
I was going to send him,

700
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,680
take him to the recycling plant,

701
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,900
so I could get the money for him,

702
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,020
and that was another reason,

703
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,260
and, well, you know,

704
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,180
he's, he's, they went to all the trouble

705
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,460
to paint the red, white, and blue Budweiser label on here,

706
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,180
and, well, I'd hate to, you know,

707
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,860
I like to support the arts,

708
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,120
I'm a patron of the arts,

709
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,500
I'd like to, you know, support him.

710
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,860
Did you hear what he was saying?

711
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,840
Did you hear what he was saying?

712
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,520
I don't like that last sound.

713
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,960
The Lord is my shepherd.

714
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,900
No, that won't do.

715
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,560
All right, close your eyes, please,

716
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,560
and repeat this prayer after me,

717
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,980
right out loud.

718
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,060
Ing, ing, ing, ing, ing.

719
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,480
Like this.

720
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,460
Ink.

721
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,600
Ink, ink, ink.

722
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,360
Ang, ang, ang, ang, ang.

723
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,400
Eve meet concrete eel.

724
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,880
What makes us do this?

725
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,020
I don't know.

726
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,240
Oh, he's funny.

727
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,920
He's funny.

728
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:28,100
I hear it's red and blue.

729
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,840
Give me a box, baby.

730
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,520
I don't know what's going on.

731
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,800
You'll never stop.

732
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,320
Well, I'm still in this song.

733
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,100
It never stops.

734
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,140
Two days later,

735
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,700
it's still going strong.

736
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,580
It never stops.

737
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,240
I don't know what's going on.

738
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,180
It never stops.

739
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:46,460
Oh, no.

740
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,380
Beings party.

741
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,240
Beings party.

742
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,540
Oh, he never stops.

743
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,020
Never stops.

744
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:51,340
Never stops.

745
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,080
Never stops.

746
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:53,880
It never stops.

747
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,080
Beings party.

748
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,920
Beings party.

749
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,120
It never stops.

750
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,760
And then because we are Christians or Americans or something, I don't know just why, we began

751
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,980
to get conscience pains.

752
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,880
And we began to hear people say, well, don't you know, I'm a Christian.

753
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:05,880


754
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,020
They don't know it's true.

755
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,020


756
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,020


757
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,820
Don't just do something.

758
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,500
Stand there.

759
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:07,920
No.

760
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,980
We are ready for the TV.

761
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,240
He's got a bra that's about two foot long.

762
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,980
Went to the doctor.

763
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,080
Let her go, Bob.

764
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,600
And I predict that our local American doctors will go on strike and be replaced by African

765
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,840
witch doctors.

766
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,300
Doctors!

767
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,100
Doctors!

768
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,860
Doctors for Bob.

769
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,140
Doctors!

770
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:31,140
Doctors!

771
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,400
Doctors for Bob.

772
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,300
Doctors!

773
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,860
Doctors for Bob.

774
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:35,860


775
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,200
Doctors for Bob! Doctors for Bob! Doctors for Bob!

776
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,580
Doctors for Bob! Endocrinologists for Bob!

777
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,240
Farmers for Bob! Gynecologists for Bob!

778
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,720
Kary Krishna's for Bob! Illustrators for Bob!

779
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,500
Jailers for Bob! Kidnappers for Bob! Lawyers for Bob!

780
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,240
Mothers for Bob! Neurologists for Bob!

781
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,980
We kept the pussies alive, they were in good condition. We fed them once a week. I didn't see why they had anything to complain about.

782
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:17,900
We had the neighbors look in on them while we were gone. We didn't whip them hard. We didn't kill them very hard. I didn't see why they had any reason to sue them.

783
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:28,100
We didn't cut her legs off hard. We only cut off two of her legs. She didn't really have any reason to sue.

784
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,800
When we ran over her face it was with her.

785
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:42,580
I mean, it was a Volkswagen. I mean, if we had run over her with a heavy car, I can understand why she had sued for that.

786
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,060
Just for throwing acid pit.

787
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,720
Yeah, Duell only took two livers is what I heard.

788
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,620
And he only took two. He only took three kidneys.

789
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,180
I mean, I don't see how the Subgenius Foundation is responsible.

790
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:56,960
I mean, if these people want to hypnotize us into cutting their pussies off, we're going to have to do it.

791
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,640
There's only 3.57 pussies alive.

792
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,780
These people want to hypnotize us into cutting their pussies off.

793
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:01,780


794
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,060
I mean, they're going to cut their brains out with chainsaws.

795
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,780
Beach party, beach party, it never stops.

796
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,340
I'm tired of this nightclub.

797
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,780
This band is so bad.

798
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:19,020
Why do I have to pay five dollars every night to stay alive?

799
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:27,580
Well, how many times do we have to play this worst song over and over and over?

800
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,260
Over again.

801
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,040
Over again.

802
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,300
We're a subgenius board with flesh under our brains.

803
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,960
Subgenius Broom Camp.

804
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,320
I'm flavored with our Andrea Marcus.

805
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,800
I'm popular—

806
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,500
With them.

807
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,120
First impression of me.

808
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,560
For me, foods are better than marshmallows.

809
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,640
From America.

810
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:48,660
Weünkai.

811
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:48,860


812
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:48,860


813
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,760
Napolitan stew.

814
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:01,760


815
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,180
Thank you.

816
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,640
Thank you.

817
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,060
Thank you.

818
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,540
Thank you.

819
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,360
Thank you.

820
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,400
Thank you.

821
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,260
Thank you.

822
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,820
Israel Regardie there, friends.

823
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,540
Thank you.

824
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,060
Thank you.

825
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,740
Thank you.

826
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,720
A digital counter on the wall, Reverend Stang.

827
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:35,580
Yes, we're coming down.

828
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,960
We've got three minutes left.

829
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,800
Three minutes of slack time, friends.

830
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,500
And I could play some burbling background noise,

831
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,200
or I could play the official sign-off tunes and so forth.

832
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,060
We could just talk for another three minutes.

833
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,120
Easily.

834
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:47,620
Easily.

835
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,280
We could talk for another three hours, friends.

836
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,700
Or three days, if that's what it takes to get you to write to that sacred post office box.

837
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:58,740
You've been hearing the learned old scholars of the Church of the Subgenius Society tonight.

838
00:46:59,020 --> 00:46:59,600
That's right.

839
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:07,300
And learned we are in the dark knowledge and forbidden sciences of time control, slack extraction.

840
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,600
And the arcane secrets of the prairie squid.

841
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:15,320
Friends, are you going to put up with what the gland owners are laying down on you?

842
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,880
I want you to either stand up or shut up, baby.

843
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,260
Praise Bob.

844
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,940
You've got to hip out to it or die trying not to.

845
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,820
Or just kill me.

846
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:46,300
And think to yourself, there's no place like home.

847
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,120
There's no place like home.

848
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:49,660
All right.

849
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,040
We're putting Serge in a psychopath now.

850
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,280
How do we spot him?

851
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,280
Well, if he's wearing a Napoleon hat, it's easy.

852
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,600
Otherwise, they come in all sizes and shapes.

853
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,400
11-year-old girls to 80-year-old men.

854
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,040
Yeah, they all look perfectly normal.

855
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,880
I keep telling y'all, this is a sick and perverted nation.

856
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,300
All the time.

857
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,240
And nobody wants to listen to me.

858
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,740
Nobody wants to hear about Bob.

859
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,340
Nobody.

860
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,180
I try to tell everybody what's going on, but they won't listen to me.

861
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,960
Well, to tell you the truth, I can't stand it anymore.

862
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,200
I don't know why you believe me.

863
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:32,200


864
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:32,200


865
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,300
Hi, everybody.

866
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:38,440
I'm Andy Oakley, and you're right on target for another session of the Gun Show.

867
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:44,860
It's the election year game that lets legislators from all over America say good things about guns

868
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:49,020
as they try to get votes and score a bullseye with our sharpshooting panel.

869
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,140
And who's tonight's first target?

870
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,360
Our first target tonight, Andy, is a state senator from Rockhead, New Hampshire.

871
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,060
Let's have a salve of applause for Harry Bolt.

872
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:57,880
Thank you.

873
00:48:59,020 --> 00:48:59,580
Thank you.

874
00:48:59,580 --> 00:48:59,580


875
00:48:59,580 --> 00:48:59,580


876
00:48:59,580 --> 00:48:59,580


877
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:02,920
My fellow voters, nobody in this country admires firearms more than I do.

878
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,880
Every American ought to have four or five.

879
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:09,360
I've got a 12-gauge in the living room, a .238 in the den, .30-30 in my car,

880
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,540
and as you can see, I'm carrying a 4.2-inch mortar.

881
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,620
Now, put your hands up and don't try any funny business.

882
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,700
Whoopee! Hey, we got a great reaction from our panel on that one.

883
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,060
And who's our next contestant?

884
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,080
Andy, our next target, from Milmoss, New Mexico,

885
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,000
a congressman who's also a minister of the First Church of Self-Defense.

886
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,740
Let's welcome Morris Mackley.

887
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,420
Mackley! Fire away, Reverend Mackley.

888
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,280
Thank you. I'd like to show you all a beautiful full-color picture of our Lord

889
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,200
wearing a .357 Magnum and a hand-tooled holster.

890
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,900
And remember, guns are a gift from God.

891
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,200
Bullseye, Reverend Mackley. You're going to be tough to beat this election year.

892
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,480
And let's get to our final contestant on the firing line.

893
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,960
From San Francisco, California, let's hear it for Congressman Willard Wendt.

894
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,200
Welcome, Willard, and what good things can you say about guns?

895
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,300
Well, I don't own a gun.

896
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,540
And I don't particularly like people who do own them.

897
00:49:59,640 --> 00:49:59,980
Whoa.

898
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,420
Willard, that's our warning buzzer.

899
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,700
You've got just ten seconds more to say something good about guns.

900
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,500
And remember, our panelists are all crack shots.

901
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:12,080
Well, I guess guns are all right in their place.

902
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,780
I'm not sure that's enough, Willard. You've got just five seconds more.

903
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,840
I think we ought to register firearms.

904
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:18,320
Whoa!

905
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,980
Hey, everybody's talking.

906
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,080
That's some great shooting, panel.

907
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:26,260
And that's all we have time for on the Gun Show.

908
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:30,520
The Gun Show's been brought to you by Bang! Bothered Americans Needing Guns.

909
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,800
I'm your host, Andy Oakley.

910
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,880
We'll be back right before the Illinois primary.

911
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:37,220
And in the meantime, remember, a gun is like a good friend.

912
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,220
Treat it right, and it won't kill you.

913
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,920
Five dollars and bright...

914
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,340
We're in?

915
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:47,620
...good shepherd prayer partner and your personal friend.

916
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:54,960
In the next 13 or 14 minutes, something good, good, good is coming your way.

917
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,720
So don't leave this radio...

918
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:59,560
...radio station. Let's have a good time together.

919
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,260
He's all I need.

920
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,460
He's all I need.

921
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,640
Ah, yeah.

922
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,440
Thank God I'm a man.

923
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:25,440
Remember, that's Bob at Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

924
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,660
877-521-5...

925
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,860
You, 10 five, 2, 1, 4.

926
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,060
everybody together

927
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,860
두,축 Tut all of a sudden

928
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:43,240
Now!

929
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:43,460
Yeah!

930
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,460
So stay tuned.

931
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,000
Don't forget to write Bobby for that free information.

932
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,960
Box 1403 of 6 Dallas, Texas.

933
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,480
Let her go, Bob.

934
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,260
I told you, I want to see Dr. Bold.

935
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,520
I read Gypsy Doctor.

936
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,460
Oh, wait a minute.

937
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,120
Is that Dr. Repeat?

938
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,600
I read Gypsy Doctor.

939
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:56,920
I can't remember.

940
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,860
Dr. Stang, are you, in fact, a doctor for Bob?

941
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,740
I'm a healer.

942
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,380
I'm a surgeon.

943
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:09,940
I've got knives, scalpels, gas, pills, anesthetics, and musical instruments.

944
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:10,900
I don't know how to play.

945
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:11,860
I am a doctor.

946
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,940
A doctor for Bob?

947
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,780
We bring him back to life, and then we kill him again.

948
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,940
I went and seen myself a doctor, and he gave me a great big bottle.

949
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:23,820
Don't take him, Bill.

950
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,280
Kill him.

951
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,620
Throw the poison pills away, pile.

952
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,620
It's probably time for a little stimulation there, cadet.

953
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,680
So why not get up and move a little?

954
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,040
Comedy is comedy, but some rhythm tossed in can do anything but help.

955
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,080
Let her go, Bob.

956
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,160
Whoa.

957
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:40,440
Whoa.

958
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,460
They said the thing is a headache.

959
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:43,840
Bigger the pill, baby.

960
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,000
Call me the big pill.

961
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,620
We're here to meet Dr. Salute, Jan, from the sub-metro of Chicago.

962
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:57,320
And I'd like to know, St. Sulak of the Hog Butchers of the West, are you a doctor for Bob?

963
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,380
I am.

964
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,560
This is the beginning of a new life for me.

965
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:05,140
As a saint of the Hog Butchers of the West, as a new man, I'm free.

966
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,120
I'm free.

967
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,340
Yes, but are you a doctor for Bob?

968
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:08,600
That's proven.

969
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,980
The fact that I'm a doctor for Bob proves that I'm free.

970
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:12,840
Only if I'm a doctor for Bob.

971
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:12,840


972
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:12,840


973
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:12,840


974
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,400
Only a doctor for Bob can be free.

975
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:14,940
Dr. Salute.

976
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,260
And I'm a doctor for Bob.

977
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,560
Dr. Salute.

978
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,900
I do what I do because Bob told me to.

979
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:27,340
I don't need charges of brainwashing.

980
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:30,260
I do what I do because Bob told me to.

981
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,140
You do what you do because you want to.

982
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,700
We don't use such techniques as brainwashing.

983
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,680
I do what I do because Bob told me to.

984
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,160
I use brain surgery in order to assure loyalty.

985
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,840
I do what I do because Bob told me to.

986
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,260
I'm a doctor for Bob.

987
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:43,260


988
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,700
I was sold to my feet to the Tippecanoe here.

989
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,180
I am a doctor for Bob.

990
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:57,500
And let me say that prior to this moment, I had the least ability to understand the doctor for Bob of any subgenius in the church.

991
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:02,500
But tonight, with our heart's elimination experiment being such a success,

992
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,980
I truly feel that I am for the first time a true doctor for Bob.

993
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,940
But Bobby's bigger than I.

994
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,680
Uh-oh, I think he's caught it.

995
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,340
Doctor, give him something for his cough.

996
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,480
All right, all right.

997
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,520
Here's a quarter.

998
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,100
Oh, that's not much.

999
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,040
Not much of a cough.

1000
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,700
Well, thanks, Douglas.

1001
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,340
I'll take over.

1002
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,620
It's all right, dear.

1003
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,960
You'll be yourself again in a minute.

1004
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:25,940
I'm...

1005
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,860
I'm so sorry, everybody.

1006
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,020
Now, you just drink this.

1007
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,220
I need my doctor for my...

1008
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,400
I don't feel well.

1009
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,120
What's the matter with you?

1010
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,200
Oh, I don't know.

1011
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,140
I was the doctor, and he told me what to do,

1012
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,100
but I didn't do it.

1013
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,700
He said to take one pill three times a day,

1014
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,840
but you can't do that.

1015
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,060
I think I'd rather die than do that.

1016
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,100
Man, it's a gas.

1017
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,720
I figure, you know,

1018
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,660
some of those roaches they put out in grass,

1019
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,340
and a glass of acid will put you on the moon in an hour.

1020
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,460
But reality, that's where it's happening.

1021
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:07,640
What?

1022
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,900
What's the use of pretending?

1023
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,140
I can't stand this anymore.

1024
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,520
Chandler said you went over to Georgia Street to see that doctor.

1025
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,820
Yeah, that's right, Ed.

1026
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:21,900
Short visit.

1027
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:22,840
Poor guy.

1028
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:23,900
Pretty bad, huh?

1029
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,160
Well, the guy's really a mess.

1030
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,560
The beatnik walked up to the epileptic and said,

1031
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:31,300
Oh, I don't hear the music, but go, baby, go!

1032
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,600
Here's $5 million.

1033
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,380
Bob's Beach Party.

1034
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:37,420
$1?

1035
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,640
Is that $1?

1036
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:40,720
$1?

1037
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:40,720


1038
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:40,720


1039
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,820
All right.

1040
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:44,540
Bob's Beach Party.

1041
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,340
Sub-Genius Beach Party.

1042
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,180
Sub-Genius Beach Party.

1043
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,620
Sub-Genius Beach Party.

1044
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,540
Great combination, isn't it, Jim?

1045
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,340
What's that?

1046
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,720
Armful of narcotics and a loaded gun?

1047
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,320
Let her go, Bob.

1048
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,940
Boy, did we get high.

1049
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:08,880
Yes, sirree.

1050
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,060
We sure got relaxed.

1051
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,300
Hey, Bob.

1052
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:12,300


1053
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,680
A physician must determine if tendon repairs are needed.

1054
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:15,980

00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:25,020


1073
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:25,020


1074
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:27,480
But if the chief ever caught me taking these pills,

1075
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,760
he'd snap my head off.

1076
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,320
Here, try one of mine.

1077
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:30,920
Oh, yeah?

1078
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:31,380
Yeah.

1079
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,360
The chief himself's been on these for a week and he's a changed-

1080
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,960
Our favorite area for clairvoyance has always been in the field of science and medicine.

1081
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,320
What's your trouble, young man?

1082
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,500
The Venusian gook rod, doctor.

1083
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,460
Now sit here, young man. My time is valuable.

1084
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,260
Doctor, this is a medical emergency.

1085
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,500
I hope you like that nonsense.

1086
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:01,900
I try to make the audience a part of the entertainment, and they go along with it all just great.

1087
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:06,100
That chatter with the doctor is no phony bit, really. It's just the way it happens.

1088
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,680
You'll have to make it in one night when you're down Florida way.

1089
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,780
All right, nurse. Bring the next patient in.

1090
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,260
Get up on this table.

1091
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,360
Pull off that gown.

1092
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,160
Raise up that right leg, let that left one down.

1093
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,020
Pull off them stockings, that silk underwear.

1094
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,780
The doctor's got to cut you.

1095
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,640
Mama, God knows when.

1096
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:37,600
Internal, inner, non-existent, void particles.

1097
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:43,580
You can send negro-influenced voice waves, tap-shoe disc patterns.

1098
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:54,160
You can send us cow vomit, tooth-broken, 11-gated, elongated, creation-oriented,

1099
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:58,500
spear gum, restaurant scars.

1100
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,300
You can send us...

1101
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,480
Don't look at me that way, Douglas.

1102
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,080
You're mad.

1103
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,780
Don't be frightened, Douglas.

1104
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,800
Imagine seeing what service you require.

1105
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,620
Give me down the road!

1106
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,380
Give me down the road!
