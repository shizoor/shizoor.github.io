1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,420
The program you are about to hear, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse, is parody, satire, and comedy.

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:18,040
Any reference to Bob, the Church of the Subgenius, religion, politics, or any other touchy subjects is intended only as humor

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,540
and should cast no reflection on the high standards of WREK Atlanta, its staff, or that of Georgia Tech.

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,040
We must adjust ourselves to the level of our audience, which is pretty low.

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,560
The following commercial has been seasonally updated for broadcast at this time.

6
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,980
I found my exact feelings expressed in a greeting card.

7
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,620
Easter's a very special day for me.

8
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,080
And I say, wouldn't it be great to have all of the churches full?

9
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,580
You know, packed churches all over our country.

10
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,180
Wow.

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,840
The trouble is that people believe that garbage can get themselves in trouble.

12
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,640
Of course, just a general statement.

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,780
By the bad planning committee.

14
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,820
They were doing it late December or early January.

15
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,440
Trying to draw a happy face from the map of the United States.

16
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,600
We'd probably be coming around about early spring, which is the beginning of April, the end of March.

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,140
Spring is here.

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,640
But, I mean, damn, if you spend all your time in your house watching videotapes of whatever it is.

19
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,640
But you've got to go out and get you some.

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,200
Click.

21
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,060
I would love to aim it right at Easter Sunday, so we're open for church service.

22
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,360
Is that true? Is that possible? Or is that false?

23
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,580
I think it's possible. Why isn't it?

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,300
How many of you believe that? You believe that?

25
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,400
Packed churches.

26
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,320
You believe that?

27
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,260
Yee-haw!

28
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:54,980
Yeah!

29
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:55,880
Let's do it!

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's do it!

31
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,120
Pew Packers!

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,380
I'm a Pew Packer. He's a Pew Packer. She's a Pew Packer. We're all Pew Packers.

33
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,740
Wouldn't you like to be a Pew Packer, too?

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,440
You come.

35
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,380
I'd love to have it open by Easter.

36
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,240
Shh! Shh! Shh!

37
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,440
I don't think that's anyone's problem.

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:08,940
Thanks, church!

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,840
And the congregation said?

40
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,620
Amen!

41
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,660
Amen.

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,820
Now, as you're dismissed, shake the hand of your neighbor before you leave your pew.

43
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,060
Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,360
I love that golf game.

45
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,320
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

46
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:35,960
Mwah!

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,340
Mwah!

48
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,400
Our country wants to die Easter Sunday. That would be a beautiful thing.

49
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:42,880
Woo-hoo!

50
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,300
What is that? The Calvinist view?

51
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,800
Calvin and Hobbes? Hm?

52
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,300
Yeah.

53
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,700
If you got it, you got it.

54
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:49,960
There we go.

55
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,060
If you got it, you got it.

56
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,260
Accidents happen.

57
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,760
Yeah, accidents do happen.

58
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:53,840
Ah-oh!

59
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,180
Ah!

60
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,000
Ah!

61
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,860
Ahh!

62
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,960
Do a gift that'll still be around for many...

63
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,500
Aprils.

64
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:01,960
... to come.

65
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,080
A gift that keeps on giving is wicker furniture, or wicker baskets, or even a gumball machine!

66
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,940
Remember that the most unique gift ideas for all year are at Baskets & Things.

67
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,260
There in the Kenwood Plaza, just behind Hershedi's.

68
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Baskets & Things wishes everybody a merry...

69
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:14,700
Easter

70
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,460
... and a happy...

71
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,180
Memorial Day!

72
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,360
The preceding commercial was seasonally updated for broadcast at this time.

73
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,160
We're still working on what to do with the 4th of July.

74
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,740
What was your idea?

75
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,060
Why? What's doing?

76
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,460
Just the usual thing.

77
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,340
We go into old Susie's place.

78
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,280
Hell of a nice place.

79
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,080
Old Susie's a laugh.

80
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,340
Always cracking jokes.

81
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,720
Like she says when we come up on the front porch last Saturday night.

82
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,540
Susie opens the door and then she yells,

83
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,920
What the f*** do you want?

84
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Sweet Susie.

85
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,320
She'll beat you to death.

86
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Sweet Susie.

87
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,780
The diary of a wicked lady.

88
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,460
The memoirs of a bad girl.

89
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,140
Sweet Susie.

90
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,720
Slamming, crashing, banging action from opening scene to mind-bending climax.

91
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,460
Sweet Susie.

92
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,920
She ain't no lady.

93
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,920
This motion picture's rated R.

94
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,400
She's a cold one, all right.

95
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,160
More stallion than man.

96
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,960
I never seen nobody like her.

97
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,660
She got the eye going all the time on everybody.

98
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,140
Rat head?

99
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:19,920
A whore.

100
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,180
I'm picturing a rat head.

101
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:21,920
She's a whore.

102
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,440
I don't know what the hell she wants.

103
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,160
She is undermining our civilization.

104
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,920
One woman, Sodom and Gomorrah, if you will.

105
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:28,700
Rape her.

106
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,640
A slimy, slithering succubus.

107
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,920
A concubine, a streetwalker, a tramp, a slut, a cheap whore.

108
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,740
Good grief.

109
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,600
There she was, parading around in clothes that couldn't keep a titmouse dry in a drizzle.

110
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,760
I mean, it was next to nothing.

111
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,380
I'd say it was next to plenty.

112
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,460
She's gonna make a mess.

113
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,560
There's gonna be a bad mess about her.

114
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,780
She's a jailbait all set on the trigger.

115
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,600
That ranch with a bunch of guys on it.

116
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,660
Ain't no place for a girl, especially like her.

117
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,780
And yet half the teenagers in town writhing around to that jungle music.

118
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,500
Gentlemen, it's time to present the person you have all come to see.

119
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,680
Please welcome Miss Susie.

120
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,860
Ha, ha, ha.

121
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,200
Ha.

122
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,460
But I'm prettier than she ever was.

123
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,400
Go hug your floozy.

124
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,740
She's right here.

125
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,680
Uh, here is relative.

126
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,720
She knows I'm kidding.

127
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,200
I'm not kidding.

128
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,560
That's okay, so am I.

129
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,280
Ha, ha.

130
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,440
That redhead.

131
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,180
That's the worst customer she's called conned with a karate punch.

132
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,000
She never talks dirty, neither.

133
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,640
What the f***?

134
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,700
What once you said you're back?

135
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,640
Two and a half.

136
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,800
Susie got nice chairs to sit in, too.

137
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,880
If a guy don't want to flop, why, he can just sit in the chairs.

138
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,700
Have a couple three shots and pass the time of day and Susie don't give a damn.

139
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,940
She ain't rushing guys through and kicking them out if they don't want to flop.

140
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,800
Might go in and look the joint over.

141
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,340
Come along.

142
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,660
It's a hell of a lot of fun.

143
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,600
Her cracking jokes all the time.

144
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,180
Like she says one time, she says,

145
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,920
I know people that if they got a rag rug on the floor and a cupid eye lamp on the phonograph,

146
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,160
they think they run in a parlor house.

147
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,240
And Susie says, I know what you boys want.

148
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,840
She says, I know.

149
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,940
My girls is clean, she says, and they ain't no water in my whiskey, she says.

150
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,140
If you guys want to look at a cupid eye lamp and take your own chance getting burned,

151
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,260
why, you know where you can go.

152
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:33,280
And she says, these guys around here walking bow-legged because they like to look at a cupid eye lamp.

153
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,600
What's so unappealing about sex?

154
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,700
Yeah, yeah.

155
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,020
I ain't had sex.

156
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,660
Well, Susie's place is clean and she got nice chairs.

157
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,460
Don't let no goo-goos in, neither.

158
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,400
What is that supposed to mean?

159
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,160
Ah, gulp.

160
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,840
I might go in and sit and have a shag.

161
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,520
But I ain't putting out no two and a half.

162
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,280
Well, a guy got to have some fun sometime.

163
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,780
Well, Susie, homewrecker, dip yourself in flour and make a skank biscuit.

164
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,520
Oh, man, it's so hard being me, but it's showtime.

165
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:15,380
Oh, welcome, Seekers, to yet another freaking episode of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

166
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,280
Ha!

167
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,600
It was the nicest little whorehouse you ever saw.

168
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,600
It lay about a mile down this old dirt road, and if you just happened to stumble on it,

169
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,000
you couldn't help but notice that the barns were painted, the fences were up, and you

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,780
might think to yourself why folks that live there might just do to run the river with.

171
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,500
What a lie.

172
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,060
Sure, but...

173
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:52,480
And welcome to Watchdog with yours truly, Melvin P. Thorpe.

174
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,000
This week's spotlight will shine on a situation that has been allowed to exist right in the

175
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,820
shadows of the state capitol.

176
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,660
Let's get it out in the open.

177
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,460
Isn't this the age of telling it like it is?

178
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,580
Well, here goes, and God forgive me!

179
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,800
Yeah, it probably will if you slip on the big enough pill on the collection plate in

180
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,320
the morning.

181
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,180
Oh, welcome, Seekers, to my favorite time of year.

182
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,120
Yes, it's spring.

183
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,980
When even the flu's gone.

184
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:41,200
Shut up and shut up.

185
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,940
Has everyone got ink or something?

186
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,620
And it's giving me a frightful feeling that I'm going to die if I start wearing the

187
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,640
homaya out that's made of cut

188
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:54,640


189
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,720
Tintin's easyunden.

190
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,040
You know you can.

191
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,080
can survive a night in the embrace of a subgenius hellbitch?

192
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,840
Are you yeti enough to take it?

193
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
Because I'll spin dry your biogram

194
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,820
like an inside-the-egg-shell egg scrambler,

195
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,560
and your DNA helices will look like spin art

196
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,580
when I'm through with it.

197
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,740
Because it's a spring-fall, baby,

198
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,760
and I'm finally in the mood for some sex!

199
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,660
And it's about damn time, too.

200
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,160
So, Connie, bar the door,

201
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,900
because we ain't taking no prisoners tonight.

202
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,140
In order to keep our broadcasting license,

203
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,700
we devote Sunday night dead time

204
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,860
to public service shows of limited appeal.

205
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,460
No!

206
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,380
In that spirit, we bring you Gabin About God.

207
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,480
No, no, no!

208
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,940
I want sex!

209
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,440
Sex!

210
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,120
Sex!

211
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,040
Now, we in the church, you know,

212
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,560
we're good at having things.

213
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,160
And to pour out drink offerings unto other gods,

214
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,660
break in a few more,

215
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,720
these are our traditions of men while you're at it.

216
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,540
A little rapture here, a little fly there,

217
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,300
fly away, it won't matter.

218
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,700
That they may provoke me to anger.

219
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,460
That's what your father thinks about the celebration of Easter

220
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,740
as it is presented by most Christians today,

221
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,760
rather than the Passover

222
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,400
with the focus upon the lamb slayer.

223
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,140
You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

224
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,980
You wake up in the dark

225
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,360
and hear the screaming,

226
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:25,640
and you're like,

227
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:34,560
the lab. Shut up! They have confused themselves whereby they don't know if an Easter egg belongs

228
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:46,280
in God's word or on a table somewhere or in an idyllic, heathen, organic orgy or festival.

229
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,700
It's all one and the same to them. Those egg council creeps got to you too, huh? Oh, you got

230
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,340
it all wrong, Homer. It's not like that. It's supposed to be told. It's supposed to be repeated,

231
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:08,600
not rolling idolatry, heathenistic Easter eggs. Well, now you're going to mess around and take

232
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,340
a lot of the children's fun away. I'm going to take a lot of the heat from God's anger away

233
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,420
from them. If they want to roll Easter eggs, let them do it some other day, but not on Passover.

234
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,260
It's an insult to the bloodshed on the cross.

235
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:28,400
You better run, egg! Well, are you saying that because they roll Easter eggs that they're going

236
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,160
to hell? No, I didn't say that. I said it gives Satan one of the greatest victories he's ever

237
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:40,320
accomplished, though. They want to hang on to that one little bit of sin, because I guess it feels

238
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:49,820
good to roll Easter eggs, not when you recognize the insinuations and the innuendos of filthy

239
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,420
orgies.

240
00:11:52,700 --> 00:12:00,180
That it's symbolic of, and to even relate it anywhere near Christ, or Christianity,

241
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:10,160
or the church, is an abomination. You're an abomination. Easter orgies. The day Christ

242
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,140
rose, they're all screwing one another. And the poor kids and the middle class kids,

243
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:20,500
they're all copying the rich kids. They're all going the same goddamn screw America way.

244
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,920
He sees the ignorance.

245
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,380
He sees the injustice. He sees the mistừM

246
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:27,960
Error.

247
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,960
He sees the punishment, the Scolding. It's

248
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,120
a승

249
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,460

255
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,560

Error.

258
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,860
you've had a few little baskets.

259
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,540
You see, rabbits don't lay eggs.

260
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,200
They don't raise legs at all.

261
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,640
They're quick like a bunny.

262
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,400
This is the city, Jerusalem.

263
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,600
It's righteous.

264
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,480
A lot of people live here, most of them good.

265
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,180
But when they fall from grace, that's where I come in.

266
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,660
My name's Friday.

267
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,200
Good Friday.

268
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,040
I carry a badge.

269
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,680
The story you are about to hear is true.

270
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,020
None of the names have been changed because only one was innocent.

271
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:20,240
The story you are about to hear is true.

272
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:50,180
The story you are about to hear is true.

273
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,740
Gee, goody, mind if I knock this time?

274
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,440
Sure, Frank. Live it up.

275
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,000
So, hello, officers.

276
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,860
What can you do for me?

277
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,600
Your name, Thomas?

278
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,860
Uh, yeah. Did I do something wrong?

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,720
We just want the facts.

280
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,620
You know a man named Jesus Christ?

281
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,580
Yeah, I know him. Uh, what's this all about?

282
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,840
What's this all about?

283
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,260
Says he's the son of God.

284
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,340
What do you say?

285
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,120
Well, uh, he's a great guy.

286
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,260
You should see the miracles he does.

287
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,200
We just need the facts, sir.

288
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,560
Just the facts.

289
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,860
Well, son of God.

290
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,380
Yes, sir.

291
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,020
I doubt it.

292
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,620
Reports say he's at a garden in Gethsemane.

293
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,920
What do you say?

294
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,720
Gethsemane. I know the place.

295
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,320
I doubt it.

296
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,140
Hmm.

297
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,120
Kind of makes him a doubting Thomas, doesn't it?

298
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,240
So, you write your own material?

299
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,620
Uh, they say this Jesus is the king of the Jews.

300
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,560
What do you say?

301
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,680
Well, uh, that I doubt.

302
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,940
Calls himself the light of the world.

303
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,580
What do you think?

304
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,060
Uh, I doubt it.

305
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,260
They claim he's mankind's salvation.

306
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,120
How about you?

307
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,300
Well, I doubt it.

308
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,120
Right.

309
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,020
You gonna be available for any further questioning?

310
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:02,880
Hmm.

311
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,500
I doubt it.

312
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,800
2.18.

313
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,300
Frank and I stopped at a fish stand for lunch.

314
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,100
8.

315
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,520
Got back on the donkey and headed out to the house

316
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,100
with yet another Jesus follower.

317
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,020
We're gonna have to get him back.

318
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,320
He's a goody.

319
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,580
He's a great fish.

320
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,960
Only $1.50 a bucket.

321
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,720
What a deal.

322
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,880
Must have been a good catch.

323
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,380
You got some coleslaw on your nose, Frank.

324
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:31,980
Yeah?

325
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,020
Uh, could you turn down your stereo?

326
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,700
My what?

327
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,520
Your stereo.

328
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,320
Oh, okay.

329
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,500
Uh, honey?

330
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,980
Could you turn down the stereo?

331
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,520
What stereo?

332
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,460
The thing next to the dishwasher.

333
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,020
I want the dishwasher!

334
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,340
Yeah?

335
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,160
Your name's Simon, also called Peter?

336
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,080
Yeah.

337
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,320
Which is it?

338
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,380
It's both.

339
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,780
Listen, Peter.

340
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,940
What do your friends call you?

341
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,860
The Rock.

342
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,440
How are you listed in the phone book?

343
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,720
I don't have a phone.

344
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,180
What's it say on your driver's license?

345
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,360
Uh, I haven't got a donkey, either.

346
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,580
What's it say on your fishing license?

347
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:05,780
Retired.

348
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,040
You know a guy named Jesus?

349
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,200
Jesus?

350
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,940
Uh, no.

351
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,640
Never heard of him.

352
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,400
Look, we've got over a dozen witnesses here

353
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,100
having seen you with him on a number of occasions.

354
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,640
Now, what do you mean you don't know him?

355
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,680
Well, maybe it was just somebody that looked like me

356
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,740
because I don't know him.

357
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,160
Hey, uh, Rocky, you got a tooth in your mouth.

358
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,160


359
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,160


360
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,160


361
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,960
Look, I don't know him.

362
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,500
3.42.

363
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,620
When we arrived back at headquarters,

364
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,600
a farmer was waiting with a 402 complaint.

365
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,840
Willful destruction of private property.

366
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,760
Frank went to call his wife.

367
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,160
I went to question the farmer.

368
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,000
Well, I can't get mine, I got a bowl, honey.

369
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,980
You can lie and I got a bowl, buddy.

370
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,180
You can lie and I got a bowl, honey.

371
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,520
You can lie and I got a bowl, honey.

372
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

373
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,380
Hey.

374
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:57,880
Hey.

375
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,000
You the farmer?

376
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,540
Sure am.

377
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,200
You the officer?

378
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,940
Love whistles.

379
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,180
Will you get me one of those?

380
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,960
Yeah, I'll get you a whole box if it keep you from singing.

381
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,560
What's your problem?

382
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,320
Well, it's this, uh, Jesus fella.

383
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,720
Jesus again.

384
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,220
What happened?

385
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,740
He killed one of my fig trees.

386
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,840
What'd he do, tear it up?

387
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,380
Nope, never even went near it.

388
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,060
He just cursed it.

389
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,360
He what?

390
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,280
He cursed it.

391
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:17,960
Oh, I see.

392
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,520
Look, uh, just give me the facts.

393
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,060
Well, I got these five fig trees down by the fence, you know?

394
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,400
Yes, sir.

395
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,700
And this here Jesus fella comes sashaying along, figuring he's gonna mooch one of my

396
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,120
figs.

397
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,320
Mm-hmm.

398
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,380
Well, sir, and he saw there was nothing to be had, he cursed it.

399
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,160
I see.

400
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,700
Well, we'll get right on it.

401
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,220
We'll let you know if anything comes up.

402
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,780
Hey, hey, listen here, bullet head.

403
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,400
Now, I'm a taxpayer and 20% of my crop's gone.

404
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,320
Now, what am I gonna do?

405
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,480
I got a wife, I got a kid, I just bought a dishwasher.

406
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,020
All right, all right.

407
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,140
Uh, did you see what he was driving?

408
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:43,880
A donkey.

409
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,820
What color?

410
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,340
Uh, light brown, Galilee plates.

411
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:47,960
Did you get the details?

412
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,060
Did you get the donkey number?

413
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:48,560
Nope.

414
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,500
Why not?

415
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,840
Tail light was out.

416
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:54,980
445.

417
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,400
Frank and I headed back to the fish stand.

418
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,100
The donkey made a wrong turn and proceeded down an alley behind the temple.

419
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,360
We ran into still another Jesus follower.

420
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,680
Gee, I don't know, Goody, maybe we're lost.

421
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,760
Boy, it sure stinks back here.

422
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,040
Hmm.

423
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,480
Maybe we should have sent Sergeant Laverne his beat anyway.

424
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,640
Hey, wait a minute.

425
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,840
Isn't that someone up there?

426
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,420
Yeah, pull the donkey up here, Frank.

427
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,500
Uh-oh.

428
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,480
Oh, well.

429
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,500
Hey, buddy, you know the way back to Goldstein's fish stand?

430
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,160
Yeah.

431
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,060
Want to tell us?

432
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,740
Okay.

433
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,580
Go to the end of the alley.

434
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,400
Hang a right.

435
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
Go down two blocks.

436
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,440
Can't miss it.

437
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,040
Big fish going around in the sky.

438
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,920
Thanks.

439
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,660
By the way, uh, what are you doing back here?

440
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,460
Me?

441
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,140
I got a meeting with the Pharisees a little later on.

442
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:45,720
Pharisees, huh?

443
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,000
So who are you?

444
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,620
I'm a priest.

445
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:47,620


446
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:47,620


447
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:47,620


448
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:47,620


449
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:47,620


450
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:47,620


451
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:47,620


452
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:47,620


453
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,540
My name's Iscariot.

454
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,640
Uh, Judas Iscariot.

455
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,760
You one of the twelve?

456
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,560
What's it to you, gumsandal?

457
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,260
We're looking for Jesus now.

458
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,980
Do you know where he is?

459
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,540
Maybe yes and maybe no.

460
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,020
What's in it for me?

461
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,640
I got some more fish back in the donkey.

462
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,620
No, I just ate, uh, spare change.

463
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,900
Hmm, let's see.

464
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,160
That's my bowling money.

465
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,420
I got some change here from the confirmation.

466
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,400
Here's 20 silver pieces.

467
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,020
I'll get another 10.

468
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,720
That's 30.

469
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,320
That's 30 pieces of silver, do you?

470
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,220
That'll do.

471
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,700
Okay, you gotta promise me one thing.

472
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,620
What's that?

473
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:17,620


474
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:17,620


475
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:17,620


476
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,120
Don't tell Jesus that I rat on him, okay?

477
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:20,960
10-4.

478
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,060
No one will ever know it was you.

479
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,020
Now, how do you want to set this thing up?

480
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,020
Well, let's see.

481
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,220
It's gonna be the Passover.

482
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,140
We're gonna eat about 8 o'clock.

483
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,540
Mm-hmm.

484
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,760
You pick him up in the garden about 10-30.

485
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,420
10-30.

486
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:32,820
Fine.

487
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,380
How are we supposed to know this Mr. Jesus fellow?

488
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,680
I'll point him out to you.

489
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,700
That's not good enough.

490
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,540
Why not?

491
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,920
We need something more definite.

492
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,200
What if we get the wrong guy?

493
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,700
Okay, uh, I'll go up to him and I'll shake his hand.

494
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,000
That's still not definite enough.

495
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:46,720
Why?

496
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,600
What if someone shoots you?

497
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:47,600


498
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:47,600


499
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:47,600


500
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:47,620
It's not definite enough.

501
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,060
I'll go up to him and I'll shake his hand.

502
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,360
Well, what do you want me to do?

503
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:50,980
Kiss him?

504
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,140
Sounds good.

505
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,040
Okay, well, see you tonight.

506
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,880
Where are we supposed to meet you?

507
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,680
Don't worry.

508
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,600
I'll be hanging around.

509
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,820
That night Frank and I busted the Son of God ring and arrested Jesus Christ.

510
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,620
6 AM the following morning we turned him over to Pontius Pilate.

511
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,160
Jesus is our only king.

512
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,160
Not anymore.

513
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:16,900
Huh?

514
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,400
What?

515
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,060
That's amazing for a Christian.

516
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,380
Alwyn.

517
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,100
Alwyn.

518
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,200
Excuse me.

519
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,740
Have you seen Alwyn anywhere?

520
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:25,680
Who?

521
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,620
Oh, it doesn't matter.

522
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,680
Alwyn.

523
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,380
Alwyn.

524
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,640
I don't know, Goody.

525
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,200
I've been a cop a long time.

526
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,280
This time I really think we did the wrong thing.

527
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,220
I mean, this Jesus guy didn't look like a criminal to me.

528
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:39,860
Hmm.

529
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,580
Even Pilate and Herod couldn't find anything wrong with him.

530
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,940
I wonder what the Pharisees have against him.

531
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,700
He was so nice and gentle.

532
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,980
You know, I even think he smiled at me.

533
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,540
Yeah.

534
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,640
Well, that's how it goes in this business, Frank.

535
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,280
We don't make the laws.

536
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,960
We just enforce them.

537
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,300
I'm kind of tired.

538
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,080
I think I'll take the rest of the day off.

539
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,460
I'll see you Monday.

540
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,860
Aren't you working Sunday?

541
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,180
No, Frank.

542
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,500
Sunday's Easter.

543
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,980
Friday, April 7th, in the apartment 6 of the Jewish Supreme Court.

544
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,680
Jesus Christ was tried and convicted of blasphemy.

545
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,240
Later that same day, he was crucified for the sins of the world.

546
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,480
In a moment, the results of that crucifixion.

547
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,300
This club better be worth it.

548
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,300
Oh, hey, oh, oh.

549
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,200
Oh, oh, oh.

550
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,580
Oh, oh, oh.

551
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,800
Oh, oh, oh.

552
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,280
Oh, oh, oh.

553
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,220
Oh, oh, oh.

554
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:37,580
Oh, oh, oh.

555
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,000
Oh, oh, oh.

556
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,240
Oh, oh, oh.

557
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,560
Oh, oh, oh.

558
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,260
Oh, oh, oh.

559
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,620
Oh, oh, oh.

560
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,620
Oh, oh, oh.

561
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,580
Oh, oh, oh.

562
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,340
Oh, oh, oh.

563
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,560
Oh, oh, oh.

564
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,320
Oh, oh, oh.

565
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,920
Oh, oh, oh.

566
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,340
Oh, oh, oh.

567
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,800
Oh, oh, oh.

568
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,920
Oh, oh, oh.

569
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:21,660
Well, it's such a strange world that I'm living in. She was my woman and he was my friend, but I was wrong again.

570
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:33,800
It's such a strange changing that you put me through. Like a fool, I'm still in love with you. What can this poor boy do?

571
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:49,020
Well, the way things go, don't leave me alone. Never let me entertain. Don't leave me laying here.

572
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,340
What will they do?

573
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,900
In two thousand years.

574
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:12,080
It's such a strange time that we're passing through. I thought you'd tell me when your time was due. I guess you thought I knew.

575
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,780
Oh, strange way to keep from waiting me.

576
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,360
Why did you lie? How could I help?

577
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,780
I'm so happy. Oh, won't you help me?

578
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:41,180
Well, the way things go, don't leave me here alone. Never let me entertain. Don't leave me laying here.

579
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,880
What will they do? In two thousand years.

580
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,640
Well, the way things go, don't leave me alone. Never let me entertain. Don't leave me laying here.

581
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,360
I think so too.

582
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,520
Well, they'll have to tell me so I don't have to stay Vargas.

583
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:17,520


584
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,720
It's the way it is.

585
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:19,720


586
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,280
So, who are you and what did you do?

587
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,200
I met you one day.

588
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,620
After three years.

589
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,740
This is one of those things that seems a little silly.

590
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,720
What does he mean?

591
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,940
What is it?

592
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,400
These fringes, tassels.

593
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,980
All right.

594
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,000
Now, in modern day, you can find something else that will take the place of it.

595
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,840
Oh, yeah.

596
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,380
I want you to make a note.

597
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,420
I'm not going to turn there.

598
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,560
I don't have time at this time, but make a note of numbers 1538.

599
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,020
What were the tassels for?

600
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,760
Every time you saw him jiggle, it reminded you to follow God's law.

601
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,720
Because usually a man, as long as the tassels are not jiggling, he's not breaking too many laws unless he's lazy.

602
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,940
So, do all you guys play for the same team or what?

603
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,840
Oh, no.

604
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,100
It sounds like that.

605
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,580
I've risen and I can't get down.

606
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,900
Stuff is over.

607
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,980
Excuse me.

608
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:34,700
If I gotta be anywhere at all, I'm glad that I am here with you.

609
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:41,140
Now, you know sex is my philosophy, though I may never make history.

610
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,160
I know making it is no mystery from my point of view.

611
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,160
I'm glad that I am here with you.

612
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:57,120
Now, the golden rule in my motto of one, do unto others as long as it's fun.

613
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,860
I never look before I leap.

614
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,520
I only sow what's fun to reap.

615
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:08,560
So, get out and live because I believe it's as blessed to give as to receive.

616
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:19,080
If I gotta be anywhere at all, I'm glad that I am here with you.

617
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,600
Now, the kids are here.

618
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:21,600


619
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:21,600


620
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:21,600


621
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:37,320
If I gotta be anywhere at all, I'm glad that I am here with you.

622
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,460
I only thought since I turned 20 is to share the wealth and I've got plenty.

623
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,220
I only live by a simple creed.

624
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,700
And he wants my friend if he's a friend in need.

625
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,220
Life's too short.

626
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,600
Not too far.

627
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:51,600


628
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:51,600


629
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:51,600


630
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,440
I don't like to have a ball.

631
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,060
Why behave?

632
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,160
Why one if you can have them all?

633
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,060
I gotta be anywhere at all.

634
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,580
I'm glad I'm here with you.

635
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,540
I gotta be anywhere at all.

636
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,600
I gotta be anywhere at all.

637
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,200
Welcome, Seekers.

638
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,580
Welcome to Bob's Jack Time Whorehouse.

639
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:32,160
The show that makes black women white hot and white men black out.

640
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,480
Oh, but the pinks keep on getting pinker.

641
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,480
Oh, hell, I can't change everything.

642
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:44,260
Oh, I'm your hostess, Reverend Susie the Floozy.

643
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,580
I'm afraid I'm the only girl working the house tonight.

644
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,600
Oh, so I'm afraid there's a problem.

645
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,540
A bit of a lie.

646
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,200
Yeah.

647
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,600
But you've caught me at a good time, sport.

648
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,980
Oh, man.

649
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,800
Damn this Easter.

650
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,320
My stigmata put out my cigarette again.

651
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,740
Damn.

652
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:15,620
I'll just slip on these rubber gloves and change them when they start looking like a five-lobe blood blister.

653
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,460
Ah, there.

654
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:28,800
Oh, yeah, these pinky cheaters just might be a good idea tonight, Seekers.

655
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:37,500
Because we're drifting into some unsavory waters full of strange body fluids and even stranger noises.

656
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,340
That's right.

657
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:44,220
It's a sex show just dripping with carnal content.

658
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,860
Better get out the drop logs, too.

659
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,300
That might be a good idea.

660
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:50,920
Yeah.

661
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,440
Yeah.

662
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,900
Because with my little shows, we can never be sure just where we're going to wind up.

663
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,400
Because I don't even have the slightest idea myself where we're headed.

664
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,980
Oh, but if we're in luck, we're going to have an obscenely good time.

665
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,640
So let's peel out of some of these clothes and get comfortable.

666
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:17,260
And then strap yourself in nice and tight.

667
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,040
And don't cheat, because I'll be coming by at a check.

668
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,060
Check those straps.

669
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:27,240
And they better be the big red ones if you know what's good for you.

670
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:36,060
Because tonight, Seekers, we're going to wallow in the baser side of our psyches.

671
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:45,100
Because when you get down to the nasty, nitty-gritty, deep, deep downside,

672
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,020
we're all nothing but a bunch of sexies.

673
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
Sex junkies.

674
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,500
Hey.

675
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,000
Whoa.

676
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,960
Here we go.

677
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,320
Woo!

678
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,800
Make your feelings cool.

679
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,780
While you don't get enough, it's called Sex Junkie.

680
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,600
You bring your black tassels and your cell phone.

681
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,200
You are the lowest, the lowest, the low.

682
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,200
Bang for me, girl.

683
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:20,660
Whoa.

684
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,220
I'm underneath

685
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,020
You're all so chunky

686
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,120
You're too fast I feel

687
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,720
I'm underneath

688
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,980
I'm underneath

689
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,340
I'm underneath

690
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:35,560
I'm underneath

691
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,760
I'm underneath

692
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:38,760


693
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,240
Secrets of us that you keep

694
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,560
in your mind

695
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,860
Things looks like you are

696
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,900
so easy to find

697
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,000
First name is jerk

698
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,240
And your last name is Lee

699
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,980
Is your hot sex junkie

700
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,420
You're too

701
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,720
as I believe

702
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,400
I'm

703
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,520
shorty master

704
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,300
Take this part to me

705
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,680
For the ideas

706
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,200
they just clog up your brain

707
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,240
These stress and fights

708
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,940
for you just focus

709
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,000
and it will be great

710
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,680
time for us to live

711
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,780
Just for this

712
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,540
your hot sex junkie

713
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,320
You're too fast I feel

714
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,180
One faster

715
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,760
One faster, one faster

716
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,160
Two hundred for the battle's over

717
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,560
Keep them walking to the light

718
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,380
And their flesh is hot

719
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,140
Eat to them, she is dead

720
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,240
Keep respiring

721
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,720
To your glory

722
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,440
Your victory

723
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,580
And your glory

724
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,600
And your glory

725
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,020
Sex balls surround

726
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,060
Out of the sky

727
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,740
Fill the orgasm

728
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,780
Until the time

729
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,740
Screaming flesh

730
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,580
Begs for more

731
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,960
You make the sex

732
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,040
There is no more

733
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,040
That's true love

734
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,340
Is to love enough

735
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,780
That you'll dedicate your life

736
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,080
To teaching the truth

737
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,340
Regardless of what people might say

738
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,780
Regardless of how offensive

739
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,020
It may be to some

740
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,820
Because you only want those

741
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,560
That care enough to love you

742
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:16,560


743
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,860
Enough that they want to know more

744
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,080
About their father's word

745
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,740
Instead of a bunch of polished off

746
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,300
Powder puff

747
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,020
Penny laced

748
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,280
Frills and thrills

749
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,420
Back scratching

750
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,640
Make you feel good

751
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,000
Men that say things

752
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,480
To get men to feel good

753
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,280
Rather than teaching the word of God

754
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,440
Are unfit and they're nuts

755
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,620
Okay, I'm off of it

756
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,380
Well it means you can sin

757
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,740
I mean

758
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,540
And the more you do it

759
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,400
The more you sin

760
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,080
The sin nature really doesn't have anything to do

761
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,140
With you failing God

762
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,760
But here's what happens

763
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,980
If you fail the Lord

764
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,880
All of a sudden that sin nature explodes into flames

765
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,800
Now whenever this happens

766
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,400
And that sin nature explodes

767
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,460
And we find ourselves

768
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,060
With sin reigning

769
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,040
Notice what Paul said here

770
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,520
Well we belong to God

771
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,180
We belong to the church that rolls eggs

772
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,260
Ball them up

773
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,880
You know and we get out and hippity hoppity

774
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,700
Chase these two bunnies

775
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,660
You know heavy stuff friend

776
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,220
I mean forget about Passover

777
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,760
God we like bunny rabbits

778
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,640
And Ishtar

779
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,140
Oh just have a big meeting

780
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,920
I mean you know

781
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,880
Everything in him became sin

782
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,720
It became degradation

783
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,100
As long as we're in a flesh body

784
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,140
Especially if you can't define sin

785
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,140
Sin is to

786
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,540
Let's take between the two sexes

787
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,040
Oh that sounds dead he likes it

788
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,460
Sin is to lust

789
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,200
Or to be very plain

790
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,500
To put the make on

791
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,920
Every type that you come across

792
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,220
That's lust

793
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,020
But to admire God's beautiful creation

794
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,120
In Christian love

795
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,020
That's not a sin

796
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,640
And if you tell someone

797
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,340
If you were to say

798
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,260
If you're holy

799
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,960
You're not even going to look upon a woman

800
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,500
Well that's

801
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,960
We are human beings

802
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,040
And there is no sin

803
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,220
In appreciating

804
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,380
Our sisters

805
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,980
Well because if you believe that

806
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,980
Then you can do anything you please

807
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,420
You can just live your life any old way

808
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,220
Say well live it up now

809
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:38,940
Might as well enjoy it now

810
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,640
This is all we have

811
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,080
Might as well just make the most of it you know

812
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,100
You only have one time around

813
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,020
Like the beer commercials tell you

814
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,320
So live it up with a lot of gusto

815
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,880
My bible says different

816
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,140
It says that the point on the

817
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,000
Never man wants to die

818
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,960
And after this he does

819
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,320
Now in this satanic bible

820
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,360
There's a chapter entitled satanic sex

821
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,720
In the chapter entitled satanic sex

822
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,860
It says this

823
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,340
Satanism condones any type of sexual activity

824
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,180
Which properly satisfies your desires

825
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,280
Be it heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual or asexual

826
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,680
Satanism also sanctions any fetish or deviation

827
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,560
Which will enhance your sex life so long

828
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,660
As it involves no one who does not wish to be involved

829
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,580
Now that's the same thing as the new morality law

830
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,420
Of liberal preaching appraisal

831
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,220
Anything's okay

832
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,800
As long as everybody that's involved is consenting to it

833
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,700
And nobody gets hurt

834
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,780
May I help you?

835
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,920
Hey don't touch me lady

836
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,800
I'll punch your face off

837
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,760
I didn't touch you

838
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,220
Well you better not

839
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,480
Or I'll tear your legs off lady

840
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,340
Now that we understand each other

841
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,260
Why don't you sell me one of those whips you got on sale

842
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:27,660
Whips?

843
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,760
Leather whips

844
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,520
Just a second

845
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,540
Now if you're out of whips

846
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,780
Maybe you got some leather rope with little barbs on them

847
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,640
I love leather so much it hurts so much

848
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,100
Oh we do have leather on sale

849
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,260
But not what you're looking for

850
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,220
I definitely want the white leather ones

851
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,640
I contrast with my black rubber suit

852
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:40,780
See

853
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,440
Hey close that will you?

854
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,020
Oh yeah sure

855
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,920
Now where's them white leather whips?

856
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,600
Shoes

857
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,520
Shoes to who?

858
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,560
No only shoes

859
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,260
Converse All Star genuine white leather basketball shoes

860
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,080
Just $12.88 while they last

861
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,300
Converse shoes no whips?

862
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:54,840
Sorry

863
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,620
But why don't you try these shoes?

864
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,800
Let me look at them here

865
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,900
Yeah nice leather but does it hurt?

866
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,980
Let me try it on my face here

867
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,480
Oh

868
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,340
Wake up wake up

00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,460
Where am I?

870
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,980
You're at Ben's Department Store 8th and Central downtown

871
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,560
And you just got some Converse All Star basketball shoes

872
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:10,620
For you

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,280
Hey that felt good hit me again

874
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,120
Oh never mind I'll just take these shoes home and wear them on my face

875
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,220
Well I'm weapon in style with my

876
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:22,680
Some people think little girls should be seen and not heard

877
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,300
But I think

878
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,160
Oh bondage up yours

879
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,920
One two three four

880
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,900
I'm a soldier of all

881
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,260
I want to be a choose who you are

882
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,380
Oh bondage up yours

883
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,520
Oh bondage of yours

884
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,380
Oh bondage of yours

885
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,440
Oh bondage of yours

886
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,800
Change that case though

887
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,120
I can save you all

888
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,800
Change it change it

889
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,020
I don't think at all

890
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,080
Oh bondage of yours

891
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,040
I'm yours.

892
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,300
I'm yours.

893
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,320
I'm yours.

894
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,060
I'm yours.

895
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:16,740
I'm yours.

896
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,160
By the

897
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,540
God's

898
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,060
name,

899
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,760
I may carry you to the wall, I wanna play your save-for-you-all.

900
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,900
Abandon, no more! Abandon, no more!

901
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,500
Abandon, no more! Abandon, no more!

902
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:01,260
Abandon, no more! Abandon, no more!

903
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,120
Wicked, bad, naughty evil Zoot!

904
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,920
Oh, she is a lowly servant, and you must pay her penalty.

905
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:14,520
And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment for setting alight the grail-shaped eaten.

906
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,380
You must tie her down on a bed and spank her.

907
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,660
And spank me! And spank me!

908
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,940
You must spank her well, and after you have spanked her, you may deal with her as you like.

909
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,080
And then, spank me.

910
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,780
And spank me. And me. And me.

911
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,360
Yes, you must give us all a good spanking.

912
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,240
And spank me! And spank me!

913
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,840
My friends are into everything, and we have it all on tape.

914
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:48,340
Big breasts, eager virgin, menage a trois, spanking, masturbation, anal fetishes, sex in unusual places.

915
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,640
Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft.

916
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,740
Verse 21 ends up this way. It gives a long list of sins.

917
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,960
And lots more.

918
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:05,720
Strange love desires that make a mockery out of marriage will keep you wedded to your seat.

919
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,900
What kind of superb love is that?

920
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,600
What kind of superb and sin have these housewives of tomorrow said, I do too?

921
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,000
Find out firsthand. See the smut peddler.

922
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,060
It's so cute!

923
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:25,080
And I've secretly taped some of my friends enjoying their wildest fantasies.

924
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:30,380
First, you'll meet a very oral girl who boasts that she gives the best.

925
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,360
I know you don't!

926
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,660
I did not have sexual relations with that woman.

927
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,660
I didn't do it.

928
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,380
How many times have I heard that before?

929
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,320
And then again.

930
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,000
And again, and again, and again.

931
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,340
I could hear the cheerings in living room all across this country.

932
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,060
Right on! It's the I didn't do it guy!

933
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,720
But you'd do it again, wouldn't you?

934
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,520
He's mine! I own him! And all the subsidiary rights!

935
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:57,860
I spoke to the president just a few minutes ago.

936
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,840
A Ph.D. in the obvious is he's quite pleased.

937
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,360
Arnie.

938
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,640
John, how could you?

939
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:06,640


940
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:06,640


941
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:06,640


942
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,360
I, uh, didn't do it.

943
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,320
Oh!

944
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,760
Ha ha ha ha!

945
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,120
Ha ha ha ha!

946
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:13,820
Ha ha ha ha!

947
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:19,200
It's just a political marriage. He doesn't love her. He never sticks his hand up her dress like he does to me.

948
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,480
You think you are so grand.

949
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,160
The president's whore. How many women do you think he has?

950
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:31,020
Paula, Jennifer, Monica, Linda, Kathleen, Elizabeth, Dolly, Sally, Perdue.

951
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,740
There's no Republican or Democratic way to pick up the garbage. It either gets picked up or it doesn't.

952
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,160
Literally.

953
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:44,480
I disagree. I don't understand how come they always dine in the president. He's doing his job and all of them women that's claiming him, they're ugly!

954
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,240
He's got a beautiful wife! They're ugly women! They're ugly!

955
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,700
I did not have sexual relations with that woman.

956
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,320
Oh my God!

957
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,580
Now, the I didn't do it dancers!

958
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,020
Don't move, dude.

959
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,500
This is totally a gun.

960
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,440
I didn't see you didn't do it.

961
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:19,440
We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program.

962
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:33,080
He has already said that he intends to expand. He invaded his neighbors. If the world community lets him, then so many people could be at risk.

963
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,720
Once you get gray-headed, you can fess up to that.

964
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:45,040
What I want to talk to you about today is that we have to continue that until every American is a part of this success story.

965
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:52,260
To determining whether we can in fact teach every neighborhood, every block, every family, every child.

966
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,920
Ah, you almost had me.

967
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,900
It's just like a sad excuse for your strange perversion.

968
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,120
You're screwing, you're screwing the head.

969
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,480
I can't believe I'm here.

970
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,080
There's got to be a third way here.

971
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,080
What's the hubbub, bub?

972
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,200
It's the president pressing the flesh, both animal and human.

973
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:14,360
Tonight, Ion Springfield takes a look at the secret affairs of Kennedy, Eisenhower, Bush and Clinton.

974
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,720
Did fooling around on their wives make them great?

975
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,260
We'll find out next when we play Tales of the Chief.

976
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:30,380
The allegations are false and I would never ask anybody to do anything other than tell the truth.

977
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,240
What's the big issue there?

978
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:37,660
His attitude was, we stick together, we all lie about it, we'll be okay.

979
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,720
We found a way, make some innovative partnerships.

980
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:47,420
We want to be your partner and we want to be a good partner and help you be a good partner.

981
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,260
Ah, the term disappointed has a whole new meaning in my life today.

982
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:58,160
I did not have sexual relations with that woman.

983
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,840
I didn't do it.

984
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,520
I didn't do it.

985
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,520
Hey, proper.

986
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:21,440
Now that would be some very good advice for our commander in chief at this time, but I assure you it would seem that he is fond of handling abominations.

987
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,820
I'm going to the White House to get my presidential knee pads.

988
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,360
Yes, this hinged knee, low cut dress for you.

989
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:30,360


990
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,400
Wearing baby fatty, phone sexing, psycho valley .

991
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,360
Intern .

992
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:42,220
Yes, in fact, she was frustrated by the fact that this person would not have what she termed regular sex with her.

993
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,140
Ah, a man after my own heart.

994
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,660
A gentleman with a taste for the low life.

995
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,320
Uncensored, without a kiss or a comma missing.

996
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,140
Let's assume that this is the guy.

997
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:06,320
Who's been sexually active for a long time and then got it that as president he'd have to not have to shut himself down.

998
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:15,200
You would then expect a variety of things which would be quasi sexual in nature, but which would fall short of it.

999
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,940
And phone sex might be one of them.

1000
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,460
Fantasies might be one of them.

1001
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:23,460
A close emotional relationship with a young person might be one of them.

1002
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,320
After the thanking, the oral sex.

1003
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,260
The oral sex.

1004
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,600
The oral sex.

1005
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:30,680
The oral sex.

1006
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,300
Those all could be real things without actually committing adultery.

1007
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,280
Where the rubber hits the road.

1008
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,220
I can report to you tonight that it's working.

1009
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,640
Guys, I know this has a very high ick factor.

1010
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:53,320
Which two politicians in this room went to the greatest lengths early in their career to cover up the fact that we can do it?

1011
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,180
Roy.

1012
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,760
Oh, you're right on that.

1013
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:56,280
I know.

1014
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,100
They don't call me sleep early for nothing.

1015
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,580
And I thought, well I don't think that's true.

1016
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,140
I think you can slap the President of the United States like that.

1017
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:03,760
Why?

1018
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,880
We had the same type of feeling with the people that John Kennedy had, I think.

1019
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,500
Sit down, ho!

1020
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,680
Sit down!

1021
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,360
Sit down!

1022
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,200
Oh, you ho, sit down!

1023
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:15,740
Oh, .

1024
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:24,380
I would very likely expose myself to legal bills and subpoenas and all manner of other hurt.

1025
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,140
Because that's the nature of this proceeding that they're under.

1026
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,560
I couldn't in good conscience just say, well, I'm going to do it.

1027
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,580
I'm going to sit on this stuff and not tell the authorities what I know.

1028
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:45,000
I, oh, yeah, I can't, oh, sit down.

1029
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,500
I want you to listen to me.

1030
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,640
I'm going to say this again.

1031
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:54,080
I did not have sexual relations with that woman.

1032
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,780
I didn't do nothing!

1033
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,280
Uh, isn't it, I didn't do it?

1034
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,280
Yeah, whatever!

1035
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:00,640
Uh.

1036
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:01,800
Do it!

1037
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,540
Do it!

1038
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,800
Do it!

1039
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,360
Do it!

1040
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,760
Do it!

1041
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:07,340
Do it!

1042
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,080
Do it!

1043
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:08,280
Do it!

1044
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,940
I did not.

1045
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:19,840
And now, boys and girls, here he is, the boy that says the words you've been longing

1046
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,200
to hear like the salivating dog that you are.

1047
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,420
I didn't do it.

1048
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,500
Huh?

1049
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,020
Uh-huh.

1050
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:28,260
Uh-huh.

1051
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:28,260


1052
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:28,520
Uh-huh.

1053
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,600
Uh-huh.

1054
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:29,980
Uh-huh.

1055
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,160
I didn't do it.

1056
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:40,680
I can go back, uh, now and continue the work that I'm doing.

1057
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,600
You awful man.

1058
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,080
Speaking of one-trick ponies, whatever happened to that I didn't do it kid?

1059
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,760
Boy, did that get old fast.

1060
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,440
Whoa!

1061
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,280
You know, if you want to last in this business, you gotta stay fresh.

1062
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,780
I can report to you tonight that it's working.

1063
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,260
Now, let's get to work.

1064
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,180
Let's imagine the future.

1065
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,160
Hello.

1066
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:01,260
Hello.

1067
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:02,260
Hello.

1068
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:05,460
Hello.

1069
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,180
Hello.

1070
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,520
Hello.

1071
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,020
Hello.

1072
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:10,340
Hello.

1073
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,000
Hello.

1074
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:11,180
Hello.

1075
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:11,680
Hello.

1076
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:11,980
Hello.

1077
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,060
Hello.

1078
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,000
Hello, seekers.

1079
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:19,380
I'd like to take this opportunity to say a few words about our leader.

1080
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:26,160
I'm very concerned about the way the whole thing's been going for a while, but I've been

1081
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,580
afraid to speak.

1082
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:35,400
Seekers, there's a very serious sexual addiction running rampant here, and it gives even me

1083
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,340
cause for concern, so you know it's gotta be bad.

1084
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:48,540
Oh, I'm not talking about that two-bit laundromat Lothario Bill Clinton.

1085
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,240
Oh, I wish I were.

1086
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:54,620
That guy's just another glad-handing, grab-ass hick.

1087
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,140
Oh, no.

1088
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,560
The leader who made me a leader.

1089
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:57,560


1090
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:04,340
And the one whom I'm referring to is our own sweet, dear, beloved Reverend Ivan Stagg.

1091
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,780
Or is he?

1092
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:15,620
Oh, as one of the church interns, I've put up with the repeated inseminations by the church

1093
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,220
hierarchy.

1094
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:22,500
Oh, just a rite of passage, they said, but this hallway never ends.

1095
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,400
Oh, I figured I was ready for anything.

1096
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,100
Well, anyhow.

1097
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:37,400
Things have been real intense for a long time, but oh, lately, Stagg's sexual excesses have

1098
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:43,680
reached such horrifying proportions that it may endanger the church itself, and I can't

1099
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,720
sit on this any longer.

1100
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:54,040
I'm gonna turn you all my kids to hell.

1101
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,100
Oh, my God.

1102
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:56,400
Oh, my God.

1103
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:56,920
They're all gonna get it.

1104
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,060
I can't sit down.

1105
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,100
Yeah, tell me about it, sister.

1106
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,620
Oh, I feel your pain.

1107
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,080
Oh, yes.

1108
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,500
Is this indeed our Stagg doing this?

1109
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,540
And doing it?

1110
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,680
And doing it?

1111
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,560
And doing it?

1112
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:23,080
The Stagg does resemble the old Stagg, but, oh, there's something about this one that

1113
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:23,740
isn't right.

1114
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,380
It's more than just our little sister.

1115
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:26,380


1116
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:26,380


1117
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:26,380


1118
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:26,380


1119
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:26,380


1120
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:26,380


1121
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:26,380


1122
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:26,380


1123
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,380
Our good old staying with a beard.

1124
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,460
There's something about the eyes.

1125
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,400
Oh, like those small ruby red dots in the middle of each pupil for starters.

1126
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,760
Oh, I'd never noticed those before.

1127
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,760
But the first thing I noticed was his weird behavior.

1128
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,640
It used to be three, maybe four call girls a night.

1129
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,300
Oh, and then the stakes got higher.

1130
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,500
He needed new thrills.

1131
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,440
Ordinary human women weren't cranking his tractor anymore.

1132
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,020
Oh, and then the disappearances started happening around Dallas.

1133
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,000
House pets, livestock, Christians.

1134
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,540
It was getting bad.

1135
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,420
Oh, but our staying was a busy man.

1136
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:23,140
At the same time, he began to assemble an elite cadre of bimbos, a la L. Ron Hubbard.

1137
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:29,140
Oh, and they helped keep up with his rampaging perversions for a while.

1138
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,520
Oh, how he kept him out of jail just with that, I don't know.

1139
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,500
Oh, but then last week, Stang.

1140
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,100
Oh, if it is Stang.

1141
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:51,660
Went on a colossal bender and took a whole busload of 38 drugged and bound and half-corps church secretaries off a bridge.

1142
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,020
And...

1143
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,120
Chained.

1144
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,480
Kappa squinted.

1145
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:59,500
And now I've got a mess of monumental proportions here to cover up.

1146
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:06,260
Oh, I managed to plant Tammy Wynette and Wendy O. Williams in convincing death scenes.

1147
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:06,780
But...

1148
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:12,280
Oh, I'm working from the wrong end of the alphabet here and I got 36 to go.

1149
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:16,980
And how he had Vince Foster on board, I'll never know.

1150
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,380
Oh, I can't figure out...

1151
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:22,960
Who was the poor jerk they found shot?

1152
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,100
I mean, I've got a bunch of people out in the park and...

1153
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:31,340
Gee, would it really confuse things all that badly if I just used that same setup again?

1154
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:35,580
It worked once and it sure would be convenient.

1155
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,180
Oh, but anyhow, Seekers.

1156
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,520
This is where you come in.

1157
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:48,160
You need to pray to Bob that our beloved Reverend Ivan Stang is okay.

1158
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,700
Whoever the hell this Stang is.

1159
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:58,340
Because one little mass murder like this could compromise our chances of making it to X-Day.

1160
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,700
And we're only 85 days away, Seekers.

1161
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:03,660
Yes.

1162
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:11,120
However evil and horny this new Stang is, we need him to get off this planet.

1163
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,860
So let's rally behind him, whoever he is.

1164
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,820
Because that way he can't point them laser beam eyes at us.

1165
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,060
And yeah...

1166
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,260
Let's get back to going on about...

1167
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,400
Sex again.

1168
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:30,600
Oh...

1169
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,220
Yeah, that damn Bill Clinton.

1170
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,880
Oh, when Willy showed his Willy to Willy, that was my shut-off point.

1171
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:47,160
Oh, but that cheesy weasel is taking us off the beaten track tonight, so...

1172
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:51,040
We're gonna have to do some beating to catch up.

1173
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:51,040


1174
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:51,040


1175
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:51,040


1176
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,300
And hey...

1177
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:57,660
That sure does sound like a good idea to me.

1178
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:02,940
So why don't you just go and get out your ritual items?

1179
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,700
A little cold cream, some Kleenex, some favorite pornography.

1180
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,740
Because we're getting back down to business.

1181
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,860
Because face it, baby...

1182
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,820
You know you want to.

1183
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:24,480
You know you need it.

1184
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:28,520
You might even deserve it.

1185
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,120
And one thing's for sure...

1186
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,620
I ain't cleaning up after it.

1187
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,360
So enjoy...

1188
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,440
And let yourself go.

1189
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:49,960
There's evil in your town, though you may not know it's there.

1190
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,780
It never makes a sound, it just creeps up your underwear.

1191
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,080
You can find it in your restaurants underneath the tablecloth.

1192
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:02,060
You can find it in your old haunts in a can of chicken broth.

1193
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,060
Sometimes it shows in daylight for everyone to see.

1194
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:10,020
We gotta join the fight against S-M-U-T.

1195
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,180
S-M-U-T.

1196
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,000
It's deepening your mind.

1197
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:16,020
S-M-U-T.

1198
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,760
So easy to find.

1199
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,780
S-M-U-T.

1200
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,380
S-M-U-T.

1201
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,520
It's wicked and it's foul.

1202
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,300
S-M-U-T.

1203
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:23,940
S-M-U-T.

1204
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,420
It's enough to make you high.

1205
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,120
High.

1206
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:26,660
Foul.

1207
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,020
My daddy was a baker.

1208
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,980
His buns he liked to show.

1209
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,480
My mama was a cosmo girl.

1210
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,000
She sucked up daddy's dough.

1211
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,340
My girlfriend is a call girl.

1212
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,040
She makes my carrot grow.

1213
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,060
She doesn't like a tractor.

1214
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,760
That's why they call her hoe.

1215
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,240
She doesn't like a tractor.

1216
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,440
That's why they call her hoe.

1217
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,520
S-M-U-T.

1218
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,500
S-M-U-T.

1219
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,680
It's deepening your mind.

1220
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,360
S-M-U-T.

1221
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,240
S-M-U-T.

1222
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,480
So easy to find.

1223
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,440
S-M-U-T.

1224
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:06,880
S-M-U-T.

1225
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,220
It's wicked and it's foul.

1226
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,920
S-M-U-T.

1227
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:10,520
S-M-U-T.

1228
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:10,900
S-M-U-T.

1229
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,100
It's enough to make you high.

1230
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:12,440
High.

1231
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,260
S-M-U-T.

1232
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:15,340
S-M-U-T.

1233
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,800
S-M-U-T.

1234
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,040
S-M-U-T.

1235
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:19,760
S-M-U-T.

1236
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:19,760


1237
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:19,760


1238
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,340
S-M-U-T.

1239
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,580
S-M-U-T.

1240
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,340
S-M-U-T.

1241
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:36,200
S-M-U-T.

1242
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,940
S-M-U-T.

1243
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,740
SUB CREDITS

1244
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,380
Good morning, boys and girls.

1245
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,160
Ah, I see you're alone.

1246
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,660
Well, turn your stereo up real loud.

1247
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,560
Make yourself real small.

1248
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:16,540
And let your mind drift away to poetry corner.

1249
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:19,960
Are you small enough to read between the lines?

1250
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,800
Well, here's a poem you can really get into.

1251
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,180
I like little pussy.

1252
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,100
I like little pussy.

1253
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,820
Her coat is so warm.

1254
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,900
And if I don't hurt her, she'll do me no harm.

1255
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:37,860
So I'll not pull her tail nor drive her away.

1256
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,980
But pussy and I very gently will play.

1257
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:46,160
She shall sit by my side and I'll give her some food.

1258
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:50,340
And she'll love me because I'm gentle and good.

1259
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:54,180
I'll pat little pussy and then she will purr.

1260
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:58,260
And I'll show her thanks for my kindness to her.

1261
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:02,560
I never will bex her or make her displeased.

1262
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:06,400
Puss doesn't like to be worried or teased.

1263
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,380
I like little pussy.

1264
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,380
I like little pussy.

1265
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,280
I like little pussy.

1266
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,100
Her coat is so warm.

1267
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,680
And if I don't hurt her, she'll do me no harm.

1268
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:22,200
Oh.

1269
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:23,620
SFUG.

1270
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,500
It's seeping in your mind.

1271
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:27,540
SFUG.

1272
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,300
It's so easy to find.

1273
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:31,260
SFUG.

1274
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,020
It's wicked and it's foul.

1275
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:34,960
SFUG.

1276
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,100
It's enough to make you high.

1277
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:40,800
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

1278
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,500
Oh, goodnight, seekers.

1279
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:47,880
SFUG.

1280
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:50,960
Ahem.
