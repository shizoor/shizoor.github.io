1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,060
From PR News in Washington, I'm hampering efforts to reach a rocket-propelled iron fist.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:13,860
More than 100 blows with Israeli stones at Palestinian civilians with a 3.5% growth rate estimated a month ago.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,840
The White House is defending the White House.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,500
The White House.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,820
On Wall Street, 31-10-3-4-2068, the Commerce Department reports the growth brought expanded in the first quarter of the year.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:32,740
President Bush has signed an executive order giving the U.S. government new powers to clamp down on PR news in Washington.

7
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:07,960
Now we're going to have Dr. Drummond here and then continue at some point with the subgenius auction of the treasures of time,

8
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,360
the last artifacts of old earth which we're going to be selling tonight,

9
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:21,800
including the extra lewd DVD of girls frisking unclothed in the locker room,

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,180
which he will probably bring from our...

11
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,880
Our cabin, where we studied it.

12
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,880
You did?

13
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,740
Yes, to make sure that the buyers would get the value that they deserved.

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:43,760
There may be some other videos that need to be logged as part of the final procedure.

15
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah, that's right.

16
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,500
We've only...

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,240
Well, hell, man, we've only got less than 12 hours left of earth money spending time.

18
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,740
But it is therapeutic for us to continue in our foolish humanoid rituals.

19
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:02,540
Buying and selling, getting and spending, and judging non-existent values against each other,

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,240
even unto the last moments of our existence.

21
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,220
For otherwise we would not be human.

22
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,680
And though we are subgeniuses, we are also human subgeniuses.

23
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,620
Oh, the humanity will go.

24
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,260
It will be burned away in the searing fires of X-Day,

25
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,020
which is why the subgenius understructure,

26
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,460
the subgenius endoskeleton, is so important to cultivate.

27
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,400
Yeah, you want to know how girls look under their clothes?

28
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,400
Look to that endoskeleton.

29
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,060
One of nature's most remarkable creations.

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,180
Hey, pater nostril, I'm going to turn the mics here up,

31
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,080
and you may want to turn your output down because it's for my tape, actually.

32
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,540
So there.

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,000
If our voices echo in an unseemly way, then we are not human.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000


35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000


36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,620
If our voices echo in an unseemly manner, you have to let us know because...

37
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,480
That's enough for... That's fine for me.

38
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,400
This is getting to go on the escape ship.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,220
Some of the last records made in this place.

40
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,580
The final tapes made on Earth.

41
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,260
They'll study these tapes, you know, for clues and hints.

42
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,060
What did we do wrong? What could we have done to have joined them?

43
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,320
Why must we be left behind? And it'll be too late.

44
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,140
And now...

45
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,520
They realize $30...

46
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:24,980
And now...

47
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,740
The cops could have done it.

48
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,260
And it's too late. Those $35...

49
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,420
$30 mean nothing anymore.

50
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,380
And they barely did back then.

51
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:41,000
$30 used to be quite a chunk of change, but when you consider what the usual utility bill is,

52
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,580
$30 is a mere hiccup of a laugh in the night,

53
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,960
a departing bunch of borgerigmus or flatulence that you'd forget about.

54
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,960
And only the next day, if then, we'll be able to get it back.

55
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,760
And then you wonder fleetingly what happened to it.

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:05,460
In the meantime, it would be guarding you, protecting you, against the many horrors and indignities of the seething subgenius apocalypse,

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:11,920
which, had you only considered, was bearing down upon you at that moment, as it does at this moment.

58
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,380
Dun, dun, dun, dun.

59
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,720
Well, you can...

60
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,340
We don't need to feather our comments, because we're not trying to scare everyone.

61
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,940
We all know the stakes in this terrible...

62
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,460
game we've been playing.

63
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,040
The risk, the gamble, the sport of it all.

64
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,600
The sport, the lark, the joke, dear friends.

65
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:46,480
Well, that was Dr. Howell and myself awaiting the seething subgenius apocalypse that we thought was bearing down upon planet Earth.

66
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,720
Quote, Earth, unquote.

67
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,660
Recorded on the stage at the pavilion of Brushwood,

68
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,820
the clothing optional campground,

69
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,960
in western New York, where we await the saucers.

70
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,940
Eight years in a row now.

71
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,460
But still, as you can tell, with total...

72
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,400
faith.

73
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:13,860
Although, you know, the late afternoon just before X-Day, or X-Day-een, we call it,

74
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:23,940
that can become a little challenging, as we hear here in these live recordings made off the cult's soundboard,

75
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:29,560
by cultist Pater Nostril, just before their day of tragedy.

76
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,120
Ben Seven-Anne come and gone in Australia.

77
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,480
And New Zealand.

78
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,840
Has anybody heard from Reverend Chain Smurker?

79
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,100
No? That's a good sign!

80
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,200
Has anybody heard from, uh, what's his name, Reverend Cardboard Box in New Zealand?

81
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,640
No! I haven't heard a word from him. I haven't gotten any email from him in many hours.

82
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,920
Has anybody picked up any radio signals?

83
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,120
No.

84
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,660
No radio signals from New Zealand or Australia in the last few hours?

85
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,840
You proved to me that they haven't been shut down, that they haven't been ruptured.

86
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:10,880
You know, the people, ignorant, illiterate subgeniuses who don't ever buy the actual book, The Subgenius,

87
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,800
often ask that question to be cute.

88
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,140
Well, hey man, 7 AM, is that Eastern Standard Time?

89
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,340
Or Central Time?

90
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,660
But, um, as we all know from long, long studying of the pre-scriptures,

91
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:35,140
that the saucers line up vertically over, uh, from North Pole to South Pole,

92
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,580
over the International Date Line, which starts in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

93
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:46,500
And at 7 AM, they turn on their rupture-sucking device and let the world rotate underneath them.

94
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,520
They don't, they're slack. See? Path of least resistance.

95
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,460
Thus, um,

96
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,200
you know, it's 7.15 right now here.

97
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,600
Well, it was 7 AM, 12 hours ago, somewhere.

98
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,360
And, we haven't heard from them.

99
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:11,180
But I would think that by, by the time, say, Beijing was utterly destroyed by the Exis,

100
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,020
we'd start getting, even here at Brushwood, we'd start getting news.

101
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,440
Wouldn't there be people running down the hill going,

102
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,660
Man, did you hear? It's like weirder than the tsunami.

103
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,600
It's like everyone east of the time zone has disappeared.

104
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,820
The every, and some of them are skeletons and some of them are just piles of clothes.

105
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,240
The piles of clothes are the subgeniuses, friends.

106
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,880
It'll be mostly skeletons.

107
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,240
As we saw in that War of the Worlds low-budget movie,

108
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,880
skeletons that continue to writhe in agony and pain.

109
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,640
As they burn.

110
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,640
They, as they're, after, long after the flesh and tendons have been burned,

111
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:48,640


112
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,940
the skeletons still struggle in agony.

113
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,580
This is a terrible thing to say, but it's true.

114
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,660
It's young men such as you, 18 to 25 years old,

115
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,120
who are doing most of the killing.

116
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,260
You, American boys,

117
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,560
you're killing your own people, and yourselves.

118
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,800
You are killing American women, American men, American children.

119
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,880
Now get this.

120
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,120
Yes, I know, I know.

121
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,080
You're too quick to experience, too smart.

122
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,000
Cool. Cool cats.

123
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,700
But I won't.

124
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,740
I'm up to my ears in ginger ale.

125
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,360
I think I'll cool off and put my face back on.

126
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,080
Break it up, you squares.

127
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,780
We've got all our lives ahead of us.

128
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,640
We'll manage somehow.

129
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,700
And a long life.

130
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,540
What a night.

131
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,080
The longer the better.

132
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,700
I can't do this.

133
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,920
I plan on doing a little snuggling with Claire.

134
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,100
We're coming, baby.

135
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,080
When she comes.

136
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,280
When she comes.

137
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,540
Comes.

138
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,420
Golly, Mike.

139
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,320
Six inches.

140
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,580
Four and a half inches.

141
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,580
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

142
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,820
We'll kill. We'll kill.

143
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,100
Kill the old member, sir. We'll kill the old member.

144
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,900
We've given him plasma.

145
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,060
Thank you.

146
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,120
I think he can take it.

147
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,080
Hey, fella.

148
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,580
How are you feeling?

149
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,020
Do you remember what happened last night?

150
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,340
Airman Wilkins had five.

151
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,740
And Airman Kelly had six.

152
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,960
Yes, sir.

153
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,700
You turned over twice.

154
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,240
Badly beaten up.

155
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,440
What about her leg?

156
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,220
What about her leg?

157
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,320
Let it go.

158
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,380
Get it over with.

159
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,500
Millions of men have dedicated their lives

160
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,880
to killing your own people.

161
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,580
And yourselves.

162
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,920
But there's always some kid who comes along

163
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,060
to dirty that reputation.

164
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,140
There's a great little guy.

165
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,580
Yeah.

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,420
So keep your mouth shut.

167
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,720
I don't know what to say.

168
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,700
I never had this happen before.

169
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,420
I don't know what to say.

170
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,840
He didn't look bad at all.

171
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,640
I know how you feel.

172
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,160
I don't know what to say.

173
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,460
I know how you feel.

174
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,700
Joy writing, dear friends, by Norell Preff,

175
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,860
who is now at norellpreff.com.

176
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,080
Go there for his slackful stuff.

177
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,100
And that's what it's all about, isn't it?

178
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,120
Slack.

179
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,540
Not intelligence, but slack.

180
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,200
Friends, you don't need those brain cells.

181
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,060
You don't need to be able to read.

182
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,220
All you need is to be able to recognize the Dobbs head.

183
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,300
That's really all it takes.

184
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,260
Sometimes I wish I could be blind to everything

185
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,040
that wasn't a Dobbs head.

186
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,720
Well, be careful what you wish for, Ivan.

187
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,940
Like the picture of Dorian Gray,

188
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,780
a hideous bargain could still be enacted.

189
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,940
And while we're all enjoying the pleasure saucers,

190
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,460
the sex goddesses,

191
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,860
you could be in a jag,

192
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,840
an endless loop, staring at that head.

193
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,460
And you've done enough of that in your ministry,

194
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:13,820
in your ministry.

195
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,500
Don't you tell me when I've done too much Dobbs head.

196
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,780
We know you've suffered too much.

197
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,940
To bring slack to others, you've often lost it yourselves.

198
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,660
And I know that...

199
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,280
I know that you're tempted to go out

200
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,200
in a blazing, burning engram

201
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,120
of the Dobbs face on your soul.

202
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,740
But this sacrifice may not be necessary.

203
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,920
Who needs arms? Who needs legs?

204
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,580
The Dobbs head doesn't have those.

205
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,340
If I could just have each part amputated,

206
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,160
bit by bit,

207
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,920
until there was nothing left but a head,

208
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,980
and have the little dots tattooed on,

209
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,340
you know, and be just like Bob.

210
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,060
Yes.

211
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,420
But isn't that the nightmare of religion, you know?

212
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,340
It's very expensive.

213
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,660
The somaectomy takes many stages.

214
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,480
That's the ultimate example of sucking the finger

215
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,240
rather than going where it points.

216
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,620
Bob doesn't want a planet of all-male salesmen

217
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,140
selling silly crap to each other.

218
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,660
Then there's the facial reconstruction surgery.

219
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,580
He wants a million different kind of people

220
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,220
selling crap where the profits come back to him.

221
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:15,820
That's all.

222
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,940
And the dotoplasty is another thing

223
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,460
that is quite expensive when they do it.

224
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,260
The witchplasm?

225
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,460
The dotoplasty.

226
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,920
When they put the dots on,

227
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,520
each one has to be gathered

228
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,800
from another part of the body, reshaped.

229
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,480
But they can do anything these days,

230
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,020
particularly down in South America.

231
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,040
You know the way it is.

232
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,640
They don't have those silly laws

233
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,880
with the fetus brain tissue and so forth.

234
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,560
Friends, if you end up with any possible access

235
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,460
to any extra fetus brain tissue,

236
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,780
we have use for that.

237
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,300
And the fetus can actually be pretty well along.

238
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,380
Delicious.

239
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,240
An ice cream in milkshakes

240
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,000
and to top your favorite dessert.

241
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,060
Face mercenaria the universe.

242
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,520
I am Rocket Boy.

243
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,620
Strawberry shortcake, help me.

244
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,600
I want my mommy.

245
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,960
Strawberry shortcake, help me.

246
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,540
I want my mommy.

247
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,740
Strawberry shortcake, help me.

248
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:26,740


249
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:26,740


250
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, it's rather interesting

251
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,780
that I was asked to follow Dr. Hal.

252
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,680
At the risk of sounding too overly kiss-ass,

253
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,500
I've been a fan and admirer of the show

254
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:37,500


255
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,580
since I first saw his artwork

256
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,940
in Paradox Press's book,

257
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,660
The Big Book of Conspiracies,

258
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,040
when I was roughly around 11 or 12 years of age.

259
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,700
It was that book that led me into the Church of the Subgenius

260
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,900
because that book had a foreword by Reverend Ivan Stang.

261
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,460
But Dr. Hal is, I suppose,

262
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,800
an archetype of some kind,

263
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,440
a Jungian sort of archetype.

264
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,420
And in fact, that's a little bit

265
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,520
of what I'd like to talk about.

266
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,480
You see, I've noticed that,

267
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,380
I've noticed this week that

268
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,920
Slack has come to me in a very interesting sort of way.

269
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,680
My approach to Slack this week

270
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,100
has been realizing,

271
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,480
at the oddest sort of moments,

272
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,780
how I felt when I had more Slack

273
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,880
when I was a young child.

274
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,180
That ineffable feeling at this Brushwood place

275
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,320
is similar to that lilting feeling of joy

276
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,440
that a young child has

277
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,500
when they're at their grandparents' house.

278
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,200
And you know, I'm 18 years old.

279
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,880
I'm a heterosexual male virgin.

280
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,480
And yet, in my time, in my life,

281
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,860
the things I've experienced

282
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,660
have kind of popped my cherries, so to speak.

283
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,160
I sort of have a...

284
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,180
Well, I'm overcoming a certain cynical realism.

285
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,600
Because these are hard times.

286
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,020
These are difficult times,

287
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,320
not only to be a subgenius,

288
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,100
but to be an American,

289
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,600
to be a human on this planet.

290
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,960
It's a sick world, I think we all realize.

291
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,780
It's a sick world when, you know,

292
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,500
a conspiracy over man

293
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,520
can molest children and get away with it.

294
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,720
It's a sick world when we have Bush

295
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,060
and so on and so forth.

296
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,620
It's a sick world when we don't have any Slack.

297
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,080
And, you know, Slack to some

298
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,460
is certainly rewarding and relaxation

299
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,220
and ease and patience.

300
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,020
But one of the more interesting aspects

301
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,420
of the Church of the Subgenius

302
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,700
is that we make no attempt,

303
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,900
we make no pretense

304
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,540
to make you feel comfortable.

305
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,520
We simply bring you up here,

306
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,920
show you our dog and pony show,

307
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,260
and if you like it, you like it,

308
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,760
and if you don't, hopefully you leave

309
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,820
and we never see you again.

310
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,920
Indeed, it would be an interesting

311
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,040
sort of predicament should the

312
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,100
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms

313
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,180
come across this place.

314
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,540
I think we would all know what would happen then.

315
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,880
They'd murder us and blame us for our own deaths.

316
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,660
I'm sure our Nazi friend can tell us

317
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,820
a little bit more about that.

318
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,980
But moving right along,

319
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,580
the conspiracy would do this

320
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,120
because the conspiracy exists

321
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,320
and plays the role of philanthropists.

322
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,000
To quote the character of Clinton,

323
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,480
George Stark in George Powell's film

324
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,820
The Seven Faces of Dr. Lau,

325
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,660
I'm a philanthropist, boy.

326
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,440
I like to help people.

327
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,540
Well, that's what the conspiracy does best,

328
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,420
is it helps people.

329
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,220
And in fact, we're living in an epoch

330
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,160
in which the conspiracy is helping us

331
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,200
through the standard conservative methods

332
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,080
of guns and bombs and death and destruction.

333
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,740
Now, in the Clinton years,

334
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,200
we had the standard liberal conspiracy

335
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,480
helping of, you know,

336
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,560
vaguely socialist sort of programs

337
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,120
and a glossy idealism and...

338
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,200
Well, here's an example.

339
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,060
For instance, you're a subgenius.

340
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,080
You've had some problems,

341
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,980
some personal problems,

342
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,780
some life problems

343
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,460
that Bob isn't just enough for.

344
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,600
So you go to the doctor.

345
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,380
The doctor looks over at your records

346
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:49,920
and he says,

347
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,520
Ah, ah, okay, I see what we have for you.

348
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,400
You are a bipolar, schizotypical,

349
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,420
high-functioning autistic.

350
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,840
Please take these pills

351
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,200
and function as a normal person

352
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,200
because this unmutualism will not stand.

353
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,260
And then, of course,

354
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,040
George W. Bush wouldn't know anything about that.

355
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,200
He'll just bomb the fuck out of you.

356
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,860
Slack. Slack is an interesting subject.

357
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,620
I've written these down.

358
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,440
Slack. Slack.

359
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,760
Slack of the Bobbies says,

360
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,620
Oh, I've got to show off how weird I am

361
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,020
and how strange and bizarre and freaky I am.

362
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,780
Most subgeni I've noticed

363
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,300
aren't necessarily concerned with being weirdos

364
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,720
as much as they are with slacking off.

365
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,360
In fact, I myself indulge in the conspiracy media.

366
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,540
I enjoy pop music and, you know,

367
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,560
TV movies and what have you,

368
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,280
but it doesn't make me any less of a subgenius, I hope.

369
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,860
Indeed, the conspiracy produces good things.

370
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,140
I've often listened to albums by Christina Aguilera

371
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,680
and thought, you know,

372
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,560
those producers have deft little fingers.

373
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,080
Perhaps if they weren't conspiracy monsters,

374
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,540
they might make something of themselves.

375
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,060
And, of course, I've known the slack of sales as well.

376
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,520
Reverend Lord Ferg and I used to install car audio

377
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,200
and when you made that perfect sell,

378
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,720
you felt a jolt of slack carouse up and down your Kundalini.

379
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,080
After that, I worked telemarketing

380
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,020
and the jolt was not quite as strong,

381
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,100
but it was still there.

382
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,140
The fact of the matter is that slack exists in many, many forms

383
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,640
and it is for us to understand them.

384
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,980
Indeed, that is the function of life on this planet.

385
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,040
As a subgenius, you realize that there are three functions.

386
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,940
First of all is to appreciate, respect, love, and worship beauty.

387
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,820
Secondly is to appreciate, love, and worship respect

388
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,180
and act as a conduit for the future.

389
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,880
Thirdly is to press on

390
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,460
and hope that your evolutionary dictation

391
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,880
progresses into the future.

392
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,500
Because we are the 0.1% that acts against the bulwark of conspiracy bullshit.

393
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,940
We are riding the crest of a fabulous fractal wave

394
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,640
directly into what could be a wonderful future

395
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,240
if we act now and strike while the iron is hot.

396
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:02,180
My prophecy, as Reverend Stang has mentioned a number of times,

397
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:08,080
is that NASA has sent up missiles to destroy the Yakutism scout ships,

398
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,020
but I still feel that NASA covered up

399
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,740
what could have been the most threatening aspect of life on this planet,

400
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,640
the shift of the poles with their tsunami story,

401
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,460
but that is what it is.

402
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,800
It's interesting to point out that youth may come and age may go,

403
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,360
but there will be no more circuses like this show.

404
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,520
And that they came to snuff the rooster,

405
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,080
but you know he ain't ever gonna die.

406
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,660
As I said before,

407
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,440
if you're the sort of person who regards yourself as an extropian,

408
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,300
as someone pushing on towards an evolutionary progression,

409
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,740
towards perhaps a great singularity,

410
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,240
possibly from an Exos destroyer

411
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,480
or from the ending of a Mayan universal calendar,

412
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,220
you still see that idealistic spark

413
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,020
in every apocalyptic nightmare you've ever had.

414
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,940
And what I would like to recommend to you today

415
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,080
is that you maintain that idealistic spark,

416
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,960
you keep it strong, powerful, healthy, and lit,

417
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,220
and you go out of this place as happy as you came,

418
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:12,160
making the world a better, safer place for slack and sub-GNI in general.

419
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,700
Thank you.

420
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,800
Reverend Alex Thompson, friends, best diction!

421
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,860
One kiss.

422
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,280
Violence.

423
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,220
Two kids.

424
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,660
Violence.

425
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,440
Three kids.

426
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:31,980
Violence.

427
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,640
I'm Dr. Laura Schlesinger.

428
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,120
Welcome to the program.

429
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,060
Hey, I'm going to take you, take you down, take you down, take you down an entirely different line.

430
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,340
You need to talk to your attorney.

431
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,200
Give me a break.

432
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,120
You don't need this.

433
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,060
Give me a break here.

434
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,320
I'm Dr. Laura Schlesinger.

435
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,540
Silly, foolish woman.

436
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:50,880
Me.

437
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,900
Get rid of her.

438
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,780
Do you really finally understand?

439
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,180
You can give me a lecture, you can beg me, you can bribe me.

440
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,800
I don't get it.

441
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,040
There's nothing I can do.

442
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,980
Going in a circle.

443
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,960
Going in a circle.

444
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,700
Boyfriend came and shot up your kid.

445
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,260
Madam.

446
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,980
Tie your tubes and don't make more babies.

447
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:04,700
Bulldog.

448
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,380
Bulldog.

449
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:05,800
Bull.

450
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,140
Bull.

451
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:06,840
Bulldog.

452
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,260
Bulldog.

453
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,600
Bulldog.

454
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:07,940
Bulldog.

455
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,560
If I choose to live with a violent man, there's not a thing you can do about it.

456
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,080
Yikes.

457
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,080
Depressed, low self-esteem, feeling like a failure.

458
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,220
Oppressed other people.

459
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,360
I'm Dr. Laura Schlesinger.

460
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:18,760
Me.

461
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,340
What?

462
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,660
Me.

463
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,040
What?

464
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,340
Me.

465
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:21,340


466
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:21,420
Me.

467
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:21,900
Me.

468
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:22,620
Me.

469
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,200


470
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,000
Me.

471
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,140
Me.

472
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,320
Not eating.

473
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,320
Starting to drink.

474
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:27,960
Me.

475
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,080
L-A-R-D-U-R-L-A-R-D-E-D-R.

476
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,540
Do it.

477
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,020
A boyfriend.

478
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,260
Gotta do what you have to do.

479
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,920
Because you knew.

480
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,420
Me.

481
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:35,880
Me.

482
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,000
I am like kidskidskidskidskidskidskidskidscrappymomommommommommom.

483
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,740
What's wrong?

484
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,180
On the highway?

485
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,280
On the highway?

486
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:46,620
Yeah.

487
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,140
Isn't that ironic?

488
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:48,940
Do they know?

489
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,100
Oh boy, don't even bother to go there.

490
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,440
You know.

491
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,760
Laura Schlesinger...

492
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,800
...specializes in trauma.

493
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:55,980
...covid-19...

494
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:55,980


495
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,440
And there's no quick fix to this.

496
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,880
Nor El Pref, and before that, Reverend Alex Thompson.

497
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,780
Coming up, radio synesthesia clips.

498
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,080
But now, friends, there's still time to...

499
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,060
Get in the water.

500
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,040
There's still time to get in the water.

501
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,180
Friends, think about it.

502
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,560
This could be your last night on Earth.

503
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,480
Have you called your old ma up and told her you loved her?

504
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,100
Well, if you haven't, too late.

505
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,100
You can't do it from here.

506
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,620
I mean, think about that.

507
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,280
When was the last time you called up your old ma and told her...

508
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,320
Your sainted, gray-haired old mammy?

509
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,820
...and told her you loved her?

510
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,220
This could be the last chance.

511
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,240
Think about that.

512
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,200
What if they don't love her, though?

513
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,000
Well...

514
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,220
What if they hate their ma and they call her up and say,

515
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,200
Ma, I love you?

516
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,380
That could send the wrong message.

517
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,500
Well, it works both ways.

518
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,660
This is your last chance to tell her off and get it off your chest.

519
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,640
Yes, it is.

520
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,380
But then there's also a sort of blessing in her not knowing.

521
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,880
I mean, let's look at this realistically.

522
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,600
The nice thing about the apocalypse is that you all go together when you go.

523
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,260
It's not as if...

524
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:01,380
It's not as if just you died and let your loved ones to discover your pornography collection on their own.

525
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,980
No, they all go up in complete ignorance of every terrible thing.

526
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,340
And you are buoyed up by the idea that you know there is something more.

527
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,780
What's the name of that company that if you die accidentally,

528
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,120
they come in and scrub all the porn off your computer before your family gets there?

529
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,820
That's Clean Co.

530
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,680
Oh, okay.

531
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,200
All right, yeah.

532
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,140
But, you know, all they do is record it for themselves.

533
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,420
Good business if you think about it.

534
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,980
You know, really, the only way to get the child pornography off of your hard drive

535
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:39,900
is to strap the hard drive to the exterior of one of the space shuttles and the heat shielding.

536
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,540
That's how the congressmen get rid of their child pornography.

537
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,380
Well, they claim they get rid of it.

538
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,060
Actually, they need it for further study.

539
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,260
Did you bring that DVD of the locker room, shower room antics here?

540
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:53,560
Yes.

541
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,100
I asked you because we are going to have to sell it.

542
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,960
No, I didn't bring it with me.

543
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,880
Well, later on then...

544
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,380
I still had it in the locker room.

545
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:08,600
Well, during the auction, we'll sell it, and then they can come by the subgenius cabin to get it.

546
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,760
Yeah, it's really something.

547
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,900
It's really something inept.

548
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,380
Bad camera work.

549
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,860
It's only 53 minutes, and it's got like six chapters.

550
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,380
The worst is you have to listen to them, to their chatter.

551
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,720
They're giggling and tittering and having a great old time.

552
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,680
Yeah, but they're boring.

553
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,940
Scrubbing the bees and soap off each other's bare buttocks.

554
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,240
Yeah, well, for all of us, it could be better considering the contents.

555
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,880
Friends, you'll be soaping the buttocks of alien space goddesses in just a matter of hours.

556
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,260
And they yours.

557
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,580
If buttocks they truly be.

558
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,720
They yours.

559
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,400
Or they could be soaping your buttocks.

560
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,220
That's what I'm trying to warn them about.

561
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,400
In fact, that will...

562
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,100
happen.

563
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:03,100
The holy injunction, wash your ass, will be enacted unto the nth degree aboard the space saucers.

564
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:08,420
Because nothing impure and organic can be allowed to go.

565
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,340
What is dirt, anyway?

566
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,400
Dirt only is something which has had some touch of life in it.

567
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,400
Pure, sterile sand and lunar regolith is not dirty

568
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,540
because there's never been any feces in it.

569
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,000
Or dead bugs or anything like that.

570
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,120
But the divine presence of life is what creates filth.

571
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:38,760
And on the space vessels, of course, as we enter into a new understanding with the cosmos,

572
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,680
these ludicrous flesh bags will probably be discarded.

573
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,540
Or at least made highly more efficient and tolerable.

574
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,480
It'll be just like getting new shoes.

575
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,040
That's all. It'll be like discarding your old shoes.

576
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,540
A momentary change.

577
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,140
A momentary discomfort and then breaking them in.

578
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,260
But, yeah, sure.

579
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,040
A new shoe and...

580
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,560
Yeah, they may be tight and cause blisters for the first few thousand years.

581
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,660
You're talking about your flesh bag.

582
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,880
Your new body.

583
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,020
I'm talking about soul blisters.

584
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,860
You know, we were asking one X-Day Drill,

585
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,120
how are you going to remake your body?

586
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,000
And Rockner, I think, said, I'm going to just stay the way I am

587
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,760
because I've gotten used to it.

588
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,720
Well, you can't, you know, change perfection.

589
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,380
There's one thing to be said about change.

590
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,920
One does not need to make these changes just for the sake of some sort of busy work.

591
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,480
But, you know, once you can redesign your body, why not?

592
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,980
It's a gas. It's a laugh and a half.

593
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,940
What do you think about that old, that thing where the guy said,

594
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,340
if it ain't broke, break it?

595
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,860
Well, that's like some remnant of old hippie philosophy.

596
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,840
I remember a similar mantra about, you know,

597
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,840
if you can't pick it up or eat it, then shit on it.

598
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,340
No, that was the dog's credo.

599
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,140
If you can't eat it or fuck it, piss on it.

600
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:10,180
Well, dogs or humans, it was a disappointingly utilitarian philosophy,

601
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,320
which we hope to transcend by our efforts

602
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,840
because there are other ways that it can be happily used.

603
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,820
Perhaps this is what Rockner said.

604
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,820
I think this is what Rockner was indicating in his rant.

605
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,540
Well, you know, I mean, we have...

606
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,960
I already saw that one.

607
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,240
So many choices.

608
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,360
I mean, look at the way people modify their bodies now.

609
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,940
Think if you had every possible...

610
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,700
I mean, when your imagination is the only limitation for it.

611
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,660
Well, I'm afraid we'll see an awful lot of werewolves and vampires.

612
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,160
Well, that's...

613
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,260
You know, goth kids that really look a little extra vampireish.

614
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,800
Tell me about that.

615
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,120
Yeah, tough guys.

616
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,260
Yes, flouncing, prancing, my little ponies, unicorns,

617
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,740
flibbertigibbet, big-eyed anime princesses.

618
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,580
Have to put up with a lot.

619
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,500
But as we leave Earth and its many solecisms behind,

620
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,540
the original meaning that adhered to these things will become faint

621
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,780
and we can accept them just as another godawful vision,

622
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,200
like all the ones that we'll be forced to confront from nanosecond to nanosecond.

623
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:27,320
And I don't mind, personally, if the Trojan horse of evolution is pleasure.

624
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,440
Bring on the shemale and something incredibly new will happen.

625
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,740
Many of our predecessors had to change and become something different.

626
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,800
Now, actually, the Church of Bob and the teachings of Bob are not exactly...

627
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,660
Well, I mean, it is a religion, but it's more like sci-fi.

628
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,080
You could call it religion-fi, in fact.

629
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:57,360
If there was a re-fi section at the bookstore, that's where our stuff would be in.

630
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,240
Religious fiction, you might say.

631
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,160
I was...

632
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,780
And how is that different from all the rest, somebody?

633
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,960
Unlike most kids, I was not raised in a religious home,

634
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,600
and I don't have a bone to pick with any particular religion.

635
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,100
I was raised on sci-fi instead of the Bible.

636
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,180
Same difference, somebody might say.

637
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,060
And I was raised...

638
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,060


639
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,280
But after a while, I kind of felt like I was grown out of that.

640
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,960
And I read a lot of comparative religion when I was younger.

641
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,240
And then I got into the paranormal and really read up a lot on the paranormal.

642
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,480
But eventually, I switched to history because it was weirder.

643
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,700
If you don't believe me, pick up a history of Russia.

644
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,640
And it's weirder than the weirdest paranormal crap I ever read.

645
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,300
But now, I'm kind of back to science fiction again, like my childhood religion.

646
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:59,760
And because out of all those forms, you know, paranormal books, religious books, and history books,

647
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,720
the sci-fi writers work the hardest to make their bullshit plausible.

648
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,520
No offense, but they really try to, you know...

649
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,400
The hard sci-fi books, the ones with the spaceships on the covers.

650
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,620
There's the other kind that has dragons on the covers, and those are probably really good too,

651
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,100
but those aren't the kind that I like.

652
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,780
I do, friends, understand the pull of the demon-haunted world.

653
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:32,600
The Church of the Subgenius is looking for misfits, disbelievers, or those who will believe anything.

654
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,000
I believe just about everything at some point or another.

655
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,460
Why do you think I'm working for J.R. Bob Dobbs?

656
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,380
But, you know, friends, you kind of...

657
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:47,540
You have to believe that you can get something for nothing.

658
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,300
That's what Bob's promising. For $30.

659
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,660
You can get something for nothing.

660
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:59,360
You have to believe in that magical thing, because, you know,

661
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:05,300
even if something for nothing doesn't come your way, if you had faith that it would,

662
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,540
if you believed that it would, then even if it didn't, you'll think it did.

663
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,720
So what's the difference?

664
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,480
And that right there is the... That's the true miracle of religion.

665
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,420
And people say there's no such thing as magic.

666
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:24,440
You know, and yet they still have faith in such utter bullshit.

667
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,840
To me, that's proof. Proof that miracles still exist.

668
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:36,940
Some people believe in magic, and it works for them.

669
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,960
That's the important thing. It works.

670
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,820
Some people don't believe in magic, and it works even better for them.

671
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,400
Now, and...

672
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,400


673
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,220
And you might say, oh, well, Reverend Stanger, you think she's real smart.

674
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,300
Well, we did call it Church of the Subgenius, friends.

675
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,400
And if you think about it, almost everybody can qualify.

676
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:05,420
Every now and then we run into people who kind of, well, I think I'm not exactly subgenius.

677
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,680
Do you qualify?

678
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,240
That was recorded at Winter Star of 2005.

679
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,380
I've got to come up with something new for Stanger.

680
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,500
I'm going to call it Starwood, which is July 19th through the 24th, also at Brushwood,

681
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,340
but sponsored by Ace of Cleveland.

682
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,560
...the duration of my stay with the aliens.

683
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,220
What? What? What?

684
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,660
...the air was turned off the TV.

685
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,700
Anyway, friends, now back to the... That's the amino acids in the background.

686
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,120
There's no explaining them.

687
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,420
But now back to the 8X Day Drill, actually the 10th drill,

688
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,380
as Dr. Howell and Dr. Drummond and I attempt to kill time

689
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,560
until the world ends along with time.

690
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,860
So we... I don't know when we're going to do the auction,

691
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,240
but I guess that will close off these proceedings,

692
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:07,400
and then each person must retire and consider the last minute preparations

693
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
that must be made for the apocalypse.

694
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,820
Some people want to get a good night's sleep, because it's a long way, you know.

695
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,660
It's a long way.

696
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,400
Some try the staying up all night drinking approach,

697
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,640
which almost always results in passing out at quarter of seven.

698
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,500
Or you can go to X Day and...

699
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,720
You might want to work out, you know, go down to the gym and work out.

700
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,300
Some people feel that the act of getting up...

701
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,080
Eat a lot of vitamin E and oysters.

702
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,320
...and coming down here at 7 o'clock...

703
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:34,700
That's very funny.

704
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,300
...is itself a sign to the X's that we don't have slack,

705
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:43,420
and that in order to show that we're worthy of them, we should stay in bed this time.

706
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,220
But it just seems like a...

707
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,360
That would kind of wreck the tradition.

708
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,000
I mean...

709
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,820
They can get you, even if you're in bed.

710
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,800
You really want to go to Planet X that bad?

711
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,340
Well, yeah, I guess so.

712
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,720
Come, Jones, coming.

713
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,920
You've just got to get up and out of bed for some things.

714
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,920
Like when you're a little shaver, to get up and go downstairs and watch cartoons,

715
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,100
it's necessary to leave your bed.

716
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:14,620
As I've been telling people, every X Day when I get up at 6.30 in the morning,

717
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,720
I have to get my clothes on so early and go work down here.

718
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:24,900
It's horrible having to stumble out of bed and shave and everything, but...

719
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:29,100
I think to myself, well, at least as sacred scribe of the subgenius church,

720
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,240
I only have to do this once a year instead of five times a week.

721
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:33,980
Once a year!

722
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,100
Yes, the pinks have to do it all their lives.

723
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,740
And most people have to do that every fucking day.

724
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:44,440
My own wife, a princess of an outer space fleet, has to get up and go to work every day.

725
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,420
Fair is a river in Africa, or the place where you take your pig and hope to win a prize.

726
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:57,960
But justice and karma are a lie, and God does not care.

727
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,460
And the Tsar is very far away.

728
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,540
In this universe.

729
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:06,080
So it's up to you, my friends, to build your own ship,

730
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,940
and your own faith and slack shall draw those Xs.

731
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,600
So therefore, if they don't show up tomorrow, it's your fault, not mine.

732
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,780
Don't throw shit at me.

733
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,700
I'm getting tired of that.

734
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,640
That's old.

735
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,260
But didn't you practice running this year?

736
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,960
You know, actually, I never make any plans for 7 a.m.

737
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:30,180
except to greet the sex goddesses in power and glory.

738
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:36,820
And I have a list in my head of hurry to Amsterdam and get the Rijksmuseum

739
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,840
before some fuckhead subgenius destroys it.

740
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,000
Get the Grand Canyon, get Monument Valley, some of my favorite places.

741
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,800
The plastic dinosaur warehouse in Las Vegas.

742
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,500
No, that's yours.

743
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,260
Yeah, that's what I'm pointing out.

744
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:49,960
That one is mine.

745
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,900
And I don't want anybody fucking with me.

746
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,320
I don't want to show up at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam

747
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,280
and find one of you motherfuckers beaming up all the cool furniture out of there.

748
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,040
You're welcome to it.

749
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:06,480
Because you will have to back your fucking saucer cart off of my green, daddy-o.

750
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,920
The real problem, it could be that at 7.15 tomorrow,

751
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,980
we'll all be at bitter war with you.

752
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,220
We'll be at bitter war with each other using weapons previously unimaginable.

753
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,080
Yeah, but once we get on the spaceship,

754
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,860
the chair, even the shittiest kitchen chairs there are more comfortable

755
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,860
than anything that's ever been imagined on Earth.

756
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,860
That's true, but you might want to preserve some of your previous identity.

757
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,880
Don't forget your roots as an ape.

758
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,240
The scene is a spaceship, Benson.

759
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,080
You are beautiful woman scientist.

760
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,000
Your spaceship is nearing its destination.

761
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,080
003200, when you finish that...

762
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,960
Now, just let me look.

763
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,960
I hope so.

764
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,960
Me too.

765
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,100
Step out.

766
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,100
What are you doing out there?

767
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,140
Why don't you shut up?

768
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,780
You said, he said.

769
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,020
This can go on forever.

770
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,840
You said, he said.

771
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,120
This can go on forever.

772
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,520
Well, I guess I can if she can.

773
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,780
Okay, thanks a lot.

774
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,420
Oh, some sex goddesses.

775
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,380
No thanks to norelpref.com.

776
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:35,360
And then there's the horrible theory that the sub-genie,

777
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,840
that everything went wrong in the original 1998,

778
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,060
we're stuck in a loop where for all eternity,

779
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,380
it's 7 o'clock in the morning and nothing has happened.

780
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,140
Forever and ever and ever.

781
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,480
From PR news in Washington, I'm considered highly preventable.

782
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,880
President Bush is facing more pressure

783
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,220
to step up USAID to PR's grenade.

784
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,440
On Wall Street 1025,

785
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,580
the Bush administration says it's seriously reviewing allegations

786
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,320
that State Department spokesman Sean McCormick says

787
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,600
that officials say that rocket-propelled protesters

788
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,840
barricaded themselves in the health care system.

789
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,320
Updating figures from Wall Street 1024-12-2681.

790
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,720
President Bush has signed legislation

791
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,560
that would provide trained counselors to help PR News.

792
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,380
Washington.

793
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,460
Now we come to a very important section,

794
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,720
one that everyone dreads, sex.

795
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,400
Yes.

796
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,160
Penis.

797
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,660
Penis.

798
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,340
Teachers should not thrust on their students

799
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,180
rather than pumping in.

800
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,040
However, it is the teacher's duty

801
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,880
to enlighten their students' sexual intercourse.

802
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,220
Through training, they will realize

803
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,780
they are as simple as A, B, C.

804
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,120
Yes.

805
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,320
So let's start with A.

806
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,340
A.

807
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,180
B.

808
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,260
And C.

809
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,240
We may not always succeed in screwing the train of force.

810
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,620
We must always try.

811
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,620
We have to make sure there's some teabagging involved.

812
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,720
Oh, God.

813
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,920
I actually do.

814
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,620
Who was that mysterious uniballer?

815
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:34,880
At X Day, why did we end up doing the most low, frat boy-like pranks?

816
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,900
Because we can't.

817
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,300
Because we're a little boys club is what it comes down to.

818
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:38,680
Exactly.

819
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,340
We have secret passwords.

820
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,220
We have secret handshakes.

821
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,200
You know.

822
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,240
Well, yeah, of course.

823
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,660
I mean, we are just little boys with our little club is what it comes down to.

824
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,740
And, you know, I feel really sorry for some people who are.

825
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,760
I've, you know, Reverend Stang,

826
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,340
one of the things I remember hearing before I got involved with the church was,

827
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,880
join this church and you will get laid.

828
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,220
That's really misleading.

829
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,700
Well, that's how they got me too.

830
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,980
That's really misleading.

831
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,920
People who've not only gotten laid,

832
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,860
they've even ended up getting laid.

833
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:08,860


834
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,400
They've ended up getting married to some of the people that got laid by.

835
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,100
But you're certainly not going to pick anyone up at X Day.

836
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,320
No, not, no, that's not necessarily true.

837
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,260
Jesus and Magdalene met at an X Day.

838
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,060
I met Princess We out there.

839
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,040
Jesus and Magdalene met and fell in love.

840
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,820
Steve Boone and Evie Love met at an X Day.

841
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,560
Both Lilith and Thea.

842
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,120
Let's see, who else?

843
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,700
Oh, the late Eris Pagana and Reverend D.J. Farrell.

844
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,660
See, that's odd.

845
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,780
Because every time I...

846
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,100
You thought I've been there?

847
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,420
I thought you'd talk, Bob.

848
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,420
...got married because of X Day.

849
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,780
See, every time I've been there, which is, you know, four years in a row now,

850
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,560
it's been a huge sausage fest, basically.

851
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,680
I mean, the only women there were there with their boyfriends or husbands.

852
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,780
Yeah, and they're really good looking, aren't they?

853
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,680
Yeah, well, some of them.

854
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,140
Well, how about Jackie, that pretty hot woman, Jackie?

855
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,620
I don't recall.

856
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,680
Actually, Dr. Semester, there were some...

857
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,480
There were some...

858
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,440
I noticed a couple of girls there who didn't seem to be attached.

859
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,740
Anybody that were...

860
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,000
Really?

861
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,080
...about your age.

862
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,860
But I never got a chance to talk to them.

863
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,700
I don't know who they were.

864
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,840
They were probably pagans.

865
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,000
No, no, they were definitely subgeniuses.

866
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,580
One of them was a soft blonde, a big blonde.

867
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,460
Well, next year, why don't you hook us up with them?

868
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,220
A small one that I had no use for.

869
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,040
Give us your women.

870
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,760
But I was...

871
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,940
Bring her to me.

872
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,360
Yeah, hey, that has worked.

873
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,620
Sometimes that works.

874
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,180
Yeah.

875
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,340
That's another thing that works.

876
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,620
You walk up to somebody...

877
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,800
But some cute...

878
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,380
Or you meet this nice couple, and you...

879
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:50,040
Now, this only works if you're older, a little bit older than the boy and girl involved, or tougher.

880
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,020
And you look at the girl and go,

881
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,000
Oh, my God, you're beautiful.

882
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,700
What are you doing with this guy?

883
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,360
And it's such a extreme...

884
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,400
That's what I was saying to the rabbi.

885
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,480
That's what I was saying to Rabbi Jacqueline Hyde when I saw her.

886
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:07,300
It's such a extreme cock block that it usually causes the young man to be tongue-tied and stunned

887
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,760
into an action.

888
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,760
And the young lady, of course, is just thrilled to be told she's beautiful.

889
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,520
Well, did you see Rabbi Jacqueline Hyde dressed as Marilyn Monroe for the deity ball?

890
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,240
My God, she gave...

891
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,040
You know, she got me all like, Whoa, I'm jealous of Prostata now.

892
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,440
Geez.

893
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:33,300
Now, our listening audience does not know this inside gossip that you're referring to.

894
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
They understand possibly Bob and Connie.

895
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,260
And here...

896
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,140
Rare, rare live recording of Bob and Connie.

897
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,960
I've been having a low affair with Jerry Springer.

898
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,960
I've been having a low affair with my dog.

899
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,440
I've been having an affair with a whale.

900
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,180
No problem.

901
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,840
I mean, like, you don't just want to be with someone just because of their penis.

902
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,260
But unfortunately, Bob and Connie weren't there this time.

903
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,160
Nope.

904
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,700
They usually aren't.

905
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,280
No, they...

906
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,760
They have better things to do.

907
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,480
They have better things to do, I guess.

908
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,580
Or that we know of.

909
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,400
Right.

910
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,840
There could always be a Bob in disguise.

911
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,520
There's so much that we don't know.

912
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,440
We all pass out sooner or later out there at X-Day.

913
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:17,720
Maybe.

914
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,560
What happens then?

915
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,280
Maybe.

916
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:23,160
If you pass out in the wrong places, you get teabagged.

917
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,560
I've awakened on the other side of the bed than the one I went to sleep on.

918
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,860
You know, it could be that Bob is actually there in all of us,

919
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,600
and that maybe only the pagans are the ones who can see this with their little magic tricks or whatever,

920
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,760
and that's...

921
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,260
That's why they refer to us as the Bobs,

922
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,300
because they look at us and they just see the Dob's head.

923
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,840
Yeah, they don't call us the Bobbies or the Sub-Demies or anything like that.

924
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,540
They call us the Bobs.

925
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:48,960
Yeah.

926
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:55,540
As if they see a bit of Bob in all of us, the boys and the unavailable...

927
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,460
the girls that are unavailable to you.

928
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,540
As if we're avatars of Bob's self.

929
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,400
Yes, perhaps Bob takes over our bodies.

930
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,400
Like, it's like a body snatcher kind of thing during the time that we're there.

931
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,760
Now, another...

932
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,800
Another reason that you...

933
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,380
that there appears to you to be a dearth of new bio young ladies

934
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,060
is Dr. Philo Drummond is there.

935
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,320
And he's like a magnet, you know?

936
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,280
He's the overman.

937
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,040
He was trained by Bob.

938
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,020
And, uh...

939
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:25,620
Yeah, he is.

940
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,680
Even though he's like 75 years old now,

941
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,760
when dames are around him, they just can't...

942
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,380
He was chasing him out of his trailer.

943
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:34,700
Wow.

944
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,220
He was chasing him out of his trailer.

945
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,360
I was like, get out of here, young ladies.

946
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,500
I need my sleep.

947
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,240
Yeah.

948
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,060
Wow.

949
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:41,720
It's strange.

950
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,660
Dr. Howell, yeah, the same way.

951
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,580
Dr. Howell.

952
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:45,520
All right.

953
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,360
Well, at any rate, I'm just pointing out that it shows.

954
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,220
When you're right with Bob,

955
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,020
you have a certain manna about you,

956
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,860
a certain halo, as it were.

957
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,920
It repels human females, yes, admittedly.

958
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,560
But not mosquitoes and so forth.

959
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,680
Actually, it does repel mosquitoes.

960
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,100
For you.

961
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,440
Sit amongst a swarm of them.

962
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,660
Oh, there's some diet ale eight down there.

963
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,820
Governor Rocknars arrived with the official drink of X Day.

964
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:18,820
Labatt's Blue.

965
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,840
The ale eight.

966
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,880
Yes, of course.

967
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,860
You see, the reason being...

968
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,760
I'm going to cut with this Labatt's Blue.

969
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,140
This ale eight stuff, it seems to be percolating into everything.

970
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,420
It's taste-saturating, everything here at this festival.

971
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:38,660
But if you simply consider the eight to be, instead of vulgar numeral, a lemniscus,

972
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,300
it's a little bit of a

973
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:57,620
But at any rate, the whole idea here is that the eight is the symbol of infinity,

974
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,640
upended, as we intend.

975
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,500
Oh, wait a minute.

976
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:03,380
Does that mean we're going to have to wait forever for X Day to arrive?

977
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,900
An infinite number of X Days?

978
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,540
86-61 was bad enough, man.

979
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:08,740
That's right.

980
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,680
That's worthy of consideration, you know.

981
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,760
We don't just go out there and stand around like cattle.

982
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,560
We're going to have to finesse our transition.

983
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:25,240
It will take every ounce of intellect, concentration, and physical strength that we possess not to muff X Day.

984
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,000
Well, we already know that Reverend Stang is our own Jane Goodall.

985
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,240
Yeah, that's true.

986
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:36,260
Did you see the... I saw the scene magazine, or actually the Free Times last week.

987
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:36,360
Oh, yeah, that's right.

988
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,380
Dorwood made the scene.

989
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,500
The Free Times.

990
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:38,640
The Free Times.

991
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,160
It was on the cover.

992
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:39,580
The Free Times, yeah.

993
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,220
And they were interviewing people that I knew and talking about people.

994
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,100
Actually, I think I might even know the guy who wrote it, but I'm not sure.

995
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,520
I have my suspicions.

996
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,600
He goes to Starwood, or he was there last time.

997
00:46:50,260 --> 00:47:01,920
And he was real impressed with the Ash, the Starwood Ashes business that Princess We sort of inherited from Raphael, the old man of the mountain.

998
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,140
You know, I think I might have known Raphael, too, actually.

999
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,720
I remember seeing him at the first X Day I went to.

1000
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,580
And I never saw him in subsequent years.

1001
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,780
Oh, he's out there still.

1002
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,780
He haunts the woods.

1003
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,620
He's the wild man that lives in the woods.

1004
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,560
I think he actually initiated me into the cult of the bull.

1005
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:20,660
Oh, really?

1006
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,880
Now, Dennis Murphy, of course, is the main cult leader of that.

1007
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:26,860
Uh-huh.

1008
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,720
Who is a different grizzled hipster.

1009
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:31,100
See, because I don't know...

1010
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,940
You know, this Brushwood and the Starwood scene is just chock full of grizzled hipsters.

1011
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:35,420
Yeah.

1012
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,700
I don't know what they do to grizzled hipsters.

1013
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,880
They don't grizz up like that.

1014
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,400
Years and years of practice.

1015
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,760
A lot of cigarettes when they're younger, I think, is what does it.

1016
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:43,800
Mm-hmm.

1017
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,140
Now, what's it like at Starwood compared to X Day?

1018
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,160
It's like way, way larger crowd.

1019
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:50,800
Oh, yeah.

1020
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,120
There's over a thousand people there.

1021
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,480
And it's a completely different thing.

1022
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,020
I mean, most of them are a bit more spiritual-minded.

1023
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,560
Seekers, suckers, nincompoops.

1024
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,440
And people who know how to party like you would not believe.

1025
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,220
It's like an East Coast burning.

1026
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,940
It's about half of them are the kind who hate the Church of the Subgenius

1027
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,800
because we grossly mock their most sacred...

1028
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,940
Well, we laugh in the face of ecstatic happiness,

1029
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,160
which they think should be taken very seriously.

1030
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,300
I think that defeats the whole purpose of it.

1031
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,900
And the other half of Starwood, however, are the ones who like having subgenius there

1032
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:36,720
because we kick off the, shall we say, fundamentalist.

1033
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:37,700
The fundamentalist.

1034
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,140
The neo-pagans.

1035
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,540
Yeah, the fundies.

1036
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:46,940
The neo-pagans and half-pagans and nagaps and all the different strange variations.

1037
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:47,420
I don't know.

1038
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,080
They're weirdos.

1039
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,460
It's a great place for weirdos.

1040
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:49,600
Yeah.

1041
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,920
Cleveland is a reason why I live in Texas.

1042
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,180
Okay, now, comb your hair.

1043
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:57,660
Okay.

1044
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,000
Let's go ahead and take a look at white men.

1045
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,880
Paid for by Cleveland.

1046
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,080
Anyway.

1047
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:17,400
Starwood is a good place to meet creatures of the opposite or otherwise desired sex, although...

1048
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,800
I hate to say this on the air, but, you know, by all accounts that I've heard,

1049
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,200
pagan chicks are easy.

1050
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,760
Well, Dr. LeGum said if you can't get laid at Starwood, you can't get laid.

1051
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,100
Dr. LeGum says a lot, Rottenar.

1052
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:35,100
Like any subgenius preacher or old-timer.

1053
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,960
They say a lot.

1054
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,860
But Starwood is another place that has been a mating ground for...

1055
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,700
Usually, it's subgenius guys and pagan girls, but I've known it to happen the other way around,

1056
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,000
where subgenius gals met some pagan fellas.

1057
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:57,540
Now, the hardcore witchy types, they probably don't use latex condoms.

1058
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,220
They probably insist on, like, the sheep intestine kind, don't they?

1059
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,740
You know, actually, that's...

1060
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,020
I think most of them, it's just lip service, you know?

1061
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:07,600
Uh-huh.

1062
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:07,940
Yeah.

1063
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,520
That's what I figured, too.

1064
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,960
I went through a pagan phase myself when I was 15, and, um...

1065
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:20,120
I don't know, you know, I can't help but look at all the pagans I meet today as, like, an overgrown version of what I was at 15.

1066
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,180
You know?

1067
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,960
Well, you know, but, um...

1068
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:29,800
But you gotta credit them for wanting to believe in forces that they believe control the universe.

1069
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,980
No, I really can't give anybody credit for a desire to believe in stuff that, you know, that they have no evidence of.

1070
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:36,280
Yeah.

1071
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,480
What pagans is that there's no such thing as a pagan.

1072
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:40,880
Well, all...

1073
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,780
Because they're all different.

1074
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:42,820
They're all pagans.

1075
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,040
They're all pagans.

1076
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,860
Christians are pagans, too.

1077
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:46,840
They have...

1078
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,240
There's no single belief system.

1079
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,800
There's a zillion little clusters.

1080
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,440
Oh, yes.

1081
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,500
They all have different gods and...

1082
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,940
It's probably best that it...

1083
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,760
Different fairies.

1084
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,580
That it stay that way.

1085
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,160
Yeah.

1086
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,000
The new age came, and look at it.

1087
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,980
I mean, God, give me a break.

1088
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:05,500
Ugh.

1089
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,160
Ugh.

1090
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,580
Now, that's a place that...

1091
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,980
Would be a great setting for a novel.

1092
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:10,900
What?

1093
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:11,620
Starwood?

1094
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,180
Starwood.

1095
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,880
I'm getting ideas for books to write now.

1096
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,560
Like, ridiculous things happening.

1097
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:17,880
There you go.

1098
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:18,820
That's a great idea.

1099
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,320
I can think of ridiculous pagan drama or something.

1100
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,200
Yeah, yeah.

1101
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:22,600
Beat them.

1102
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,560
Well, you know, there's...

1103
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:28,860
There'll probably be a Tom Clancy novel that takes place at Burning Man, and you can cash in on that.

1104
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,660
First, I want to let you know that portions of the following broadcast may be found objectionable by some members of the listening audience.

1105
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,960
Therefore, WCSB advises...

1106
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,260
Discretion.

1107
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:45,540
And the views and opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of WCSB or Cleveland State University or anybody, for that matter.

1108
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,860
We're just kind of talking nonsense here, so...

1109
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:48,960
Don't believe us.

1110
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,240
Do not believe a word we say.

1111
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,660
Yeah, yeah.

1112
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,400
We just have to say that.

1113
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,860
You know, the people who really get it will still get it.

1114
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,040
Got it?

1115
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,120
Well, get this.

1116
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,620
You're listening to The Hour of Slack, number 1003.

1117
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,700
But that clip was from Radio Synesthesia on WCSB.

1118
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:12,780
WCSB.org on Sunday nights at 10 after The Hour of Slack in Cleveland.

1119
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,420
Yes, Cleveland.

1120
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,400
Dallas be damned.

1121
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,720
Fort Worth is okay.

1122
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:27,700
Friends, that's Post Office Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1123
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,060
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang, and get this, subgenius.com.

1124
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,440
Last year...

1125
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,280
Every man, woman, and child recently wrote...

1126
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:40,780
Dear Cleveland,

1127
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,620
Week moving to Iowa, if you succeed.

1128
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,400
I agree with thousands of Iowans who are too high.

1129
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,680
To see the light of day, you must eliminate obnoxious Cleveland.

1130
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,780
It's a wonder anyone stays there at all.

1131
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,500
Paid for by Cleveland.

1132
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,540
But, friends, even if they did come,

1133
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:06,860
even if the aliens that Bob predicted would come in 1998, which obviously hasn't,

1134
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,420
arrived in our true calendar yet.

1135
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,060
But even if the aliens came and wiped out,

1136
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:18,120
or if the humans screwed up so bad,

1137
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:24,820
that we or somebody wiped out all life on the surface of the planet Earth,

1138
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:28,400
there's still these critters called heat vent worms.

1139
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,080
And friends, this is the kind of thing that gives me hope.

1140
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,360
Others, you may look into a crystal ball and get hope,

1141
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,420
or go and meditate and talk to God, and you're like,

1142
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:37,780
I'm gonna get hope.

1143
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,240
I get hope from reading about the heat vent worms.

1144
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,440
These creatures are so different from the rest of us,

1145
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,800
they're not even really oxygen breed, or they're carbon based,

1146
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,100
but that's about as much as they have in common with us.

1147
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,880
They live in the deepest parts of the ocean,

1148
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,000
where these volcanic vents have been giving off heat and crud and

1149
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,080
poisonous gases for an eternity.

1150
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:06,260
And they've evolved to live off of poisonous gases, no oxygen at all.

1151
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:10,580
They wouldn't do well anywhere else except around a heat vent.

1152
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:15,400
But the important thing is, even if the rest of the planet is totally destroyed,

1153
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:20,260
Bob will still have customers down at the bottom of the ocean.

1154
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:23,920
And evolution will bring those bastards up.

1155
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,400
It will happen.

1156
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:31,460
If everybody, if all our great wonderful consciousness was wiped out, and

1157
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:35,880
even the great apes, and even the monkeys, and even the plankton in the sea were wiped out,

1158
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,400
those damn heat vent worms would be gone.

1159
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:37,640
Give them a chance to live.

1160
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:37,640


1161
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,280
Give them, that might take a while.

1162
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:44,580
Might take a whole billion years to drive mutated ones out onto the land or something.

1163
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,900
But there is progress.

1164
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:54,600
If I can get along with my dad as well as I do these days, friends, there's hope.

1165
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,000
There's progress.

1166
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,940
Alright, I think we're ready.

1167
00:54:59,080 --> 00:54:59,380
Okay.

1168
00:54:59,380 --> 00:54:59,380


1169
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:13,520
And now the end is near We sit and face the final curtain

1170
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:23,620
Bob Dobbs, he'll fuck them good Their pink bright butts will soon be hurting

1171
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:29,360
We've lived a life that's full And I can't wait to see the end of it

1172
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:29,360


1173
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:29,360


1174
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:29,360


1175
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:29,360


1176
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:38,500
We didn't go the pink boy job way But more, much more than this

1177
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:48,800
We did it Bob's way Regrets, we had a few

1178
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:58,840
But then again, too few to mention We'll cleave their world in two

1179
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:09,160
Then blast off to the X dimension Bob's pipe is stiff and hard

1180
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:19,160
And it will smite them here on X day He'll pulverize their little world

1181
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:26,460
And do it Bob's way Oh, there were times

1182
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:33,880
You often knew The pink boys beat us black and blue

1183
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:38,860
But through it all We didn't stop

1184
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:44,400
We took the pills And smoked the frock

1185
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,920
We faced the con And we moved on

1186
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:53,700
And did Bob's way

1187
00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:03,780
Oh, sure, at times we cry But they'll be the ones we'll be abusing

1188
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:08,500
Until the last Pink boy has died

1189
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:18,480
I'm sure we'll find it fucking amusing To think we'll do all that

1190
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,680
From Bangor, Maine Down to Zimbabwe

1191
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:33,480
Oh, no, oh, no, not us We'll do it Bob's way

1192
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:38,380
For what is a sub? What has he got?

1193
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:43,560
If not some slack Then he has not

1194
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:48,900
To say the things He truly feels

1195
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:53,660
And not the words Of those who say

1196
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,860
Bob's way

1197
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:08,200
Bob's way

1198
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:13,340
Thanks, brothers and sisters, for coming to the end of the world and beyond.

1199
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,780
Or kill me.

1200
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,160
Good.

1201
00:58:45,500 --> 00:59:02,140
I'm sorry, Bob's way.

1202
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:09,780
I'm sorry, Bob's way.
