1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
From PR News in Washington, I'm favoring the rich over the poor.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,860
U.N. spokesman Stefan Dujarric is already hyped as debate moves forward.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,720
Secretary General Kofi Annan feels it's productive to do so, especially in New York.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,720
President Bush signed a letter opposing the president's policies.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,500
The letter accuses the president of publishing a picture of Mrs. Bush in yesterday's newspaper.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,060
The president published more photographs today.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:32,620
First Lady Laura Bush said they were forced to leave behind comrades who collapsed from exhaustion and PR news.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,020
This is official information by responsible authorities.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,940
Don't obtain further information and advice.

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,680
Depend on government radio.

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,820
Tune your radio to any local station that is broadcasting.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,740
The Self-Genius Program.

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,520
Follow whatever instructions are given.

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,440
There should be no verse in English.

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,580
After all, English is not the language of love.

16
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,600
No? Listen.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,100
German, German.

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,460
Oh, German.

19
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,420
Listen.

20
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,260
German, German.

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,820
German, German.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000


23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,120
German, German.

24
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,440
I can't live with you.

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,980
Stand by. Stand by.

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,820
Well, what happens next, man? Go on. I'm cold. Tell me. Tell me more about how you...

27
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,600
Well, there was this dinosaur, you see. Yeah, that's it.

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,060
Hey, I saw a cop over there. Maybe we should act a little more cool.

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,560
Okay.

30
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:55,780
Okay.

31
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,200
Move on.

32
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,720
What is it? Some kind of a rally?

33
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,820
I think so. Who's that guy with the funny mustache?

34
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,500
Hey, maybe we can get some spare change if we just, uh...

35
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,500
A spare... spare... spare tire? Uh... spare... uh... change?

36
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,260
Hey, spare ribs, buddy?

37
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,240
Seems to be some kind of... route.

38
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,860
Hey, Mac, how about coughing up five bucks for a bottle of coffee?

39
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,260
Pfft.

40
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,680
Pfft.

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,320
Pfft.

42
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:22,560
Pfft.

43
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,480
Pfft.

44
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:23,620
Pfft.

45
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,580
Didn't seem to work.

46
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,420
Oh, it's a console.

47
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,440
Hey, you just heard the great Paul Martin recreating one of the banjo favorites of the year.

48
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,460
Friends, welcome to, um, the, uh, whatever this is, uh, talk.

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,200
Oh, that's right, I had a subject matter.

50
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:54,160
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang, and I was supposed to talk about, uh, what was the... what's left of the right side of Bob's brain.

51
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:54,700
Yeah.

52
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,420
And let's just get this over with real quick.

53
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,460
He's... the... the left side of... in the left side of his brain, nothing is right.

54
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,040
And on the right side of his brain, there's nothing left.

55
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,460
So, now we can all go to dinner!

56
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:16,100
Uh, I was, uh, kind of horrified to see a bunch of people praising Bob in the old-fashioned Bob way.

57
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,220
Somebody, you know, just chanting his name. That was enough for me at one time.

58
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,100
I've... I've been doing this for twenty years.

59
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,420
And it's gotten to the point now where we've had to deal with subgenius kooks.

60
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,380
Subgenius fundamentalists.

61
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:31,940
Oh, wow.

62
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,780
Imagine that.

63
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:42,280
And, uh, so we've kind of... I... I... it's hard for me to sometimes get pumped up in the old-fashioned, back-to-the-panflet way,

64
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,340
because I'm in a preventative mode now.

65
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,380
It's like we sold him this, uh... we sold him the insanity.

66
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,160
We sold him the mental illness.

67
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,040
And now we're trying to sell him the cure, basically.

68
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,640
So, uh, I mean, I don't want to be heard promoting sanity, okay?

69
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,460
But there... it came a point where we had to draw a line.

70
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,660
Sort of. We never did draw the... it's a very blurry line.

71
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,760
Friends, uh, I guess I... I don't recognize everybody in here.

72
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,680
And that's real good. That means I'm not preaching to the choir.

73
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,040
And they... none of whom could sing very well in the first place.

74
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,980
They'd be like,

75
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:30,860


76
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,580
You're not interesting anymore, boys.

77
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,500
Well, so, the... the... the tutorial...

78
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,140
That's, like, very different.

79
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,500
every time you see

80
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:22,860
yes if you're not getting enough fibrous mass in your diet for

81
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,160
For digestive purposes, you'll want to eat new oats and groats, a subgenius cereal.

82
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,640
It's made out of 100% natural rock juice, tree bark, and stillborn bean sprouts.

83
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,000
It's the vegetable cereal that Bob Dobbs himself attempts to eat,

84
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,820
but he breaks his teeth on its rocky consistency every morning.

85
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,640
And there's a free plastic dinosaur in every package.

86
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,440
So get oats and groats, or get lost.

87
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm trying to get into the country.

88
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,620
The president of Uzbekistan clearly had no idea he was creating PR News.

89
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,300
PR's bad. PR's bad.

90
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,480
The military says conspiracy theorists have long suggested a second gay sex party near the Syrian border.

91
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:13,020
Also in Baghdad today, a top Iraqi foreign ministry official was assassinated by PR News, Washington.

92
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,440
Yeah, by Fernanda Nandeli-Murr.

93
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,420
Their friend says it was mostly...

94
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,580
Most of our opening and other holes accept what came from Puzzling Evidence Show,

95
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,300
with Dr. Howell, Doug Wellman, Gary Gabrogfan, Lies, and Bob Nelson.

96
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,520
And this show, number 997, has some ranting from Winterstar.

97
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,660
But first, and now, the great groovy Neptune.

98
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,540
Watch the crowd on TV.

99
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,900
Watch the crowd on TV.

100
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,400
Watch the crowd on TV.

101
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,820
Watch the crowd on TV.

102
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,980
Watch Bob on TV.

103
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,120
Watch Bob on TV.

104
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,000
On TV.

105
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,440
Head for the mountains.

106
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,580
Where the beer flows in the fountain, boys.

107
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,460
Drunk like a bum, counting up his counts.

108
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,380
I'm so astounded in the flip of things.

109
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,560
A effect of a trip you rigged, whatever the set.

110
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,980
It's dissection of the insect intellect, boy.

111
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,340
I tell ya.

112
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,860
Bug brain go-bots.

113
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,980
While the animals they drop one after another, that X marks the spot.

114
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,000
Boys, I tell ya.

115
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,600
Them brains infected with their master's blood.

116
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,960
Get out of my face!

117
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
That blocker'll shut you up gentle and bent and

118
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,600
do next to nothing with up to the

119
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:51,600


120
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,780
If some get to say, you're from the Straw Hats!

121
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:56,780


122
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:07,380
in, Fred's Base, Dupont that's the H2O unit for life.

123
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:17,840
Kid must be stifled to overcome a every smoke, every wrecked guard, haven't you?

124
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:17,840


125
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,420
I've had my hands flashed across the roof.

126
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,140
Come on, child.

127
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,400
You can take my hand.

128
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,220
Blessed is the day you give up your own control

129
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,840
over your own lame brain.

130
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,520
Do you love the queen of pussies?

131
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Pretending you know what the game is,

132
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,700
but who really deals the cards?

133
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,740
You as long as me.

134
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,820
We're both retards.

135
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,080
Everyone, I believe,

136
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,700
I used to believe that everyone thought

137
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,260
they were really secretly down,

138
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,920
deep down inside I used to believe

139
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,480
everybody thinks they're different and weird and special.

140
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,120
I was wrong.

141
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,160
I lost a lot of money under that assumption,

142
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,860
overestimating the intelligence of the American public.

143
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,380
But I do think that everybody,

144
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,260
pretty much everybody,

145
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,100
thinks that they're a little smarter than the next guy.

146
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,300
And dumbasses know they are.

147
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,120
They are sure that,

148
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,820
and I so frequently think that I must be a dumbass,

149
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,840
breaking my toe chewing gum and walking and stuff like that.

150
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,140
It happens that so often I go,

151
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,240
God, what a dumbass.

152
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,200
That itself gives me the tiny vestige of hope

153
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,400
that maybe, maybe I might actually be a little smarter

154
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,820
than most people after all,

155
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,060
just because I was aware that I was a dumbass.

156
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,420
Or rather, more correctly,

157
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,380
I sometimes think, well, maybe I have at least half a brain.

158
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,680
And it turns out what I ended up having

159
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,440
was more like half a brain cell.

160
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,160
Luckily, my wife has the other half.

161
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,940
So we've still, as long as we're together, we can function.

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,120
But, you know, Einstein, people like Einstein, Lincoln, Mark Twain,

163
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,620
undoubtedly smart guys,

164
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,860
probably thought that they themselves were dumbasses,

165
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,800
and they were right,

166
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,400
even though they were right.

167
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,840
Even though we know they were a little smarter than most people,

168
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,840
because friends, we are, all of us, dumbasses.

169
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,100
Truly, none of us really, really knows for sure

170
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,040
what's really going on.

171
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,300
And everything really is vanity.

172
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,260
And what the bleep do we know?

173
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,220
Friends, it all is, in fact, vanity.

174
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,520
And that said, all dumbasses are not created equal.

175
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,480
And some are dumber than others.

176
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,400
It is true.

177
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,080
And generally, the dumber they are,

178
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,620
the more certain they are that they're right,

179
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,240
that they're a little smarter than most people.

180
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:08,200
That's that incredible confidence that the true dumbass has,

181
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,680
that he has quit being a dumbass.

182
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,600
And they sometimes have followers.

183
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,700
Because there's always going to be lots of,

184
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,100
little private assholes looking for a major asshole

185
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,360
who'll tell them what to do and boss them around.

186
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,280
And so many people need a guru or a teacher or a master,

187
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,800
basically a Mac philosophy that they can follow.

188
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,120
That some other guy's made up rule book that worked for his life,

189
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,600
because maybe his life's better.

190
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,080
Isn't that sad?

191
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,260
And if so, the follower types just have to hope that their leader

192
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,620
is not itself another follower.

193
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,680
Because there's a long line of guys,

194
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,340
dumbasses teaching each other how to rook lesser dumbasses.

195
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,840
Because you end up being a follower follower.

196
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,880
Or in the subgenius world, we call them Bobbies.

197
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,260
I understand that out at Brushwood,

198
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,180
we have a festival out there ourselves every year.

199
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,840
Well, this will be the last one,

200
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,360
because the world will end this time.

201
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,740
But we have this end of the world festival

202
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,880
at Brushwood, and they call us the Bobs out there,

203
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,840
the staff at Brushwood.

204
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,260
They don't call us Bobbies, which is nice,

205
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,140
because that's an insult.

206
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,320
They call us the Bobs.

207
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,600
No, that's, you know,

208
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,900
they don't call the Moonies the Moons.

209
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,840
This is Margie Laughlin, and Margie,

210
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,100
you were in the church, the state church, for a while.

211
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,780
What was your first contact like?

212
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,680
They were very friendly, and they kept contacts up.

213
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,120
They were always trying to call me,

214
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,760
and what they call lovebombs,

215
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,620
they send me little letters and things like that.

216
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,580
And they just, they gained my trust as friends,

217
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,040
and then they started slowly indoctrinating me through that.

218
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,300
And how did you get out?

219
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,520
My parents rescued me off of the Iowa City campus,

220
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,120
and I was deprogrammed.

221
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,520
I'm free, running through the pastures

222
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,460
and through the cornfields, through the cornfields.

223
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,580
His life was devoted to the Reverend Happy Watkins,

224
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,100
who he believed was the most important person

225
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,400
to the Messiah.

226
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,100
Church and state church.

227
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,660
Cults in the United States.

228
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,680
Programmed twice.

229
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,120
Church and state church.

230
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,020
Cult seminar.

231
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,480
Lovebombing.

232
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,540
Brainwashing.

233
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,660
Hootenannies and Stove Downs.

234
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,720
I wish I was dead.

235
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,840
Brainwashing.

236
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,300
Information overload.

237
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,420
Programmers.

238
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,740
Steve became a robot.

239
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,000
In a monotonous way.

240
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,120
Steve's real concern was to please the Reverend Happy Watkins.

241
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,980
Programming ensued, and months and months of

242
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,060
Reverend Happy Watkins.

243
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:41,720
Wasted.

244
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,900
A lot of the friends that I met in the cult

245
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,080
realized how crazy the whole thing was.

246
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,240
A lot of things that happened to me in the cult,

247
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,300
a lot of the friends that I met in the cult,

248
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,680
will come back to me and have a desire to want to run back there.

249
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,100
So I just have to run back there.

250
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:08,380
I said, Bob, he's a pilot drone of mine.

251
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh yeah.

252
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,560
All the gray star and radar.

253
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,000
Mom and pop.

254
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,960
He pipped and popped.

255
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,720
And, uh, tipped and tap.

256
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,820
I said, uh, Bob.

257
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:28,320
I said, Bob, he's a pilot drone of mine.

258
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,500
I sees a civic, deified dad.

259
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,460
A level-eyed tut-tut.

260
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,100
A giga-gagaboot up.

261
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,060
A pole of a bug.

262
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,300
I said, Bob.

263
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,460
I said, Bob.

264
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:43,540
Oh yeah.

265
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:43,540


266
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:43,540


267
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:43,540

273
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:43,540


274
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:43,540


275
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:43,540


276
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:43,540


277
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:43,540

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:43,540


279
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:43,540


280
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,280
Dog is a palindrome mind

281
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,340
Long with race car and radar

282
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,400
Mom and pop

283
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,420
And hip and pat

284
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,200
And tickle and tat

285
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,080
I said I'm Bob

286
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,920
Do geese see God?

287
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,580
Murder for a jar of red rum

288
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,140
Some men interpret nine memos

289
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,180
Never honor Eve

290
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,400
Don't gnaw, don't gnaw

291
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,940
Dogma, I am God

292
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,320
Rats live on no evil star

293
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,200
Was it Elliot's toilet I saw?

294
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,940
No trace, not one carbon

295
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,460
Go hang a salami

296
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,220
I'm a lasagna hog

297
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,640
I dissent

298
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,100
Go deliver a dare vile dog

All craft your friends

316
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,300
As long as they play

317
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,460
Was that weird song Bob is a palindrome of mine?

318
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,960
And now, Lemurian PR News.

319
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,500
From PR News in Washington, I'm not good enough.

320
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,480
President Bush says he expects to be held without foreign interference.

321
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,560
Mr. Bush left 16 people dead and scores of others injured.

322
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,320
Mr. Bush said beans is like a foreign clean-burning alternative fuel.

323

On Wall Street today, 10-2-10-7-7-7.

324
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,400
Police are investigating another PR news discovered in a grave in Washington.

325
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,860
I'm a woman, so I have chafing.

326
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,040
Introducing new chafing from the makers of chafing.

327
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,780
See this unique delicate skin?

328
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,500
New fast-acting itch spray. It even sprays down.

329
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,320
Diminish our intelligence. Diminish our intelligence.

330
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,760
Imperialism in this country.

331
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,740
We're gonna try to control what our people read and say and think.

332
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,520
Transfer.

333
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,500
Transform.

334
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,660
The United States FBI from the communists.

335
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,100
To build a peaceful world.

336
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,720
We know that the greatest threat to us.

337
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,400
Is a man keeping you down.

338
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,240
Universally despised.

339
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,620
Is a man keeping you down.

340
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,280
Maybe I'm overly naive.

341
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,920
Is a man keeping you down.

342
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,040
In this country.

343
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,700
The government didn't know I was working for the government.

344
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,840
In this country.

345
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,020
Gestapo secret police.

346
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,680
Is a man keeping you down.

347
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,060
Now I'm gonna tell you why.

348
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,380
How we're not gonna fight.

349
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,060
Well I will not be held down by the man.

350
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,400
Okay? I will not.

351
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:46,960
Fine.

352
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,080
The man wants to pay me $5.50 an hour.

353
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,040
He deserves to get ripped off.

354
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,320
Okay? Same way I am.

355
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,700
He rips me off. I rip him off.

356
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,900
It's a matter of...

357
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,700
It's maintaining self-respect.

358
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,460
I want to talk to you again.

359
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,320
You guys have been looking for a war, haven't you?

360
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,560
That's right, Rick. That's why we're starting.

361
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,100
You may have started, Joe, but we'll finish it.

362
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,560
So you're a psychiatric resident?

363
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,060
Yes.

364
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,680
What does that mean exactly?

365
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,500
I witness the horrors of humanity.

366
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,020
Wow. I hear ya.

367
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,840
You are the trip...

368
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,640
What are you?

369
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,100
A synthetic approximation of a socially interactive human.

370
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,360
Okay. While you wait, do you want to learn some business?

371
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,080
For the moment, I am just a man.

372
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,300
I am a machine.

373
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,100
And yet, someday, I may be fully alive and aware.

374
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,480
Look, I tried to contact God myself this afternoon.

375
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,620
He had no comment.

376
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:57,020
CNN doesn't always get it right, but it goes pretty well if you watch it on Fox.

377
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,460
You will stand up with me and tell him to shut up.

378
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,840
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

379
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,260
I just... I think it's odd when people say,

380
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,340
God talked to me and God made this...

381
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,020
Give up the death penalty.

382
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,480
The arrogance of Ann.

383
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,600
Amazing here. The arrogance of Ann.

384
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,660
I actually like Ann.

385
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,060
An instinctive revulsion.

386
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,840
Tucker, you're way out to lunch on this one, my friend.

387
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,160
Rule over one night.

388
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,560
Stomp on a bush doll.

389
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,300
The Supreme Court labored forth and came.

390
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,820
Stomp on a bush doll.

391
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,840
The abortion... the... the...

392
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,820
A bush doll.

393
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,320
The abortion... the... the... biggest bush doll.

394
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,940
Ann has become trouble recently.

395
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,700
It shows a very weak ego, in my opinion.

396
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,160
I think if you're as strong as you say you are, anything I've got to say can't hurt you.

397
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,580
Stop killing each other and take care of yourself.

398
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,800
Better care of the poor. Two issues not exactly at the top of the Bush agenda.

399
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,740
The courts are killing us.

400
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,620
Arrogant.

401
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,220
The United States of America.

402
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,860
I believe that the Roman Catholic Church is a false church.

403
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,520
Arrogant.

404
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,440
It teaches a false gospel and the Pope himself holds a false and unbiblical office.

405
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:56,980
Arrogant.

406
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,520
He's a Southern Baptist for pizza.

407
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,840
Do you have a First Amendment right?

408
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,660
Would have met my derriere.

409
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,000
There's no right to be a clown.

410
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,460
Could whack your child.

411
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,440
Whack your child.

412
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,940
We need more teachers beating people about the face and head.

413
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,580
Ridiculing.

414
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,060
Laughing.

415
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,840
Incredibly impossible.

416
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,520
Come.

417
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,120
Come.

418
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:14,800
Come.

419
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,400
Come.

420
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:15,580
Come.

421
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,520
Who's a Boy Scout?

422
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,440
How messed up is America today?

423
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,100
Gave Boy Scouts into the Boy Scouts.

424
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,300
That won't be a problem for me.

425
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,400
That won't be a problem for me.

426
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,700
Gave.

427
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,000
Force.

428
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,380
Force.

429
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:23,680
Force.

430
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:23,940
Force.

431
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,260
Gave.

432
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:24,640
Gave.

433
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:24,920
Gave.

434
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,380
Force.

435
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:25,820
Force.

436
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,260
Um, I'm a little hurt.

437
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,140
Stupid and evil.

438
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:28,820
Killing.

439
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,300
Lying.

440
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:29,860
Adultery.

441
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,160
That's ridiculous.

442
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:30,780
Killing.

443
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,300
Lying.

444
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:31,840
Adultery.

445
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,200
That's ridiculous.

446
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,920
George Bush is an empty vessel, an empty suit.

447
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,340
He's, you know, the brain of Karl Rove, or he's Madeline Albright.

448
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,120
Madeline Albright.

449
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:40,880
Madeline Albright.

450
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,260
Madeline Albright.

451
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:41,520
Madeline Albright.

452
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:41,920
Madeline Albright.

453
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,100
Madeline Albright.

454
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,020
Cartoon.

455
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:43,920
Cartoon.

456
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,460
Cartoon.

457
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:44,540
Attack.

458
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:44,940
Attack.

459
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,020
Attack.

460
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,780
Dick Cartoon.

461
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,020
Dick Cartoon.

462
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,120
Dick Cartoon.

463
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,340
Dick Cartoon.

464
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,380
My feet are the size of the Atlantic Ocean and my head is the size of a tiny little ant.

465
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
Lovefest with conservatives.

466
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,420
This thing.

467
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,180
It was just in the gutter.

468
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,000
Some of these babes, I'm telling you, they're like the sexual harassment crowd.

469
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,920
They're out there protesting what they actually wish would happen to them.

470
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Lovefest with conservatives.

471
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,360
Thanks to gay liberation.

472
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:04,900
Lovefest with conservatives.

473
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,760
Thanks to gay liberation.

474
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,880
Lovefest with conservatives.

475
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,240
Get out of my face.

476
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,480
Get out of my face.

477
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,460
I wish we lived in the day where you could challenge a person to a duel.

478
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,480
It was dumb.

479
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,720
Beat that dog to death.

480
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,240
I would love you to come tonight.

481
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,440
You think our network's getting too conservative?

482
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:34,660
I'm just a little fellow but y'all always want to be a cowboy sticking close to the

483
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:34,900
man.

484
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:34,900


485
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,460
I want to be a cowboy, a Christian cowboy.

486
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:46,000
I want to have a round up in the gospel story town and get a lot of people in the Holy Ghost

487
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,600
Corral.

488
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,140
I'll be a cowboy, a Christian cowboy.

489
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,320
I'll work for Jesus all my days.

490
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:04,880
And on the prairie or in the city, I'll help him round up the people.

491
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:04,880


492
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:04,880


493
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:04,880


494
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:04,880


495
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,180
I can do it all.

496
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,320
I love the priest.

497
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,100
I love theons.

498
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,160
I don't have money to offer him.

499
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,520
I'm very smart.

500
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,580
But I can love my Jesus and I know that he can still love me.

501
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:26,420
And cuz I know all I've got to do is satisfy my Lord and be the butthole of the Christian

502
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:26,960
boy.

503
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,140
And all the bone I最想要 Become is according to the 예수

504
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,180
cke Ghiosso.

505
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,300
Lord I'll be a cowboy, a Christian cowboy.

506
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:38,440
I'll work for Jesus all my days.

507
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,500
And on the prairie or in the city,

508
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,940
I'll help him round up all the strays.

509
00:22:51,620 --> 00:23:02,160
All the strays.

510
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,520
Tip it and sip it.

511
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,320
Man-sized swallows.

512
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,920
Norman only had one hand.

513
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,760
He was used to all the jokes about pitching in and giving a hand.

514
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,740
It was cold, bitter cold, as he stood selling his papers.

515
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,080
Oh, hoping to earn enough.

516
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,180
To buy his mom an expensive gift.

517
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,460
The other paper sellers didn't come out that day, so business was great.

518
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,320
Usually he held the papers under one arm and made change with his one hand.

519
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,440
Business rush and the excitement of making the money escaped Norman's young mind.

520
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,180
He overdid it.

521
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,060
His only good hand was frostbitten.

522
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,700
Hospital, amputation.

523
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,980
Now Norman has no hands.

524
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,900
He loved his mother.

525
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,500
He loved his mother so much.

526
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,940
Loving is leaving yourself and reaching out to others with or without hands.

527
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,720
Father Harry, God Squad.

528
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:51,420
A whole slew there, friends, from Alt Binary Slack of Norrell Preff cut-ups.

529
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:56,880
And you can get a lot more of his stuff from HeavyConfetti.com.

530
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:02,140
And now another slew, but this time of Le Cref.

531
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,140


532
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,140


533
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,560
Mirror.

534
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,400
1, 3, 0, 1, 3.

535
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,500
Vital, important, specific.

536
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,020
The protection of vital, duplicate business records is always important.

537
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:13,940
Essential, essential.

538
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,420
In case of a nuclear attack, the protection of records is essential.

539
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:17,960
Specific.

540
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,220
If this country is to carry on its important economy, duplicate.

541
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,180
Maintain our important way of life.

542
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,760
Special, vital, important business.

543
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
Business, vital business, business and industry.

544
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,820
Civil defense.

545
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,000
Specially designed nuclear industrial disasters.

546
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:31,740
Washington.

547
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,340
1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0.

548
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,120
Mirror.

549
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,260
1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0.

550
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,520
From PR News in Washington.

551
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,660
I'm protesting against the U.S. presence in Washington.

552
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:48,760
The U.S. military says rival ethnic groups may violate Saddam's prisoners in Iraq.

553
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:54,960
Today, large Shiites took to the streets after several restrictions on embryonic stem cell research.

554
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,340
Sunnis shut down their religious leaders.

555
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,420
On Wall Street, 10-466-1241.

556
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,700
PR's bad.

557
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,940
The president said he's not opposed to PR News.

558
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:10,340
President Bush said today that he would veto PR News in Washington.

559
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,720
Nothing was more important than my sexual side effects.

560
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,120
And I have to say it's nice that there's sexual side effects.

561
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,000
Wellbutrin XL with sexual side effects.

562
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,560
It feels great to enjoy sexual side effects.

563
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,820
Anyone taking Wellbutrin XL should have severe, serious liver or kidney problems.

564
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,440
Wellbutrin XL is for seizures, so use if you're eating sedatives.

565
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,260
Anyone taking Wellbutrin XL should have unusual changes in mood or behavior or thoughts of suicide.

566
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,920
Wellbutrin XL should increase these thoughts or behaviors in children and teens.

567
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,640
It works for sexual side effects.

568
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,040
Ask your doctor about sexual side effects.

569
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,040
I can't kiss your mouth or be in your house.

570
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,900
I can't watch you go to work.

571
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,220
I can't feed your cat.

572
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,500
I can't look at that.

573
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,120
I can't help being a jerk.

574
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,080
They won't let me near you.

575
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,200
They make me behave.

576
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,860
I can't make them fear you.

577
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,520
I guess all I can do is haunt you, babe.

578
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,180
I can't get even or even get close.

579
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,980
I can't seem to catch a break.

580
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,500
I can't get lucky or use one of those things that you once threw my way.

581
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,540
I can't get over how you can control such a large agency.

582
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,720
They make me back off.

583
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,940
They make me hurt.

584
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,020
I can't get them out of my way.

585
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,500
I guess all I can do is haunt you, babe.

586
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,900
I'm out of your face but not out of your life.

587
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,460
I'm just not that easy.

588
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,480
Maybe my real world access is cut off.

589
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:27,480


590
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:27,480


591
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:27,480


592
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:27,480


593
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,700
And maybe the telephone.

594
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:35,060
And even a break off of internet contact can keep me from out of your dreams.

595
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,520
Guess all I can do is haunt you, babe.

596
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,800
I guess all I can do is haunt you.

597
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
Haunt You.

598
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,420
That was by Just John.

599
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,200
Reverend Just John.

600
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,980
From his CD called The Ayatollah of Understatement.

601
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,040
You can get more about that from just-john.com.

602
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,980
And now, Norelle.

603
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,340
Ancient legend.

604
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:06,620
Empty.

605
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,020
From the heavens.

606
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,680
Getting goosebumps, man.

607
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,140
Apocalyptic legends.

608
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,100
It was like, it was like.

609
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,940
Two concepts.

610
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,680
My two best friends.

611
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,020
Prayed in desperation to the inescapable reality.

612
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,480
Space was deemed to be empty.

613
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,620
Archaeologists tell us.

614
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,800
Clean your room.

615
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,020
Yeah, I remember the first time.

616
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,620
We were separate but I was at home.

617
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,300
Yo, yo.

618
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,060
You'll see only what your little mind can allow.

619
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,820
And there is a theory.

620
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Very, very early.

621
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,080
Now.

622
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,500
Up and down the.

623
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,740
Weighing it annually.

624
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,980
My sister called me.

625
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,520
She was like, turn the radio on, turn the radio on.

626
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:40,980
So we like.

627
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,720
You'll lose your little mind.

628
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,000
Turn the radio on.

629
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,020
Now.

630
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:45,860
Empty.

631
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,040
Aristotle.

632
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,680
He was responsible for.

633
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,760
The more superstitious space rocks.

634
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,280
He could even throw rocks from heaven.

635
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,840
Experts dismissed him.

636
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,940
It is surprising.

637
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,760
At roughly the same time.

638
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,520
In fact.

639
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:58,940
It was like.

640
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,240
It was like.

641
00:29:59,280 --> 00:29:59,980
I was driving.

642
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,580
History in the process.

643
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,800
Do do do do do.

644
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,400
So it's been a pretty amazing year for us.

645
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,400
Had some trouble.

646
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,620
Had some trouble.

647
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,000
I want more.

648
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,580
And it came on.

649
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,840
And then recovered.

650
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,820
Superstition to science.

651
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,880
This pill will work.

652
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,600
Scholars still weren't convinced.

653
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,620
Common folk already knew.

654
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,920
I just want to say.

655
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,020
Don't accept the word of ordinary people.

656
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,780
Yo, yo.

657
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:25,920
You're not going to get it.

658
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:25,920


659
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:25,920


660
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:25,920


661
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:25,920


662
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:25,920


663
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:25,920


664
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,360
Like.

665
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,340
Happy Parents.

666
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:29,920
Happily.

667
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,280
Stay.

668
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,720
Happy family.

669
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:42,800
Successfully.

670
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,140
整ента.

671
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,520
Thank you have a good holiday.

672
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:54,520


673
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,860
My next holiday is Saturday.

674
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:47,160
Your

675
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:55,060
Close muffles.

676
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:09,620
being. The little man, the little subgenius is telling the big subgenius what to do. The

677
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:21,320
majority, which is the subgenius, is oppressed by the minority of normals. The 54% cluster

678
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:43,560
known as women are put down by the 46% majority of men. The pink man is just a splinter off

679
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:50,100
the mighty multicolored tree of mortals on this mud ball Mars.

680
00:31:51,600 --> 00:32:05,640
Yet they somehow are holding all the cards. Most of us don't have much money, and yet

681
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:20,960
money tells most of us what to do. This is a topsy-turvy world. Whole shift. Climate

682
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,300
change.

683
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:42,220
Why, Bob, why? And Bob replied, this planet is Mars. Part four. This planet is Mars. Your

684
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:50,800
duty as a Martian. The first duty of the Martian subgenius.

685
00:32:51,320 --> 00:33:10,300
Is to disobey. Whether this is 1998, 1957, or 2004, you can be sure that the subgeniuses

686
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:21,300
in their gray vehicles are driving the roads and back alleys of this, the former Martian

687
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,640
subgenius.

688
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:32,520
The United States. Searching for the proper vehicle to release this most precious of information.

689
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:49,120
The pearl of great price. The very kidney stone of wisdom. This planet is Mars. If this

690
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,300
planet is where it was supposed to be, then it is not. It is not. It is not. It is not.

691
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:51,300


692
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,980
It is not.

693
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,320
Why does the sun cause cancer?

694
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,180
Why does the sun cause cancer?

695
00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:02,720
Life evolved for the most part on this planet, except for what was seeded by our extraterrestrial

696
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,100
handlers.

697
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:15,660
But the sun, the very sun itself, is killing off not just the humans, but we half-breeds,

698
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:20,780
half-Yeti humans, and even full-bred Yetis.

699
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,300
Why does the sun cause cancer?

700
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,300


701
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,300


702
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:28,880
Because the full-bred Yetis are often confined to the coldest of climates. The North Pole,

703
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:39,580
the South Pole, the mountains of Tibet, Lemuria, the frozen depths, the very bottom of the

704
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:45,360
ocean. The Atlantean purebred Yetis survive, but just barely.

705
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,160
But you see, if you take everything that's here and move it to the fourth planet, and

706
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,320
the fourth planet, move that all to here, it's all good.

707
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,940
We're spending more than a full week in the car, going nowhere. Everyone's loving it.

708
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,900
Going nowhere. Hoping. Going nowhere. The supersized hole is so jammed. Fast food. Researchers

709
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,220
report clogged arteries.

710
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,780
There's probably nothing more painful.

711
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,580
It's still unclear.

712
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,140
There's no magic wand.

713
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,260
A fat tax.

714
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,280
Five-pronged approach to confront congestion, specifically targeted toward

715
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,520
Oh, you have a little faith. Look how big that is.

716
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,040
Turn up the stereo and

717
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,920
Think I can make it in between there? Nope.

718
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,520
Ten minutes away.

719
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,380
Negligent homicide. Killing the women.

720
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,320
Solemn commemoration services and street parties.

721
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,500
Yee-haw!

722
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,860
President George Bush paid tribute to Nazi Germany, and scenes of balloons being let go into the air.

723
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,000
Yee-haw!

724
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:46,780
Jack Chiro-ro-ro-rock reviewed for the Nazi's concentration camp victim.

725
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,420
Prince Charles, this stray dog.

726
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,140
Audioswap.

727
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,120
How to breed aggressive loud rock music and, uh, barbed wire.

728
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,660
It's time to bust a tower.

729
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,700
The supersized hole.

730
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,460
Actress.

731
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,720
Ice, ice, ice, ice, I don't have a lot of answers.

732
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,420
War battered the so-so-so-so-so-so-cress.

733
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,740
Going nowhere.

734
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,320
Rockin' away. Rockin' away. Rockin' away. Rockin' away.

735
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,680
Come on.

736
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,540
There's something down here.

737
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,380
Uh, I believe he's got his hand up.

738
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:15,740
Here.

739
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:20,260
I'm not here to play, Bob.

740
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,320
I'm here to kill Bob.

741
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,480
No, no, that's already been done here.

742
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,000
Okay.

743
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,400
How do you like that, huh?

744
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,880
Hey, I like that.

745
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,400
I'm getting space sick.

746
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,080
Space sick. Try some slow-mo.

747
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,640
Don't open that sludge up here.

748
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,260
Okay, why?

749
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,260
Whoa!

750
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,760
See, as soon as you say it, it breaks.

751
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,600
Yeah, look at that. Those little green lights come on all up and down.

752
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,620
Yeah, they have to call a human.

753
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:43,920
Live.

754
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,480
But that's not legal, of course.

755
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:52,480
Oh, it's not. It's not legal for us to broadcast you, but it's legal for you to say that's broadcast up.

756
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:52,920
Oh, yeah?

757
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:53,360
Yeah.

758
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:53,760
Are you talking?

759
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,440
Yeah.

760
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,580
A pocket lawyer, too.

761
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,480
Yeah, really. And I come with a watch.

762
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,840
Turned into a ball and fell into the instruments. Now we're falling into the sun.

763
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,700
Captain, stop the rocket!

764
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,500
It helps if you sit on your hands and quiet.

765
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,020
The sun sure seems to slow down.

766
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,640
But back on Earth, time is moving at what would seem to us an incredibly accelerated pace.

767
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,040
Whole centuries are going by.

768
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,820
Well, let me ask you this. If I had to go ahead and tell my family what these people are...

769
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,300
Sure.

770
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:27,180
Rich human candy bones. Yes, they tear the bones right out of those people and they coat them in sugar and serve them up to you every Halloween night.

771
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:27,460
Yeah.

772
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,040
It'll suck a marrow right out of you.

773
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,020
That's true. You sure will. And if they won't, I will.

774
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,360
And that's fact. Right here, on the air of the Theater of Mystery and Darkness.

775
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,740
That's true. And one of our scary callers now is inviting himself to be on the show.

776
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,900
He's practically asking for it, isn't he, Doctor?

777
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,640
Okay. Human, come in.

778
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,140
And as the rocket is broadcast back to the...

779
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,840
Hello? Hello?

780
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,760
...the Mobius Rex turns it into code.

781
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,380
I don't know. Who's this?

782
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:52,700
Never mind.

783
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,380
Early, early subgenius KPF.

784
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,360
A show there with puzzling evidence, lies, Gary Gabrog friend Bob Nelson, and Doctor Howland.

785
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,760
Before that and now, now new Norell Pref.

786
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,300
John Williams delivers political uncertainty.

787
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,420
I can't get no...

788
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,100
...out of...

789
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,140
...batch...

790
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,320
John Williams delivers 9-11.

791
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,720
It's been rumored for weeks.

792
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,140
Folks, you have to get off...

793
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,260
Actress Renee Zellweger.

794
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,540
Now.

795
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,320
Something old.

796
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,480
The Rolling Stones announce...

797
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,420
Folks, you have to get off...

798
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:40,640
Now.

799
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,540
Deep, deep, deep, deep.

800
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,420
...in front of about 45 close friends and family members.

801
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,320
The Stones show no signs of...

802
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,380
...Hot Country Songs list.

803
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,500
Well, let's go, guys. Let's move.

804
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,980
This year's Cannes Film Festival...

805
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,520
Something old.

806
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,380
Something borrowed.

807
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,600
And yes, this year's Cannes Film Festival blew.

808
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,040
Revenge of...

809
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,580
Something old.

810
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:56,920
Slung.

811
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,040
I'm always relying on...

812
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,640
Something old.

813
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,000
...probably won't be repeated.

814
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,940
...which he wants to do.

815
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,920
And some critics...

816
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,240
Ken Rudd.

817
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:02,620
Cronenberg.

818
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,560
Gus Van Sant.

819
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,640
Executed immediately.

820
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,400
President Bush was out...

821
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,320
...with Kung Fu Lemming.

822
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,860
President Cheney was taken to a secure location in...

823
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,060
MTV Butt Party.

824
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,840
Revenge of the Associated Press.

825
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,680
Officials say it was unclear...

826
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,260
...worldwide.

827
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:16,920
Rise.

828
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,920
Let's see what the facts are.

829
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,400
Rise.

830
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,120
Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming, coming, coming, coming.

831
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,380
From PR News in Washington, I'm run by the United Nations.

832
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,260
The Senate may soon vote on whether to change Cuban leader Fidel Castro.

833
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,360
On Wall Street 481034, Queen Elizabeth has been kidnapped.

834
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,680
Hundreds of thousands of Cubans claimed responsibility for her abduction.

835
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:50,940
A similar kidnapping occurred last October when 10,000 Cuban government kidnapped PR News in Washington.

836
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,640
Anyway, friends, we're going to have some great bands at X Day this year.

837
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,960
Aside from the Amino Acids, who are also playing in Detroit.

838
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,800
That's our other D-Vival coming up March 19th in Detroit.

839
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,280
The Amino Acids will be at X Day.

840
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:12,300
And also, the Mind Losers, Crazy Man and the Out of Minders, Suppository Made of Lawnmowers.

841
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,360
Literally, I have a pop band.

842
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,360
Mr. This is like a folk singer.

843
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,240
Mr. You-Don't-Know-Who-You're-Dealing-With.

844
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:24,140
He's a really moody fellow.

845
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,120
Smokin' Stein will be there.

846
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,380
We're Drunk.

847
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,160
The Rummy.

848
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,120
Crackula.

849
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,820
The Vampires.

850
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,020
Phantom of the Frappera.

851
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,140
Creature from the Smack Lagoon.

852
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,280
Did I say Crankin' Stein?

853
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,380
No, I said Smokin' Stein.

854
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,680
There's some litigation between those two.

855
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,180
And the Hunch Slack of Brushwood.

856
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,100
It's a band that, a jam band, Hunch Slack of Brushwood.

857
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,360
I thought of something the other day.

858
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,940
You'd have to be seriously messed up to want to quit drugs.

859
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,420
And it's not a value judgment.

860
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,440
It's a statement of order.

861
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,920
First you are seriously messed up, then you have to want to quit drugs.

862
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,180
It's so sad when you get to that place.

863
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,640
Oh, oh, the other bands.

864
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,960
20,000 Nutsacks Beneath My Ball Sack.

865
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,400
These kids these days.

866
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,580
Polly Blister Puss and the Intarnations.

867
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,680
God Shittingly Good Pot.

868
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,960
And a band called Half Acidly, spelled A-C-I-D-L-Y.

869
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,500
Half Acidly.

870
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,520
And there's a Jehovah's Witnesses band called the Miller Lights.

871
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,420
Who all needs another Colbert?

872
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,740
I do, I do.

873
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,820
Grab me one.

874
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,140
Grab me one.

875
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,820
You boys bring all the camping gear?

876
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,580
I got a half gallon of Jack Daniels in a den.

877
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,820
Got some coke, chainsaw, extra gasoline.

878
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,020
Some 15 year old scotch, my rifle.

879
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,700
I got four coolers, beer and ice.

880
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,500
Good, good, good.

881
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,940
Wave and drag and whiskey, stock and beer.

882
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,940
And beer.

883
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,020
And we're madly mad.

884
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,780
So we ain't got no fear.

885
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,180
Now don't be a pussy and tell me it's dangerous.

886
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,840
Just shut your damn mouth, hold my beer.

887
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,520
Watch this.

888
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:48,620
There's a barn with a tree growing next to it on my ranch.

889
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,540
And hanging over the roof.

890
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,160
There's a big old rotten branch.

891
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,980
I'm gonna climb my ass up 30 feet and that there tree.

892
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,780
And one of you boys throw the chainsaw to me.

893
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,140
Oh my bear, watch this.

894
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,660
Oh my bear, watch this.

895
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,960
Watch out for those hornets.

896
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,960
I got a plan to hand this.

897
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,580
Oh my bear, watch this.

898
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:31,140
It rained last night all over our firewood.

899
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:38,020
And that soggy kindling don't wanna burn too good.

900
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:44,920
But I got a way to start us a big ass fire.

901
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,840
Give me that hose so I can stop this old man.

902
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:50,940
Oh my bear, watch this.

903
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:50,940


904
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:03,860
I got a plan to hang this.

905
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,060
Aim it at the fire.

906
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,200
Oh my bear, watch this.

907
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,100
I hope you got insurance.

908
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,160
Is your new truck?

909
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,080
Yep, I ain't seeing a few.

910
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:20,920
I say, heavy duty roll cage, gun rack, extra cup holders, 500 bucks.

911
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


912
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


913
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


914
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:20,920


915
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:27,900
40 horsepower, all terrain suspension, plus a few aftermarket improvements to my old dirt

916
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,240
town.

917
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,860
This baby got more gadgets than the Batmobile, Mach 5, and Space Shuttle all put together.

918
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,740
Hey, what's this red nuttin' do?

919
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,220
Don't touch that!

920
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:39,920
Oops.

921
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,240
Please tell me we got some of that scotch left.

922
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,340
Plus two more bottles.

923
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,080
After that we're down to burning the bears.

924
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:50,900
Oh my bear, watch this.

925
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:50,900


926
00:44:53,900 --> 00:45:03,840
I got a way to start us a big ass fire.

927
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,080
Give me that hose so I can start this.

928
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,260
Oh my bear, watch this.

929
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,440
I say, heavy duty roll cage, gun rack, extra cup holders, 500 bucks.

930
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:17,540
40 horsepower, all terrain suspension, plus a few aftermarket improvements to my old dirt

931
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:17,800
town.

932
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:17,800


933
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:17,800


934
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:17,800


935
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,180
I say, heavy duty roll cage, gun rack, extra cup holders, 500 bucks.

937
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,740
Oh, my bear, watch this.

938
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,220
Look at the sound of that snout.

939
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,140
Oh, my bear, watch this.

940
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,100
Here he comes.

941
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,580
Grab it, plan to ban this

942
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,780
I got him, ow!

943
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,080
Oh, my bear, watch this

944
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:33,960
He bites you

945
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,080
What do you think I'm stylin'?

946
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,900
Livin', drinkin' whiskey, scotch and beer

947
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,660
Yeah, we're madly mad, so we ain't got no fear

948
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,060
Now, don't be a pussy and tell me it's dangerous

949
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:58,740
Just shut your damn mouth, oh, my bear

950
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,400
Watch this

951
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,660
Shut your damn mouth, oh, my bear

952
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,300
Watch this

953
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:12,800
Shut your goddamn mouth, oh, my gold bear

954
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,120
Watch this

955
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,940
Who all's got my bear?

956
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:29,200
A Loki E. Coyote, dear friends, from his CD, Yipe Hype

957
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,100
And you can learn and see more at wiccabilly.com

958
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:38,800
That's W-I-C-C-A-B-I-L-L-Y dot com

959
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:45,680
And now, some radio synesthesia from WCSB in Cleveland

960
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,160
We are still hanging with the Antichrist League

961
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,860
So, you know, one time I read a story about

962
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:52,680
Who's this?

963
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:53,880
A guy who...

964
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,560
I read this novel that centered around a guy who went to

965
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,420
Sex addicts anonymous meetings to pick up chicks

966
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,180
You know, support groups for sex addicts

967
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,680
Like, how does one actually find a support group for sex addicts?

968
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,860
Like, do such things actually exist?

969
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,080
It's just strictly the stuff of moguls

970
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,580
Can you imagine bringing a bunch of people together like that for groups?

971
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,580
Well, I mean, I actually...

972
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,240
Hey, well, here's the thing, for real, for real

973
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,640
I know someone who was going to AA meetings

974
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,380
And meeting new drinking buddies there at AA meetings

975
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,840
And I was like, well, that's kind of semi-old

976
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,780
In fact, that's how many of them die

977
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:28,300
Yeah

978
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,700
That's how many of them die

979
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,680
So I figure if...

980
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,940
Uh-oh, who'd we lose?

981
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,080
That's how many of them die

982
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:36,740
Roll call

983
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,920
Many of them die

984
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,620
Rock now, are you here?

985
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:41,600
Yes

986
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,700
Okay, that means Sloth is gone

987
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,360
I'm still here

988
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:52,220
Alright, I'm impressed that I was actually able to remember which line everybody was on

989
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,000
I was at work today and I saw one of your clones at work, Stang

990
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,700
I swear to God, he had the face, he had the eyes

991
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,600
He even had the glasses, mustache, and beard

992
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,140
But he didn't have the hair

993
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,580
Oh, I was, uh, I just had a haircut recently

994
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,940
I was out horse...

995
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,040
Betting on horse races today

996
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:12,820
Why did you...

997
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:13,380
Without the hair?

998
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,240
Yeah, yeah, I'm bald now

999
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,200
Did you have a blue suit on?

1000
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,540
Yeah, that was me

1001
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:19,840
Awesome

1002
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,220
Sure, you should have said hello

1003
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,040
I knew, I knew that you were going to say hello to me

1004
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,040


1005
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,040


1006
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,480
I knew when I saw that Mustang go through the parking lot with the...

1007
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,500
Yeah, that's Mustang

1008
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,340
Sang 3

1009
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,480
Sang 3

1010
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,220
You didn't want the trifecta today, didn't you, Stang?

1011
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:30,820
That's Mustang

1012
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,060
Yeah, I see that all the time, I do

1013
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,020
Yeah, I drove back from Kentucky

1014
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,600
Only took me an hour and a half in that thing

1015
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,860
6-8-7-9-0-VAL-F-N-O-V-A-F-U-F-N-A-G-O-N-O-T-H-O-R-C-O-L-L-R-H-E-R

1016
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,880
Or, uh, there we go

1017
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,160
You've been in this area for five minutes and he already knows all the routines

1018
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,660
2-1-6-0-V-A-F-U-F-N-O-T-H-O-N-O-T-H-O-R-C-O-L-R-H-E-R

1019
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,220
If you'd like to join our discussion of nothing in particular

1020
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,480
You know, I think we need, I think, uh, I think we need an official subgenius blog

1021
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,460
I heard that all the people in the Stubenville-East Liverpool area

1022
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,980
Although we hear of these people who are semi-connected to the Cleveland Metropolitan

1023
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,200
Did you just say a subgenius blog?

1024
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:09,420
Yeah, is there such a thing?

1025
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:09,880
Oh, yeah

1026
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,380
Where can I find that?

1027
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,380
Well, there's dozens of them

1028
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,320
What about like an official one?

1029
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,960
My favorite particular one

1030
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,940
Uh, here, let me, uh

1031
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:22,940
There's nothing official though? It's all, uh, strictly, like, DIY stuff?

1032
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,440
Well, there's my own that I use just for, for news

1033
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,580
But there's one, uh, called Slackoff

1034
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,680
Yeah, slackoff.blogspot.com

1035
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,580
Was started fairly recently by Reverend New Monet

1036
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,360
And that's a, it's a good one

1037
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:45,520
That's slackoff.blogspot.com

1038
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,140
Or revstack

1039
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,880
And it's bang.blogspot.com

1040
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,500
Uh

1041
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,460
It's yours, isn't it?

1042
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,440
Let's see

1043
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,760
Yeah, I, that's mine, but it's not really interactive

1044
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:59,320
It's just for me to, to make, uh, to spam with

1045
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:04,620
The subgenius blog at Slackoff is open to contributors

1046
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:05,680
Yeah

1047
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,240
Well, I'm just, it's a little different

1048
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:13,840
I only started mine because when you try to log on and just respond to one of these things

1049
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,200
It tricks you into starting your own blog

1050
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,140
Oh, yeah

1051
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:17,820
You don't really have to

1052
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,120
But it makes you think you have to

1053
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,460
And I ended up doing so

1054
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,760
And, but I don't, uh, and, and mine, I guess you can make comments

1055
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,040
But I, I just mainly use it as a soapbox for my own gigantic ego

1056
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,800
Whereas this other one, slackoff.blogspot.com

1057
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,020
That's for everybody's gigantic ego

1058
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,680
Well, these people are all psychic slaves, though

1059
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:45,440
And a blog is a term which is like one individual's take on a particular subject at a particular time

1060
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,120
Well, it's short for weblogs

1061
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,160
It's a fact that is disposable

1062
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:54,420
Yeah, now some of us were doing this for, for centuries before the internet was invented

1063
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,280
Yes

1064
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,260
We did it by urinating on posts and leaving our message that way

1065
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,440
That was the very first chemical message we left

1066
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,940
Right, P-mail we called it

1067
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,640
Ruroc has been here

1068
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,420
Yeah

1069
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,620
Ruroc will return soon with a bladder infection

1070
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:11,540
Oh, Ruroc's girlfriend is in estrus

1071
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:12,100
Mmm

1072
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,080
Mmm

1073
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,120
We'll kill Ruroc, take girlfriend

1074
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,020
Got it

1075
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:17,600
See things

1076
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,720
Low blood calcium, severe kidney disease, cannot sit or stand for 30 minutes

1077
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,240
Painful swallowing, chest pain, severe or continuing heartburn

1078
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,640
I see things, and I've just realized

1079
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,980
The world can be a deadly place

1080
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:33,380
In rare cases, digestive and neurological side effects have been reported

1081
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,900
If there's one thing you can count on, it's this name right here

1083
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,880
Wally's Dream Girl

1084
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:47,380
Hi, dear

1085
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,320
Wally

1086
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,520
Well, Wally

1087
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,140
Keep listening

1088
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,620
She doesn't even know I'm alive

1089
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,580
I don't know, I, I just like to look at her like

1090
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,760
You better have a serious talk with your counselor

1091
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,440
Do you want me, Mom?

1092
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,320
Um

1093
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,960
Do you want me, Mom?

1094
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:07,840
Um

1095
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,300
Gee, Mom

1096
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,260
You wanna take a, a drive up to Myers Lake?

1097
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,480
You know, it makes a guy feel creepy

1098
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,160
Bam, bam, bam!

1099
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,580
Overactive bladder

1100
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,360
That's right, I know I'm excited

1101
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:19,960
It's exciting

1102
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,120
Overactive bladder

1103
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,100
It's not normal

1104
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh

1105
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,580
Creamy, thick, good

1106
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,760
Oh yes, Mr. Cleaver, low

1107
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,260
Isn't it disgusting?

1108
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,760
You better go back and get cleaned up

1109
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:35,960
Yes, Beaver

1110
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,820
But you and I can talk about just about anything, can't we?

1111
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,660
Jenny is a very good looking girl

1112
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,440
Getting all dressed up to impress the gym coach

1113
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,860
You know something, Beaver?

1114
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,460
She won't, I don't know?

1115
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,260
She did

1116
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,600
I was about ready to call you

1117
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:48,520
Yeah

1118
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,640
All you dogs are at risk

1119
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,220
You're talking to Big Daddy

1120
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,200
He knows all and says nothing

1121
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,480
I'll say it's nothing

1122
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,820
I better get going

1123
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:58,400
Yeah

1124
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,280
Be hurt

1125
00:52:59,280 --> 00:52:59,780
Get hurt

1126
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,440
Beaver, don't eat so fast

1127
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,920
Let's face it, Eddie

1128
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,960
Who wants a sunburn allergic dream girl with lumps?

1129
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,200
Gee, Dad, cut it out, huh?

1130
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,720
Gee, Dad, cut it out, huh?

1131
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,180
Gee

1132
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,580
Great big lumps all over me

1133
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,860
The lumps all over her?

1134
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,840
Well, good night, Mom

1135
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,440
Good night, Daddy

1136
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,440


1137
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,440


1138
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,440


1139
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,440


1140
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,440


1141
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,440


1142
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,440


1143
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,440


1144
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,440


1145
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:15,600
Good night, Dad

1146
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,600
Good night, son

1147
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,260
Cold sore

1148
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:17,780
Cold sore

1149
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,280
Cold sore

1150
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:18,800
Cold sore

1151
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:18,880
Cold sore

1152
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:18,920
Cold sore

1153
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:19,240
Strychnine

1154
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,440
or freekie

1155
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,280
Totally cheesy

1156
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,180
Totally cheesy

1157
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:22,300
Easy.

1158
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:46,700
Some of us actually got Bob to hold still long enough to eat with us.

1159
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,500
And since when he comes to your house, he eats everything in sight,

1160
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,480
including the tablecloth and the dog dish stuff,

1161
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:59,220
and then the fridge contents, even the old cherries and suspicious chicken salad way in the back,

1162
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,740
we went to Bloaty's Pizza Hog, and he was sucking it all down so hard,

1163
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:06,760
the employees were afraid to even call the cops.

1164
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,960
And as usual, he really overdid it, until there was this inevitable awful reversal event,

1165
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,520
and the pizza just flew out of Bob's nose and ears, peppering everyone.

1166
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,300
It was disgusting.

1167
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:19,680
Disgusting.

1168
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:24,380
But at least he paid the bill this time, and he even tipped the staff for their trouble,

1169
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,980
and boy was there a lot of it.

1170
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:32,000
Besides, I saved one of his nasally befouled pepperonis and sold it on eBay for $100,000.

1171
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:33,340
Praise Bob!

1172
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:46,840
Brothers and sorors, we are to concern ourselves with the science of misdemeanors.

1173
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,020
It's the mystical state.

1174
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:49,280
It's the mystical state.

1175
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:49,280


1176
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:49,680
It's the reality.

1177
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:55,300
If it is not an illusion, then it is possible of analysis.

1178
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:12,040
The first step in this science of mysticalness is concentration.

1179
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:29,360
When we concentrate on anything, whether our concentration is visual or auditory,

1180
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,920
we are focusing our attention.

1181
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:48,660
The first step in this science of mysticalness is concentration.

1182
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,180
The second step in this science of mysticalness is concentration.

1183
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,660
It is conceptual glass.

1184
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,240
We make public

1185
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:54,300
化

1186
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:54,300


1187
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,940
massage.

1188
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:00,120
We can long wait until our body hardens.

1189
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:00,140
Establishment of body.

1190
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,060
You have voluntarily focused your attention upon it.

1191
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,300
Give it also involuntary attention.

1192
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:04,940
The sudden, loud noise, the nature of some birds, is an example of involuntary attention.

1193
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:11,420
Give it also involuntary attention without being conscious.

1194
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,760
The sex is a sublime pleasure.

1195
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,640
A pleasure that is beyond words to describe.

1196
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:26,340
An experience that rejuvenates our being and stimulates our mental powers.

1197
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,520
These meditation exercises, accompanied by this special music,

1198
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,600
can be practiced by you as often as once daily, if you wish.

1199
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:43,580
Each period of meditation is not to exceed five minutes in duration.

1200
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,760
May the cosmic abide with you.

1201
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:15,740
Meditation

1202
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:34,160
That was Atomic Jefferson, dear friends, from Birmingham, Alabama.

1203
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:36,880
A song called Electric Torch.

1204
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:40,060
We heard Hell Pope Huey ranting a bit before that.

1205
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:44,680
You are listening to Hour of Slack number 997.

1206
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:51,040
And if you want to know everything, see subgenius.com.

1207
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,520
That's subgenius.com.

1208
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:59,700
There's information there about the books and the videos and just about everything.

1209
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,440
And now, Lemaire.

1210
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,780
And that was all I had to say that was interesting.

1211
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,240
Completely inert.

1212
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,120
Disconnecting.

1213
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,140
Disconnecting.

1214
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,160
Disconnecting.

1215
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,220
Disconnecting.

1216
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,260
Disconnecting.

1217
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,260
Disconnecting.

1218
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,000
All right, Hell?

1219
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,800
Back to normal.
