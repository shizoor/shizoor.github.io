1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
What time is it, Tevis?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,320
It's Bob time. Time for the Hour of Slack.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,260
Tevis, you know that you're not supposed to be watching the Hour of Slack because it's too weird for you.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,120
Uh-uh.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,680
Oh, yeah, I'll prove it. Right, Daddy.

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,720
Huh? What?

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,960
Right, she's not supposed to see the Hour of Slack.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,560
Oh, Tevis is just as weird as the Hour of Slack, aren't you, Tev?

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:30,260
Yeah.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:47,960
Mr. Smith is our friend and father.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,940
Mr. Smith!

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,920
Mr. Smith is our friend and father.

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,340
Mr. Smith is our friend and father.

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,480
Mr. Smith is our friend and father.

15
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,540
Mr. Smith is our friend and father.

16
00:00:59,540 --> 00:00:59,540


17
00:00:59,540 --> 00:00:59,540


18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:00:59,540


19
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,540
Smith

20
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,280
And I feel good.

21
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,460
The subconscious will listen and absorb this message.

22
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,660
Exactly.

23
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,040
Hey, what's going on here?

24
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,560
The subgenius.

25
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,380
The subgenius.

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,140
What?

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Welcome to the end times, boys and girls.

28
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,740
We're going to shock shock the house.

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,780
We can bring the world.

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,780
Bob is getting down with you here tonight.

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,140
Bob is getting down to help your plight.

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,380
Bob is coming here to ease your strife.

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,480
Come on suckers, let Bob into your life.

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,800
Big bad Bob.

35
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,780
Big bad Bob.

36
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:42,740
Dear friends, call 823-7490 or 828-9500 for more information.

37
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,300
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that light releases,

38
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,580
but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,100
Hoping your time is all time and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

40
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,420
Here's your host.

41
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,040
Who sits on the right hand side of Bob?

42
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,860
None other than the Reverend Ivan Stang.

43
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,420
That's me.

44
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,960
The sexiest man on earth.

45
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,100
A young Adonis who's irresistible to women.

46
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,280
Melville, I can't wait a moment longer.

47
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,960
I've got to have sex with you.

48
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,940
You shall have sex.

49
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,100
You shall be rich.

50
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,860
Rich in limitless sex, sir.

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,280
Sigh.

52
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,860
Sigh.

53
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,740
Sigh.

54
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,400
Sigh.

55
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,380
Sigh.

56
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:29,540


57
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:29,540


58
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:29,540


59
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:29,540


60
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:29,540


61
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:29,540


62
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:29,540


63
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,400
Sigh.

64
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:31,700


65
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,420
Sigh.

66
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,420
Sigh.

67
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:34,420


68
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:34,420


69
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:34,420


70
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:34,420


71
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,640
You love me dear friends.

72
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,180
Greetings to our radio announcer and many friends of the rail land.

73
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,760
This is the old fashioned healing broadcast coming direct from the auditorium here in

74
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,160
Dallas.

75
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,340
And now I left in that rented car, prayed, and cried and bawled and squalled about 80

76
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,140
or 90 miles clearing the Tucson.

77
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,780
And by the time I got to Tucson, I was so drunk under the spirit of God.

78
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,660
And I just can't get it out of my head.

79
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,240
I can't get it out of my head.

80
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,640
I can't get it out of my head.

81
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,540
I can't get it out of my head.

82
00:03:59,540 --> 00:03:59,540


83
00:03:59,540 --> 00:03:59,540


84
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,680
I want you all to bear one thing in mind before we get going.

85
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,620
That I am one of you.

86
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,700
I'm not an actor.

87
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,780
Just like them actors that you guys see that these movies come in.

88
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,920
They put words in their mouth.

89
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,220
Well, I'm one of you guys.

90
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,740
You know, when Dick dropped me off at the motel today,

91
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,120
I almost seen a blind man get killed.

92
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,820
He was crossing the street.

93
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,580
And I noticed that the dog didn't look right or left.

94
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,120
This big truck almost hit him.

95
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,180
And I watched the blind guy on the other side,

96
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,920
and I seen him handing the dog some cookies.

97
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,620
And I ran across, I said, sir, you know, you almost got killed here.

98
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,720
That dog didn't look, and yet you're giving him some cookies.

99
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,780
Why?

100
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,700
He says, because I want to feel where his head is so I can kick him right in the rear.

101
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,760
Oh, that pup is good.

102
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,660
It's impossible to do everything tonight, what I know in my head,

103
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,560
and the way I fool and play with people.

104
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,180
I may sound a little bit mad because I've gotten letters from people.

105
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,600
All I want is the reputation that I've earned.

106
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,400
Don't let nobody take advantage of us guys.

107
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,860
Be one step ahead of these mothers.

108
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,940
Thank you, Bob.

109
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,660
Thank you, Bob.

110
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,880
Thank you, Bob.

111
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,740
Thank you, Bob.

112
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:53,860
Thank you, Bob.

113
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,860
Thank you, Bob.

114
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:54,880
Thank you.

115
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,720
Thank you.

116
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:56,720


117
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,120
Hey, that new church air is just great.

118
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,760
It's fun.

119
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:17,100
Well, son, if you'll just keep breathing an equal portion of church air with all of the bad air, too, you'll get like me.

120
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,440
Your head will begin to expand.

121
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,880
The inside will eventually become larger than the outside.

122
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,820
I don't know quite how to explain this, but I've put my trust in Bob.

123
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:39,620
Thanks to Bob, the inside of my head is much larger than the outside ever was.

124
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,060
But doesn't that make it hard to get through doorways?

125
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:52,160
Sometimes I do get lost inside my head, and I've had trouble finding my way out, especially early in the morning.

126
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,860
But thanks to Bob, I'll be a much more...

127
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,280
...productive employee on the job.

128
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:05,640
And I've had a great time at parties with this new big head that came with my glandscaping.

129
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,100
Will the same thing happen to me when I get to be a man, too?

130
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,080
Yes, son, you'll go through the operations, too.

131
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:24,320
The doctors will open your third nostril with their musical instruments, and you'll be able to whiff-read the stenches of all the normals and pinks around you.

132
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,860
You'll be able to sell your...

133
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,480
...soul and anything, son.

134
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,120
Just like me.

135
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,340
Gee, I can't wait till that Bob-time train comes around the bend.

136
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,340
Oh, look out, son! Here it comes now!

137
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,940
It's frightening, isn't it?

138
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,340
It's unbelievably big and scary.

139
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,760
It's not rich enough to be used and to receive the new world, but flesh and under...

140
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,180
...the skin and blood of the dead is a real mystery.

141
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,200
I understand not the way of the land-clad ones, only.

142
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,100
Resident believes possibly MNAs are in the area.

143
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,460
Oh, dear friends, well, this is another hour of slack.

144
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,060
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, speaking to you.

145
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,960
Negative land in the background, as usual.

146
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,780
And, uh, the Will of Dobbs is here.

147
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:27,480
And he needs for Shelly C. Mann to call 823-7490 or 828-9500.

148
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,040
Because we didn't get your address right.

149
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,940
It's hard to read the address.

150
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,640
We need you to call in.

151
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,160
Dear, dear, dear friend.

152
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,320
We're gonna be hurting the animals, uh, tonight.

153
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,300
We're gonna hurt them real bad.

154
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,400
Um, not as much as we'd like to hurt boy George real bad.

155
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,260
But that's an inside joke. That's another story.

156
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,460
Oh.

157
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,140
So beautiful. So beautiful.

158
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,220
Hey, that new church air is just great.

159
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,720
The new screen excitement you've been waiting for.

160
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,260
Rated PG.

161
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,200
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.

162
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,220
Your doorbell rings, and there's a chaplain standing quietly.

163
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,140
He tells you...

164
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,200
We're splashing liberation right around the world.

165
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,900
And we'll die to do it.

166
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,980
Hurt me.

167
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,380
Use me.

168
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,720
Use me again.

169
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,300
Use me.

170
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,240
Hurt me.

171
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,600
Use me again.

172
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,060
Hurt me.

173
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,060
What?

174
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,180
That's amazing.

175
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,420
Tape recorders taking over their mother.

176
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,240
Before making any additional statements about my subject, I'd like to make it clear that,

177
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,200
in any reference I make to the church on today's show, I'm not going to be making any additional

178
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,200


179
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,880
statements about my subject.

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,300
I'm going to be speaking in broad and certainly not specific terms.

181
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,960
That is, I will be referring primarily to the institutionalized church.

182
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,120
Everyone uses...

183
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,200
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

184
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,000
Now to continue with the tape recording.

185
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,220
We're going to see. Get ready.

186
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,940
What I'm talking to you about today is the most up-to-date thing that I could talk to you about.

187
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,700
We're living in the closing moments of this dispensation.

188
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,000
So, housewives, take this tip from the growers of Idaho potatoes, whose potatoes make delicious

189
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,860
French flies.

190
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:33,100
Then we watched my friend very suddenly and violently vomiting.

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,220
Who's going to listen to that?

192
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,840
And when they do, how are they going to feel?

193
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,440
Well, I don't have to think about that.

194
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:42,820
You do.

195
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,600
Whoever you are.

196
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,920
Your family's safe.

197
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,680
We're safe.

198
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:48,760
We're going to get you out of here.

199
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,760
I wish you were a genius, but feel like only a sub-genius.

200
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,240
Have a kisser Darth Vader's mom would expunge.

201
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,740
Tired of gorge-clogging crypto-wimpism?

202
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,500
I have a solution.

203
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,620
Stay tuned in the weeks to come for exciting lectures such as Drink Your Way to Happiness

204
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:12,760
and a special tour of the Roy Rogers Museum, wherein Bob will prove that Trigger has moved

205
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,160
again.

206
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,640
All this and more on your favorite soundtrack for a crumbling society.

207
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,660
Food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food,

208
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,540
food, food fights of the gods.

209
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,880
All great things are happening.

210
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,320
God is showing people.

211
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,260
Many of you are hearing verses.

212
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,180
You're tormented, your mind is tormented, your family.

213
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,800
Some of you husbands and wives.

214
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,320
You mumble, grumble, complain, fuss-fight.

215
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:38,660
You demon powers and strive to destroy your marriage, your home, so you need to, if you

216
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,380
can't mend you all to get these tapes anyhow on demonology.

217
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,020
Take one, two, three, four, five, six and they're on, right on up, till we get through,

218
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,180
on can a Christian be demon-possessed at the end of the program,

219
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,160
but we're going to take you into that service right now.

220
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,880
We're going to take you now into that service in progress

221
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,500
where we are sharing on the subject,

222
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,500
can a Christian be demon-possessed?

223
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,860
Hundreds of New Yorkers at a religious revival

224
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,320
chanting the name of a modern-day prophet, Bob.

225
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,400
Bob's teachings are the foundation of a church

226
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,460
that does little more than parody cults and American consumerism.

227
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,980
It's called the Church of the Subgenius.

228
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,960
Tom Vitale has this report.

229
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,240
You will pay to know what you really think.

230
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,940
But if you give us money, we will tell you what to think.

231
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,580
And not only have you paid to know what you really think,

232
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,620
but once you will get value for your dollars.

233
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,380
Americans will buy anything,

234
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,380
and they're getting sold shirts.

235
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,460
That's the message of the Church of the Subgenius,

236
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,560
as delivered by the Pope of all New York,

237
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,380
David Meyer, at a recent revival.

238
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,700
Meyer also instructed the enthusiastic crowd

239
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,120
in how to get slack,

240
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,900
how to get right with Bob,

241
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,880
and how to pull the wool over your own eyes.

242
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,600
For they shall see God.

243
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
It's still true.

244
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,240
God still speaks in special ways to each of us today.

245
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,620
But my feelings toward him are still so brittle and sour.

246
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,360
I don't care. I don't care.

247
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,060
I don't care. I don't care.

248
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,120
I don't care. I don't care.

249
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,760
I don't care. I don't care.

250
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,460
I don't care. I don't care.

251
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,400
I don't care anymore.

252
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,760
Tired. I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm tired.

253
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,120
I can't tolerate it.

254
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,200
I can't live with it.

255
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,720
I can't.

256
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,720
And that's how I became a subgenius.

257
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,020
This is from Gordon Pruvis and Jimmy Slack.

258
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,820
Listen to this. Listen to this. Listen to this.

259
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,660
What I'm going to tell you now may shock some of you,

260
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,240
but it's the truth.

261
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,120
I was in the rock music scene.

262
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,020
I was a part of it for years.

263
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,740
I was a musician. I was a singer.

264
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,540
Thinking about what the kids want to hear.

265
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,060
Speed and pot.

266
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,200
Sex outside of marriage.

267
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,100
Said old masochistic sexual techniques

268
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,180
involving leathers, razors, and spiked heels.

269
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,200
Money.

270
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,960
Stink and the stench and the filth and the rot

271
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,200
and the bondage and the darkness.

272
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,440
Sports.

273
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:18,560
Sports.

274
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,360
Listen to this.

275
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,940
One of the greatest days of my life.

276
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,440
This particular night I was there with crowd control.

277
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,420
That coliseum was packed to capacity with tens of thousands of people.

278
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,860
Thousands, thousands, thousands, thousands, thousands there that night.

279
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,900
The air was heavily laden with marijuana smoke.

280
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,180
And it was so thick you would even get high walking through it.

281
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,340
And the scene was straight out of Danny's Inferno.

282
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,280
It was like animals.

283
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,180
It was like...

284
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,380
It was like...

285
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,820
Dogs sponsoring this huge...

286
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,220
It was like...

287
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,220


288
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,640
Extravaganza will be...

289
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,060
It was like...

290
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,060
Some of the mightiest corporations in the United States of America.

291
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,600
I would give my body to this group until it was black and blue.

292
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,280
I mean it.

293
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,900
I'd get down on my hands and knees.

294
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,420
I'd give them anything they wanted.

295
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,380
They're like God.

296
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,180
They're even better than God.

297
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,680
Listen to this.

298
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
To be blunt.

299
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,560
You will...

300
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,380
You will...

301
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:23,660
When the show is over you'll go backstage and let these animals do about anything they want to do to you.

302
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,360
So what?

303
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,020
It would be worth it to me.

304
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,240
Listen to this.

305
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,100
Listen to this.

306
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:31,900
Listen to this.

307
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:41,460
I awakened on the couch to the flaring reverberation of a monstrous stereo that had played all night long.

308
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,080
A little stale cigarette set up to attempt to focus on my immediate surroundings.

309
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,920
Garbage, garbage, cigarette butts, cigarette butts.

310
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,580
Dope trays, dope trays.

311
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,740
Needles and albums were strung about with clothes ankle deep on the floor.

312
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:03,100
I reached forward to begin consuming one of the leftover untouched drinks when I noticed the television set was on.

313
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,020
I almost turned it off.

314
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,240
But something said watch it.

315
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,700
I looked at my life.

316
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,740
It means nothing anymore.

317
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,140
Do you hear me?

318
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,400
It means nothing anymore.

319
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,380
Help everywhere.

320
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,220
The marvelous show today folks.

321
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,700
Our very special guest is loved and admired the world over as a fine performer and a great humanitarian.

322
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,700
Please welcome one of America's oldest and most respected kids, Ivan Stank.

323
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,040
Senator, do you care to cross-examine now?

324
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,540
Yes, I'd like to cross-examine him now.

325
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:57,260
Mr. Stank here, when you sold these hydrogen devices to the Malaysians, were you aware that that was taxpayers property?

326
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:04,080
Those, listen, those Malaysians are fighting against freedom every bit as hard as the Church of the Subgenius.

327
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:15,400
And on top of that, these people can't be expected to protect the Dobstown investment out there in the jungles from the nearby hostile.

328
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,140
The fiendishly clever savages who are constantly...

329
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,660
You must refer to the Ukabalaponga.

330
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,580
Yes.

331
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,640
The fiends they are.

332
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,240
Very popular with this order.

333
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,200
They hate...

334
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,780
Well, that's all very good, but where's the missing money?

335
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,440
Well, you see, these freedom fighters, or Ukabalapongas, Ukas as we call them, have used it all up.

336
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,640
They fought freedom all over the world.

337
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,140
And that's not a cheap prospect you're looking at there.

338
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:51,700
Now, I offer this document in evidence, an article from the Arizona Daily Star entitled,

339
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,240
You Could Lose Your Blues at that Toddlin' Tucson Bar that's known as Bob Dobbs.

340
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:08,780
It appears that this bar, which has taken the name of Bob Dobbs, is an utter warren of normals and pinks of the worst stripe who talk about sports and wear bill caps and drink beer.

341
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,940
What do you have to say about this obvious betrayal of the trust of your many followers?

342
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:26,860
Look, Bob gets a penny for every time his face is xeroxed, and he doesn't care whether that xerox ends up on the wing of a Russian fighter, or if it's on a nice old granny's wheelchair.

343
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,900
That's right. But.

344
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,660
Or. And.

345
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,640
And it is a big but.

346
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,880
No ifs about it.

347
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,700
I mean, look. You can't run a church on air.

348
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,920
This is a world outreach. We're fighting for freedom.

349
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:43,920


350
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:43,920


351
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,300
...riding poverty and free thought everywhere, all over the world.

352
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,600
So you feel justified as a private citizen into pushing your particular line?

353
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,240
Well, the...

354
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,520
Is that what I'm to understand?

355
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,300
As Bob said, the ends always justify, more than justify the means in every situation.

356
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,740
And too much is always better than not enough.

357
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,260
And if you want to step on my...

358
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,580
I've read the Constitution.

359
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,840
I know what the rights of religious subgeniuses are.

360
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,940
If we want to sell what you call nuclear weapons, these are stage props for us.

361
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,620
To small countries, and that is our prerogative.

362
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,040
We're...

363
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,220
This episode of the Hour of Slack...

364
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:39,560
...is on the...

365
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,320
...underwritten by the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company,

366
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:48,640
a purveyor of Dobbs-approved church wear, including subgenius T-shirts, buttons, and other mutant products.

367
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,400
Also available locally at Lone Star Comics and Metamorphosis.

368
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,280
That's the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company, serving the public since God knows when,

369
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:04,920
at P.O. Box 595-148, Dallas, Texas 75359-5148.

370
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,960
Thanks, Weeping Cyclops, for supporting KNON on the Hour of Slack.

371
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,600
Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company

372
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,860
is a production of the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company.

373
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:40,860


374
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:40,860


375
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,700
Oh, listen to those...

376
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,360
Once again, the swinging love corpses, dear friend.

377
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,320
Oh, you know, all last week I was hearing ads on the radio for this Lena Lovitch concert.

378
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,180
She was going to do a benefit for the animal liberation movement,

379
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,700
the people for the ethical treatment of animals.

380
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,620
Well, that's just great.

381
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,040
She and Nina Hagen, praise Nina, damn Nina,

382
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,280
and they're...

383
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,380
I don't know if you've ever seen any of the literature that comes from the animal liberation groups,

384
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,220
but it's hate literature.

385
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,460
They hate people, basically.

386
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,820
And now I'm just speaking for myself, not for the radio station,

387
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,660
not necessarily for other subgenii.

388
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,440
I can't pretend to speak for them,

389
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,960
but for myself I say,

390
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,980
death to the animals.

391
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,720
Death! Death to them!

392
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,100
Because I eat them.

393
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,120
And I will always eat them.

394
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,780
And millions of us will eat them,

395
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,920
the little animals,

396
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,840
because they're replaceable,

397
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,360
easily replaceable,

398
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,900
because they fornicate and make more little animals.

399
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,740
And they are filled with blood.

400
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,800
Rich, red blood.

401
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,960
Blood which gives us...

402
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,720
the strength and the power.

403
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,220
Which the vegetarians have not.

404
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,100
And not only the strength and the power,

405
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,580
for even they can gain strength and power from eating their little plants.

406
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,760
Their helpless vegetables.

407
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,240
I mean, at least the animals can fight back, dear friends.

408
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,400
At least the animals can scream in pain and agony

409
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,000
as we track them down and kill them.

410
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,680
Or else as we throw them in cages and kill them.

411
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,800
Either one, doesn't matter.

412
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,100
Because they're just animals.

413
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,220
Souls?

414
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,200
Oh, of course they have souls.

415
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,380
And all the better to make them feel pain with.

416
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,400
We free those souls, dear friends,

417
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,800
from their mortal coils.

418
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,380
That they may go up to their cow heaven,

419
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,600
or their pig heaven, or whatever.

420
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,060
Where there are no humans to destroy them and eat them.

421
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,060
Ha ha ha ha ha.

422
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,780
Oh, friends, one thing which the vegetarians can do,

423
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:08,780


424
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,500
and never glean from their sad, limited diet,

425
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,940
is the aggression.

426
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,100
The hormonal hate power.

427
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,040
Which is why the carnivores will always exist.

428
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,180
And will always win any battles with the vegetarians.

429
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,060
Just as the alcoholics have historically always won against the froth heads.

430
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,920
And for the same reasons.

431
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,940
And it's a damn good thing that I eat a hamburger a minute.

432
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,920
Because I'm not an alcoholic, and thus not as feisty as they are.

433
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,900
So I need the meek and the death of the animals.

434
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:47,420
And death, death by torture to those who are supporters of animal liberation groups.

435
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,160
Did you know, friends, that there have been people killed in laboratories

436
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,260
sabotaged by these fanatical anti-vivisectionists?

437
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:01,020
Of course these beasts must be vivisected and dissected alive.

438
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,540
How else can we know what exact level of pain on the painometer must be reached?

439
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,740
Before they die of fright.

440
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,600
This is an important consideration in modern science.

441
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,040
So, dear friends,

442
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,500
don't just eat that animal.

443
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,320
Eat the hell out of it.

444
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,320
With hot sauce.

445
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:29,440
You'll need to, because the ones that are vegetarians now will be the first to turn to cannibalism.

446
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,300
Once the econo-cataclysm really sinks in,

447
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,340
the environment's destroyed,

448
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,860
and then where will their ideals be?

449
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,980
They'll feel like we deserve to be eaten.

450
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,980
Nope, they sacrificed all those years not eating animals.

451
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,340
The world's been destroyed, there's no vegetables left,

452
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,500
nothing will grow for 500 years,

453
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,720
and they'll feel that it's our turn.

454
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,140
Oh, they'll quickly turn to dining upon some succulent

455
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,960
long pig,

456
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,580
faster than anybody.

457
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,700
Mark my words, dear friends,

458
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,520
mark them,

459
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,200
and then heed.

460
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,180
Everybody welcome.

461
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,740
How do they know we're here?

462
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,520
Oh, so, uh, you know...

463
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,800
...you're sure to take care of us?

464
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,700
In a dream I dreamt that was no dream,

465
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,440
in a sleep I slept that was no sleep,

466
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,900
I met the junk man in his scattered yard.

467
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,840
There in a twilight of talk,

468
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,360
my ears stared at the wag of his broken jaw

469
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,900
as he ranted over the rule of ruin.

470
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,200
And within my rusting headpiece,

471
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,460
here where all metals turn inward,

472
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,620
I eyed his arguments as a bargain of beads

473
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,400
strung on the grieving yesterdays.

474
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,440
And the junk man's words circled about my beefery brain

475
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,880
like crippled wings on a broken bed.

476
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,160
I was a young bird,

477
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,740
no real flight in it.

478
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,360
Come, hold hands with me

479
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,600
in this stagger of dark,

480
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,080
and watch the junk man inventory his rust.

481
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,720
Trace with the green of our togethered intelligence

482
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,800
the rag picker counting his twisted treasures

483
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,420
here in this jungle of jungle

484
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,800
where all smiles must leap down.

485
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,120
Don't let go of my hand.

486
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,780
Look how the madman of discard walks

487
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,820
through the low forest of his possessions.

488
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,740
There he stops,

489
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,480
and with his practiced junk man's appraisal

490
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,600
measures the meanness in the meaning of a bent frame

491
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,000
of some lost courage.

492
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,400
Now, his awful laughter beginning,

493
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,660
he counts a stack of odd-shaped fears

494
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,860
and considers with his cash register eyes

495
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,380
the price they all bring

496
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,440
when some young thing,

497
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,460
you or me,

498
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,680
or anyone somewhat free,

499
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,460
happens to come here to build on these

500
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,900
grotesque grounds.

501
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,200
Don't be afraid,

502
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,940
but don't let go of my hand.

503
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,200
I am no braver than you.

504
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,180
We need our need of needing each other,

505
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,160
and more.

506
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,100
We need our need of not needing each other.

507
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,440
Now, while the junk man is busy in his counting house,

508
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,580
now, while the king of unkindness tells lies to himself

509
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,640
in a devalue of value,

510
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,800
help me in this crowded air of broken wings,

511
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:06,140
like melodies we can whistle against the dark.

512
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,800
Yes, now, when the junk man has made a yard

513
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,460
of so many millions who have been disinherited

514
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,600
from their inheritance,

515
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,380
you and I will begin again the beginning that will never end.

516
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,920
We will mix ourselves together

517
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,660
and throw our togetherness down

518
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,340
to make the junkyard green

519
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,540
with our cunning care.

520
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:25,620


521
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,060
Then, in some tomorrows, tomorrow on other wings,

522
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,680
other wings will know that flight can be mended,

523
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,940
and that the junk man who wants his books in the black,

524
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,700
in a profit of no profit,

525
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,280
the cheater of the cheated,

526
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,780
will make his idiot inventory against other eyes

527
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,560
with a difference.

528
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,120
Our having given ourselves to his junkyard

529
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,560
will give love the sanction.

530
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,600
It is now great greatness will stand,

531
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,900
and sound with noise in that then.

532
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,400
And there will be no weeping

533
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,460
as the junk man lies weak

534
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,340
on the memory of his bad bed.

535
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,200
Look, even now as we hold hands separately,

536
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,180
the crimson edge cuts across our silhouettes.

537
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,380
Don't let go of my hand.

538
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,460
It will be morning soon.

539
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,400
We can look at each other unafraid.

540
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,120
And in that morning we will laugh until the tears run

541
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,580
as we listen to the children of our children,

542
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,240
and the children of our children's children

543
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,120
sing the many melody to one song.

544
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,560
Oh, what a pleasant, lovely piece

545
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,620
by Ken Nordean, dear friends.

546
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,440
Good old, old, good old Ken Nordean.

547
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,860
In the mammal world, dear friends,

548
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,560
in the mammal world the predators

549
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,700
were traditionally carnivores.

550
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,900
Specialized meat-eating animals with teeth

551
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:13,840
modified for stabbing, killing, and tearing flesh.

552
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,320
Their legs were designed for leaping

553
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,540
and producing a turn of speed that could quickly bring

554
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,580
their chosen prey within killing distance.

555
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,060
They reached their acne just before the age of man,

556
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,640
but have since decreased in importance

557
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,000
and are now almost extinct,

558
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,520
except for a number of aberrant forms

559
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,980
found in the coniferous forests of the far north

560
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,280
and in the South American island continent.

561
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,900
When the carnivores were at their peak,

562
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,060
the rodents, particularly the rats,

563
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:55,560
began to acquire a taste for meat and animal waste.

564
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:55,560


565
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,120
The spread of man to all parts of the world

566
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,560
encouraged their proliferation,

567
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,340
and after man's demise,

568
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,240
they continued to flourish in the refuse

569
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,560
created by the disruption and decay of human civilization.

570
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,660
It is this adaptability that has ensured their survival.

571
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:24,320
The gnawing incisors developed long stabbing points

572
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,540
and were equipped with teeth

573
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,380
and blades that could cut and grip into their prey.

574
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,980
The other main predator is the raboon.

575
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,220
Descended from the baboons that flourished

576
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,360
on the grasslands during the age of man,

577
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,660
their diet changed from omnivorous to carnivorous

578
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,340
during the period that the big cats of the grasslands died out.

579
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,020
At the same time, they increased their speed

580
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,640
by taking to their hind limbs

581
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,980
and adopting a totally bipedal locomotion.

582
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,100
The forelimbs became reduced

583
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,300
and the head was carried further forward,

584
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,820
balanced by a thick, heavy tail.

585
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,640
In physical form, the raboon bears a distinct resemblance

586
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,960
to the carnivorous dinosaurs

587
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,380
that died out over a hundred million years ago.

588
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,140
The raboon stands about 2.3 meters high

589
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,220
at the tip, at the hip, pardon me,

590
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,080
and lives purely as a scavenger.

591
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,620
As predators, it is a predator,

592
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,720
and it eats only the softer tissues and muscles

593
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,540
of, for instance, the gigantelope's belly

594
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,880
or the anal regions where there is always plenty of meat

595
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,340
left for the scavengers.

596
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,580
The giant raboon concentrates on the meat

597
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,700
of the limbs and neck,

598
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,440
leaving the rest to smaller, less powerful carrion feeders

599
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,500
such as the primitive pink boys.

600
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,420
A less energetic tree dweller,

601
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,620
the sloth,

602
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,200
or the slobber,

603
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,780
or rheostostium corpitellium,

604
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,700
can be thought of as a kind of marsupial sloth

605
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,100
that spends nearly all its life hanging upside down

606
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,420
from trees and creepers.

607
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,760
It's totally blind

608
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,060
and subsists entirely on insects

609
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,860
that it catches in the flowers of its home creeper

610
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,380
by entangling them in long strands of mucus

611
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,060
dangled from its mouth.

612
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,860
Its large, downturned ears and sensory whiskers

613
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,980
alert it to the insect's arrival

614
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,160
and tell it when to drop the mucus,

615
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,120
which it aims at the flower's scent.

616
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,260
As the slobber's hair grows in spiral tufts

617
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,860
and is pervaded by a parasitic algae,

618
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,000
it is completely camouflaged against the background of creepers

619
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,700
and, when totally motionless,

620
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,700
can escape the attention of predators.

621
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,500
These readings, dear friends, are from

622
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,900
Life After Man,

623
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,240
a Zoology of the Future,

624
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,960
a true documentary.

625
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,360
A document,

626
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,800
as you should well recognize by this point in your stud-

627
00:33:59,240 --> 00:33:59,720
Respirate.

628
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,460
Yes?

629
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,020
Because the conspiracy wants you, children.

630
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,700
It wants to own you.

631
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,160
It wants a piece of you.

632
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,500
It wants your soul.

633
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,960
And we have to discuss this.

634
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,200
We have to discuss tonight

635
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,160
the ways in which the conspiracy wants to take you over

636
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,060
so that we might better combat it.

637
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,960
And the first thing we're going to discuss tonight, children, is

638
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:33,740
deregulation.

639
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,120
Yes, children, that's right.

640
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,000
We're going to discuss deregulation.

641
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,140
Do you remember flying in this wonderful country

642
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,120
prior to deregulation?

643
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,760
Say yes.

644
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,640
Absolutely, children.

645
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,940
The planes weren't full.

646
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,100
The air was clean.

647
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,540
The fares were low.

648
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,900
There was no way to the airport.

649
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,760
They didn't cancel.

650
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,460
It was a wonderful thing.

651
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,160
And also, children,

652
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,780
if you wanted to take a very short flight,

653
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,500
let's say you wanted to fly,

654
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,640
for instance, from, I don't know,

655
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,100
Northampton, Mass., to Buffalo, New York,

656
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,720
well, you could just get on a plane and go.

657
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,680
A small carrier.

658
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,080
Now you've got to go to Graffiti Field in Connecticut, Newark,

659
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,040
and blow your whole day.

660
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,220
Is that fair? Say no.

661
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:11,900
No.

662
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,020
Don't you deserve the flight you need?

663
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,960
Absolutely, children.

664
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,620
So let's carry this analogy further

665
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,460
and look at an industry that's been deregulating

666
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,880
since the beginning of time, children.

667
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,000
Because deregulation breeds monopoly.

668
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,300
And where do we have more monopoly than him?

669
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,580
Religion.

670
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,560
Religion.

671
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,460
Yes, children, religion.

672
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,640
Religion as a business has been deregulated

673
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,460
for years and years.

674
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,160
And if you want to talk to your God,

675
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,840
why, you have to go through one of the large

676
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,820
spiritual carriers, children.

677
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,440
You have to go through Muhammadism.

678
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,420
You have to go through baptism.

679
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,640
You have to go through Judaism.

680
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,900
You have to go through Catholicism.

681
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,220
And children, what if you want to worship in your own way?

682
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,940
In that case, children, you need the small, independent,

683
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,660
or spiritual carrier.

684
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,460
Isn't that right? Say yes.

685
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,060
And who is that small, independent, spiritual carrier?

686
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,940
Who is it?

687
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,580
Who is it?

688
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,680
That's right, children, it's Bob.

689
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,620
When you go to worship to Bob,

690
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,140
when you tithe to Bob,

691
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,340
that which is Bob's is the piece of your soul

692
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,260
that smudges off from your dollar bills.

693
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,620
Then you aren't worshiping in the way you want.

694
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,140
You're spinning in the eye of these deregulated,

695
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,340
monopolistic spiritual carriers.

696
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,440
Now, children, you know, a few months ago,

697
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,040
the whole earth horribly came out with an article

698
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,400
about the church of the subgenius.

699
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,620
And in it, in it, someone had the bald-faced temerity

700
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,840
to compare the Pope of the Pacific Northwest

701
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,440
to Jim Jones.

702
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,520
Shameful, children.

703
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,600
Shameful, I know.

704
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,340
Don't cancel your subscription here.

705
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,720
But you know, children, in my estimation,

706
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,920
in the estimation of the Pope of the Pacific Northwest,

707
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,180
Jim Jones was a piker.

708
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,280
A right piker, children.

709
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,220
An amateur.

710
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,280
After all, what did Jim Jones accomplish?

711
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,080
All Jim Jones managed to do is talk a hundred nilers

712
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,400
out of something they had no use for in the first place.

713
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,220
Their miserable lives.

714
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,500
But, children, I'm here to talk about something

715
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:19,520


716
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,680
This crowd of smart, hip, affluent, perceptive young go-getters

717
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,480
has something that means the whole world to you.

718
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,960
And that is your money, children.

719
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,360
I want your money.

720
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,680
But, children, children, children,

721
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,080
do I want it for myself?

722
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,200
Do I want it for the renegades of slack?

723
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,600
Who do I want it for?

724
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,820
That's right, children.

725
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,360
I want it for Bob.

726
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,460
I always want it for Bob.

727
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,180
Or K-N-O-N.

728
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,120
Oh, yes.

729
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,740
Dear, dear friends.

730
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,760
And you can call 823-7490

731
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,880
or 828-9500

732
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,860
and talk to the Will O' Dobbs.

733
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,960
If you're puzzled, if you're confused,

734
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,640
if you need to come to us

735
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,320
for a healing or an injury,

736
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,360
we can deliver either one.

737
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,400
Oh, it's so lovely.

738
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,240
Reverend Stang, I hate those bobbies

739
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,800
just as much as you do.

740
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,440
Remember listening to the testimony

741
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,980
of the Reverend Ivan Stang

742
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,440
of the Church of the Subgenius.

743
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,920
Reverend Stang stands accused

744
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,580
of selling hydrogen weapons

745
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,520
to the Malaysians.

746
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,180
I thought it was hydrogen peroxide, Senator.

747
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,500
Wasn't it hydrogen peroxide?

748
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,980
Hydrogen peroxide weapons.

749
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,660
Hydrogen peroxide weapons, that's right.

750
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,400
The giant foam bomb

751
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,900
and it was found in the back seat

752
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,860
of his Lincoln Continental, wasn't it?

753
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:48,980
That's right.

754
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,500
With the name of God, the Father Almighty.

755
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,900
With the Malaysian secretary.

756
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,220
The shredded body of the late Reverend.

757
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,000
Yes, that late Reverend.

758
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,040
Who was a Malaysian secretary in disguise.

759
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,380
Well, you can see him down there sweating.

760
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,100
I think it is getting hot.

761
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,180
He looks a little nervous.

762
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:05,760
There it is.

763
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,920
He seems a little upset.

764
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,300
He's removed his tie.

765
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,620
He's standing on top of the table now

766
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,220
and ranting.

767
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,020
You ought to be treated the way you are.

768
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,660
Twenty-five lawyers are trying to

769
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,500
power the Supreme Court

770
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,820
and they're fighting the conspiracy.

771
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,620
Stand up against City Hall.

772
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,740
I was starting Dr. Howard.

773
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,940
Today is the worst Tuesday

774
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,280
growing these books up at the council.

775
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,500
Yes, but he's mooting.

776
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,420
He's mooting the Reverend.

777
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,500
Please don't judge me too harshly, Bob.

778
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,660
I was good.

779
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,080
I was murdering anybody for you.

780
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:38,700
I'm talking to you, Bob.

781
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,160
We're going to have to scrub the skin

782
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,700
off this boy.

783
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,440
No trouble.

784
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,300
Reverend Sting, can you remember back on

785
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:52,060
last November 25th, your meeting with

786
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,140
Dr. Drummond and the President?

787
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,920
Could you please tell us what you were

788
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,700
talking about?

789
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,300
Well, to begin with, the famous six

790
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,920
subgenius girls that the press keeps

791
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,460
harping on, they were secretaries.

792
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,100
And they were very valued members of the

793
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,340
church.

794
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,320
They were helping us make decisions on

795
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:16,800
these things.

796
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,420
They know more about it than we do in

797
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,000
some cases.

798
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,700
So, and the President, I mean, he wants

799
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,760
advice and we're all too happy to try to

800
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,120
give it.

801
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,300
He can't, even someone in the position of

802
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,900
Ronald Reagan can't just call up J.R. Bob

803
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,740
Dobbs anytime he wants to.

804
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,120
So, uh,

805
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,020
Well, what exactly did you tell the

806
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,440
President?

807
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,440
Well, look, the transcripts are available

808
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,160
for $1 from P.O. Box 14306, Dallas, Texas,

809
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,300
75213.

810
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,820
And the

811
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:16,300
transcripts are available for $1 from

812
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:16,300


813
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:16,580
P.O. Box 14306, Dallas, Texas, 75213,

814
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:16,580


815
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:27,240
If I was in Lavite, I'd pay the same

816
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,240


817
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,240


818
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,260
This is Bill's

819
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:27,840
Home.

820
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,720
Can you bet a bunch on him?

821
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:34,860
Does he play basketball?

822
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:35,400
He does.

823
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,240
He wins a lot of você, you know that,

824
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:39,500
right?

825
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,040
Yes, of course he does.

826
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,300
He is from Los Angeles.

827
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,440
He is from San Francisco.

828
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,400
Yeah, he's from Florida.

829
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,480
What kind of people can he get

830
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:44,920
to hörate?

831
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,400
could be supportive.

832
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,960
We could be giving them hot lunches

833
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,520
in the home for slackless children,

834
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,800
and yet you expect me to spend it all on lawyers.

835
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,460
They're ready to go out to Slaughterhouse 301.

836
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,220
Slack.

837
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,120
Special classes.

838
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,200
Slack.

839
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,720
Oh, slack.

840
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,040
Line up for that slaughterhouse, you little bobbies.

841
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,400
It's easy how they could treat JJX like that.

842
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,020
Look how they cheated Jesus Christ.

843
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:15,800
Yeah, no kidding.

844
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,100
And look how they...

845
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,540
Well, we just got a hate call, dear friends.

846
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,140
It was great.

847
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,840
Somebody called and said,

848
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,900
well, I'd rather see...

849
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,400
I think the life of a cocker spaniel

850
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,100
in that laboratory being experimented on

851
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,160
is worth more than the life of Reverend Stang.

852
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,320
And I agree so much.

853
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,160
And think of those poor little bunnies out there

854
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,980
that are being killed by wolves.

855
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,140
And those poor deer that the wolves bring down.

856
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,720
And those giraffes.

857
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,400
The lions and tigers kill.

858
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,500
Oh, gosh, it's so terrible.

859
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,200
Death in the animal kingdom.

860
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,740
We should end all killing of animals,

861
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,940
even at the expense of the timber wolf,

862
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,160
the mountain gorilla,

863
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,640
the tiger, the Bengal tiger,

864
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,460
the African lion.

865
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,240
Let these animals fall by the wayside

866
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,800
because they're terrible.

867
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,320
They kill animals.

868
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,600
Of course they do it.

869
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,220
For a reason.

870
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,260
Not like us humans.

871
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,400
We don't do it for a reason.

872
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,560
We just do it for fun.

873
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,700
Yes, fun.

874
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,680
Fun, fun, fun.

875
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,800
I may sound like a Bible beater

876
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,580
yelling up a revival in a river crossing hand meal.

877
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,960
But that don't change the truth now.

878
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,280
I want to see if one person,

879
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,700
one single person,

880
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,880
will have the courage of their conviction

881
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,780
and come...

882
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,820
Come down here and open up to Bob

883
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,720
and give them, give me their wallet.

884
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,480
I don't just want your money.

885
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,820
Don't just want your credit cards.

886
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,440
We want your library cards,

887
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,860
your voter registration.

888
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,680
Give it all up now.

889
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,300
Actually, Bob doesn't care.

890
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,060
Bob is the richest man on earth.

891
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,900
He doesn't care if you spend money.

892
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,660
All he wants is souls.

893
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,300
He wants you to have slack.

894
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,740
He wants you to fight the conspiracy.

895
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,620
And it is going to take some fighting

896
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,120
because they are everywhere.

897
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,960
Powerful conspiracy.

898
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,920
The conspiracy is everywhere.

899
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,740
The television shows you watch,

900
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,800
the rock and roll songs that they play

901
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,000
over and over and over and over again.

902
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,420
Of course, this station excluded.

903
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,460
President's got me excluded.

904
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:33,300
But J.R. Bob Dobbs is here to spread abnormality.

905
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,100
Yes, the seed of Bob is your abnormality potential.

906
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,500
We're not talking about this consumer abnormality

907
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,160
which they forced onto your children.

908
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,020
We're not looking for a hip audience.

909
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,220
Please, get me behind the hip.

910
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,920
We're not looking for a sophisticated audience.

911
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,580
Bob, certainly not.

912
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,120
We're looking for an audience that is willing to believe everything.

913
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,360
An audience that cannot escape

914
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,080
because only then does it stop being an audience

915
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,640
and participate in the isness of Bob.

916
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,340
The last thing that we want is a vast stadium full of geeks,

917
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,800
80,000 strong waiting for us to come on stage and entertain them.

918
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,360
We want them to found their own church.

919
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,500
Get on the streets and entertain themselves.

920
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,180
Bob preaches short duration personal saviors.

921
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,900
You should skip from one personal savior to the next.

922
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:13,980
It could be a wine bottle.

923
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:13,980


924
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,740
We're a consumer society, ladies and gentlemen.

925
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,100
Planned obsolescence.

926
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,180
Things wear out fast.

927
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,020
Not our fault.

928
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,620
That's the way it is and we understand.

929
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,500
Look down and piss it.

930
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,400
You killed your mother.

931
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:24,980
Your servant.

932
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,660
You left her alone to die.

933
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,760
Shut up!

934
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:27,960
Shut up!

935
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:28,180


936
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:28,360
Shut up!

937
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:28,360


938
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:28,360


939
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:28,920
Shut up!

940
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:28,920


941
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:28,920


942
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,120
Shut up!

943
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:29,500
Shut up!

944
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:29,500


945
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:29,520
Shut up!

946
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:29,520


947
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,160
Shut up!

948
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,100
Shut up!

949
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:43,960
Shut up!

950
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,440
Shut up!

951
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,320
Shut up!

952
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,400
No!

953
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,060
Female?,

954
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,960
stay still here!

955
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:54,960


956
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,400
Uh, my life is like a

957
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,360
A few men,

958
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,240
depended over the penetrating

959
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,900
Laotian

960
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,700
balsamic cup,

961
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,820
cayenne,

962
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,440
zenia f Xbox,

963
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,340
ренozco

964
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,960
k化

965
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,080
And it can eventually produce for you what you don't want.

966
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,100
But you cannot get away from this power.

967
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,980
Just listening to what I'm telling you now can be the turning point in your life.

968
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

969
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,460
And, you know, we've been getting, boy, we've been getting some angry calls.

970
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,040
That's good, that's good, that's good.

971
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,100
They think we're bad people because we brag about eating animals.

972
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,240
And it's actually, to tell the truth, to tell the honest-to-God truth,

973
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:51,540
I think it's pretty appalling the way certain laboratories and old cosmetic testing groups

974
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,020
will hold a little bunny rabbit, a cute little bunny,

975
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:03,420
strapped down while they put chemicals into their eyes that are held open like in a clockwork orange.

976
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:08,720
And they put drop after drop of,

977
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,460
hydrochloric acid and so forth, you know, hairspray and things into their eyeballs

978
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:17,380
to see whether it would, how badly it would hurt a human's eye.

979
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,800
And when it wouldn't hurt it too god-awful badly, then they go ahead and release the chemical.

980
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,160
And that's, you know, that's, that is appalling.

981
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:32,740
But at the same time, that whole thing is mixed up with this insane notion about cruelty to animals.

982
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,740
And my God, man, what about cruelty to people?

983
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,620
Why can't we be more cruel to human beings?

984
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,780
That's what we're here for?

985
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,980
To destroy the planet?

986
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,300
That's what it says in the Bible.

987
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:50,780
So, uh, you know, hey, oh, oh, oh, and the other thing is, I should mention now, start mentioning,

988
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:57,260
that there's a subgenius, small subgenius, D-vival, coming up at the next Fantasy Fair,

989
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:07,080
uh, in, uh, let's see, that's on June 5th, Friday, June the 5th, at 10 o'clock at the Sheraton downtown.

990
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,380
It's the downtown.

991
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,820
It's the Sheraton Hotel.

992
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,240
It's the new one, I think.

993
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,300
It's at Live Oak and something, I believe.

994
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,480
I don't know.

995
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:14,980
I don't know.

996
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,240
It's in, yeah, it's inside a building.

997
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:25,640
And, uh, anyway, keep your eyes open for that, uh, subgenius revival, the 5th, at the Fantasy Fair downtown.

998
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:32,400
You'll have to pay to get into the Fantasy Fair, although, uh, usually, uh, you can get in for, for, uh,

999
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:36,000
K&ON listeners, if you can present a picture of Bob, you get in for nothing.

1000
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,360
This is free for all sort of thing.

1001
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:38,600
I'm going to go get some food.

1002
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:38,600


1003
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,060
Uh, under those conditions.

1004
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:40,880
Yeah.

1005
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,060
Yeah.

1006
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,080
So, we do continue, I suppose, here, somehow.

1007
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:57,240
Yeah, that America, or any country, values individuality as the highest ideal is a cheap myth.

1008
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:03,460
Everybody's an individualist, but they don't like individuals.

1009
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,540
But, friends, I'm here to talk about J-O Bob Dock.

1010
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1011
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:08,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1012
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,520
But, oh, oh, I shall talk about Bob.

1013
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,880
The church is everywhere.

1014
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,300
Oh, subgenius is everywhere.

1015
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:16,700
Yeah.

1016
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,000
They wear Bob on their shirt.

1017
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,840
They have a pipe in their mouth so they can be like Bob.

1018
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:28,300
But they've got, oh, they've got the church of the subgenius.

1019
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,760
Oh, yeah, they're saved.

1020
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,280
But that's all they have.

1021
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,380
They forgot Bob.

1022
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:34,260
That's right.

1023
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:38,360
They don't have, I think what it is, they don't have enough faith.

1024
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:47,960
They don't have enough faith in humanity or subgeniusdom or Bob or themselves to believe that there could be a J-O Bob Dock.

1025
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:53,820
I'm not of any of these offshoot subgenius fringe groups.

1026
00:49:54,080 --> 00:50:04,500
I'm the sole member of the Sagian Orthodox Megafiscombological People's Covenant Church of Docks Yet Resurrected.

1027
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:04,840
Yeah.

1028
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,720
And you can forget Connie's panties.

1029
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,120
You can forget the conspiracy.

1030
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,800
You can forget all that stuff.

1031
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,520
But you best not forget Bob, my friend.

1032
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:25,080
Because someday, someday it's quite possible that the conspiracy itself will own this church, lock, stock, and barrel.

1033
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,720
Oh, yeah.

1034
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,420
So you better watch, you Bob fans.

1035
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,420
You better watch where this church is taking you.

1036
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,820
Oh, yeah.

1037
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:49,660
Because, friends, this church, there's nothing wrong necessarily with the church someday coming up out of its underground status like something out of Night of the Living Dead and getting popular.

1038
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:55,700
But it's much easier to get popular in all the wrong ways, dear friends.

1039
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:03,140
And we'll see how long this book will stand up to the weasel-faced, slack vampires.

1040
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:09,960
And Bobbies out there, oh, they want to serve you, Bob, up on a silver platter.

1041
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,640
A fancy-bite Bob.

1042
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,060
A sort of good-natured, mellow Bob.

1043
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:21,460
And, friends, you best fear the day when Bob Dobbs becomes as wholesome as he looks.

1044
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,180
Because on that day, friends, your paychecks shall crumble.

1045
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,360
Your condos shall fall to the ground.

1046
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,120
Your rock and roll albums will melt in the atmosphere.

1047
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:33,640
Your masks fall.

1048
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,280
I will pray to you.

1049
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,300
You'll be begging.

1050
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:41,220
You'll be begging for one last breath of church air.

1051
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,960
You think Jesus had it bad.

1052
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,400
Oh, Jesus had to work an 80-hour week.

1053
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,360
Oh, poor J.J. Conymer.

1054
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:55,120
Friends, they're going to nail you up on a cross with electrified nails.

1055
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,560
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1056
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,760
They'll make you nail yourself up.

1057
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,740
And you'll be glad to do it at 20% interest.

1058
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,600
But how are you going to get that left hand in?

1059
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,420
How are you going to get the right one in?

1060
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,840
You'll have to pay somebody.

1061
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,540
But how are you going to get your wallet out of your pocket?

1062
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,380
Yeah, you think about that.

1063
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,960
Oh, you think I'm kidding?

1064
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:18,300
No.

1065
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,280
Oh, big joke.

1066
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,020
You'll know who Big Brother is, dear friends, sooner or later.

1067
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,980
And you'll know that hell is not some place down below.

1068
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,360
It's right here on earth.

1069
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,380
And when the demons try to tell you that,

1070
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,780
oh, you think it's a satire.

1071
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,700
You think you're being some kind of stand-up comedian.

1072
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,580
And someday you'll wake up, up to your neck,

1073
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:43,480
in false jobs, false sex, false money.

1074
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,680
And you'll say, where's Bob?

1075
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,340
Where's Bob?

1076
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,080
Three, two, one.

1077
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,080
The next time you head for your car,

1078
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,280
the Texas Medical Association wants you to remember this.

1079
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,360
When your car strikes another object,

1080
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:06,320
the impact is over in one tenth of a second.

1081
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,220
You have no time to brace yourself, much less protect your child.

1082
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,160
Correct use of safety belts and child restraints

1083
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,820
reduces injuries and saves lives.

1084
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,360
And this is some of that unreleased Devo that somebody was asking for.

1085
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,520
But I'm going to cut it off short and disappoint you.

1086
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:41,100
So that They Don't Think I'm area's

1087
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:45,980
Going on T18s,

1088
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:45,980


1089
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:46,600
I'm because I've been in season-마,

1090
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,620
and I don't want the away coule best

1091
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:50,620


1092
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,320
Got it?

1093
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,900
Thank you.

1094
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,040
Thank you.

1095
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,920
Thank you.

1096
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:21,980
Thank you.

1097
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,500
Thank you.

1098
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:06,980
Thank you.

1099
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,080
Thank you.

1100
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,400
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1101
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:20,320
And you can write to the Church of the Subgenius for more information at Bob at P.O. Box 140306.

1102
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,320
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1103
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:31,240
Once again, that's Bob at P.O. Box 140306.

1104
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,220
Dallas, Texas.

1105
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:39,680
If you so much as value your souls, 75214.

1106
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,040
Society is full.

1107
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,120
You will obey.

1108
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,960
Fill their minds with questions.

1109
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,940
Fill their minds with questions.

1110
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,920
Fill their minds with questions.

1111
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,300
Fill their minds with questions.

1112
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,780
Fill their minds with questions.

1113
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,800
Fill their minds with questions.

1114
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,760
Fill their minds with questions.

1115
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,720
Fill their minds with questions.

1116
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,360
Fill their minds with questions.

1117
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,100
That's not interesting at all.

1118
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,060
You'll buy our special process.

1119
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:09,300
A process in use since our first mom and pop operation.

1120
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,520
Who are we?

1121
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,520
We're the normal people.

1122
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,340
The most normal people in the world.

1123
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,840
But not quite as normal as you.

1124
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:22,620
Why?

1125
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,180
You're unique.

1126
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,980
It's natural.

1127
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,740
Everyone's unique.

1128
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,280
But you stand apart from the crowd.

1129
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,520
You're normal.

1130
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,320
Normal is a typical herd of sea cow.

1131
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,060
Normal is an exploding stellar nebula.

1132
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,620
Normal is the world in which we live.

1133
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:51,020
I think we're going to isolate them all in these baskets.

1134
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:51,300
I think we're going to isolate them all in these baskets.

1135
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:51,300


1136
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,400
It was not like that already.

1137
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,380
I've got a high dignbait back.

1138
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:57,820
They don't have the the� detachable demanded from survival cooking.

1139
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,100
Over the next ten days I think we're going to be all by ourselves.

1140
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,360
In the middle you've got a Dutch boy that Cornwall l książ propagated.

1141
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,020
We'll be up on Earth naked, and here were scientists krijgnafados.

1142
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:04,020


1143
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,140
On Earth mudarangkumaуть.

1144
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:09,500


1145
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:09,500


1146
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:09,500


1147
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:09,500


1148
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:09,680
But I don't work up the provision.

1149
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:09,680


1150
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,480
Let's get serious.

1151
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,060
I shoulda 관련 the fish.

1152
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:13,900
When we decide to replace euronazis.

1153
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,420
Cá niq.

1154
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,620
We are.

1155
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,420
yet another form.

1156
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,080
So hang in there, dear friends. This is

1157
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,020
KNON 90.9 FM

1158
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,780
in Dallas, Texas.

1159
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,660
You're listening to

1160
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,780
the latest from

1161
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,740
Hinton Templar from the

1162
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,120
Subelectric Institute.

1163
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,200
Help him somebody!

1164
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,140
You've lost your

1165
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,880
jersey as a player, John, and you

1166
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,440
have to record it. You're willing to

1167
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,220
trip up when you walk away

1168
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:00,100
in a fit.

1169
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:03,480
That was

1170
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,580
a scary one.

1171
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,220
I was a boy

1172
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,660
on the Iowa Barber.

1173
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:20,660
I was a boy

1174
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:20,660


1175
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:21,880
What is your mission?

1176
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,080
What is your

1177
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,300
cause?

1178
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,300
How can I

1179
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:41,780
be happy?

1180
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:43,800
What is your

1181
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:44,160
mission?

1182
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:48,840
What time

1183
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,460
do you think

1184
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,300
There is no

1185
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:50,660
hope

1186
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:51,140
in time

1187
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:51,140


1188
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:51,140


1189
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:51,140


1190
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:51,140


1191
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:51,300
what is your

1192
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:51,300


1193
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:51,860
What is your problem?

1194
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,220
Show off!

1195
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,720
Or you think there is no hope?

1196
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,440
I tried to fix this habit.

1197
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,360
Show off!

1198
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,620
What is your issue?

1199
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,540
What is your problem?

1200
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,780
You've lost your duty as a creator.
