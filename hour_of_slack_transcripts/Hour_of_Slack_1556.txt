Ladies and gentlemen, please do not panic, but scream! Scream for your lives!
Mob?
It's loose in this theater, and if you don't scream, it may kill you.
Scream! Scream!
Keep screaming! Scream for your lives!
It's here! It's over here!
Mob?
Let a man or woman venture from the well-beaten path of civilization.
Let him cross the threshold of the limited intellect,
and he encounters amazing, wondrous things,
the unknown and terrible.
If he escapes these weird adventures with his life,
he will usually find he left his reason behind him.
Perhaps that is what happened to these two souls,
lost in the great Mexican desert.
But then, ask yourself,
why would anyone,
trod from the usually well-traveled roads of this modern age,
from the luxury of an air-conditioned automobile?
A prairie squid.
That's prairie squid dropping.
Oh, the, uh, the desert, uh,
they have a poisonous sheath
that irritates the skin, so...
Well,
heh,

heh,
Randy sure told him, didn't he?
Can you imagine the delight on their faces when he pulled his panties down,
and there was the ogle stick that Grandpa had promised?
Ha, ha, talk about an oblique gesture.
Some say he was stumped that way from the day he was born.
Others say he'd been headed that way all his long and miserable life.
But, as they sat him down into his virtual moment chair,
for his last virtual moment in this here virtual life,
all he could think of was,
as the monitors dimmed was Mom's frozen apple pie.
Three hundred pounds of it,
sitting on his lap.
His hair's getting hairier.

I left my wallet in another suit
It isn't in my pocket
You won't need your wallet here
A thousand miles from the atmosphere
It's not a nightmare that's going to end
It's just beginning because it's inside me

Manipulating statements exaggerate the truth.
I can't believe the hate my show inspires.

It's not just because I'm stupid,
It's not just because I'm scum,
It's just because Republicans are liars.
Those dirty filthy liars.
I am heartless, I am vain, insensitive, insane.
They say that I'm a national disgrace.
Disgrace!
I am nasty, insulting, basically revolting.
I'm a concentrated pile of human waste.

You are a good consumer.
Blessings of the people. Blessings of the state.
We are only here to help.
Bend over. Bend over, human, and let us help.
And get ready for cultural warfare.
We're coming to your town.
Jesus is coming to your town.
We're the colonial purpose.
Get down on your knees and cry.
We're just here to help.
Praise Jesus.
Praise Jesus.
And to help you better, we must destroy you.
To save the town, we had to destroy it.
To save democracy, we had to destroy it.
To save the world, we must destroy it.
Destroy!
One, two, destroy!
Good job.
Hey man, when you're saving the world, why don't you save me a little piece, you know?
And then you can like blow up the rest and let me have some fun.
To carve up a world.
To carve a worm.
To carve a worm as neatly as one might carve a stick of bowtie.
To carve up a world between the corporations.
Which means between my friends.
And my friends' friends.
And here they are at the Monaco Parlor Ballroom.
This is a very exclusive place.
Inhabited and frequented by only the one percent of the one percent.
There's Mrs. Rockefeller.
Ready, stage left.
Oh, there's Mr. J.
Oh look, his skin cancer's much better now.
Look, there's Mr. Morgan. He's getting on in years.
Yeah, he's still got that terrible club foot though, but he'll be fine.
He's got more money than I need.
Somebody tell Dave to shut us down.
Oh, there's the Anheuser-Busch's.
I think we have one of the Dursetants underneath the bushes.
We're getting ready for the curtain.
There he is. He's by the curtain.
He's hiding in the Anheuser-Busch.
Sir, don't let me.
Get him, too.
Boom.
Crack.
Got it.
Crack.
What?
Crack.
Crack.
Oh, damn.
Thanks, Chaz.
Way to go.
Friends, that Rush Limbaugh song.
I don't know who Rush got to help him with that.
Although, I got it off of alt.binary slack via time control, friends.
Time control.
And that's what this hour number 774.
I'm going to do.
Of slack is about.
Time contain a whole stye full of Connie types.
Full of time control.
And show collisions will, of course, include KPFA puzzling evidence and G Gordon Gordon
Gary broke friend.
It's a lot less talking to any tape.
I know it's difficult if you haven't ever called up a radio station before and talked
to just a dumb old tape.
And here it is, an eight track tape answering you.
Yes.
But you can't believe you're talking to an intelligent machine player.
I know this is your future.
Your phones will act like us very soon.
Any question?
Bob will miss five.
Yes.
Seven, seven, six, two, four, three, eight.
Okay.
But that's your Bob.
That's right.
Yeah.
Bob is her guy.
I hear the sound.
Oh, yeah.
Our love will never fade.











Our love will never die.
Bob is my guy.
Bob.

Oh, yes.
Yes.
Yes.
This is stochastic resonant Bob.

Everything's digital here.
We're not live.
That's why we can't take any calls.
This show has been entirely on...
Basically, you have to use the digits of your right or left hand to operate anything on this show.
That includes move the turntable around with your fingertips.
But we don't use turntables.
We only use broken tape decks here on the Hour of Slack.
And friends, praise Bob, a tape deck can be smashed to pieces.
But if it's needed for the Hour of Slack, it will...
Friends, Bob, it's best to have a front zip you lops, doctor.
Oh, yes.
Has this ever happened to you?
Why, it should have been there, Ted.
It was great.
There was free booze, great music, one of the best parties I ever went to.
Where were you that night?
I just kind of stayed home and watched TV.
I guess I should have gone, huh?
Didn't you feel stupid?
Didn't you wish you could go back to that?
That night, that party.
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn how to do that very thing.
Introducing Bob's School of Time Control.
At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time,
slow time,
and make time run backwards.
But most importantly, you'll be learning how to make time work for you.
How, you may ask.
Well, just ask this man here, an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck.
Blango.
My dog was dead.
Was I sad till I met Bob.
Bob.
Bob showed me how I could...
Go back, get the registration number for the car,
do a slip job on the brakes,
and wouldn't you know it,
that truck went off into a ditch and burst into flames
just exactly a block before he could hit old Booger.
Ain't that right, fella?
Yes, just imagine the horrible things
that could be undone tomorrow
if you had only gone to Bob's School of Time Control today.
Courses start yesterday, but you can catch up.
Just right.
Bob's School of Time Control.
The universe.
Bob's School of Time Control.
A division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited.
Subgenius Industries Unlimited.
He...
stopped to watch for a few seconds.
Oh, hell.
Look, if he starts this thing, he won't be able to stop it.
It's immortality.
With a price more costly than death.
The world stops spinning and the clock stops moving,
but something's still ticking and wearing on the inside.
And every time you let it go like I'm doing right now,
you can feel the wear.
I know from 342 years of experience
that time control can only go awry.
So please, for his own sake,
tell the bastard to knock it off.
What if you could turn back the clock,
even on...
...the clock?
...on Earth...
...and start over again?
You know, would the same things happen?
Wouldn't you go back in time and kill Hitler?
Even though he might be the very one who killed the man who would destroy the entire world?
The first lizard.
No, say you could go back in time.
Okay, I would risk...
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I would go back in time.
Say you could go back in time to when the first lizard evolved.
Kissed Hitler.
Kissed Hitler.
Because we're really evolved from the lizards, right?
Okay, we're still lizards.
So you kill the first lizard and it's some other form of life that comes on.
Not a lizard.
Not specifically...
Maybe a polyp.
Not specifically a lizard.
Maybe a polyp.
Perhaps an insect-based intelligent life.
Polyps come out sometimes.
A hive queen, a Friday Jones species.
Okay, say our polyps were evolving at a rate that was so rapidly fast that we could not control it.
Would you go back, in a Hitler suit, like one of those first characters, a one-celled creature,
start your own jail and kill the polyps?
Would you step on that butterfly to make everything be spelled wrong?
And live you as Americans?
Would you do it?
Brace yourselves together with these mighty hernia braces designed by my cousin Lou and I.
Would you play frisbee with God?
Stand firmly and fastly in front of the rest of your renegade crew and laugh like dogs until the cows return.
Everybody has to eat shaving cream once in a while.
That stuff comes right out of the center of the earth.
And straight into our supermarkets.
The yellow sons of bitches.
They took their own lives.
Call me bastards, you cheated me.
When I was out among you, I always believed, as you did, that time exists in a sequential pattern.
One day following another.
One year after another.
Each century following the previous one.
But it's not like that at all.
Steve, you know what this is, don't you?
It's a time space warp.
I felt a communication.
A series of images.
After which I knew what was happening to us.
And I knew our fear was unnecessary.
Try putting an electrode soaked in saline solution on your head and another one strapped to your leg and then slamming two thousand volts between them.
If it hurts, let me know.
I have never seen anyone so terrified or so unable to release her fear tensions.
Are you screwing up my karma?
He must still be in shock.
All he does is sit around all day bobbling about some seven foot monster.
Even fish do it.
But what do they do?
In today's modern world.
In the year 2006.
Fish not only do it.
They do it in style at the downtown arena.
For moms and dads and kids alike.
It's done regularly in the water you're drinking right now.
So sit back, plop an ice cube and put those feet up on the chaise lounge.
It's time for the Sponge Patrol.
The fish are doing it, huh?
I don't like to watch this.
The fish doing it reminds me of...
Bob.
More recalcitrant.
More flaccid days.
Oh, I remember Bob and Connie on Valentine's Day.
The little bat-winged hearts.
You could almost see them.
Well, psychics could see them flying between Bob and Connie.
As they walked on the sidewalk hand in hand.
I could hear.
Pantsless and panties and skirts.
The boats going up and down the Seine.
You can hear the singing of the boat guys.
Bob with his funny little beret cocked on his...
The side of his...
Oh, look, he's wearing a funny little shirt with a nipple cut out so he can drink the wine and let it fall where it may.
No.
Like what I already did.
Or shopping for butt plugs.
A long way sacre de mer.
Ah, le sacre de mer.
Let's go over to Montparnasse and see if we can find those green butt plugs with his sequins.
They're so hard to find.
Yes, and we shall commit some paintings and some artwork.
Ah, we will commit...
And we will go to see Jerry Lewis movies.
Ah, the Jerry Lewis movies.
And we'll listen to Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
He also is a genius.
Ah, yes.
I love Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
True American stupidity.
Only the American can be so brilliantly stupid.
I listen to the audition all the time and believe me, for my limited anglais, I can tell you these people have no idea what they're talking about which makes them so funny.
Oh, la la, more truffles.
Hey, let's stop down by the river and have our feet crushed and sing a morality song from the Middle Ages.
Ah, ooh la la.
Ah, I remember those days well.
I remember when the Saracens attacked the city.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm going to flush myself.
I'm going to flush myself.
I'm going to flush myself.
I'm going to flush myself.
I'm going to flush myself.
Are you ready, Isia?
Oh, oh, oh.
Sit down and stop yourself.
Sorry, I was wool gathering.
The virtual moment is almost expired.
I wonder if you want more time.
Yes, please.
One thing, Waiter.
What country is this?
Well, at the current time with the checkpoint and also...
That's the other thing.
What time do you have?
What day, by the way?
Well, I'm afraid I have to make a terrible mess here and stop for a brief moment.
I don't recognize those cars.
What year car is that new one over there, Waiter?
Yes.
Uh, is, uh...
It's a brand new 1934 S4.
Oh, uh...
Brand new, eh?
Oh, man.
Time control.
It was just like the old man said.
Time control must always go awry.
I was a fool.
I was a fool to follow Bob and his insane plans.
He was like a madman.
Throwing these glass beakers and his Tesla coils back across the laboratory in a rage.
Trying to bring life to the battery.
Then finally he got it plugged in.
Then...
Oh, my God, man.
I thought that surely he was just a crackpot, a kook, a madman.
A madman.
But yet...
Obvi...
What?
Here I find myself in 19...
1934.
Some little town in France, I guess it is.
Ah, whistle while you work, monsieur.
I, uh...
I spill the wine in my forehead all over my lady's lap and all over your forehead.
I...
What is that in your forehead?
Time control.
Oh, what, what?
Oh, my God.
The clock.
Ah, a bigger mess.
Ah, this is wonderful.
I...
Wait a minute.
I...
I'm...
Let me look at this mirror over here.
Wait a minute.
The clock is...
It looks...
A quarter.
Why does it look a quarter?
Why does it...
No, it looks right in the mirror, which means it must be installed in my head in...
Backwards...
Do...

So that it will look right in a mirror.
What have they done?
What did Bob do to me?
Ah, Bob did nothing to you, my friend.
He put this stupid clock into my forehead.
Just relax, monsieur.
Everyone has this stupid clock in the forehead.
What is that?
What kind of insur...
What...
I mean, was this supposed to be a show?
What kind of insurance?
It's not a show, monsieur.
It was just supposed to be a show.
Miss, I am afraid you have used up your entire virtual...



Bob was like a monographer on the internet.
Please get out of the...
And he said go over there and push the button.
Yes, yes, yes, monsieur.
Next.
And I pushed the button and then...
Next, monsieur.
I'm sorry.
Your virtual moment is over.
No, no, Miguel, out of...
Don't...
Don't...

Before that new Monet Clippy Snips of bad film,
ESO Swamp Radio with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chan Smith,
and yours truly, Falling For Toby, clips from the film by Idnax Stang.
Bleepo did Bob's School of Time Control, and it's miraculous, friends,
as was the Tucson subgenius devival called The Oasis of Slack.
Sponsored by Tucson's own Reverend Crawford Smith,
as featured now in this special.
Report.
I'm going to post eternal salvation for 30 bucks, subgenius.com.
Stop that.
If I was the other people in that chat room, I'd be going,
oh, no, it's one of those subgenius creeps.
They're stupid Bob people.
Oh, God.
Speaking of stupid Bob people, man,
I just got back from a devival in Tucson where a very mysterious thing happened.
It's difficult for our modern world.
Statistics and electronics to accept miracles.
But you could almost call this a miracle, a genuine miracle.
Out of hundreds and thousands of square miles of heat and seared wasteland,
where the vultures wait for the other vultures to die.
The desert of death.
And it hurts.
It really, really hurts.
It's horrible.
It's horrible.
It's agony that begins and increases.
That's how you can tell it's a scorpion.
Aren't there the tiny little Arizona scorpions that scamper up your urethra?
Tail first.
As if daring you to try to squeeze them out.
This is the oasis of slack.
I got off the plane and here we are.
We're here.
This is the oasis of slack.
But I don't see the oasis.
And I don't see the...
I don't feel the slack.
Maybe the of.
I guess this is the of.
I don't know.
I don't know.
The of is the of.
I don't know.






The first mysterious thing was that Chicken, John and Mongoloid showed up all the way from
San Francisco.
With that 12 foot high 3D Dobbs head made out of wood frame, chicken wire and paper
mache and a blow torch.
That's the way I like it.
A giant Dobbs head.
Now, they were going to...
They really just had to get rid of it.
the damn thing. They built it
a year ago and it had been rotting.
The whole barbecue average.
What do you do with a giant 80 foot tall
Dobbs? You take the face
and you take it to Tucson.
The idea was they were going to trick
the Tucson host,
Reverend Crawford Smith. That's our cousin.
So easily tricked he is.
By leaving
the Dobbs head on
his doorstep.
This is like a 12 foot tall
monster face.
That some Dobbs like creature
had actually pertained itself into
his progressive energy.
And they did.
While Crawford and us were
at the party. But when we came back to
Crawford's place, the giant
Dobbs head, which they claimed they left
there, was gone. Gone
somewhere in Tucson or
mayhaps in outer space.
Someone has a Dobbs head so big that it
takes a pickup truck
and four people to carry it.
Doesn't that sound like the kind of
thing you'd like to happen
to you every day of your life?
You wake up early in the morning
and there's an 80 pound
60 foot high Dobbs head
in your front yard.
And as you step out across the mail
and newspapers and the dead laundry,
you notice that Dobbs
head's not only smiling,
he's talking to you.
And he's not only talking, he's
talking trash.
Because it's the giant Bob.
But it's deep.
Look at the size of that thing.
It's got dots the size of boulders.
No, I've never seen grain like that.
No wonder they make the sphinxes.
Look, here are the jewels.
We've got to get up to his forehead and
pull one of those out of his eyes and get
it back to Dobbs head.
But watch out for the brow.
Don't get caught in the brow.
Whatever you do.
Tangled mess of wires and cables.
Yes.
Steve gets out on the drive.
Some kind of cybernetic.
But here, we'll just push all this tape
aside here.
Instantly the gunman fires.
Oh, look out, look out.
He's shooting at us.
Oh, no.
No.
Look out.
They got me.
Let's get out of here real fast.
Here.
Get out of here.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
I'm going back for the glass files.
Going too fast now.
The tape's all wrapped around my legs.
We left all the drugs over there.
OK.
You don't have to try to carry me down.
This giant .
I've got to carry these hollow pills down here
and alter the president's body before the rest of these guys
get back.
The giant pills have been brought down from the brow.
This story's getting real confusing fast.
We can just hold out till next week.
OK.
I feel better now.
Maybe if I take some more of that wotan,
then I'll be able to walk out.
Rub a little gabrogfran into the sore part there,
and you'll be OK.
The legions are growing.
My name was Legion.
And yours is.
Hey.
Yours is.
Is Mr. Legion here?
Sir, you're.
Paging Mr. Legion.
Did you say your name was Legion, sir?
No, I said my name was.
Repetition is the key to the bandaged head.
Repetition is the key to art.
Repetition is the key to redundancy.
Repetition.
It is the key to learning and to dubstale.
And as the great gates open up and the high priestess ushers
Dave in.
They took down there.
Millie and I, that woman greeted us at the dock.
She was wearing a lei and a sauna dress.
Oh.
And she said.
She was related to the great late singer, Ima Sumac,
if you could imagine such a thing.
But there she was in a zip up top.
And her head was all zipped up, believe me.
There wasn't a pot showing.
And there was no sunshine coming through the back door either,
the way old Mammy and Pappy down on the farm used to sprinkle.
She was clean to the mug, 100%.
But they said they were going to still have to do a few things.
So she led us around.
We had a few eggnogs.
We stood and watched the trees burn.
And then we entered the actual inner center, center
sanctorum of Dom's town itself.
It was beautiful.
Look at those gigantic sculpted statues carved
from the native volcanic rock.
Oh my god.
They look like famous subgenius radio personalities.
What's that bald-headed one?
That's lonesome cowboy Dave.
And look at the trunk.
And look, the one with the giant lips that dances with rockets.
And that really handsome one, isn't that supposed to be Reverend Stag?
The butter's aligned with silver.
The mountain itself, by God, I just realized.
It's carved into a gigantic gob's head.
Stang, Stang, you must come over here.
The size of 10 Mount Rushmore's.
Try this chocolate phosphate drinking foam.
It's free.
Oh, my God, it's delicious and it's psychoactive, too.
I can feel my...
I can feel everything.
I can feel my knees.
I can feel my sandwiches.
I can feel sandwiches in my back pocket.
They're speaking to me, Stang.
Learn from the sandwiches.
Feel of your sandwich, Dave.
Feel of it.
Have you ever been kissed by a girl like this?
Strange.
The monstrous assurance of this race of puny bipeds with overblown egos.
The creature who calls himself man.
He believes he owns the earth.
And every living thing on it exists only for his benefit.
Yet how foolish he is.
Consider.
Even the lowly insect that man trods underfoot outweighs humanity several times.
And outnumbers him by countless billions.
In the continuing war for survival between man and the hexapods.
Only a nutter of food.
A fool would bet against the insect.
You have such reptile eyes.
Eyes like a lizard that weave their spell.
Landed the lizard.
See him running across the floor.
See him skittering out the door.
Hmm. I couldn't sleep.
Every little sheep that jumped over the fence landed under a horny ram.
The only time I want to feel somebody tossing and turning in bed is when I'm helping them.
Watch, Lilith!
I won't let lillith
Hey pumpbustH oh go ahead
Well x I think we do all agree P.W.S.h lillith is a beautiful woman
a beautiful man, a beautiful spiritual entity,
which few of us would dare to disagree with, I think, in the dark.
And sometimes that entity would light up its pipe.
Puppets Lilith, are you going to be at the Tucson Devival on February 10th in Arizona?
I'm going to be here in Seattle celebrating my 31st birthday
and working on the first ever subgenius she-vival.
Oh, she-vival.
The old Connie Devival has come abate.
Oh, the bitch. Will it never end?
Are you a transsexual or a transvestite subgenius?
Relay into the pit of the continent.
I've given my best in Bob for the past 15 years.
I'm willing.
I'm willing to give Connie a chance, and if you would too, I bet you would clean up for a change.
I've been into Connie before.
It wasn't all it's cracked up to be.
Connie's real nice, if you know what I mean.
Oh, yeah.
You ought to get real friendly with Connie.
Yeah, but who hasn't?
She's the lord of Babylon.
Who hasn't?
Who?
You know, what we should see?
She doesn't care about everything but using her 않을 file to save her weight,

What more could I want to do?

Well, here's a job offer that pass Nom and I laid.
We've got two Fleetwood Family dresses.
Good.
The Regent recently bought his brains,
and he put them on for him.
Why didn't he care ?

Most Albea
You make a very, very good point about the Benjamin standards.
I'm trying to turn him into a...
There's no law against wearing such apparel on the street.
Perfect ordinary people.
If you threaten to extend your violence,
this earth of yours will be reduced to a burned out cinder.
Now I will kill you.
Max, he's wearing a dress.
I think he's trying to mate.
Oh, dear.
I don't do humans.
No kidding.
It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet.
I think you're just a big bully,
picking on people smaller than you are.
There's no law against wearing such apparel on the street,
as long as it can be distinguished that man is man and woman is woman.
Go into a doctor and say,
hey, I want to be a woman the next day.
We're talking about spreading the wealth a little tiny bit.
Was that one of those original Martians
trying to...
Trying to tune in from afar?
Some people don't think God is a space monster.
I don't know.
Earth needs women.
I will swim out.
Earth needs a hell of a lot more women.
I think if Earth would tip the scale the right way for us guys,
I think our problems would finally be all over.
I think if there was...
All over the place.
Instead of 1.6 women for every man,
what if there was like 1.9 women for...
I know her, baby.
Come on.
Well, that would certainly make things easier on me.
There'd be more women for me, too.
You would be more woman-like,
or you would be more womanly from the contrast
of so much womanhood around you, too.
You could take it, you know, five or seven ways.
I take it any way I can.
Well, I'm sure you do.
Does the word lowlife...
Watch five or six or seven men and women doing it.
I'd rather be five or six or seven men and women.
I'd rather be five or seven men and women.

That's beautiful.
But what would a cacophonous experience like that be?
It would be so confusing.
You would not know your own id from your own tid.
Not only would you remove your own head from your own body,
but you would actually be forcing yourself into a situation
where you'd be looking at yourself from the inside.
There's no law against wearing such apparel on the street.
As long as it can be distinguished that man is man,
woman is woman,
and woman is woman.
You're just a big bully.
My significant other is...
...a pre-option sexual.
As long as it can be distinguished that man is man,
and woman is woman,
and woman is woman,
it's a pleasure, isn't it?
Crime and giving yourself over to...
Man is man.
Man is man.
Man is man.
Man is man.
Man is man.
Crime and giving yourself over...
Man!
Connie Spews there, friends,
from Reverend Protectrix, Amazonia.
And now we're going to dare delve deep into the folds of the Connieites.
Right now, what makes the guy you hate for the vienege feel morefalent than a woman or was
the rail mutants.
Additionally, many of the events of the past years would not have been accomplished
had it not been for Kanyiite intervention and direction,
including Dockstock in Amsterdam.
And it's funny because we really didn't plan it this way.
It simply became necessary.
We had mysterious visions and hang-up phone calls while the phone was unplugged,
but there were certain things we just had to do.
And I'm not doing any ass-licking today. I told you that, right?
Yes, yes. No ass-licking.
I'm telling you, it's getting so a fella can't get away from the goddamn sickies no more.
I left New York for that same reason.
Hell, I love that city.
As before, it got crazy, that is.
And all that atomic shit starts falling out of the sky.
And wherever a spore touches you, a parasite will grow.
A guy broke into the house.
Yeah.
He raped you.
You liked it.
He died.
They got used to eating human flesh.
He feeds those pigs dead people.
And then he eats the pigs.
So what? Everybody's sick. Everybody running away from everything.
And what are you, what are you, a troublemaker?
Yeah.
Terror, horror, death. Filming 11.
And I found this little parable about Kali
that perfectly illustrates the position of the Kanyites in the church today
that I'd like to share with you.
The goddess immediately set out to be battled with a dreaded demon in the form of Kali.
Her eyes were red, her complexion was dark, her features gaunt, her hair unbound, her teeth sharp like fangs.
As she rode onto the battleground on her lion, Raktabija experienced fear for the first time in his demonic heart.
Kali warned the gods to attack him.
She then spread her tongue to cover the battlefield, preventing even a single drop of Raktabija's blood from falling on the ground.
Drunk on Raktabija's blood, Kali ran across the cosmos, killing anyone who dared cross her path.
Now it's obvious that this ancient myth is just an archaic story about Bob, one of the old Bob's battles against the conspiracy, represented by the demon.
So while Bob, or Shego, was lost in meditation, which is just a diplomatic way of saying to fraud,
who went out to take care of business?
Why, of course, Kani, his consort, who incidentally can do miraculous things with her tongue, which kind of proves that the story is true.
She would be damned well as metal.
Solid, solid metal.
Impregnable.
I was so proud of her.
Well, I heard she is impregnable.
I was so proud of her.
She got up at the D Bible, and she preached her little heart out, and her mighty, excellent lungs were heaving as she preached,
and preached on the false Kanis versus the true Kani type.
She preached her beloved groins right off, and I was not sadder than anybody there, crying as I was, to see that happen.
She is a lovely person.
I mean, a more lovely personality.
A lovely personality.
And a playwright as well, who works for the EMS services.
Well, I didn't actually see that part.
I think I was just imagining it.
Well, you wish she was your daughter, don't you, Steve?
No, actually, now she's several years older than my daughter, and so it's okay, you know.
Ah, I see why I got the dirty old man looks.
Now I understand.
Well, you know, some babes, you know, like in their 30s, actually look younger.
So she actually is younger.
Technically, Reverend Nikki Deathchick is an employee of the, she's one of my fellow co-workers for the
I thought you were going to say she was an imperialist.
No, so if I were to cite fresh things about her and so forth, that could be construed as on-the-job harassment, you see.
Okay. We don't want you to harangue her on your job or any other place you go.
No, but I sure wouldn't mind it if she harassed me. Oh, yes.
Have you ever seen Nikki Deathchick in her nun outfit with that big old whip, that riding crop?
I personally would rather spank Nikki than have her spank me.
Well, she'd probably rather that too, and she's into guilt on both parties and taking turns,
because the guilt is what makes it all seem so forbidden, and that's what makes it so much fun for some folks, you know.
It just proves my point that we were the ones who were supposed to take over all along.
Oh, yeah.
It's not a situation of who's better or any retarded conspiracy-based notions of battle between the sexes.
It's just part of the plan.
For when the Coneyites have power, then will fear be placed into the heart of the demon of the conspiracy.
Fear!
But just last week, Sister Decadence, the producer of the Coneyite calendar,
was lamenting that we just don't have enough months in the calendar.
We have to wait another month in the year to display all of the fine Coneyite fates.
That's right.
But as in the story from Hindu mythology, it is important to note that the powers of the Coneyites are varied,
ranging from condus to bloodlust and everything in between.
Like the many arms of the goddess Kali, we all represent different aspects of Constance Marsh Doll, which is her full name.
Each claiming our own unique niche.
There has been the occasional pink female who tried to infiltrate the church.
One can only imagine Senpai the conspiracy to take the Yeti bloodline.
These were easily recognizable as pink because they were all the same.
Their basic act was to be like, hey, I'm a girl.
That's all I have to offer.
Look, breasts!
They didn't have that quality that all true subgeniuses share,
which is to be completely different.
And look how far we've come to bringing God's prophecy to light,
that there be many Coneyite Yetis all in life and ex.
Let us pay homage to all those who aren't with us this evening,
who have done so much for the sake of your slack,
like Sister Decadence, Mary Magdalene, Rabbi, Princess Wee, Barbie Yeti,
Angela, Pope X, Lilith, Friday the Ghost, and of course,
the queen of all Coneyites alive today, Sister Declan.
And now, the first lady of the church,
Sister Susie the Cluesie.
And everybody else who's made the text there that I forgot to mention.
If you want to be happy, keep your legs open and your mouth shut.
No, no, look, I want to get this straight.
You show them your purse, and that makes them pass out?
And thanks again for servicing our daughter.
She's gonna have an elephant?
Is she trying to say my wife screwed an elephant?
Now you know how powerful the devil is, and if you cross him,
he's gonna be mad as hell.
Shut up and let me think!
I gotta think.
This is killing me!
There's always so ugly she can scare a hungry bulldog off the back of a meat truck.
I suppose digging in cow dung is fun, is it?
It depends on what you find underneath.
I remember now.
After I passed out, I remember.
A serpent.
A horrible thing.
Towering above me.
Curled around a crucifix.
Fritz, get up for God's sake, get up!
They've killed Fritz!
They've killed Fritz!
Those lousy, stinking yellow berries!
Those horrible, atrocity-filled vermin!
Those just make-able animal warmongers!
They've killed Fritz!
Take that!
Take that!
Take that, you green slime!
You black-eyed, insured mullet!
Because of my interactions with false Kanye's in my earliest days of involvement with the church,
I never wanted to talk about Kanye or do things that seemed like I was placing my gender above my jettiness.
But things have changed.
My aspect has always been more of the Kali side of Kanye.
To get shit done and punish the guilty, while providing slack for the true followers of the path of God.
My contribution has been...
And will continue to be...
Giving you what you really want.
Which I'm finding out more and more...
Is to be teased and taunted...
While you feel that delicious, forbidden guilt.
So for your enjoyment and frustration...
I'm going to talk about blowjobs.
Blowjobs!
Blowjobs!
It's sort of the thrive of Nicki Death Chick and it's called,
My Blowjobs Are So Good!
Young brudes are a pain in the ass.
He's just a man. Horny like every other guy.
We're going back to that island, Fairbanks.
Back to find the beasts that chewed up your pals while they were still alive and kicking.
You want to come along?
Yes, I do.
We're going to find the beasts like the ones that chewed up my pals...

We've all heard we've been terrorized by what some people say is a sea monster.
What I say, it's only a fish.
And we're not going to be intimidated by a fish.
Now I've got big problems.
I mean, stuff that the dogs don't understand.
Well, why doesn't somebody reason with it?
Can't you control it? It's got to be stopped.
We're your government. We're the good guys.
Appreachment, dear friends, you're about to receive
on John Barleycore, nicotine, and the temptations of Eve.
Okay, that's it. It was so good.
For once I was happy and had a good wife.
I had enough money to last me for life.
I met with a gal and we went on a spree.
She taught me to smoke and drink whiskey.
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood
And wild new bridges, they'll drive you insane.
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood
And wild new bridges, they'll drive you insane.
I, I sing temptation with you.
Please.
Cigarettes is a blot on the whole human face.
A man is a monkey with one in his face.
Here's my definition, believe me, dear brother.
A fire on one end, a fool on the other.
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood
And wild new bridges, they'll drive you insane.
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood
And wild new bridges, they'll drive you insane.
Say, Debra, say, Debra, dear friend.
Somebody get that bum out of here.
Brother, repent or they'll write on your grave.
Two women and whiskey, here lies a poor slave.
Hey, boy.
Good morning, dear stranger.
Say, morning, dear friend.
They'll write in big letters these words that then
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood
And wild new bridges, they'll drive you insane.
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood
And wild new bridges, they'll drive you insane.
Listen.
I want to hear it.
I want to hear temptation, you hear?
That's what I want to hear, temptation.
Hold it, brother.
My friend, I'm afraid you're in the wrong place.
We don't sing that kind of music here.
Okay.
Then show us your muscle.
See?
Good God.
The prediction came true.
Now what's next?
The Bible's life.
It's Bob's pipe.
It's a young, hipster teenager girl with a Bob pipe in her mouth and a broomstick inserted
just the way Bob predicted would be the new fad of the...
Now, speaking of things that come and go, speaking of fads, is that a real broomstick
or is that one...
When you see a broomstick where it shouldn't ought to be, whether it be inserted by New
York Police Department or Bob Dobbs himself, friends.
You know the end times are coming.
And so are a lot of gross perverts out there, of which I am not that kind myself.
No.
Nay, brother.
And I only look at these things.
Dr. Sharks, you just want to look at it in your eyes, the yellow metal dripping down
from the corners of your eyes.
You got to know your enemy.


Praise the Lord, to pass the admonition.
Praise the Lord, to pass the admonition.
Sometimes I wish God would give me a Holy Ghost machine gun.






I'll blow your head off.
There's some new words that are being described very blatantly.
Let me give you an example.
In the lyrics of songs, when you hear them sing about engine, motor, or machine, they're
referring to sex.
When you hear them sing about funky, they're referring to sexual odors.
When they sing about groovy, they're talking about the position of intercourse.
When they sing of get off, they're singing about the goal of lovemaking.
And then you hear them talk about sex.
When they talk about it, they're singing about groupies.
They're talking about rock prostitutes.
I am a groupie.
The bee, bee, bee, bee, bee, bee.
Do you know what a groupie is?
I am a groupie.
I'm a groupie.
You're a groupie.
A rock group freak like me, who digs musicians and follows them night after night to wherever
their gig is.
I am a groupie.
I'm 16 years old.
I am a groupie.
I get where I want to go, any way I can.
I'm a groupie.



I can swim trips, a van, or daddy's wheel.
All I want is to be free, and all I've got are looks and a few gimmicks.
I am a groupie.
I am a groupie.
I am a groupie.
I'm a groupie.
I'm a groupie.
I'm 16 years old.
I am a groupie.
I am a groupie.
I'm a groupie.
I'm a groupie.
I am a groupie.
I am a groupie.
The beat.
I would say at this point that it's absolutely incredible
to hear those primitive drum beats
and the overt and blatant reference to Satan.
That is unbelievable.
Every time I hear it, it gets me,
I guess the word to describe would be the creeps.
Sometimes late at night I have to play this beat,
and it's not fun to play that type of beat after midnight,
believe me.
But if you think that's unbelievable,
I've got more of this song for you.
Here's BBC, and you're out there on it.
This is my, I am a groupie.
That music was by the Bran Flakes, friends.
And this is Reverend Stang talking in 2016 via time control.
At one point in this episode,
you hear Lonesome Cowboy Dave say,
here in the year 2006.
But he was saying that in the year 2001,
whence came this show almost 15 years ago,
when the hour of slack was in the middle of its,
so far, 30-year run.
But about the Bran Flakes,
I got some news about the Bran Flakes
from our old friend St. Andrew.
Who said,
I was hoping to ask if you'd be so kind as to mention
that the Bran Flakes have an album out on vinyl.
If you'd like a copy, let me know.
I'm hoping some will still be around this summer,
so I have a business excuse to make it to the first X day
since before the towers fell.
It's my company's first vinyl release.
Just got them back from the plant yesterday.
Pressed in the original town of Dobbs, Dallas, Texas.
And you can find,
you can find this at
thebrandflakes.bandcamp.com
The brand flakes being all one word.
.bandcamp.com
You can also look at subgenius.bandcamp.com
For Cleveland area listeners,
I wanted to mention that the Winter Star Ball
will be held Sunday, February 28th
at the Beachland Ballroom.
And that has a kind of a miniature,
a miniature devival in it,
with Reverend Baby Bear preaching.
She'll also be emceeing for various bands and jams,
including the band Burning Sage.
That's February 28th at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland.
You can look at subgenius.com events for details.
Price Bob.
Anyway, now back to Chaz Smith's ESO Radio
from WCSB Cleveland from 2001.
Like it or bend over, that's the way.

Let it melt, melt, melt
down into a little puddle

soup.

and now I want, stay tuned,
friends, you internet listeners, for
Nikki's X-Rated Rant
after Z-Zot.
...

...
...
She's pretty, don't you think?
And you creeped her out.
I felt even more
uncomfortable when my father
suddenly began taking his clothes off.
And before I could say Sigmund Freud,
my father
put on this, this, this diaper
to see my own father in a diaper.
Oh!
What do you think could have done that to him?
I wish I knew, Lieutenant.
But look at the way his skin and clothes are torn.
It's almost as if, I don't know,
it's almost as if he exploded.
If you're always in this condition,
it's quite obvious you couldn't get it up,
even if you used a cray.
Oh, this, must you always smother my cooking
in tornadoes before you even taste it?
There is so much
to see and know there is
a path for men to go.
It's good to travel wide
and then it's good
to come back home
again.
Fasten safety belts, please.
Fasten safety belts, please.
We're coming in for an Earth landing.
Now we're turning.
Our tail will point toward the Earth
and we will slow down our landing
with our tail rockets.
There's the field below.
People say in Boston even
beans do it.
Beans will do it, friends.
Let's go.
Home again.
My blowjobs are so good
that I will be solely responsible
for the second coming.
My blowjobs are so good
that Bob himself offered to pay me for one
and I told him he didn't have enough money.
My blowjobs are so good
that they had to rename
Deep Throat's shallow indentation.
My blowjobs are so good
that they're a felony
in most southern states.
Ouch!
My blowjobs are so good
that I cause rigor,
and I'm rigor mortis in the living.
My blowjobs are so good
that I make porno actresses
reevaluate their career paths.
My blowjobs are so good
that Connie herself called me up
and asked me for lessons.
Yeah!
Woo!
Woo!
My blowjobs are so good
that the Pope declared them a mortal sin.
This one's really gross.
I'm fond of it.
My blowjobs are so good
that I regularly need to give
my stomach pumped.
Oh!

Oh!
50!
My blowjobs are so good
that my longest blowjob
involved time travel.
Oh!
Here's another one along the same lines.
My blowjobs are so good
that my mouse gravitational pull
is in danger of creating a black hole.
Oh yeah!
I give Stephen Hawking nightmares!
Oh!
My blowjobs are so good
that if I ever became a lesbian,
the suicide rate would triple overnight.
Oh!
My blowjobs are so good
that last time I hit a popsicle in public,
I got charged with violating public abstentions laws.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
My tongue can fold in ways
that only M.C. Escher could understand.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Aw!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!


All right, exactly!
Krr!

All right!







All right, Emily's the best.

Allow me to give you a shout-out.
Well, there's always some stuff in my life,
until you want to coming back and講 that we're talking about .
And that's because some episodes do mention
creating radius like erractions,
T'Von is a Spanish-ίν вещer
Or rather,
a st impersonal formation evangelist!
But he can't find blowjobs on there.
So he goes out and asks an altar boy,
What does a pastor usually give for blowjobs?
And the altar boy says,
Oh, about five bucks.
Alright, that's enough.
And Reverend Amy Gelschich,
please order some shins so I can keep my job.
