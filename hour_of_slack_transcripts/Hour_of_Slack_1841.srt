1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,060
What are you going to do? What is it you want of me?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,100
I am going to remove your soul, your mind if you prefer, from your body for a time.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,280
You mean my brain? You're going to take my brain away from me?

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,940
The Self-Genius Power of Smartness.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,560
Oh no, why don't you kill me?

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:32,920
Friends, this episode, recorded live at 24X Day at Land of Id in Land O'Lakes, Florida,

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,720
with special guests Dr. Howell and Father Joe Mama,

8
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:49,580
may be a bit of a challenge for the listener because the recording quality was affected by seriously loud torrential rains.

9
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,660
And although we were under a roof,

10
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,120
we were still outside in it without walls.

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:05,480
So this recording took some serious filtering with the levelator to be comprehensible.

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,760
And Dr. Howell especially was horribly over-modulated.

13
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,340
But I think it's worth it.

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:19,120
I just heard it for the first time because I couldn't actually hear Howell and Papa Joe then a lot of the time.

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,020
My hearing aids were shorted out by the humidity.

16
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,500
And the background rain noise sounded like a freight train.

17
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,120
And I'm...

18
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,300
...deaf.

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,320
And, uh...

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,920
Well...

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:41,160
There's a joke by me that I had to censor even from the X-rated internet version of the show because it's too funny and it might hurt somebody.

22
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,140
Oh, yes, dear friends. Welcome to the Hour of Slack.

23
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,940
And let's keep it to one hour because I'm tired already of bulls**t.

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,200
Oh, yes, dear friends. Welcome to the Hour of Slack. And let's keep it to one hour because I'm tired already of bulls**t.

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,640
Thank you for watching. And I'll see you next time. Bye.

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:52,640


27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:52,640


28
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,840
B meeting for the rain, oh Wotan.

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:03,100
Well, an hour will bring us to quarter to three, the local time here in the great state of Florida.

30
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,560
No one...

31
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,860
I just noticed something about my recording.

32
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,540
It's...

33
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,380
It's Florida the sunshine state.

34
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,920
California is the golden state.

35
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,600
The moonshine state.

36
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,660
Indiana's the hoosier state.

37
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,540
Illinois is the sucker state.

38
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,180
Um...

39
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,420
New Jersey's the garden state.

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,760
And if you travel in northern New Jersey, you'll see that's a good name.

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,120
But actually, I'm asking, because I'm not sure, isn't Florida the sunshine state?

42
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,160
We're the moonshine state.

43
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,640
No, it's the reclaimed water state.

44
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,760
Well, many things to many folks.

45
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,400
But I was wondering about the official moniker.

46
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,780
Like there's a state bird, a state bug, a state plant.

47
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,160
The mockingbird is our bird.

48
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,500
It's certainly here.

49
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,980
It was the best replacement we can come up with the official bird, which was the mosquito.

50
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,480
Right.

51
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,760
Well, I read about the unusual life forms here.

52
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:15,360
Not only the West Nile virus mosquito, but the anopheles, the terrible kissing bug or cone-nosed bug that spreads Chagas disease.

53
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,420
Don't forget Zika.

54
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,120
We love that.

55
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,880
Yes.

56
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,540
The tick.

57
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,040
The Chagas, of course.

58
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,400
The subcutaneous burrowers who leave their excrement in dead bodies in your wounds.

59
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,400
They only do that when they're babies, Hal.

60
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,800
When they're mature, they become vegans.

61
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,100
They bore their way out through your body when they are adults.

62
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,960
But, you know, I'm not afraid of them out here.

63
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:50,100
I think the weather is too extreme for them to do their thing.

64
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,560
I'm wondering if the radio audience can hear the rain.

65
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,200
It comes and goes.

66
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,460
It's torrential right now.

67
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,940
It sounds like a train going by.

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,060
Yes, like a tropical downpour of sudden violence and fury.

69
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,800
It's going to be the same way on next day, except it'll be blood instead of water.

70
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,860
It's like Hawaii.

71
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,320
They have the very intense rain and then a rainbow and then sun.

72
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,480
If you don't like the weather, wait a minute.

73
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,080
I know.

74
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,400
And volcanoes.

75
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,580
Well, yes, there is that.

76
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,180
Earthquakes.

77
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:30,060
They are the volcanic top of a seamount, as is Balls Pyramid Island.

78
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,940
I'm sure you don't want me...

79
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,900
We covered Balls Pyramid Island.

80
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,420
Yeah, I know.

81
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,660
I'm not going to bring the island up this time, but...

82
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,240
Well, we don't have volcanoes in Florida, but we do have sinkholes, and they achieve the same purpose.

83
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,800
We give sacrifices to the sinkholes.

84
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,780
They engulf cars, houses, animals.

85
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,560
And men.

86
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,040
We've done away with the ceremony.

87
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,900
They just usually drive right into the sinkholes involuntarily.

88
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,440
The rain is raining all around.

89
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,280
It falls on field and tree.

90
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,040
Yeah, it wouldn't be so bad if only we had a roof over our heads, but it's shortened out my hearing aids again.

91
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,140
It's true.

92
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:17,480
Like Mr. Giuliani's hair dye, the moisture ran into Pastor Stang's hearing assist device

93
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,080
and caused a violent short circuit.

94
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,400
Yeah, it shocked the hell out of me.

95
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,120
I saw Bob last night when that happened.

96
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,980
It was like being struck by lightning.

97
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,100
Only...

98
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,320
But not the rest of the people.

99
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:30,600
Not as much fun.

100
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,340
I didn't come.

101
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,880
Let's put it that way.

102
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,520
Well, the radio listeners should be thankful, because they can't actually see that we're actually up here,

103
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,160
getting rained on, soaked, completely naked.

104
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,420
I think they'd enjoy that.

105
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:42,920
And I'd enjoy that.

106
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,760
All naturism and health, as explicated by Doris Wishman in her many films,

107
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,160
have you seen him staying?

108
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,200
No, well, I'm not sure what you just said.

109
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,460
Doris Wishman.

110
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:05,020
I referred to the oeuvre of Doris Wishman, the mediocre filmmaker who was lauded by connoisseurs of, quote,

111
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,900
incredibly strange films, unquote.

112
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,280
One of them, for example, I think was filmed right around here, maybe even here,

113
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,720
and it was called Mood on the Moon.

114
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,760
Has anyone ever seen this film?

115
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,440
I started to watch it.

116
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,560
And turned it off.

117
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,080
Well, it's very boring, of course.

118
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,740
Somebody showed me the moon yesterday.

119
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,740
So what happens is these two astronauts who get in some kind of a rocket,

120
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,780
and they talk to each other over their microphones, although they're sitting right next to each other,

121
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,100
land on the moon, they walk around, they come to a wall, they look over it,

122
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:44,640
and they're all these babes with antennas, bobbing antennas and panties, lounging around.

123
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,840
Did you say bob?

124
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,200
We're passing out bottles of water.

125
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,780
Oh, how nice.

126
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,860
To the dehydrated preachers up here.

127
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,680
Oh, you can't imagine the sensual pleasure of that.

128
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,660
Has anyone mentioned the Dobstown Weekly Whiff Reader publication up here during the Hour of Slack?

129
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:12,180
Yeah, I noticed a fine job had been done on it in all the good traditions of subgenius journalism.

130
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:19,060
Yeah, it's here's some headlines on the front cover of the Dobstown Weekly Whiff Reader.

131
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,680
Captured normals escape via underground tunnels.

132
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,020
Exclusive conspiracy sex slave sting in Florida.

133
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,420
X-Day has arrived.

134
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,480
Elite crew of determined yeti gather at new ritual site.

135
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,920
Well, it's pretty elite because there's only about 12 of them here so far.

136
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,240
These are the ones attending us at the present time,

137
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,160
but we cannot see the legions of future listeners.

138
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,220
These documentations.

139
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,980
Well, and the sheets of rain make it hard to see the audience.

140
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,620
Well, we really have to get that war on God thing squared away

141
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,840
because every time you talk, the rain intensifies.

142
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:02,980
It's a conspiracy.

143
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,660
Oh, so it's my fault, huh?

144
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,100
Well, I'm not blaming you.

145
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,380
You sound just like Princess Wee.

146
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,780
It's just the tech tactics of the other side.

147
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,520
I think the exes are just punishing Sting for bragging for the fact that he can read.

148
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,300
I can't wait to hear what you're saying in the recording.

149
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,060
I'm going to have to get a little bit of a good reading later on, Papa Joe Mama.

150
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,680
Play it back.

151
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,900
Yeah, friends, we have the illustrious Father Joe Mama here.

152
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,720
You'll have to take our word for it.

153
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,020
Yeah.

154
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,560
His voice is the exact timbre of the rainfall that's falling.

155
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,760
You needed special equipment to tease it out.

156
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,160
Well, I often have people say that my timbre is very similar to yours, Dr. Howell.

157
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:49,320
Well, it may be, but it's a question of who the rain will allow to pass.

158
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,280
It's a question of who the rain will allow to pass through its curtain.

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,800
Well, the tone may be similar, but the vocabulary is certainly not as expansive.

160
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,740
Here's my favorite inside joke on the cover of the Dobstown Weekly Whiff Reader.

161
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,920
Beargate survivors speak out against new Fid Chooley joke.

162
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,460
Not everyone knows about Beargate.

163
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,520
No, but since that caused tremendous damage to the church, I don't know why we need to

164
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,260
rehash it again.

165
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:18,520
It didn't.

166
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,420
It didn't cause damage.

167
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,540
It didn't cause tremendous damage at all.

168
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,420
Well, I promise not to say my joke about it.

169
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
What the hell?

170
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,800
I'm kidding you.

171
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,040
You should say the most incendiary, uncorrect joke that you can manage.

172
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,220
After all, you earned the right to say it.

173
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:42,020
Well, after the abuse of the bear allegory that apparently triggered a person.

174
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's get this in the absolute variety.

175
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,180
Let's put it this way.

176
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,120
The church has improved.

177
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,660
Improved a great deal.

178
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,440
It started with Lagoon telling bear jokes.

179
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,440
Isn't that correct?

180
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,300
Well, it was an allegory.

181
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,040
It wasn't a joke.

182
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:05,220
It was an allegory about the fear of camping on the part of nerdly city boys.

183
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,100
Who should instead be encouraged for camping.

184
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,460
Did you just say Lagoon?

185
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,200
It was not a PC joke in a way.

186
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,080
Did you say Lagoon?

187
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,380
I brought Lagoon with us.

188
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,260
All right.

189
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh, my God.

190
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,140
The hammer of Lagoon.

191
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,160
Yes, I did.

192
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,880
Interesting that the table supports its weight.

193
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,620
I wouldn't do that for Thor's hammer.

194
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,320
I can't believe you're even able to lift it.

195
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,640
Well, it's only temporarily given the power to do so until it gets on inside the saucer.

196
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,500
And then I lose that power.

197
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,480
Well, of course.

198
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,120
You're not going to want a hammer inside the saucer with those delicate instruments.

199
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:44,640
It's kind of a slightly smaller version of Thor's hammer.

200
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,020
Yes, this is from Lagoon.

201
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,080
And it had to be hand-delivered to me.

202
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,100


203
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,100


204
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,320
By the only other person who could carry it, which was Onan.

205
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,180
He had to trek all the way down to Tallahassee to deliver that hammer.

206
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,200
Because it was weighing down the plane.

207
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
The plane couldn't take off.

208
00:10:59,620 --> 00:10:59,760
Right.

209
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,360
Only a holy man can lift it.

210
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,080
No machine can budge this sacred hammer.

211
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,520
You have to be holy, holy.

212
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,220
He hammered a lot of bobbies with that thing.

213
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,140
He wants it back.

214
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,720
And he's instructed that it be placed on the saucer to get it to him.

215
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,460
So, we're looking forward to delivering that.

216
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,560
Oh, okay. Good.

217
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,080
In person.

218
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,100
As long as it's secure and doesn't move around and affect the instruments.

219
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,520
Yeah.

220
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:30,340
And also, if it's piloted by XS, it should be able to damage the delicate telemetry device.

221
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,800
So, he's here in spirit.

222
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,200
You can, you know, adjust everything to it.

223
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,800
Yeah, the church a lot of when that Bear Gate thing happened.

224
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,560
That was my thing I wasn't going to say because it's shaming and triggering.

225
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,020
Oh, that's how you know you're listening to the uncensored version of the show.

226
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,100
Certain people who, as Lagume put it, themselves to death.

227
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,320
Boy, am I going to have to edit that one.

228
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,160
I thought butt was okay.

229
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,480
You can't say butt on the radio?

230
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,240
I say it all the time.

231
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,360
No, not anymore because, you know, it offends the unbutted.

232
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,400
But, but, but, but, oh, never mind.

233
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,000
Be careful, man.

234
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,040
You can't be funny these days.

235
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,840
It's against the law.

236
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
You can be funny.

237
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,780
You just can't be disrespectful to people.

238
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,140
And a lot of humor is based on being mean to people.

239
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,560
Yes.

240
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,200
It's harder, but it's not impossible.

241
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,700
We like to be nice to the peeps and the gnomes.

242
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,740
We like to give them a bubble bath.

243
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,580
Yes, that's right.

244
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,040
For about four days.

245
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,080
We don't like to trigger the conspiracy.

246
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:28,860
Hmm.

247
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,720
Well, that triggers me when that happens.

248
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,400
When it gets to July 5th, they're going to see what triggering really means.

249
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,340
As in a Gatling gun trigger.

250
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,760
Every time that Roy Rogers' horse Trigger is mentioned, it triggers me to a point.

251
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:49,600
I have an unpleasant memory of the museum where he's stuffed and on display and gradually falling apart.

252
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,580
Yes.

253
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,060
Triggered you and the horse you rode in on.

254
00:12:53,340 --> 00:13:02,960
Well, on Trigger, you know, many horses in Hollywood had extraordinary careers because they understood they were in a show and knew what they were supposed to do.

255
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,420
And they were very highly prized and requested by the actors over and over.

256
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,120
I'll do the show if I can get Dollar.

257
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,940
But if I can't ride Dollar, I'm not going to do your show.

258
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,360
So, there were more unspoken heroes of Hollywood.

259
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,300
Then there were the horses that were trying to fall down and break their legs.

260
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,020
That was a good thing.

261
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,160
The less lucky horses.

262
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:37,780
They didn't break their legs when they fell down, but they did when what was called a running gig was operated by Yakima Kamut and other stunt people of the 1930s where it would just be a cable.

263
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,480
It would run out.

264
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,980
Then they would stumble and fall.

265
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,200
Yeah, they didn't call this.

266
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,440
It was a synchronized gunshot.

267
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,760
Those weren't stunt horses.

268
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:43,760


269
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,040
Those were stub horses because they would usually cut the leg off after that.

270
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,640
And, you know, it was not just horses.

271
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,300
And the movie 1 Million B.C. is full of abuse of all sorts of animals.

272
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:08,140
Not only of the indignity of having fins and dinosaur horns glued on them, but also are actually forced to fight and kill each other and fall into fiery pits.

273
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,760
And in one case where Lon Cherney Jr. in the role of Aqoba is killed.

274
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,320
He's crippled with a horrible compound fracture.

275
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,640
The bones protruding through his skin.

276
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:28,440
Yakima Kamut did that on a running ram of some kind, which was tricked up with skins to look a lot larger.

277
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,280
This is before.

278
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,360
And that's why we showed that movie two years ago at X Day.

279
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,720
Well, not to revel in its cruelty.

280
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:43,340
You know, they got the everything we wanted on screen and nobody cares about if a bunch of little animals got hurt.

281
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,000
Well, but let's.

282
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,160
I mean, that's their idea.

283
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,920
We should be.

284
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,780
No animals were harmed in the production of this X Day party.

285
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,260
No, we'll never harm animals anymore.

286
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,700
Let's get that on the record.

287
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:01,220
And let's also make it clear that when this was done, that was before they knew about dinosaur appropriation.

288
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,520
When they were putting those little fins on iguanas and horns and stuff like that.

289
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:12,420
I mean, if Erwin Allen had any idea how many woke laws he was breaking by doing that, he never would have done it.

290
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,520
He was a very sensitive man.

291
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,960
And I still feel embarrassed for that iguana.

292
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,080
The the the woker than thou will face the judgment.

293
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:30,200
When the sleeper wakes, we all wake to new life in Bob on the glowing saucers of the space goddesses.

294
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,060
Unfortunately, also the judgmental will face the judgment.

295
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,640
Yes. For being too judgmental, they will be hauled before the sub judge in the great court of eternal judgment.

296
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:41,940
That.

297
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,560
And that moves on to higher and higher court for all eternity.

298
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,180
Right. Because it's so it's they keep being judgmental.

299
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,920
I like how Jack T. Chick has the embarrassment ceremony.

300
00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:09,700
Before you go to hell, everybody in the universe watches every bad thing you ever did on a giant screen that's there in the celestial throne room with a towering 300 foot tall light bulb headed Jesus presiding on the throne.

301
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,040
I wonder about that.

302
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,200
How many angels does it take to swap out the heads on the faceless God?

303
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,260
That's a good question.

304
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,200
But, you know, I have a question for you, Dr.

305
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,660
Howe, because you probably would know this.

306
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,540
I've always been curious.

307
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,040
Is that movie that they show on the giant screen in heaven and the Jack Chick film?

308
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,000
Is it a black and white because the tracks are black and white?

309
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,620
It may be in color and we don't know.

310
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:39,680
Well, but because something is in black and white does not necessarily mean that it is to be represented as actually being a black and white.

311
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:39,680


312
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:39,680


313
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:39,680


314
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:39,680


315
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:39,680


316
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:39,680


317
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:39,680


318
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,780
I don't think they're saying anything in those shades unless they make a little note.

319
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,660
No, it's just economy when you're producing a comic book that sells for 14 cents worldwide.

320
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:54,760
That movie of everyone's sins is available in 3D, but it cost the extra five dollars.

321
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:02,460
But everybody is gathered there, the quick and the dead, the great and the small, generations, and they're all watching your show.

322
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,080
And why not?

323
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,420
They've got eternity to do it in.

324
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,680
And so everything you did in secret when you thought you were picking up a good movie will be in the dark.

325
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:09,680


326
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,640
And so you're picking your nose and nobody is watching.

327
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,680
Is it up there in Todd Ayo's sense around Rumble Rumble?

328
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,680
Wait until Mrs. Darden sees the home movies I have in store for her.

329
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,040
Well, this brings up another question.

330
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,740
It's a terrible thing.

331
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,520
I'm sure we've all got dirty laundry.

332
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,980
The audience out there, I mean, this is a heavenly audience.

333
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,280
They've seen a lot of these films.

334
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:38,660
When somebody is doing something really loathsome, you know, adultery and three ways, four ways, 20 ways, does the audience applaud?

335
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,680
Or do they just watch?

336
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,840
Do they throw things at them?

337
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,960
They'd rather not, especially if their movie hasn't been shown yet.

338
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,420
But obviously the movie would have been shown, right?

339
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,440
Or they wouldn't be allowed to?

340
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,640
No, they're there.

341
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,680
They'll show them all they have to wear.

342
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,100
So you're saying the audience is all the people waiting to be judged?

343
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,560
I thought maybe it was the angels.

344
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,980
They're angels.

345
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,080
They are sort of like security guards to keep order.

346
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,940
But most people are too abashed.

347
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,060
Also, they're naked.

348
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,620
Also, they're standing in front of the 300-foot tall light bulb headed GC.

349
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,700
Well, inside there were balloons in it.

350
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
Are they enjoying the...

351
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,760
None of them are enjoying.

352
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:24,560
This is Chick's brand of pornography where he's relishing their discomfiture as they realize that he was right and they were wrong.

353
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,880
And they're being rebuked in front of the entire universe on a giant screen.

354
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,100
I mean, that's what I always thought was so funny, that he drew it as a rectangular screen.

355
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,640
Oh, I didn't think anybody saw me do that.

356
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,480
You know, July 12th.

357
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,160
July 12th, 1954.

358
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:48,560
And what does it say that when we talk about Bear Gate, it's pouring, but then when we talk about the Jack Chick tracks, suddenly the sun comes out.

359
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,780
I mean, who's in control of this?

360
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:57,100
Well, I'm trying to turn away because, you see, we do have this unfortunate war on God going on.

361
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,900
And so it never hurts to write...

362
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,280
God thinks that's hilarious.

363
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:07,020
I know that that's true because I have not been struck down yet.

364
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:07,600
Oh.

365
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:21,660
I think the good Lord has a sense of humor and probably has an equally funny plan for a little punchline for me in store when I go to meet my maker or un-maker, as the case may be.

366
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,180
Well, I just hope I'm in the audience when they show your movie because, I mean, that would be one that would be worth watching.

367
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:36,260
Well, I suppose this all huge audience includes everybody who is dead at the moment and then all in the past.

368
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:36,620
Maybe backlogged.

369
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,500
Yeah. Yeah. So...

370
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,900
Some movies are longer than others, especially if they're showing highlights.

371
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,080
Going all the way back to the Neolithic era.

372
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:52,240
Say, on next day, would it be possible, I wonder, to resurrect Jack Chick and force him to finish that anti-subgenius comic we've all wanted to see?

373
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,600
That would be necromancy and very, very evil, but maybe we'll be allowed to be evil.

374
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,160
Only if Dr. Hal drew it.

375
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:05,980
Well, the only thing we'll... as subgeniuses, the only thing we'll be judged on is how much we paid Bob.

376
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,320
Yes.

377
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,080
How much actual dollars we paid to Bob.

378
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,340
Oh, actual dollars.

379
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,900
Or, in practical terms, the subgenius foundation.

380
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,700
And remember, I'm here as a representative of that august organization.

381
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:33,940
The swag table in there doesn't look any different than it did when we first set it up, except Reverend Trixie von Mothersbaugh bought $35 worth of stuff.

382
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:34,840
Oh, yeah?

383
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,360
Yes.

384
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,200
That's it.

385
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,300
That's... otherwise, it looks like these guys are gonna have to send all that stuff back to me in Texas.

386
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,920
That's about $150 worth of shipping.

387
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,440
So, you better whip these people into shape and get them to spend some damn money in there.

388
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,860
I don't want any of that shit, would you please?

389
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,560
Now, how many were looking out there?

390
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,520
I don't want to have to haul any of it back in this case.

391
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,160
And for a limited time only, these priceless subgenius souvenirs can be yours.

392
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,240
I thought we were gonna have new people here this time.

393
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,180
That would... new... I mean, buyers.

394
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,980
You don't even have to order on Amazon.

395
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,400
This is how you're gonna save...

396
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,480
They're actually physically near you.

397
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,780
This religion is a cut above the others, because in the other religions, you're expected to just give money.

398
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,140
And you get nothing in return.

399
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,660
You tithe.

400
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,080
You're not only gonna get eternal salvation, but you also get swag.

401
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,240
Plus, you can get us famous old-timers to sign those books.

402
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:32,640
You see, Cotton Mather wrote that we're only not plunging down through the earth to hell this second,

403
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,480
because God is holding us up.

404
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:44,440
But anytime he wanted to, he could whisk his hand away, and we would instantly sink down through the earth's crust into the eternal fires of hell.

405
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,300
Are you saying we're like sinners in the hands of an angry God?

406
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:56,420
Well, Cotton Mather's bromides and pamphlets and books are remarkable for their consistency in that regard.

407
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,080
But I read an interesting book recently called Lords of the Left Hand Path.

408
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,440
Have you heard of this one?

409
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,220
No, but it...

410
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,640
It's a defense of demon worshipers and the like, you know.

411
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:19,260
And one of the things that it says is, everything you've ever read about Satanists, demon worshipers, and so forth, has been written by their enemies.

412
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,180
You know, it's distorted.

413
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,700
It is partisan.

414
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,000
And the other side deserves a say.

415
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:32,060
And then the rest of the book tells about all sorts of recent movements.

416
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:42,880
Like the Temple of Set, for example, which was disapproved of by the U.S. Air Force when it was found to be a subcult within its ranks.

417
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,220
So this is kind of like a critical religion theory.

418
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,640
It's a live and let live, Dick.

419
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,260
It's ecumenical.

420
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,140
It's let everybody in.

421
00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:00,420
Everybody's church deserves to be there, including the so-called bad guys.

422
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,060
You wouldn't have a good God in the world.

423
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,060


424
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,100
You wouldn't have the good guys without the bad guys.

425
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,120
You've got to let them in.

426
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,420
So the Satanists and the fundamentalists can kind of dance together and...

427
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,780
It's not even really formally advocating for the side.

428
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,960
It's just saying, give them a fair shake.

429
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,760
Because historically, philosophically, this is where this comes from.

430
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,840
And it's not as the propagandists would have it.

431
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,560
Well, that's one party I'd like to see.

432
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,600
I think it would be interesting.

433
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,700
Well, but as Jack Chick says, don't think you're going to get to party.

434
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,340
You're going to get to party with your friends in hell.

435
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,540
They arrange it so you can never see them.

436
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,760
Well, I do approve of the one track where when they're in hell, he says,

437
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,140
wait a minute, you lied to me.

438
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,560
They interject the you lied to me.

439
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,420
Friends, if you're not aware of the film called God's Cartoonist,

440
00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:01,120
it is a wonderful movie about the life and works of Jack Chick.

441
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,900
Produced by someone we know somewhere around here.

442
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:18,120
And it features Dr. Hal and me being so hilariously polite about never quite saying he's a crazy kook.

443
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,800
Well, he is an artist.

444
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,140
I can't surround that so expertly that that's my favorite part of the movie.

445
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,060
That's not the approach the movie takes.

446
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,600
In my view, he's like an underground cartoonist.

447
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,580
Yeah, I thought he was just a professional courtesy staying.

448
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,940
I mean, every artist is...

449
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,340
Crazy.

450
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,320
I think his cartoons have done immeasurable harm in the world.

451
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,300
I'd even say that.

452
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:43,980
But analyzing these as literary objects is a lot of fun.

453
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,840
They're fun to read.

454
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,840
They're designed to be fun to read.

455
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,040
Well, I mean, come on.

456
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,860
I mean, you know, the Nazis and Hitler did a lot of harm too.

457
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,860
But if they didn't exist...

458
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,400
But they didn't produce good comics.

459
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,100
Think of all the movies and all the books we would have.

460
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,780
All those X-rated men's...

461
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,040
All those magazines we wouldn't have.

462
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,000
I mean, you know...

463
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,800
Hogan's Heroes.

464
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,320
Yeah, we'd lose Hogan's Heroes.

465
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:06,900
LeBeau.

466
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,380
What would we do without that?

467
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,520
What about LeBeau?

468
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,800
If LeBeau can go to Auschwitz, and he did.

469
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,620
He actually went to Auschwitz.

470
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,000
LeBeau is an Auschwitz survivor.

471
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,200
If he can go and make fun of the Nazis and Hogan's Heroes, don't you think the rest of

472
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,600
us can at least politely laugh?

473
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,560
Well, it's not my ox being gored, so I would tread lightly there too.

474
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,100
Yeah.

475
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,680
Yeah.

476
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,920
I did think it was rather interesting how they managed never to show his forearm in

477
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,360
that movie.

478
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,140
Or TV series, rather.

479
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,140
Well, four-armed is four-armed.

480
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,620
Yes.

481
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:50,680
And I think Schultz and Colonel Klink were also Jewish, as was Major Hostet.

482
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,340
Shut up, Klink!

483
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,060
You know, I recently saw a...

484
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,940
General Poe.

485
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,600
It was a Daffy Duck World...

486
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:07,120
It was a World War Time cartoon where a Daffy infiltrates the Nazi headquarters or something.

487
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,820
And I swear to God, that's where Schultz and Klink came from.

488
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,000
That cartoon, there is a Schultz.

489
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,360
Yeah, Schultz is the adjutant.

490
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,000
It's just like the Schultz in the sitcom.

491
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:23,060
And the officer is ordering Schultz around, and Schultz is bundling and so on.

492
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,720
I know nothing!

493
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,760
I know nothing!

494
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,580
Well, if I remember correctly, Bing Kling...

495
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:28,580


496
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,940
Bing Kling and Bing Krosby produced Hogan's Heroes along with Groucho Marx.

497
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,980
He was in on it.

498
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,920
He was one of the backers.

499
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,880
Yes.

500
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,940
And another odd fact is that the world of Hogan's Heroes is coeval with Petticoat Junction,

501
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,960
because one of the men in the camp is from there.

502
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,940
Well, I didn't realize that.

503
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,860
So it's a shared universe like Marvel.

504
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,220
Yes.

505
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,400
Which may even expand farther, to six degrees of saturation.

506
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:58,560
Well, three navels.

507
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:58,560


508
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,400
Green Acres, definitely.

509
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,380
Petticoat Junction.

510
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:00,620
Right.

511
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,400
My fave.

512
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,920
Boy, when I moved out into the country, Princess Wee and I ended up watching Green Acres all over again.

513
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,040
Because think about it.

514
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,840
Lisa and Mr. Douglas.

515
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,600
It's strangely compelling, isn't it?

516
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
How it appeals.

517
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,040
Conspiracy or coincidence?

518
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,160
And you got a little suspicious when the postman came up.

519
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,280
Good morning, Mr. Douglas.

520
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,560
Well, not really Douglas.

521
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,620
More like Doug.

522
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:27,720
Doug.

523
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:28,740
Sting.

524
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,900
Then again, not really.

525
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,500
Well, anyway.

526
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,140
Here's your mail.

527
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,740
It's been thoroughly checked.

528
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,480
That was a very prophetic series, I thought.

529
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:45,620
Well, I have the idea that the scriptwriters behind the scene were getting ripped all the time.

530
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,960
And some of their ideas were stoner ideas.

531
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,740
Are we still talking about Green Acres?

532
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,080
Yes.

533
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,420
In this instance, talking about how in Green Acres, sometimes some characters could see

534
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:57,600
themselves.

535
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:57,620


536
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:57,620


537
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,580
Maybe it's because of the title letters floating in the air.

538
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,400
The other ones couldn't.

539
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,960
Or when they looked, they would whip away by animated magic so they wouldn't be seen and

540
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,280
then mischievously return and that sort of thing.

541
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,660
That show was meta ahead of its time.

542
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,320
You know, it was a radio show before that.

543
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:13,940
That's right.

544
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
And I've heard those.

545
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,560
The same writer, same director.

546
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,520
Dale Arden.

547
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,620
He improved it a lot.

548
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,200
Gale Gordon originally played the Mr. Douglas character and he was a jerk.

549
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:26,960
Eddie Albert.

550
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,260
Sorry.

551
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,600
He wasn't just a jerk.

552
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:27,600


553
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:27,600


554
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:27,600


555
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:27,600


556
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:34,000
He was just a simpleton, well-meaning numbskull like Oliver Wendell Douglas.

557
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,840
Dale Gordon always had to be the fall guy.

558
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,380
He was a real jerk.

559
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,140
He couldn't be the hero.

560
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,980
But Jeb was the same.

561
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,580
Jeb was the same old Jeb.

562
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,800
Jeb Bush was his last name, I think.

563
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,120
Jeb Bush?

564
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,720
That's where we got our governor, straight from that radio show.

565
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:03,580
So, yeah, it really hit home to me because I was, in fact, a city guy suddenly on a ranch.

566
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,200
The difference was I didn't really care about being a farmer.

567
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,960
Philo, Dr. Philo Drummond, now is a farmer.

568
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,300
He might as well be Mr. Green Jeans.

569
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,740
And what's he doing out on his acreage?

570
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,880
Dragging logs, felling trees, carving them into lumber.

571
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,700
And growing crops?

572
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,840
Completely legal stock.

573
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,440
We just want to make sure everybody knows it's all legal.

574
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,240
He has a movie theater in his barn, in one of his barns.

575
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:31,780
Uh-huh.

576
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,360
Yeah.

577
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,040
Yeah.

578
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:39,020
Bob paid Philo and me pretty well in the end.

579
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,820
After all of our struggles, Philo had to work for those arms dealers for 35 years.

580
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,020
And I had to work for Bob for 35 years, which was even harder.

581
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,620
But by golly.

582
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,080
By golly.

583
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,180
But he would struggling this whole lives.

584
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,840
And when heré este, he él todo, qué es pórFAHECHO?

585
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,740
I think he was a buyer and initially, he and this great great great man called Philo were

586
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:10,740


587
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,500
growing thing, because that's where we that was the thing that Professor

588
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:11,540
Keith was mostied about, and we said, oh, though, if we are trying so desperately to

589
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:11,540


590
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:11,820
of crank primary labor to we would now want to keep out of it if we wanted varies

591
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,600
� party paying over land and reasonable resources not using Jaıktys and

592
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,900
Europe actually is a terrible crap, I would say, to your point.

593
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,100
Yeah.

594
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:27,180
Yeah, I was kind of upset because I got to the point where I was doing all the landscaping on the ranch,

595
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,980
and I injured my back, and I needed to hire an immigrant.

596
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,140
But Trump had built this wall.

597
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,480
Which one?

598
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,600
And you couldn't get Mexicans or Hondurans or anybody.

599
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:47,680
Pease suggested, and this was Eskimos, immigrant refugee Eskimos,

600
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,260
because they work at night.

601
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,180
Ah, and they love that Texas weather.

602
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,960
And in Texas, that's good.

603
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,800
That's great.

604
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,140
It's really hot in the daytime.

605
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,160
Can they adapt to the heat of central Texas?

606
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,260
No, they stay inside their igloos during the day.

607
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,480
Yeah, one would think, yeah.

608
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,860
Of course, it's hard to keep the igloo refrigerated.

609
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:13,840
It has to be inside a separate refrigeration unit, which has power uses.

610
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,240
Well, my grandmother actually was roommates.

611
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,100
She was with the woman who invented Eskimo pies.

612
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,960
She would dismiss with her.

613
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,920
That was the big flavor thing.

614
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,200
And I bet she wasn't an Eskimo, was she?

615
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,800
No, she wasn't.

616
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,600
It was Eskimo appropriations.

617
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,160
Yes, that's true.

618
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,460
And they're not even really pies.

619
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,720
No, they're not.

620
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,500
It's all, well.

621
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,000
It's a black lie.

622
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,120
It's a metaphor.

623
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,140
I shouldn't say that.

624
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,420
It is a metaphor.

625
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,040
It's a truth built on lies.

626
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:44,200
It's things that stand for things combined into something else.

627
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,900
Pretty tasty, though.

628
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,780
You know?

629
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,940
A pizza pie.

630
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,840
Is that a pie?

631
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:56,780
Or some people would think a pie was baked in an oven with the standard fruity contents.

632
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,820
You know, pies are supposed to be hot.

633
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,500
Eskimo pie.

634
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,280
Well, I get it.

635
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,520
It's an Eskimo pie.

636
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,020
It's cold.

637
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,260
Finally.

638
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,620
After all these years, I finally get it.

639
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,700
You see how simple it is to follow down to derivation.

640
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,480
The answer was so simple.

641
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,140
I was overcomplicating it.

642
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:13,900
Overthinking it.

643
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,900
That's unusual for a subgenius.

644
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,000
Right here on the hour slack.

645
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:17,640
That's what it is.

646
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:17,800
That's what it is.

647
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:17,880
That's what it is.

648
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:17,880


649
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,380
That's what it is.

650
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,520
Well, I hope that it will accord slack.

651
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:27,280
It says here, Dr. Howell announced new universal poet laureate.

652
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:28,900
Universal.

653
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,760
I didn't.

654
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,340
That's a real.

655
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,600
Perhaps universalist pictures contacted me.

656
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,320
That puts you ahead of even the great Glyrablex of Jupiter.

657
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,060
Well, I mean Europa, not Jupiter.

658
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,040
Oh, so claiming the universe.

659
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,080
Oh, well.

660
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,900
Yeah, the whole universe.

661
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,860
Perhaps it only refers to the universe.

662
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:53,020
The universe of the noosphere, which would be a grandiose enough assertion.

663
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,720
The unicycle verse.

664
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,240
All sorts of interesting documents appended to the greeting book.

665
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,080
Well, maybe they mean he's a poet of like one verse.

666
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,800
It's just kind of the universe.

667
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,460
But he came up with the best verse there is.

668
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,680
So he's the poet laureate of that.

669
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:17,840
In the realm of what possibility is, the actuality of it dwindles to the equivalent.

670
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,960
Of one verse.

671
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,440
The cyclopic.

672
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:30,780
I have to wonder why the Dobstown weekly whiff reader does not actually have a picture of J.R. Bob Dobbs in it,

673
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,520
but has seven pictures of Reverend Pease.

674
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,080
Well, all that Dobbs stuff is fine with the old folks and traditionalists,

675
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,760
but today's now a go-go church has to reach for the star.

676
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,380
Pease, in the back of his little Pease brain, is trying to get himself.

677
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,280
Into the position of high epoch.

678
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,220
And an accent on the high and popped.

679
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:00,820
What I like about that, Rag, is it's one of the few newspapers that says you flip through the pages through it,

680
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,300
you get to one page that's completely blank.

681
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,480
So you fill it in.

682
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,060
It's kind of make your own news.

683
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,080
I think that's something that all newspapers should do.

684
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:17,840
Well, it gives you a place to work out the same one that President Trump was giving.

685
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:17,840


686
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:17,840


687
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,300
Yeah.

688
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,060
Uh-huh.

689
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,840
You have to identify the rhinoceros, the lion, the camel.

690
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,160
Say what you will, but Trump did recognize the camel toe.

691
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,300
You can see it right there.

692
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,280
Oh, yeah.

693
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,200
I saw the filled out form.

694
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,140
It was pretty funny.

695
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,080
And you saw the rhinoceros horny.

696
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,260
You got that one.

697
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,920
Or monoceros, as they were once called.

698
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,480
Are you taking care of your babies there, Pease?

699
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,820
The rhinoceros family is enormous.

700
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,420
Someone brought Reverend Pease.

701
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,660
And they're on the offensive.

702
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,000
There are a few of them alive today.

703
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:49,980
A little zip-up green pea.

704
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:58,560
An incredible variety of forms and shapes, including the largest mammal ever to walk the earth.

705
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,620
This one is just waiting for the sweet piece of death.

706
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,580
Oh.

707
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:10,720
Well, you know, the rhinoceros are some of the most wonderful medical inventions ever created.

708
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,560
Because if you pound up their bones into dust and make pills out of them,

709
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,560
the aphrodisiac quality.

710
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,600
The qualities are just amazing.

711
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:24,400
That's primitive magic which has been disproved.

712
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,460
Well, wait a minute, though.

713
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,520
They've got that giant horn.

714
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,480
It makes you horny.

715
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,400
That makes sense.

716
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,000
Correlation without connection.

717
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,900
It's scientifically proved.

718
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,280
Are you one of these non-science people?

719
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,380
The same with shark fins.

720
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,580
I have to put my hoof down somewhere.

721
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,940
Dude, you're as bad as my fucking friend at all.

722
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,040
What happened to Fritz Schuele's feet?

723
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,640
He was a bloody mess.

724
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,540
Like, he was attacked by ludicrous animals.

725
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:47,540


726
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:47,540


727
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:47,540


728
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:47,540


729
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:47,540


730
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:47,540


731
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:47,540


732
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:47,540


733
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:47,540


734
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:47,540


735
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,680
Hell yeah.

736
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,700
But this post-war crisis actually scares me even more and that I probably should be

737
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,560
careful with this.

738
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,480
Which are, you know, few, and possibly too modest, considerations, drain the patient

739
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:12,480


740
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,060
Consumption Benimodulation

741
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,080
In conclusion, the full picture here, 120.

742
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,080


743
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,520
효 ?

744
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,040
Idiot is such an ugly word.

745
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:19,880
Moron.

746
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,700
That's quite, that's quite, quite, let, you know.

747
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:29,380
The thing that's so nice about the word subgenius is that if you say it right, people focus on the genius part.

748
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,380
And they think, oh, he's complimenting me.

749
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,260
Hey, you know what?

750
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,900
You're an excellent subgenius.

751
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:35,800
Well, that.

752
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,160
Incidentally, sir, that man is an excellent subgenius.

753
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,480
You know, you're telling the boss this about the worker.

754
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,820
Incidentally, sir.

755
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,220
That man is a devoted subgenius.

756
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,320
You'll be lucky if you can get him to work for you.

757
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:58,320
Well, it looks like the humidity has killed my hearing aid again.

758
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,360
So I'm back to guessing even more poorly what everybody else is saying.

759
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,560
We're recording the classics.

760
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:10,880
In this case, transposing chick tracks for our own amusement.

761
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,600
This is a little joke we play on staying about halfway into the show.

762
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,800
We start moving our lips.

763
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,020
We make him think he's not hearing anything.

764
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,660
Oh, well, that's when it's time to start talking about old monster movie trivia.

765
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:32,840
Well, you see, every time I have, you've explained that we always devolve into such a discussion.

766
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,020
We do.

767
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,720
That's how you know it's an hour of slack.

768
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,400
But, you see, Bull Dada contains profound lessons.

769
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,280
And that's why it's fun to talk about it.

770
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,800
Well, it's just that Bull Dada is a good movie.

771
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:45,800


772
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:45,800


773
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:45,800


774
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:45,800


775
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:45,800


776
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:45,800


777
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:45,800


778
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:45,800


779
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:45,800


780
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,960
And the Bull Dada we're referring to is from their grandparents' time.

781
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,140
Foundational, nonetheless.

782
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,160
Well, it might be, but they don't know what the hell we're talking about.

783
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,460
That doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about it.

784
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,220
They need to learn.

785
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,780
Well, that's the thing.

786
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,540
We call it trivia.

787
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,120
That sounds so like you're denigrating that.

788
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,020
I never called it that.

789
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,900
This is far greater than trivia.

790
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,680
That happened in the 1970s when everything was trivialized.

791
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,460
And the game of trivia first appeared.

792
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,240
But, uh...

793
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:15,460
You know, I was...

794
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:15,800
Things are...

795
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,320
Things are only as trivial as you...

796
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:19,720
Uh-oh.

797
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,240
It's the tripod-breaking drunk man.

798
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,060
Stay away from my tripod, Finn Chooley.

799
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,500
Keep your tripod away from my bad knee.

800
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,520
Why don't you take a seat?

801
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,360
Sit down in the green chair there.

802
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,340
Take a load off.

803
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,440
Sit in the green chair.

804
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,720
It's a comfortable chair.

805
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,700
That man's going to be a hero come next day when the tripods are...

806
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,120
Do we need to re-establish the tripod?

807
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,660
Yeah.

808
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,440
Uh...

809
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:46,680
Uh...

810
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,640
Ensure domestic tranquility.

811
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,580
Killin' you, Chief.

812
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,840
Provide for the common defense.

813
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,020
Tripod-breaking man is at every divival.

814
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,580
Uh...

815
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,140
The...

816
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:56,920
But there...

817
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:02,440
When there's 50 cases of beer, there's 50 tripod-breaking men.

818
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,200
Hmm.

819
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,140
Usually, the tripod-breaking men are fat.

820
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,060
But, uh...

821
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,720
Even a...

822
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,480
Well, man...

823
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,500
A thin, hungry-looking man.

824
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,520
A lean and hungry man like Finn Chooley.

825
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:20,140
Can become drunk enough to break tripods and bloody his feet.

826
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,360
He should come and sit down in a comfortable chair here.

827
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,860
No, idiots can't...

828
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,320
I mean, sorry.

829
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,140
Subgeniuses can't do that.

830
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,680
Well, his first movie, though, was pretty good.

831
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,680
The Thin Man.

832
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:38,740
I have to recall one of my favorite lines ever spoken by a subgenius.

833
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,800
It was completely spontaneous and heartfelt.

834
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,560
It was Dr. Fox sitting at a table.

835
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,100
And he said,

836
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,100


837
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,160
And he just suddenly looked into space and said,

838
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,240
I'm not really a rebel.

839
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,560
I'm just an idiot.

840
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,140
And he said it with such feeling.

841
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,900
I thought that is...

842
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,280
That sums up the subgenius condition in some ways.

843
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,540
You know?

844
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,180
If you get right down to it...

845
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,840
The way he said it was so...

846
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,960
It felt so true.

847
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,800
Mm-hmm.

848
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,560
And I've ended up repeating that line myself.

849
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:11,740
Uh...

850
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,720
Often to my wife.

851
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,120
Who goes,

852
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,140
No, no.

853
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,460
You're not an idiot.

854
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,120
And I go,

855
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:17,600
You're right.

856
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,500
That is an ugly word.

857
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,160
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

858
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,360
Well, I had a heartfelt moment like that with my wife once.

859
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,720
We didn't call it Church of the Genius for a reason.

860
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,180
That's another one of those daily utterances that comes in handy.

861
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:33,840
We were watching one of these beautiful documentaries of oceans and prairies.

862
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,520
And it was just...

863
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,360
It was really beautiful.

864
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,460
And it kind of got my wife to choke up.

865
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,620
And she looked at me and she said,

866
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,700
You know, sometimes I think Earth really is the most beautiful planet.

867
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,960
And the whole world.

868
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,840
That's a good one.

869
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,040
Well, I'm sure she's right.

870
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,440
Well, to an Earthling, sure.

871
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,060
Yeah.

872
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,500
Yes.

873
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,480
Well, you definitely feel it when you are on another planet.

874
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,740
The wrongness.

875
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,460
She's never experienced Havafrop Zipulat.

876
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,420
She's only been on this planet and on this world.

877
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,320
Hey, have you noticed that all the people who can afford to are going into space on their own spaceships?

878
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:12,980
Mm-hmm.

879
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:18,080
And they're going to be men and women living on the moon in three years from now.

880
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:26,000
And say what you will against Trump, but he did say the U.S. government is going to have to reveal everything it knows about UFOs in 180 days.

881
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,920
And when did he say it?

882
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,340
The end of December.

883
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,760
Hey, that's right about now.

884
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:36,160
Well, that was easy because the U.S. government admitted they don't know a damn thing about UFOs.

885
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,660
That was the whole point, which we knew was coming.

886
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,680
And it works for, as somebody pointed out, that works for the believers.

887
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,760
And the non-believers.

888
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,660
What it does is it...

889
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,060
They admit they don't know, so they've got to keep it.

890
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,840
It confirms the existence of UFOs, which is a big step forward.

891
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,560
Of course there are unidentified things in the sky.

892
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,260
Nobody questions that.

893
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,580
Pie plates or reflections of the atmosphere.

894
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,820
The idea that they're flung by aliens instead of billionaires.

895
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,920
Dry cleaning bags filled with marsh gas.

896
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,740
I figured John Galt's behind it.

897
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:12,720
This is all part of the climate change and climate acclimation process.

898
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:18,500
You get people talking about UFOs so that on July 5th, when they're actually in the skies blowing people up,

899
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,300
and other folks are running inside going,

900
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,940
There's UFOs out there! They're blowing it up!

901
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've heard all the talk.

902
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,600
No, nobody knows anything about it.

903
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,780
We've already talked about that.

904
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,180
They don't have any evidence.

905
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,120
It's a distractionary and confusionary technique.

906
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,140
And it works beautifully.

907
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,000
There's plenty of evidence for weird things in the sky.

908
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,420
There's just no evidence as to what exactly they are.

909
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,280
Yes.

910
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,700
We don't know everything about what may be inhabiting the sky.

911
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:50,280
I think it's the, all the smartest rich people about 500 years ago

912
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:56,700
moved to some underground hidden base and decided they would have their own scientific utopia.

913
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,960
And now they're just teasing the rest of us.

914
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,400
Well, that's...

915
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:01,820
Why not?

916
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,080
It's as likely as anything else.

917
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,440
Well, somebody threatens the whole setup.

918
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,560
Good.

919
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,240
But they're going to learn their lesson when the X's get here.

920
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:12,680
That's pretty good.

921
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,040
I'm damn sure.

922
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,980
Because there ain't no flying saucer crashing ninnies.

923
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,620
They need machines to get around.

924
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,900
The X's does not need a saucer.

925
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,160
The X's does not need a ship or a boat.

926
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,260
The X's does not even need a body.

927
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,500
It's just a mind.

928
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,100
It's pure mind, pure soul.

929
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,280
And it has the power of the infinite mind.

930
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,420
It can do anything.

931
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,260
It might as well be unto a god.

932
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,360
Arthur C. Clarke said that if it was real aliens, well, they'd be just like magic to us.

933
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,060
Hell yeah.

934
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
But it ain't magic.

935
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,760
It's dobsly.

936
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,140
It's dobsly scientific magic.

937
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,260
Well, it is magic.

938
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,060
Because we'll never understand it.

939
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,100
But why do we have to?

940
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,540
We don't have to.

941
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:00,060
Nobody said in the rule book that we had to know what the universe was here for or what

942
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,480
UFOs was or what life is all about.

943
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,500
But I can tell you what the point of life is.

944
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,440
It's to have fun.

945
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,840
That's the reason you're alive is to have fun.

946
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,840
My father asked me that one time.

947
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,340
He said, Alan, you know, I'm a scientist.

948
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


949
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


950
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


951
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


952
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


953
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,760
I'm a scientist.

954
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:14,740
I'm going to show you how fun it is.

955
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,380
What's the purpose of life?

956
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,900
And without batting an eye, I said to have fun.

957
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,740
And he goes, my God.

958
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,280
I had no idea you were so wise at your age.

959
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,940
This was only a few years ago.

960
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:26,400
Well, no.

961
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,760
That was when I was your age.

962
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,620
Well, I've given it a lot of thought.

963
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,500
And I've read the word of Bob.

964
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,020
Slot comes first.

965
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:32,640
That's it.

966
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,980
That's all there is to it.

967
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:40,140
You just ... You get you ... If you ain't having fun, then you're just wasting your

968
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:40,700
damn time.

969
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,320
Of course, you've got to go through all this.

970
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:42,320


971
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:42,320


972
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,700
through some hardships and stuff for a thousand years, maybe.

973
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,800
But when you finally do have fun, it's worth the wait.

974
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,460
I promise. I tried that.

975
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,660
Those hard times are to give more enjoyment to the fun.

976
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,380
You know, if you've been down to hell, being in heaven is so much better than if you just go straight to heaven.

977
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,620
That's why you've got to go through subgenius hell before you can even handle the subgenius heaven.

978
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,400
That's why we have the spanking machine.

979
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,800
That and the fact that it's at a nudist colony.

980
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,220
What about that? The spanking machine?

981
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:18,140
Well, didn't the Vatican abolish purgatory, so it's now ever so binary.

982
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,900
Either it's a fiery place or the celestial realm.

983
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,960
Oh, the Masons will tell you that's all just a bunch of made-up bunch of hooves.

984
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,900
Yes, I know. Masonry, Marsha Mason.

985
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:39,860
But the foundations are sound, wouldn't you say?

986
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,140
Well, people are trying to make sense out of the dogma, and that's not the point of the dogma.

987
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,960
The dogma is to confound. The dogma is to inspire.

988
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:54,960
The dogma is to enrich the pursuit of the knowledge which is not capable of being understood.

989
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,740
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

990
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,760
That's as simple as that. It's going to backfire on you.

991
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:06,620
Well, as they say, the wise man is the one that knows the limits of their own wisdom,

992
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,440
and that is the point of a subgenius.

993
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,480
Well, you don't know.

994
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,860
You don't know what's going on. You'd better do what Bob told you to do.

995
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,760
But that's what makes you so smart, because you know that you're a subgenius.

996
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,840
That's the genius part right there.

997
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,060
Or as they say these days, I identify as a subgenius.

998
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:31,400
I had a whole big long sentence about what I identify as

999
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,460
that was inspired by Chicken John's recent appearance in the news.

1000
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,020
Oh, yeah?

1001
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,400
I can't say it in public.

1002
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,860
No, better not. Very dangerous.

1003
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:48,200
But the part of it was that I identify as a gun-toting, land-owning, white, straight, something-something,

1004
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,880
bitch-ass subgenius.

1005
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,500
A bitch-ass subgenius.

1006
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,980
If you think there's something wrong with being a bitch-ass subgenius...

1007
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,020
Oh, I already did that one yesterday.

1008
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,200
Okay.

1009
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,640
Well, I repeat myself when under stress.

1010
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,320
What would Dolomite say? And how would he say it?

1011
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,020
Well, I'm not supposed to say it the way he would say it, but I could.

1012
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:06,980
No, sir.

1013
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,440
And he'd laugh.

1014
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,300
No, sir.

1015
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:08,560
Mm-hmm.

1016
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,880
I know he would.

1017
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,700
I actually worked with Rudy White more briefly.

1018
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:14,420
Mm-hmm.

1019
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,200
Strangely enough, I think he was gay.

1020
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:19,940
Or everything.

1021
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,680
How did he put it?

1022
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,820
All the for-real down-home people would be there.

1023
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,960
The b****es and c***s.

1024
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,940
He's an open-minded fellow.

1025
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,820
And I like to think of the escape vessels in much the same way.

1026
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,300
Oops, I just did the thing I'm not supposed to do.

1027
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,380
But I'm good at it.

1028
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,120
And the rain starts again.

1029
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,860
And I'm the one who edits, so I can include it or not, depending on how I feel about it.

1030
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,180
Heaven openly weeps.

1031
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,900
But I know I'm not supposed to do that.

1032
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,420
It's appropriation or something.

1033
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,640
To me, it's appropriate.

1034
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,400
Well, everything's appropriate.

1035
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,020
Appropriate is very important.

1036
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,360
Well, you know...

1037
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:01,220
Appropriate.

1038
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,180
Let's be realistic.

1039
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,620
Well, I didn't live in East Cleveland for 20 years.

1040
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,620
If anyone's going to attack you for appropriation,

1041
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,540
nine times out of ten, you're going to be in the same place.

1042
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:08,540


1043
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,060
If you're going to attack me for appropriation,

1044
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:09,860
you say, well, wait a minute.

1045
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:10,900
You're speaking English.

1046
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,180
You appropriated someone else's language.

1047
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,380
That's not your language.

1048
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,440
I guess that's not an appropriate thing to say, though.

1049
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,100
Apropos of...

1050
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,760
Yeah, apropos of appropriatism.

1051
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,000
Appropriationism.

1052
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,280
Well, hey, look.

1053
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,040
I can't help it.

1054
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:34,720
I'm an appropri...

1055
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,540
I identify as an appropriationist.

1056
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:37,780
How's that?

1057
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,400
Yeah.

1058
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,220
You're going to infringe on my right to identify as an appropriationist?

1059
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,600
What kind of a Nazi fascist are you?

1060
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,060
Share and...

1061
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,680
Probably somebody on the Internet, I bet.

1062
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:53,500
Share and share alike ideas of all.

1063
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,960
There was a young couple that's on their way here

1064
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,020
that just got engaged, like yesterday.

1065
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:03,220
Well, good for them.

1066
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,020
Yeah, Reverend Negative and Reverend Katana 007.

1067
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,380
I hope they make it.

1068
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,920
I hope they make it through this down boy.

1069
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,240
Yeah.

1070
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,860
They met through Bob, and they had a band called Sub-G Kids.

1071
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:20,240
He plays bass, and she sings just like a little child.

1072
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,820
A heartwarming story.

1073
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:26,160
And he proposed to her, I think, yesterday or the day before,

1074
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,100
and she accepted, and they're coming here.

1075
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,400
So these events are...

1076
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,920
I guess we better get our marriage...

1077
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,100
Continuously happening.

1078
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,920
They're going to go on their honeymoon in the stars.

1079
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:43,020
It certainly is cheaper than doing the SpaceX variety.

1080
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,380
You know, just think about it.

1081
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:46,780
You're charging just $35,

1082
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,260
and these other people are paying millions of dollars

1083
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,060
to get out into space for just a few hours.

1084
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,880
This is such a rip-off.

1085
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,480
Did you know this X-Day is free?

1086
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,640
They're breaking the law and not charging for this X-Day.

1087
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,300
So you see, that charge cannot be laid at our door this time.

1088
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,380
I mean, $35 for a week is pretty cheap.

1089
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:08,380


1090
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:08,380


1091
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,300
This one's not a full week, but still.

1092
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,180
I'm going to miss that $35.

1093
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:15,220
And nobody's bought a damn thing at the swag table.

1094
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,560
I want you to go in there and buy an extra copy of

1095
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,080
Book of the Subgenius, Eyelash, and Neighbor World,

1096
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,280
and come back here and have us sign it,

1097
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,740
even though those guys didn't work on those other two books,

1098
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,840
and I just did the forwards.

1099
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,540
But, by golly, we've got to sell some stuff.

1100
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,540
Or Bob's going to kick my butt.

1101
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,960
I won't be afraid to go back to Texas if I don't...

1102
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,120
If I have to go back with a full suitcase.

1103
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,520
There's still time.

1104
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:45,140
You'll be breaking Ivan Stang's back if you don't buy

1105
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,020
at the sacred swag table.

1106
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,320
The Lord may call Ivan Stang home.

1107
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,440
I've got a vision.

1108
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,260
The Lord...

1109
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,780
Bob's going to call me home

1110
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,880
if you don't contribute.

1111
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,800
If we don't raise that money,

1112
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,000
Bob's going to call me home.

1113
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,540
If you're listening to this on the computer,

1114
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:05,500
it's not too late to hit that PayPal button.

1115
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,260
Yeah.

1116
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,160
Put your hands on the screen.

1117
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:09,880
Yeah, we take credit cards.

1118
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,520
You don't have to actually have the money.

1119
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,460
You can max it out.

1120
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,280
I won't care.

1121
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,140
I'll get it one way or another.

1122
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,340
For Bob, of course.

1123
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,460
Money has a symbolic value.

1124
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:28,800
I only keep what we need to keep the foundation going,

1125
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,940
you know, to buy the product, the parts.

1126
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,700
It's all made in the USA, by the way, folks.

1127
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,220
Well, you know, eBay is no longer doing PayPal.

1128
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,540
They now have their own version.

1129
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,980
They're charging direct through eBay gates.

1130
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,040
So they're cutting out the middleman.

1131
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,100
At one time, eBay owned PayPal.

1132
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,060
Now, when the conspiracy starts stabbing each other in the back,

1133
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,580
that's when you know the end times truly are upon us.

1134
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,580
Don't they have hurricanes here?

1135
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,460
Oh, yeah.

1136
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,040
That rip the roofs off buildings?

1137
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:05,720
Constantly.

1138
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,040
Constantly.

1139
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,520
But we prefer to call them...

1140
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,420
Hurricanes.

1141
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,100
Just because we don't want to be sexist about it.

1142
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,740
I can't hear a word you're saying over the rain.

1143
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,440
That's Bob doing that for me.

1144
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,440
He's protecting me.

1145
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:28,580
The hurricanes that perpetually assault down here.

1146
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,760
John Shirley wrote a new novel

1147
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,720
where there are eternal hurricanes

1148
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,940
in this area.

1149
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,140
And they never stop.

1150
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,640
You know, when one is stopping,

1151
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,600
another is starting.

1152
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,200
It's called Stormland.

1153
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,520
Oh, I can't wait to read that one.

1154
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,340
That's a fun one.

1155
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,520
Yeah, it's like the big spot of Jupiter.

1156
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,620
Yeah, I haven't got my free copy from him yet.

1157
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,480
Maybe he wised up.

1158
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:59,660
I have an all John Shirley shelf and a half.

1159
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,320
He's that old John Shirley.

1160
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,340
He's a sick, twisted subgenius.

1161
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,260
And a really good writer.

1162
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:16,860
There's a lot of subgenius inside jokes buried in some of those.

1163
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:17,820
I know.

1164
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:23,040
And I don't mean the one with me and Bob in it.

1165
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,840
There's some with Sternow.

1166
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,340
The one with the fight in Jesus.

1167
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,420
And Filo and all that.

1168
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,000
We say they're jokes,

1169
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,540
but that's how we sit them past the censors.

1170
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,400
Yes.

1171
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,900
Now the sky...

1172
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,520
The sky is indeed angry with this shift of topic.

1173
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,420
I love that sound.

1174
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,980
Yes, the laughter, not the roar of heaven.

1175
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,220
Is that what that is?

1176
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:49,740
They're listening.

1177
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,360
They're judging.

1178
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,860
The unknown upper atmosphere affects hundreds of miles wide

1179
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:03,500
in electro storms that have never been quantified.

1180
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,480
Who knows how many millions of volts there are.

1181
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,940
I'm glad it's raining because...

1182
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,160
I hope that helps thin out the reclaimed water.

1183
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,920
It'll be not quite as smelly for my next cup of coffee, I hope.

1184
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,960
The trickle-down theory, eh?

1185
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:19,980
Right.

1186
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,880
While they're doing this,

1187
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,820
they think this is going to help them on next day.

1188
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,100
It's going to put out fires,

1189
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,600
but all it's really going to do is limit the ability of the tanks

1190
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,260
to respond to the invaders.

1191
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:36,480
Perhaps it will create a steamy X-Day as all this water is...

1192
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,920
Well, and it can always...

1193
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,920
It can always turn into basketball-sized hail at any second.

1194
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:45,620
Yeah, and of course, up in northern Florida and Georgia,

1195
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,020
we have all that red clay.

1196
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,600
The Yankees used to say that the ground looked like blood,

1197
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,280
and that's exactly what it will look like.

1198
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,300
Thanks for being patient.

1199
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,700
The red dirt of X-Day.

1200
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,020
The pay dirt of X-Day.

1201
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,020
Yeah, so...

1202
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,940
How do they get the cast-off?

1203
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:07,940


1204
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:07,940


1205
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:07,940


1206
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:07,940


1207
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,620
Right, you're right.

1208
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,780
I was going to ask that question, too.

1209
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,740
How do you get a cat to eat coffee beans?

1210
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,920
Well, I know how I would try to do it,

1211
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:22,260
but there's one factor that will always vary,

1212
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,580
and that is the individual cat in question.

1213
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:29,000
They have different personalities

1214
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,640
and different behavior patterns.

1215
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,780
Oh, I know another answer to that.

1216
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:37,120
Well...

1217
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:37,940
Oh, no.

1218
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,600
Yeah, well, we're welcome to...

1219
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:39,720
And a civet cat.

1220
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:41,960
A civet cat.

1221
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:42,060
A civet cat.

1222
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:42,820
Do you know what those are?

1223
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:43,180
Yeah.

1224
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,960
They eat coffee beans and...

1225
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,080
them.

1226
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,020
Oh, that...

1227
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:47,280
Okay.

1228
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,660
And those coffee beans are the most valuable coffee in the world.

1229
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,060
Yes.

1230
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:54,260
Coffee that has been passed through the system of a civet cat.

1231
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,460
Unfortunately, they're not really cats.

1232
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:57,680
They're just called that.

1233
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,380
Okay.

1234
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,800
Well, they are called by the name cat.

1235
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:02,260


1236
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,760
I'd love to taste that stuff once it's been processed.

1237
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,700
They actually do that.

1238
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,660
It's processed by a cat, first of all.

1239
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,100
Yes, a gourmand treat from another culture.

1240
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:15,100
But...

1241
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,560
So, you know, there...

1242
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:24,340
One way would be to coat the coffee bean with acceptable, agreeable oil,

1243
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,520
and then it might be eaten by the cat.

1244
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:35,060
Or the Mithridates technique of introducing minute amounts,

1245
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:35,700
which are gradually...

1246
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,280
Increased with each feeding.

1247
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,160
Do they have to, like, process the...

1248
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:47,760
When it comes out the other end, do they have to, like, dehydrate it in order to make it more packageable?

1249
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:47,780
No, no.

1250
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,720
They just throw it in a bag and sell it to you.

1251
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,700
Oh, okay.

1252
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:50,940
Yeah.

1253
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,520
Yeah, they grind it up.

1254
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,060
But it's all ground up, so you can't tell what's bean and what's excrement.

1255
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,900
What's bean, what's excrement, and what's litter box?

1256
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,080
Apparently, it tastes better than any Starbucks.

1257
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,040
Oh, yeah.

1258
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,060
Well, boiling water occurs.

1259
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,400
I'm not sure if it's, you know...

1260
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,900
Whatever you said.

1261
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,100
The coffee that'll make you climb the walls.

1262
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:13,280
Right on.

1263
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,260
Civic Cat Coffee.

1264
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,580
I'm up for any program.

1265
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:18,440
Sure, I have done justice to your question.

1266
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:24,840
Again, friends, I must remind our listeners that the fuzzy sound in this episode

1267
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,920
was not because of your local radio station or ISP,

1268
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:34,440
but because of a rainstorm in Florida where this was recorded outdoors weeks ago.

1269
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:40,300
Huge fish emerged everywhere and walked upon the land.

1270
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,820
That really happened.

1271
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,380
It was weird.

1272
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,060
It was an omen.

1273
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:50,240
The walking catfish came out right after this show was recorded, though.

1274
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,460
Or, believe me, we would have mentioned it.

1275
00:57:53,100 --> 00:58:00,200
I filmed it, and eventually we'll get it up on my YouTube channel.
