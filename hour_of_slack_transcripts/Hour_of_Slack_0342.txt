This is a provocative, sour, highly controversial topic that we tackle over the next 60 minutes.
We ask you to suspend your disbelief, those of you who are skeptical, those who are believers in this particular phenomenon.
We ask you not to overreact to the stories, the horror stories that you are about to hear.
For those doing the view of the United States, the major concern for American people is still the economy, not necessarily the elites.
And today the government released news statistics that seem to indicate that everything is under control.

Properly used,
it can provide

Both interesting

So,
have a good time.
We have assumed control.
Yes.
We always assume control.
And we have it.
May we assume control of you?
Ah, but what about this man?

My mind has deteriorated.
Deteriorated in its implementation.
This led to my failure.
Much has been said about my management style.
I can tell you, I've put in long hours for the nation's benefit.
Creating troubles or tragedies.
Catchy reports.
Erroneous statements.
Thousands of documents.
Secret bank accounts and diverted funds.
So that those can be available to me on a continuing basis.
That's so pretty.
Welcome to another installment.
Wow.
A dangerous, perhaps, installment of your subgenius.
Hour of Slack.
An especially musical hour of Slack tonight, I believe.
I believe that's how it's going to turn out.
But it's that hour you come to dread and pray for every week.
And we seldom let you down.
At least as far as showing up, anyway.
What can I say?
It's that Bob show.
That Bob...
We got a piece of mail this week from a young listener in another city who wanted...
I just heard the end of your show last week.
So I didn't really get everything but the address.
But send me information about that Bob Dog religion.
And we couldn't do that.
Because I don't have any information about the Bob Dog religion.
But if you have any information about the Bob Dog...
You know...
Send it in to the address that I'll be giving to you at the end of tonight's program.
And, uh...
Slack.
This is the...
You know, it's the Slack show.
Some nights more Slack than others.
So here's a song to begin with.
Here's a song all about Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.





Slack.
Slack.
You Slack for sure.
Slack me on your wildest dreams.
Right now it's Slack.
You have the power to find Slack.
Good something for nothing.
Credit cards are taken.
Slack.
Slack.
Shit cares.
I want more Slack.
Send your money now.
Conspiracy denied me again.
Send your money.
I will have my Slack.
Your Slack show is here.
Slack.
Slack.
Buy more Slack.
You Slack.
Let it go.
You Slack.
You're very old.
All sorts of Slack.
You Slack.
Every kind of Slack imaginable.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack from heaven to hell.












Slack.
Slack from the very inside of the world.
Slack.
Slack from right next door.
Here you go.
Here's your Slack show, my dear.
Slack show, my lady.
Your Slack.
My dear.
My now.
You Slack.
You Slack.
We have you.
You Slack.


I don't know who you are.
I don't know.








I want my slack
You slack
Slack off
If you have a gas you can have your slack
Money is slack
Something for nothing
Slack is great
Slack
Slack is government control for your protection
I want more slack
Slack is not for everyone
You cannot take my slack away
Slack can be taken by prescription
Slack is not for everyone
Slack is for everyone
Well that was the, or were, OBE, OutBanned Experience, actually Kings of Feedback slash OBE
And I think OBE would like you to know that their phone number is not what it once was
You remember it was 1-800-OB, you know, OutBanned, 1-800-OUTBANNED
It's not that anymore
If you want to join their audio shenanigans, and you do, believe me
Don't call that number I said a minute ago
Call 1-617-LICKOBE
L-I-C-K-O-B-E
Those of you who have called their number in the past know how much fun it is
Fun waiting for those of you
And speaking of fun, here's something
Well I like it and I hope you will too
I think that's what you get from watching this
If you want to get in touch with me in the future, just call me
I'll make sure to come back
Okay, thanks
See you next time

the pharaoh with satisfaction
but then to his immense surprise his empire fell before his eyes a hundred thousand busy slaves
down the
tools
stood like the canyon
the pharaoh pulled up in his wagon
and saw within those walls of glass i heard of whales go racing past a hundred thousand fishy
tails crossed his mind about the day
the
the broken tablets had been mended
the golden calf had been up and dead
and old folks said
the fire would talk of voices from the sky babies sailing down the nile the recipe for locust pie
a hundred thousand frogs per mile we'd always ask them to describe
the
child
the child

the child the child

Bushes that refuse to burn Steamy sandals hardly worn
Raining blood, raining bread The night we painted Egypt red
Now shut that covet, shut that lie Now shut that bonk, you neighbour's wife
The recipe for egg-tripe lice A hundred ways to kill a fly
Love your daddy, love your mummy Put your bread and milk and honey
He cut his fish, he did, he did Never beat the wife and kids
Sloughed through deserts, sloughed through sand Until we reached the promised land
Now shan't not kill, now shan't not steal Shan't not plough in a jottery
Jottery size of fifty-pea White camel, camel shoe, camel shoe, camel shoe
Gold, gold, gold yiителей

Okay, following the Android Sisters, talking on the subject,
although I think we are all the subject of money,
following that was either a song called Charlton Heston
by a band called Stump,
or the song may have well just been called Stump Charlton Heston,
which isn't hard if you've ever seen him.
I'm not sure about that, but I know this.
This is The Clash.
Of course. Of course.
Raymond?
The Clash.
The Clash.
The Clash.

Don't leave.
Don't leave.
Don't leave.
Well, I have actually, so far.
Rajwa, Rajwa.

Rajwa, Rajwa.
Rajwa, Rajwa.
Rajwa, Rajwa.
Rajwa, Rajwa.
The poor and the rich, the young and the old be smeared with guiltless gore.
I mustn't panic.
No time for regrets.
The Congress wants more.
Rebellion, the awful realization of it assails us.
Who is to command us all?
My name does not matter.
I have my misgivings, little experience.
There's no sleep for us. All is chaos.
But it's better than we dared hope.
The slaves to buy their freedom with army pay.
Our insubordinate, undisciplined New Englanders are beginning to obey orders.
We're true rebels now.
All of us here and in Congress walk daily in the shadow of the hangman.
But whenever any form of government becomes destructive of those ends,
it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it
and to institute new government.
We can expect the utter destruction,
invasion of all our homes.
Savage is turned loose on our frontiers.
But we have more than our lives or our property.

Thank you.
Several times in fact, I'm able to transport myself there and back.
Zero gravity on an interstellar slide, breaking through to the other side.
Sex, food, sex, food.
TV preachers and creature preachers all night long.

That was a CD that just happened to be here at the station tonight.
It's a group called Alien Sex Fiend.
It's a song called Alien Sex Fiend.
And last week we got a call, or I got a call, from a listener with a request.
And since this was not only a paid up pleasure to this program, but a member of our beloved church,
we hear those requests.
Bob and his chosen, they do not hear the prayers of those who do not pledge or join the Church of the Subgenius.
So, this is an old favorite, although we haven't played this in a long, long time.
We only played it once.
This is Hubert Goetz.
This Sunday, stay tuned right after tapeworm baseball for...
Abedin Costello, Meek.
The Antichrist.
But Abed is the Animus.
Lou Costello is the Anima.
Spring Byington is the Magna Mater.
And John Ireland is the Beast.
In Abed and Costello Meet the Antichrist.
Check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check.
What is it now, Costello?
Look, look, look at that throne.
Which throne?
That throne, the Holy of Holies.
You mean the seat of the throne of Jerusalem?
I mean the throne of Jehovah.
I saw him sitting there.
What's the big deal? There's nobody there.
Will you stop fooling around and shut up and pass me the Kabbalah.
Check, I saw him there.
Who?
David Rockefeller.
But if I see you hitting the Holy Sacrament one more time.
See our two G.I. jerks say,
Nuts to the Nazis like this.
Now Homer, listen to me.
It's simple.
The forces of dark and the forces of light will fight for the last time.
You mean like Joe Louis?
No, no, Homer, the apocalypse.
Oh yeah, apocalypse. Oh, I like that Jamaican music.
No, no.
Don't you understand? It's Armageddon.
Armageddon what?
No, not Eurogeddon, Armageddon.
I don't understand.
You're telling me there's a final fight between dark and light?
But it's not a title book.
That's right.
You tell me it's Apocalypseo, but it's not Jamaican Gant.
That's right.
You tell me it's Armageddon, but the only thing I know is I'm getting tired of trying to figure out this book of revelations.
See Lou go gaga over curvaceous Hilary Brooke, but bite off more hosts than he can chew when he winds up up to his stripes in hot holy water.
Homer, it's kind of hot in here.
How about if we step outside to the veranda?
That's okay by me, lady.
Why, you adorable little finger. Shy, aren't you?
Ah, shucks, yes, ma'am.
Call me Hilary.
Okay, Hilary.
Well, if you're ever lonely, Homer, you can give me a call. You won't regret it.
You're a nice lady. What's your number?
Here, it's 666-6666.
666-6666.
That's right.
666-6666.
Abb and Gastello meet the Antichrist this Sunday right after tapeworm baseball.
