1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,900
In the tombs where you fled to escape your fellow man, to escape from your inferiors,

2
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:25,380
from the halt and lame of mind, do you speak to men, you pious vomit?

3
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,160
Your abode is in a nest of peacocks, Meron.

4
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,520
Well, that's certainly enough of that. Our guest was the demon from The Exorcist.

5
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,520
And now let's go to our next guest. What you're talking about here is

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,600
Doctors for Extreme Prejudice, our guest here tonight in the studio down here by the beach.

7
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,600
Yes, for the first time, Doctors for Extreme Prejudice hits the West Coast.

8
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,560
Look at that go. Yes, yes.

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,240
Bob Rotman.

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,360
Bob Rotman.

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:55,360


12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,720
And when the doctors get together, they like to relax with a few shots and a few shots.

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,640
Yes, a few shots and a few shots.

14
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,560
It's all right, it's all right, Doctor. You'll be okay.

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,640
No. Holy, holy Bob.

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,580
That's just another fine Doctor for Bob, all puffed up and swollen with the sound of rant.

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,180
Hey, Doctor.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,660
Doug, did you gas the show up?

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,520
No, I don't think I did. I better check.

20
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,440
Okay, I've got my credit card, so I'm gonna go gas it up while you guys clean the windshield.

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,840
Get some Raisin Bran, okay, and some big newbies and stuff.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,100
All right.

23
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,980
Now we're ready to go to...

24
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,700
Camera 3 and the closest shot of this scary operation which we've been able to see this morning.

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,340
And here are the little tree frogs that used to inhabit the island and came...

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,160
Oh, come on, get them off me.

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
Hey, you wanna get those frogs off me?

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,540
They're jumping all over the bathroom.

29
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,720
Get those frogs off me.

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,360
Where's my torch?

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,080
How do I get out of here?

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,280
This is sticky.

33
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,580
I'm going to the other end of the house.

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,080
Wait, you've got the wrong show, dog.

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,780
Oh, this isn't the Bolivian show?

36
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,600
No, no, no.

37
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,600
This is the Oakland show, right?

38
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:50,860
Yeah, right.

39
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,620
The Berkeley show.

40
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,820
The Berkeley show, right.

41
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,740
Take the frogs off.

42
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,800
No frogs here.

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,700
No, no, you need muggers and police cars.

44
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,420
These are not good operating conditions here on the football field with all these dogs strutting around the temple.

45
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,460
But they get whatever's left over and that's what we call the eco-balance of nature.

46
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,800
Nevertheless, I'll try to wake up and talk.

47
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,940
Hey, dog, you wanna give me the keys so I can get the tank unlocked?

48
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,580
Do we use keys in this show?

49
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,020
Well, if you want me to fuel up the show...

50
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,720
I guess so.

51
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,780
I guess we better use them.

52
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,380
Well, I have a key.

53
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,440
Tonight the show's going to various scary parts of the world.

54
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,380
We're going to the wrong, wrong right side of the Yakutizma Perception Center

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,780
where people are going to...

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,820
stretch out their little maple eyestitch fields

57
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,520
and we're going to look for babayons in a Gargamel Chow's cavern.

58
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,540
Not for no one, neither.

59
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,320
We'll take the show back to the far other side of the extent of where we haven't been yet.

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,980
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

61
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,220
The Self Genius Hour of Slack.

62
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,540
What you gonna play?

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,340
Now, Bobby, I don't know.

64
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,040
B-b-b-b-b-baaaaaaaaaaaaah!

65
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,680
Hey, strap in.

66
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,980
The show's about to take off.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,660
...about two and a half miles in width.

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,520
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

69
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,640
Hey, did you bring your law firm?

70
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,040
I did, it's right here in my briefcase.

71
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,760
Break it out.

72
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,460
Well, break out what you can and let's get them to signing these papers.

73
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:20,980
Right.

74
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,420
How are you gonna find out before we get them all signed?

75
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,880
This, uh, stand has to be terminated with extreme prejudice.

76
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,380
Shh.

77
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,740
Okay, okay, okay.

78
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,680
The state doesn't know about that yet. We're still signing the papers.

79
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,920
Sign over there.

80
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
Now, could you sign this piece of paper?

81
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,280
Okay, now, over there.

82
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,720
Ah, okay.

83
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,820
Will you have your wife sign this piece, please?

84
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,280
The children need to make their marks here and here.

85
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,740
Tevis, sign here.

86
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,140
And the house, the house...

87
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,520
Oh, here are the papers for the house.

88
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,960
The cars have to sign here, please.

89
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,660
Oh, yes.

90
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,040
Someone else has to sign.

91
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,100
And all three of these parts to find itself are in deep trouble.

92
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,520
We are in trouble.

93
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,380
Are we possessing rights?

94
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,120
Okay.

95
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,940
Here at the singing lawyer.

96
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,940
This is the...

97
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,860
Oh, again, sign the final agreement.

98
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,000
Still signing.

99
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,340
...staying in return for the two-thirds of my sole back from the other bankers,

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,480
hereby give the church to the bank.

101
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,740
And, uh, I'm signing right here.

102
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,200
He's just singing.

103
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,620
And right here.

104
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,860
And, uh, he's signing chapter three.

105
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,020
Okay, I've got to pick up what I've got here, guys.

106
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,560
He's getting his chance.

107
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,920
We can't wake him up in the middle of the night and take his church away with his kids sleeping and his wife.

108
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,580
I'm sorry, he's just lost it.

109
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,580
The church no longer belongs to him.

110
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,920
Stang, I've got two-thirds of my book in the mail myself.

111
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,560
Look, here's Stang calling in to tell us he wants his church back.

112
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,120
Hello, this is Stang.

113
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,080
Where's Bob?

114
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,880
Well, you don't have to worry about Bob because there's a new church.

115
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,400
Oh, is this time control?

116
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,400
So here is your future, Wiz's past.

117
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,740
On your video screen, you can see the bad things that happened in 1984

118
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,880
and the good things that'll be happening in 1985 when your new religion is being sold.

119
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,500
Sorry.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,080
What is wrong?

121
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,260
What is going on?

122
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:13,940
Sorry.

123
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,800
One thing I had to say is that somebody wants our church back and agricults want to see it live.

124
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:38,800


125
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:38,800


126
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:38,900
or that one ¡uh!

127
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,220
Just disgusting.

128
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,220


129
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,860
There is nothing to Weakening U say,��자.

130
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:52,860


131
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,920
guitar solo

132
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,320
guitar solo

133
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,720
guitar solo

134
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,840

137

139
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,240

guitar solo

144
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:44,620
Uh, yes, and that's what the Church of the Subgenius is all about, friends.

145
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,300
Uh, we, uh, once again, one of those thrown-together shows,

146
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,840
well, actually, I edited it about a half an hour's worth of stuff,

147
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,420
but I've got some great music.

148
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,600
It's about time we played it.

149
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,080
There's a new album, or tape, one might say,

150
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,040
from Lost Souls Incorporated here in Dallas, Texas,

151
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:12,200
or actually in Arlington, the city, the mid-city city,

152
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,980
and, uh, you know, I could just play, it is so good,

153
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,640
I could just play the whole Lost Souls Incorporated album.

154
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,700
I'm not going to, but I'm gonna try to put in two songs from it tonight.

155
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,000
You'll love this stuff.

156
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,760
guitar solo

157
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,060
guitar solo

158
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,140

159
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,140
guitar solo

160
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,140


161
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,240
There comes a time to reinvent everything

162
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,840
guitar solo

163
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,900
guitar solo

164
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:53,900


165
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,280
There comes a time to cast aside some dreams

166
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,640
I was having the nightmare of the apocalypse again

167
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,980
When you woke me with your phony bedside screams

168
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,780
They remind me of a dinner bell still ringing

169
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,560
Since Pavlov and his dogs have had their day

170
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,420
We're drooling green and we recycle everything

171
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,120
It's no one's fault, there's nothing new today

172
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,820
Trying to steer the upside down

173
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,560
I'm a down world trying to ignore the entropy

174
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,320
Trying to steer me upside

175
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,620
I'm a down world talking about the 20th century

176
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,000
Industrial to information culture

177
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,960
From communist to root of evil greed

178
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,920
The capitalists gaining are still vultures

179
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,100
They smell a little blood in the machine

180
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,820
I'm trying to steer the upside down

181
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,400
I'm a down world trying to force down more than we can eat

182
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,720
Trying to steer me upside

183
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,920
I'm a down world still a little blood in the machine

184
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,020
Upside down world

185
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,320
Fingert, siècle

186
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,940
Upside down world

187
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Talking about the end of the century

188
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,820
Talking about the end of the century

189
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,900
Talking about the end of the century

190
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,160
Talking about the end of the century

191
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,820
Nostalgia comes in cycles of two decades

192
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,520
The 70s are back now as I write

193
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,380
It's that long since we should have switched to methane

194
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,160
I'm running out of rocket fuel tonight

195
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,560
Trying to steer the upside of a down world

196
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,840
Still hoping to feed the starving

197
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,720
Trying to steer the upside of a down world

198
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,580
Pleading won't you please stop the killing

199
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,700
But five billion's too much

200
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,180
Not enough time in the world!

201
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:20,500
Not enough time in the world!

202
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,580
Don't you slow me down

203
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,820
No it's a crime

204
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,980
Turn it off!

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,620
Turn on tune and drop by

206
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,640
Had enough

207
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,640
But I've still got to make up another line

208
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,720
Cause I'm trying to steer the upside

209
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,980
Of a down world

210
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,020
Trying to ignore the entropy

211
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,760
Trying to steer the upside

212
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,080
Of a down world

213
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,180
Trying to be the blood in the machine

214
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,120
Upside down world

215
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,480
Upside down world

216
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,820
Fandesia Glam

217
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,220
Upside down world

218
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,160
Talking about the end of the century

219
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Talking about the end of the century

220
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,400
Talking about the end of the century

221
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:28,040
Upside down world

222
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,000
Ravens Getting

223
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,280
Jobless

224
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,160
NORT

225
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,300
midnight

226
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,300


227
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,720
Alder

228
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:42,720


229
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,180
Now I'm back

230
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,180


231
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,460
It's time to say death

232
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,240
Right now

233
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,920
Oh yeah

234
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,260
It's time we set an air

235
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,780
Beautiful, beautiful, and more of Lost Souls Incorporated coming up, dear friends.

236
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,080
Oh, whoa, whoa.

237
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,660
What am I going to do with my daughter here?

238
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,580
Sivit, do you have anything to say,

239
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,880
or is there any reason that you've come to this show to hang around,

240
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,000
aside from the fact that it's Father's Day?

241
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,660
Oh, she's unplugged the microphone.

242
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:15,800
There.

243
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,680
I fixed it.

244
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,780
Why did you come down here today?

245
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,300
Because it's Father's Day, and I love my daddy.

246
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,040
Oh, man.

247
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,380
The best daughter in the whole world.

248
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,120
That's what I've got, dear friends.

249
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,820
Well, we hate to get personal on the Hour of Slack

250
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,320
or show any feelings, human emotions,

251
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,640
any crack in the facade,

252
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,520
any tiny breach in the armor,

253
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,140
is, of course, uh...

254
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,140
Well, it's a blessing in the eyes of Bob, dear friends.

255
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh, yes.

256
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,140
Sorry.

257
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:06,900
Sorry.

258
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,380
Now, if you will excuse me, I must be on my way.

259
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,160
Jekyll.

260
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,580
Are you sure?

261
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,160
Oh, it's... safe.

262
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,220
Ha ha ha.

263
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,240
Primitive people have been using it for centuries.

264
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Cool, man.

265
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,060
Okay, here are the two shows.

266
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,620
I'm gonna put some show on here for you, and I'm just...

267
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,080
trying to get my show together here so I can give you some show.

268
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,440
And I'll still be able to send you some show.

269
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,020
Oh, and now I would like to present...

270
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,040
Beautiful day.

271
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,780
His...

272
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,820
His Excellency, Count Hohenstaufen von Liechtenstein.

273
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,400
Our guest tonight.

274
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,360
The Count has a war wound.

275
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,160
He's not able to speak very well, but he's sickled by...

276
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,400
Rem.

277
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,860
He waves his stumps and, uh, thus communicates.

278
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,520
Yes, and here we are, flying high over the hill.

279
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,060
Oh, my God.

280
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,980
The hills of Berkeley now.

281
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,340
Whoa, look out!

282
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,060
Cleveland Donuts.

283
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,240
Don't...

284
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,520
Call her!

285
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,640
Call her right outside the building.

286
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,000
Come on.

287
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,060
I hope you all enjoyed that brief moment of silence you had there.

288
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,860
It was almost a half second.

289
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:32,900
Good.

290
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:33,880
Oh.

291
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,840
Come on!

292
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,980
That'll last forever in my memory.

293
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,140
First time ever.

294
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:39,960
Okay.

295
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,120
No.

296
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:40,660
Okay.

297
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,460
Oh, more.

298
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,080
Oh, oh.

299
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,980
We got some more.

300
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,620
Why do I feel that they're...

301
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,040
Bergman knew how to use the...

302
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,040


303
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,040


304
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,040


305
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,040


306
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,040


307
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,040


308
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,040


309
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,040


310
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,540
... silence?

311
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,320
The silence of the soul.

312
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,660
Sure is nice out here.

313
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,600
I hope the boat comes, though.

314
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,800
Fellini knew how to use silence.

315
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,960
Gary said he was going to.

316
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But that horrible boatman with his grizzly hands...

317
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,440
Yeah, I know.

318
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,140
Don't touch him.

319
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,680
... that giant flaming oar...

320
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:01,700
Oh, yes.

321
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,040
Mr. Boatman.

322
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,020
Please, Mr. Boatman.

323
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,500
Uh...

324
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,460
And look, you have to put a coin on his tongue, and it's all black and icky.

325
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,920
Climb aboard, Dr. Howell Robbins.

326
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,200
No, no.

327
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,040
And be prepared for the next time.

328
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,040


329
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,040


330
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,040


331
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,040


332
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,040


333
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,040


334
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,040


335
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,040


336
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,040


337
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,060
I'm prepared to go past my dog, my three-headed dog's cerebrus.

338
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,840
Oh, he looks rather cerebral.

339
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,180
The triple-brained monster which guards the gates, the gateway.

340
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,780
Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.

341
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,180
What's he reading from?

342
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,340
Yes, I am away...

343
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,200
It's a B-movie script.

344
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,820
... into eternal sorrow.

345
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,840
I am the wage of forsaken people.

346
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,780
Gee, you're right, Virgil, said Dobbs.

347
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,040
I don't know.

348
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,040


349
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,040


350
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,040


351
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,040


352
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,040


353
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,040


354
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,460
It is getting hot in here.

355
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,160
Yeah, I've seen that movie, the Virgil movie.

356
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,820
... beyond me and beyond time, I think.

357
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,520
Yeah.

358
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,720
Bob and Virgil went several levels further down into hell.

359
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:58,860
It's nice out here in the ocean.

360
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,560
It makes you feel a little bit of a problem, doesn't it?

361
00:17:59,560 --> 00:17:59,580
Oh, look out.

362
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,520
Suddenly, Bob, shifting his kite from one hand to the other, pulled out from his voluminous

363
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:11,040
ditty bag a sop of cakes with wine and honey, fermented, which he threw dexterously into

364
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,080
the slavering three mouths of the three-headed monster which guarded the cavernous entrance.

365
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,820
And in return, he was given a mighty blivet by Satan.

366
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:27,800
And a mighty belt shook the canine's bulging stomach.

367
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,500
His three-headed thing wafted in the air.

368
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,300
You're not going to get me to mention that.

369
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,720
That's enough of horrible horticultural facts on the world of mythology.

370
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,540
It's horrible three foreskins quivering.

371
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:46,060
His gigantic, populous, scabrous hide quivered unspeakably as with two-headed men.

372
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,060


373
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,020
In canine lust, he scraped his hindquarters across the floor, howling and dribbling from

374
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,420
all three heads simultaneously.

375
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:00,140
Huge ticks the size of small land crabs leaped from his fur-sparse epidermis.

376
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,460
Suddenly, the dog leaped across the vast expanse of hell and saddled up to Ivan's leg.

377
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,180
Yes, he was forced to be on the show hour after hour.

378
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,240
Pino, why did you make me do that horrible thing?

379
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:12,820
Yes.

380
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,860
Yes, the bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling.

381
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,220
For you and not for me.

382
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,220
Take my glands away, King P-Dog.

383
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,540
They bang and bong and bing-a-ling-a-ling and ring eternally.

384
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,840
Yeah, they don't ever stop.

385
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,000
Yes, from Cerebus the P-Dog, they all go for Ivan's leg.

386
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,220
Ow! Get that, you! Get those horrible little poodles off of me!

387
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,720
I hate poodles!

388
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:40,960
That was Madame Ruzanga and her dancing chihuahuas performing once again on the subgenius hour of mystery and darkness.

389
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,020
That was really a beautiful little dance number, Dr. Howell.

390
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,780
What a nice service.

391
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,880
Yeah, you wouldn't think they were capable.

392
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,540
And when's Michael Jackson gonna be on?

393
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,540
Good morning, Michael.

394
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,800
Oh, I'm sorry, Michael Jackson's not going to be on tonight.

395
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:07,720
Instead, we have Lost Souls Incorporated, which are, believe me, every bit as good, and I'm sure you'll enjoy them just as much.

396
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:14,640
This is a little ditty called Elvis Don't Live Here.

397
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,200
And, ah, yes.

398
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:32,860
By the way, now that I've got this music from Seventh Voyage of Sinbad in the background, I have to say, I hope when I grow up to be 70 years old that I'm more like Dr. Leary than Mr. Harryhausen.

399
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:38,660
Because I went to the Fantasy Fair this weekend, you know, a big sci-fi convention here in Dallas.

400
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,600
And, praise Bob, Ray Harryhausen was one of the guests.

401
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,020
The great special effects expert.

402
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:54,200
The man who really, if anything, is responsible for the church of the subgenius, one might say.

403
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,620
And many, many other subversive and evil things without ever meaning to be.

404
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:07,100
He just presented us with what we could not see in the conspiracy world.

405
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,920
And so we chose that other world.

406
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,720
But, you know, he's an old man.

407
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,240
And I was at that convention.

408
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:21,740
And I was hoping I wouldn't hear this, but I did hear him bad mouth Jurassic Park.

409
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,700
Yes, Ray Harryhausen sat up there and said,

410
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,020
Well, anyone can push buttons on a computer.

411
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,920
But this, the things we used to do were handcrafted.

412
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,440
I don't think that, ah, that for $50 million,

413
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,700
or whatever it is.

414
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,300
Friends, you know it's sad when one gets so old,

415
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:55,560
he can't appreciate the fact that something is done better and more beautifully and easier with a different technique.

416
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:00,140
And I can't believe I'm saying that about Ray Harryhausen.

417
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:08,180
One of the truly great, great men who has ever lived.

418
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,660
Yes.

419
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,440
But, ah, but to hear anybody,

420
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm sorry, but to hear anybody bad mouth Jurassic Park,

421
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
that just makes me sick.

422
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,800
What do you say, T?

423
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,140
Can you believe it?

424
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,640
That's what I say.

425
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,260
I tell you, man, it's a mess.

426
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,240
You know, people get to be old fogies of some kind or another.

427
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,580
Now, which, which tape was I going to stick in here?

428
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
Oh, yeah, Lost Souls Incorporated.

429
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,540
Elvis don't live here no more.

430
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:38,980
Uh-huh.

431
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,240
Elvis doesn't live here anymore.

432
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,600
And if he did, he'd have long since changed the decor.

433
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:14,640
Now, they won't let you walk on the grass where the king played touch football with his friends.

434
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,820
But you can write your postcard home saying you were there with him.

435
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,240
We drove for a thousand miles listening to his cassettes.

436
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,440
Crashed in some sleazy motels with broken TV sets.

437
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,680
Just to drop out a C-note off some sacred relics,

438
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,580
the postcards, the keychains, the cups.

439
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:53,420
To listening to him on the way home made me want to throw up.

440
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,220
Cause they're popping him in from the top.

441
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,220


442
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,480
From the Lisa Marie to the Heartbreak Hotel restaurant.

443
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,360
And they'll never ask what you expected, just what do you want?

444
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,520
What do you want?

445
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,660
Because Elvis doesn't live here anymore.

446
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,260
Oh, no, no.

447
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,460
Even his spirit avoids the place I could have sworn.

448
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:36,300
And it's a shame to admit, but like all of the sheep, I was herded quite docilely by

449
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:43,540
the programmed security robots disguised as tour guides.

450
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,440
Who's that laughing at me?

451
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,580
Oh, so derisively.

452
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,420
It couldn't be just in my head, no.

453
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,220
That's the spirit of Colonel Tom Parker that's always learned.

454
00:24:59,220 --> 00:24:59,660
He's got the looks there.

455
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,140
And he's lurking there.

456
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,240
Saying what he wants.

457
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,620
Better out there.

458
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,120
Saying what he wants.

459
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,980
Better out there.

460
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,420
He said the time has shaken our little house down to aience.

461
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:27,420


462
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:27,420


463
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,140
Elvis doesn't live here anymore.

464
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,960
He's always gatherings, seusses, Seven of the forgiven,

465
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,340
but only dishes and a retriever.

466
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:38,340


467
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,540
And I'm gonna take him home and do the rest.

468
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:48,540
And if he's so cheap and you can't cry his grave side, that's all right.

469
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,920
There's no time for tears.

470
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:58,480
And if you're like me standing right there, you'll feel like you're light years from here.

471
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:06,260
Cause they're piping him in from the Lisa Marie to the Heartbreak Hotel restaurant.

472
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,140
And they'll never ask what you expected, just what do you want?

473
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,100
So what do you want?

474
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,220
And I heard a lot of food and stuff.

475
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,400
Okay, there hasn't really been that much, but go ahead, what's on your mind?

476
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:54,940
Well, I'd like to talk about salvation instead.

477
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,140
Okay, I'd like to too.

478
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:03,980
It's more, to use the other discussion, it's more nutritious.

479
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,460
You know what I mean?

480
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,460
I do, yeah, food for the spirit.

481
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,800
Yes.

482
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,040
Wait, you got a card?

483
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,820
I don't know nutrition in salvation, not in fire.

484
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,920
Mm-hmm.

485
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,940
Salvation comes first, that's for sure.

486
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:26,380
It's not the difference between good food and bad food.

487
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,160
I wouldn't eat a McDonald's packet of Burger King, you know?

488
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:35,820
And I just don't, you've got to be able to choose.

489
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,560
You do, and that's the first step to knowing God.

490
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,200
Appreciate your call, Marge.

491
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,620
Thanks, Kamal.

492
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:50,200
All right, now turn the record over, and we'll hear more about this great plan of ours.

493
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,000
Here is some more racism in the Bible.

494
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:02,420
And God told Isaac and Rebekah, the sons of the world will become two rival nations.

495
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,080
One will be stronger than the other, and the older shall be the servant of the younger.

496
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,180
This means that the African nation shall be the servant of the younger.

497
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,040
And the older shall be the son of the new nation, of the whites.

498
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,640
This is clear and clear.

499
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,600
Racism in the Bible once again.

500
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,760
Now, who tainted the Bible?

501
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,920
Satan!

502
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,080
Satan again has tainted the Bible.

503
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,440
All faggots must die and die and die in the fire of hell.

504
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:42,160
Faggots, send as much money as you can before you die to this day!

505
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,360
Eat your wretched lust for a while.

506
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,580
I hate to break up your game, but we're leaving for Earth as soon as possible.

507
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,480
Yeah, that's what we're doing right now, dear friends.

508
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,640
And the swinging love corpses will help us.

509
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,100
I wish we were leaving Earth, actually, is what it comes down to.

510
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,520
Uh-oh. I'm not politically correct.

511
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,580
Father!

512
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,200
How about the, uh...

513
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,600
Iraq has a hydrogen bomb.

514
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,180
Father!

515
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,700
How about the, uh, in Bangladesh?

516
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,760
3,000 people are killed in a typhoon in Bangladesh.

517
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,300
3,000 people are killed in a typhoon in Bangladesh.

518
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:44,960
Bummer!

519
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,520
Bummer!

520
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,600
There's a trillion dollar deficit.

521
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,720
Bummer!

522
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,340
Kind of a bummer.

523
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:54,580
I can't myself buddhi.

524
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,920
I cut myself shaving.

525
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,600
Oh...

526
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,760
Bummer!

527
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,700
Bummer!

528
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:01,900
Bummer!

529
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,640
Hitler killed six million Jews in World War II.

530
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,300
It was a bummer!

531
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:20,800
Bummer!

532
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,020
The greenhouse effect for...

533
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,160
Well, he killed the dinosaurs.

534
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,440
Oh yeah, right. When an asteroid hit the earth,

535
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:39,160
all the dinosaurs were killed as a cloud covered the earth.

536
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,020
Real bummer!

537
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,140
Bummer!

538
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,040
Help! I'm falling and I can't get up!

539
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,220
Bummer!

540
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:03,980
Bummer!

541
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,100
That song is a bummer.

542
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,260
Come on!

543
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,380
You can scream louder than that!

544
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,100
Ah, come on man.

545
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,380
I'm sure you can...

546
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,180
scream.

547
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,120
Can't you? Can you not scream louder than that?

548
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,400
Tevis, what do you say?

549
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,840
Is it hot? What?

550
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,600
I can scream very loud.

551
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,820
And Willow Dog knows it.

552
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,440
Yes.

553
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,120
Wait a minute. Now, what is that?

554
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,200
I can scream. I can scream very loud.

555
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,100
You can...

556
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:50,480
Any 12 year old girl can scream loud enough to wreck the eardrums of a hundred grown ups.

557
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,520
Or dogs.

558
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,520
Yeah.

559
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,880
Yes, dogs.

560
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,320
Oh, yes.

561
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,780
Yes, we're back.

562
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,380
I guess we're back.

563
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,500
And we're not very beautiful, really.

564
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,200
...thing for earth as soon as possible.

565
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,600
Say, Mac, could you like spare some change for like a bite to eat?

566
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,380
What?

567
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:20,600
Ah!

568
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,080
Here! Now go on!

569
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,100
Scram!

570
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,600
Like, bless you, sir.

571
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,280
Deadbeat!

572
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,620
...and get good milk from a brown skinned cow.

573
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,880
The color of the skin doesn't matter no how.

574
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,420
Ho, ho, ho.

575
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,200
Ha, ha, ha. You can learn common sense at the grocery store.

576
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,240
We shall begin.

577
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,800
Sit down in your favorite chair.

578
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:58,400
The chair in which you do your reading, your thinking, and your relaxation.

579
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,600
Or lie down on your favorite Chesterfield.

580
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,060
Drop your arms to your sides.

581
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,580
Relax completely.

582
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,720
And now, listen to my voice.

583
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:22,980
We're like a slowly growing organism in its infancy now, but gradually maturing.

584
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,500
A super race.

585
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,640
Well, yes.

586
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,140
But not an evil super race.

587
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:36,140
Still in the future, there won't be any room for imperfection.

588
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,420
But who chooses?

589
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:45,820
In medicine, as you know it, your organ transplants are forcing a choice.

590
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,780
I mean, who should have another heart?

591
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
The mental deficient or the great philosopher?

592
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:54,860
Hmm?

593
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,760
Or an artist?

594
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,960
Or some great statesman?

595
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,440
Now don't tell me that you would choose the deficient.

596
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,040
They're breeding with our daughters and spreading their AIDS.

597
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,360
Spreading their AIDS.

598
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:15,900
They're just, they're intermingling in the blacks and the Jews.

599
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,400
Imagine that, a new chocolate race.

600
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:18,860
Okay, okay.

601
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,680
Disgust!

602
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,220
Racism!

603
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,080
This is what racism and the Bible leads to!

604
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,320
This is what we've been telling you about!

605
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:35,960
These heathen masturbators, the heathenism, or the Satan-worshipping racists that we've been talking about!

606
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,860
You're not paranoid!

607
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,500
It's just that Satan is everywhere!

608
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,720
He's all around us!

609
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,080
He's right behind me!

610
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,320
He's in front of me!

611
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,400
He's to the left of me!

612
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,200
He's to the right of me!

613
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,880
Satan is everywhere!

614
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,120
He's in our schools!

615
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,680
He's in our classrooms!

616
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,900
He's in our youths!

617
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,220
He's the drugs on the streets!

618
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
And Satan is taking over!

619
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,080
He's taking over the hearts and the souls of mankind!

620
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:19,660
And there's this teeny few of us who must combat this evil!

621
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,200
You seem to have forgotten something.

622
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:22,780
You must not forget, Doctor.

623
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,060
You have to murder them.

624
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,220
Well, my dear young man,

625
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,640
we are for the future.

626
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,660
Now I ask you,

627
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,900
what future do they have?

628
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,440
God!

629
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,420
Give us some preachers!

630
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,120
God!

631
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,080
Give us some preachers!

632
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,500
God!

633
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:52,100
Give us some preachers!

634
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,200


635
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,200


636
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,140
The next rule of the Church of the Subgenius also takes a little bit of explaining.

637
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,320
And I've been searching for an example, children, and I think I've found it.

638
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,900
The Church of the Subgenius knows, as you do not yet,

639
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,700
that the conspiracy is out to get you, children.

640
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,440
It's out to sap your lifeblood.

641
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,580
And you have to deal with the conspiracy every day.

642
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,840
And things that happen to you

643
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,940
that give you the existential blues,

644
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,480
you may not recognize them as a conspiracy,

645
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,120
but they are.

646
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,680
And because of that,

647
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,860
the Church of the Subgenius knows that you should elevate

648
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,560
every confrontation with the conspiracy

649
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,080
to the ultimate.

650
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,140
So that you don't lose sight

651
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,980
of the stakes involved.

652
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,220
And that's why we call this rule

653
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,940
Or Kill Them.

654
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,900
Let me explain this, children.

655
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,360
I was in a store.

656
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,200
I was in a store one day.

657
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,800
I was purchasing a few objects.

658
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,720
Or as you say in New Orleans,

659
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:48,900
objays.

660
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,100
And I was looking at the store.

661
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,440
And I stacked my objays by the cash register.

662
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,160
And something caught my eye on the counter.

663
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,900
And I went over to look at it.

664
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,940
Wasn't that interesting?

665
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,180
I turned back.

666
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,880
And some pink-wimp conspiracy mind-deaf

667
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,080
had taken my line,

668
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,400
my spotting line,

669
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,760
at the cash register.

670
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,100
Children, this was not a minor event.

671
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,740
This was the conspiracy incarnate.

672
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,500
And I said to him,

673
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,460
excuse me,

674
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,100
but I was in a store.

675
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,440
I was here first.

676
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,860
Then, and he said to me,

677
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,980
no you weren't, I was here first.

678
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,400
You may mistake this for a meaningless confrontation, children,

679
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,240
but it was the conspiracy incarnate.

680
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,920
And that's why I turned to that man

681
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,460
and I said,

682
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,760
I was here first.

683
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,520
Or kill me!

684
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,900
The next rule of the Church of the Self-Genius

685
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,280
is an intro into the next part of this section

686
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,720
and I'm going to tell you

687
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,600
what the subgenius is

688
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,280
and what makes a subgenius.

689
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,620
One thing you can always say

690
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,080
about subgeniuses is that

691
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,020
they pick fields

692
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,380
where it takes your entire lifetime

693
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,640
to fail.

694
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,400
Children, subgeniuses are artists.

695
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,500
They're writers.

696
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,800
They're musicians.

697
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,280
They labor in obscurity, children.

698
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,700
They work hard.

699
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,000
They work alone, children.

700
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,460
They work alone.

701
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,400
Because the conspiracy wants you to believe

702
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,460
that if you are a creative person

703
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,600
you have to be out there alone.

704
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,700
Shut off from the world.

705
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,540
In touch with your views.

706
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,380
Because the conspiracy wants you to believe

707
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,680
that you cannot unite children.

708
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,240
But even the people

709
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,980
who have to be alone to work

710
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,880
need a community, children.

711
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,600
A collaborative network.

712
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,760
And that's why in the Church of the Self-Genius

713
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,240
we say,

714
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,140
individuals get lonely too.

715
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,020
And,

716
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,900
that's where I decided to

717
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,480
just cut in on my edit.

718
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,920
I had some good cuts that go with that.

719
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,220
But I'm going to instead play this

720
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,280
yet one more song

721
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,280
by Lost Souls Incorporated.

722
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,420
Sort of an anti-romantic song.

723
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,060
And I think some may appreciate it.

724
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:10,860
And I think some may appreciate it.

725
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,020
And I think some may appreciate it.

726
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,280
Lost Souls Incorporated, dear friend.

727
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:14,780
Lost Souls Incorporated, dear friend.

728
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,360
She doesn't channel spirits of the dead.

729
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,140
She isn't all that great at making beds.

730
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,300
She isn't all that great at making beds.

731
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,260
Her figure isn't stunning

732
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,260
but it won't embarrass you

733
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,860
at the beach either.

734
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,120
At the beach either.

735
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,000
She might suggest to me

736
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,220
that I'm her kind

737
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,020
It's true if love is

738
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,460
lame as well as blind

739
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,960
I'm willing to endure the average lifespan

740
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,740
So I must be glad to meet her

741
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,180
Medium girl, I guess I'll marry her

742
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,680
And father mediocre children

743
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,580
Some middle class neighborhood

744
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:09,000
Medium girl, it's hard to sing her praises

745
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,740
But she's maybe best for it for me

746
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,760
Girl's okay

747
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,840
She'd be so easy to back close for

748
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,320
If I ever went to the mall

749
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,960
I'd pick her birthday card at random

750
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,100
She'd thank me for remembering at all

751
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,960
Medium girl, I guess I'll marry her

752
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,340
And father mediocre children

753
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,320
Some middle class neighborhood

754
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,560
Medium girl, it's hard to sing her praises

755
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,360
But she's maybe best for it for me

756
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,400
Girl's okay

757
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,760
In a world full of people

758
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,840
Always yearning for something

759
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,960
Till we settle for anyone

760
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,680
I'll take her

761
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,120
And it's dumb as a program

762
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,260
On your cathode ray t-shirt

763
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,620
Yet you follow the

764
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,380
Line of least resistance

765
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:11,260
I'll never write a symphony for girls

766
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,540
And I'll never write a symphony for girls

767
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:12,540


768
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,200
Instead I'll buy a string of phony pearls

769
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,480
She's not exactly clever

770
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,640
Maybe I could convince her

771
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,040
There's something real

772
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,920
Medium girl, I guess I'll marry her

773
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,460
And father mediocre children

774
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,340
Some middle class neighborhood

775
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,560
Medium girl, it's hard to sing her praises

776
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,420
But she's maybe best for it for me

777
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,480
Girl's okay

778
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,980
Just okay

779
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,960
Yes, I'll marry her

780
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,440
Our used pee on her

781
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,420
I did choose her poison

782
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,460
And spoke the girls of today

783
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,200
Incorporated. Lovely, lovely, lovely. Was I thinking about playing some more music tonight?

784
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,400
Well, why not? We'll do it.

785
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:34,140
It's Greg Keeler, dear friends, in Bozeman, Montana. Another independent production, as

786
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,800
everything we play just about is.

787
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,540
It's Greg Keeler, dear friends, in Bozeman, Montana. Another independent production, as

788
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:42,520
everything we play just about is.

789
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:58,200
I hope hell gets here soon. This Sony cassette recorder might pick up these last words. So

790
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:05,180
I'll press record and tell my tale and hope someday I'm heard.

791
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:29,840
I was the new age cowboy and I walked the mountain trails.

792
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:39,140
With my llama name, Persephone, I sought the hidden vales.

793
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,540
With chest over made of cream.

794
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,140
I was the new age cowboy and I walked the mountain trails.

795
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,880
I freed myself from sin.

796
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:55,360
And harnessed my computer to ride the solar wind.

797
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:00,660
I've channeled all the Aztec gods.

798
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,460
I've listened to the sea.

799
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:12,060
All I ever wanted was to set my body free.

800
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:12,540
All I ever wanted was to set my body free.

801
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:20,040
Free, angry, sugar free, AIDS free, drug free, fat free, smoke free, booze free,

802
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:27,400
beet free, caffeine free, milk free, odor free, smog free, interest free, care free,

803
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,780
all I ever wanted was to set my body free.

804
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:35,140
I was the new age cowboy and I rode a cosmic range.

805
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,360
I chased the fads, both good and bad.

806
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,680
I changed with every change.

807
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,020
With pistols made of crystal.

808
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,080
I freed myself from sin.

809
00:45:52,500 --> 00:46:00,440
And harnessed my computer to ride the solar wind.

810
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:09,720
Now the flames are closing in on me.

811
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,120
Burning plastic fills my nose.

812
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,580
So I'll zip this Sony in a baggie.

813
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,480
And toss it in the snow.

814
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,620
Music

815
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,520
Music

816
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,820
Music

817
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,980
Music

818
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,440
Music

819
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:39,440


820
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,220
Music.

821
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,300
Music.

822
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:05,300


823
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,820
Yes, Greg Keeler there.

824
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,340
From his album.

825
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,040
What is this album?

826
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,640
I honestly don't even know.

827
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,740
But it's Greg Keeler,

828
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,940
Bad Science Fiction I think is the

829
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:25,580
name of the album.

830
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,800
And it's probably about time that I gave

831
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,980
you some helpful hints

832
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,940
as to what you've been listening to.

833
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:49,520
to dear friends and background music here you know a feller tries to get in

834
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:56,180
and do this radio show dirt back no there's just a hum listen to that name

835
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:06,960

836
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:16,020
lovely lovely long stretch of material here we've had a lot of KPFA radio show

837
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:25,720
pieces from puzzling evidence dr. Howell and in this case

838
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:37,600
special guest G Gordon Gordon we also find ourselves listening to a cut my it

839
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:45,640
I pity myself having to read my own handwriting I really do you know KPFA

840
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:54,380
some Christian calls to radio talk show programs I believe in Oregon from and I

841
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,600
those were sent in by

842
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:01,900
Reverend Jim Blanchard the fine Reverend Jim Blanchard with his huge

843
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,820
prank call collection which is sort of interspersed with ours what are you two

846
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,460
perfectly good

847
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,120
good

848
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:32,180
touch with the ball knocked out oh she knocked the ball off of ballpoint pen

849
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:36,420
here at the station that was my ballpoint pen at one time I think and has

850
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:43,360
marked up an old newspaper and done some sort of extravagant avant-garde artwork

851
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:55,060
I yeah okay also we heard from the the Church of New Faith wonderful preaching

852
00:49:55,060 --> 00:50:01,020
there from Church of New Faith early in the show media barrage material from

853
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:07,220
Reverend Jim Busser who has helped us out many times in the past and more of

854
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:11,880
that coming up Vincent price our Reverend Vincent price of course member

855
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:20,520
of the church talking about the super race and Pope David and Meyer on the the

856
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:25,040
rant about the church doctrine of order

857
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:25,700
kill me.

858
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:31,220
In Turks and the subgenius we say, individuals get lonely too.

859
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,500
Tell me about it.

860
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,440
Tell me what you like.

861
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,880
Oh, it is so good.

862
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,880
But I don't think you like the way you taste it.

863
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,900
Sounds primitive, doesn't it?

864
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:08,700
I know this will sound funny to a scientist.

865
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,280
I can't taste it.

866
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:13,640
Okay.

867
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,020
And now, this.

868
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:17,880
This.

869
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,000
That thing is still running.

870
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:20,700
What have we got here?

871
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:20,900
Oh.

872
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:24,680
Why don't I run the show from the left side of your brain if you want.

873
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,600
Okay, here it will unplug the right side.

874
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,760
The show stumbled on its own one and a half feet.

875
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,160
Come on, doctor.

876
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,400
This man is bleeding to death.

877
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,000
Okay.

878
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:32,840
It is all better now.

879
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:33,500
No.

880
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,620
I'm not even listening to your show.

881
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:36,380
Good, good.

882
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,100
But we can't stay to be on your show because we have another listener.

883
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,760
We're picking up those vibrations.

884
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,220
You are not.

885
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,100
You are not.

886
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:44,600
You are not.

887
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,840
You are not.

888
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,880
We are picking up those vibrations.

889
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:47,880


890
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:47,880


891
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,260
Another dead radio station.

892
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,100
Jerry, please.

893
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,160
I am desperately lonely.

894
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,480
Jerry, hello?

895
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,600
Yeah, you're lonely.

896
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,880
Well, he lost him there.

897
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,180
Now, I have, fortunately, and not too often,

898
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,360
I have been deceived here.

899
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,120
We've had a couple crank calls.

900
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:21,460
One fairly recently, a week, week and a half ago,

901
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:27,360
which, you know, I was brought right into the middle of it,

902
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,740
and then the person kind of started laughing at the end.

903
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,200
And that's fine,

904
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:37,400
because I'm not always going to discern who's right on.

905
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,520
And I know that there are some callers

906
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,360
who call and switch names.

907
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,300
And they'll call a second time,

908
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,800
or maybe another night,

909
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:52,220
but under the frontage of a different name.

910
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:55,220
So I have to, again, I'm saying,

911
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,060
I have to depend upon the Lord.

912
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,420
At least that's my desire.

913
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,440
It's hard to do.

914
00:52:59,500 --> 00:52:59,980
Hi, Andrea.

915
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:00,720
Hi.

916
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,080
Hi.

917
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:04,520
I have something that's totally unrelated.

918
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,500
Oh, well, then forget it.

919
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:07,920
Hi, Malcolm.

920
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,100
Hi.

921
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,660
Hi, my name's Malcolm,

922
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,000
and I'd like to talk a little bit about

923
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,140
what that last caller was talking about,

924
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,280
because it fits into what I'm talking about.

925
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:17,280


926
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:17,280


927
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:17,280


928
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:17,280


929
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:17,280


930
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,940
I originally called to talk about,

931
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,020
I mean, I have to say I'm a compulsive eater.

932
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:24,840
Okay.

933
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,200
And I'm attracted to worldly things,

934
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,080
like food.

935
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,360
I can't stop eating.

936
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:36,340
And it's really hard for me,

937
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,860
because I know that God wouldn't want,

938
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,560
or doesn't want me to be compulsive.

939
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,200
It's not a Christian thing.

940
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,840
Just like smoking cigarettes,

941
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,280
compulsively,

942
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,660
is a bad thing.

943
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:51,280
And just like taking drugs compulsively

944
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:52,720
is a bad thing,

945
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,900
if taking it at all.

946
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,760
And I think that,

947
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,660
I think I'm going to eat myself to death.

948
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,820
I think that I'm going to get so fat

949
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,980
that I'm not going to be able to fit into heaven,

950
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,280
if you know what I mean metaphorically.

951
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,320
And I really don't know what to do,

952
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:11,220
because I'm compromising

953
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,220
my not being a part of this world.

954
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,740
I'm cutting myself off from my lifeline to Jesus.

955
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,020
I've got a message for you,

956
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:17,260
Bob.

957
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,520
The office says it's important.

958
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:18,860
Good.

959
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:19,780
Keep going.

960
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,740
Is this some kind of a joke?

961
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,920
Believe in the power of the dogs.

962
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:27,840
I believe.

963
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,500
Believe in Bob.

964
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,600
Reach out for him.

965
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:32,720
I'm reaching.

966
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:40,280
Sorry, sorry.

967
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,160
We didn't mean to bring up the program.

968
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,600
Drop the sacred name of the program.

969
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:44,500
Not on the ground.

970
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,420
This is kind of incestuous,

971
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:46,680
you know,

972
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,060
a radio talk show.

973
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,600
Calling a radio talk show,

974
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:49,920
I mean.

975
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,440
Hello, caller.

976
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,140
I just walked in.

977
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,420
Well, so did we.

978
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,780
Everybody's real quiet.

979
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,060
What program is this?

980
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,020
How did we get here?

981
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,200
We found this show in progress,

982
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,280
and nobody's running it.

983
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:01,500
Where's my car, caller?

984
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,520
Did you have the keys?

985
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,140
Where's my car?

986
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,920
Give me my car back, caller.

987
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:06,920
I want to go home.

988
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,540
People are weird.

989
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,160
And we either deprogram them

990
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,380
or teach them to stay or kill people.

991
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,860
Here's the deprogramming going on right now.

992
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,660
The battle between the two.

993
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,340
Between churches continues.

994
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,440
Well, that's what churches are for.

995
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,020
Okay.

996
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:22,840
And I lost my car.

997
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,600
This is a message for world peace.

998
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:24,920
Look.

999
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,960
And sometimes it is a hard task,

1000
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,820
but it must be done.

1001
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,060
Satanism is becoming an organized religion,

1002
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,160
just as Christianity is.

1003
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,120
It is going to amass its intelligence into one force

1004
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,360
and overthrow Christianity

1005
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,460
if we don't do anything about it.

1006
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:50,520
And he's going to overtake Jesus on earth.

1007
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,320
And it's up to us, brothers and sisters,

1008
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,280
to make sure that this does not happen.

1009
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,080
The Pope's out to get us.

1010
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,800
The U.S. government is out to get us.

1011
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,520
The governments where we have our ministries are out to get us.

1012
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,000
Communists are out to get us.

1013
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,640
Nazis are out to get us.

1014
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,040
Racists are out to get us.

1015
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,440
Derelicts, atheists are all out to get us.

1016
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:16,440


1017
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:16,440


1018
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:21,380
And we must combat these evils.

1019
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,580
Since that day, it is worth a toss,

1020
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,300
one-third my purchase price.

1021
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,700
Thereafter, groups of assassins ready to barge out after me in the foyer

1022
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,420
lurked in all stock brokerage offices.

1023
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,020
I did not dare to even watch the ticker tape from the sidewalk.

1024
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,380
I went into hibernation,

1025
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,500
waiting for the computer god efforts to murder me

1026
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,840
in the brokerage offices to relax.

1027
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,740
Early in 1969, secretly,

1028
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,220
the computer god controlled and manipulated gangster government

1029
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:44,780
issued a warrant for my immediate arrest and incarceration

1030
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,420
in a maximum security environment.

1031
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,500
I was sent to the insanity prison to be cured forever

1032
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,740
before I could go before any parroting puppet,

1033
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:52,720
hangman rope gangster judge to give testimony.

1034
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,600
Since 1969, I hide alone in this house.

1035
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,720
All deliveries, food, etc., I mail order,

1036
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,040
adding five bucks for delivery.

1037
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:01,880
Demonstructural perform as into

1038
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,700
adversely successful RSV strength.

1039
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,680
Bending presented.

1040
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,620
Inflatable, 4-2.

1041
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:15,460
Vehicle crash pulse moment of the yoke panel load applied.

1042
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:19,880
At the vehicle employed in appending two parts of the rail.

1043
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:26,120
However, the instrated at the magnitudinal related to removing two sectives.

1044
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,640
God understands!

1045
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,460
That thing of wandering around,

1046
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,060
I don't know what I've done wrong.

1047
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,740
I don't know what I've done wrong.

1048
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,700
That's hogwash every man.

1049
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,260
Wandering around, I don't know what I've done wrong.

1050
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,520
Wandering around, I don't know what I've done wrong.

1051
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,480
That's hogwash every man.

1052
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,460
That's hogwash every man.

1053
00:57:51,520 --> 00:58:00,280
Knows what his head in his hands and pulled his hair in his hands and pulled his hair and clawed the ground.

1054
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:03,000
I know what that is and that doesn't include me, Brother Rodney.

1055
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,540
Move on, move on, move on, move on, move on.

1056
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,300
Just move on, move on, move on.

1057
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:08,620
This is it.

1058
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,340
Here it is.

1059
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,980
This is it.

1060
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,260
But there's one thing.

1061
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:17,200
There's one thing that keeps us from giving up.

1062
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,040
One sure weapon we possess.

1063
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:27,160
The sole effective tool that we can, nay, must use to thwart the conspiracy.

1064
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,460
Our indomitable, implacable, unswerving hate.

1065
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,060
Yes.

1066
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:34,800
Yes.

1067
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:38,640
The church offers the same features as most religions.

1068
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,700
Mindless aberration for an invisible dead guy and lots of hate.

1069
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,660
But ours is a new kind of hate.

1070
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:50,520
It has a superior way of festering than does theirs.

1071
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:57,420
For ours may ferment, smolder, and explode into cash dollars for the hater.

1072
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,580
Our hate is like a self-fueling fusion reactor.

1073
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:08,700
Because the conspiracy gives us, the conspiracy itself gives us the energy to oppose it.

1074
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:14,240
Its very hostility towards us is the uranium which fuels us.

1075
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,880
Our hate dynamos.

1076
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:20,160
Many foolishly see hate as negative.

1077
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:30,340
But hate, that is, unsullied hate, Adamic or original hate, is merely the active nature of Wotan.

1078
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:38,060
A cosmic principle so primal that humans can't conceive of it because it makes up their conception.

1079
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:42,400
Subgeniuses, on the other hand, have since prehistory.

1080
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,580
Deliberately exploited their inborn hate.

1081
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:50,700
Have diverted it through the transformer of their inherently good natures.

1082
00:59:50,720 --> 01:00:04,680
To recreate it as the divine stupidity which drives man to build his great monuments, compose his sublime sonatas, and open his exalted pop bottling plants.

1083
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:11,760
We're not talking about the pinks, run-of-the-mill, panty-waisted, limp-wristed little hate.

1084
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,880
Oh, and you've heard this before.

1085
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,400
Oh, I hate taxes.

1086
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,280
Oh, I hate the president.

1087
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,200
I hate my job.

1088
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,020
Or, worst of all, I hate myself.

1089
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:31,020
That's the diddly-fiddly-namby-pamby kind of hate.

1090
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,640
A sick and weakly spitefulness.

1091
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:41,740
Normal hate, bottled up, makes the mediocritan want to destroy what he doesn't have, whether he wants it or not.

1092
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,600
Especially if it's something he might need but can't understand.

1093
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,500
Subgenius hate gushes and erupts.

1094
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,200
It spews and contaminates.

1095
01:00:54,720 --> 01:01:00,560
Eric, we were both taught that a psychiatrist's function is to find mental illness and to cure it.

1096
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:01,360
As simple as that.

1097
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:01,920
Obviously.

1098
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:11,340
But at the cheaper hotel across the street, a group of people too weird for most science fiction fans to comprehend were holding a little convention of their own.

1099
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:19,540
These wackos call themselves the First Church of the Subgenius and they include, in their, to say the least, eccentric membership...

1100
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:19,580
Bob.

1101
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:20,960
Bob Bob.

1102
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,140
Bob Bob.

1103
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,160
Bob Bob.

1104
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:24,120
Bob Bob.

1105
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:24,680
Bob Bob.

1106
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:25,600
Bob Bob.

1107
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,380
What do they believe in?

1108
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,020
Everything.

1109
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,700
Who do they believe in?

1110
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:30,400
A mysterious character named Bob.

1111
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,260
A mysterious character named Bob.

1112
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:32,480
Bob.

1113
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:32,820
Bob.

1114
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:33,080
Bob.

1115
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:33,160
Bob.

1116
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:33,300


1117
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:33,500
Bob.

1118
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,280
Bob.

1119
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:35,800
Bob.

1120
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:35,860
Bob.

1121
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:37,220
Bob.

1122
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,340
Bob.

1123
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,920
Bob.

1124
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,080
Bob.

1125
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:03,060


1126
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,660
Oh my God, that's so cool.

1127
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,560
Bobbs is 8'8' and likes writing lyrics.

1128
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:05,680
Roomoz combined, alright, with Tom Schrightl, the bomb.

1129
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:05,680


1130
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:05,680


1131
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:05,680


1132
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:05,680


1133
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:05,680


1134
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:05,680


1135
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:05,680


1136
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,320
братaks》

1137
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,940
That one's in Los Angeles, right?

1138
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:10,940


1139
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:10,940


1140
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:10,940


1141
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:10,940


1142
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:10,940


1143
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:10,940


1144
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:10,940


1145
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:10,940


1146
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:11,140
I couldn't find him.

1147
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:14,420
7-5-2-1-4.

1148
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,120
7-5-2-1-4.

1149
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,200
And you...

1150
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,360
Why you...

1151
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,880
Well, those of you who already know won't be amazed.

1152
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,060
But the rest will love it.

1153
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:25,760
And, uh...

1154
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,920
And, uh, that's it, I guess.

1155
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:28,880
It's after midnight.

1156
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:29,420
Time to go.

1157
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:29,640
Bye!

1158
