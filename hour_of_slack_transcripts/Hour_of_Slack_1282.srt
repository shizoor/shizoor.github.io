00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,200
Hi, Mom. It's Bobby.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,260
Um, look, I'm gonna have to work tonight after all.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,580
If there was a way to get out of here, we wouldn't know about it.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,520
It's your turn.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,560
Come on, Bob.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,380
There's no time for a joke.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,920
Come on, Bobby, no time for a joke.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,580
But I am no joke.

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,460
I am very serious.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,520
I am sure.

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:27,920
Here they come.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,500
Okay, you two.

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,020
Time for your hour of fun.

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,620
Call me Bob.

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,380
Call me Bob.

16
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:38,920
Call me Bob.

17
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,920
Call me Bob.

18
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,460
Bob, what's the meaning of life?

19
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,040
Yes, Bob.

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:49,940
Bob, Bob.

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:50,960
Bob, Bob.

22
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,160
Bob, Bob.

23
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,540
Yes, Bob.

24
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,500
Hello, Bob.

25
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,520
Bob, yes, sir.

26
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,120
Bob, Bob.

27
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,620
Hi, Bob.

28
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,000
Hey, Bob.

29
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,520
Bob, Bob.

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,300
Bob, Bob.

31
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,340
Yes, sir.

32
00:00:59,340 --> 00:00:59,780
Hello, Bob.

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,720
Bob, Bob, Bob.

34
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,380
Bob, Bob.

35
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,360
Yes, Bob.

36
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,040
Bob, Rob.

37
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,100
Can you hear me?

38
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,120
Ah!

39
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,480
I wear a special aluminum helmet.

40
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:16,640
I wear a special aluminum helmet.

41
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,520
I wear a special aluminum helmet.

42
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,820
Special aluminum.

43
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,440
Bob.

44
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:25,920
Bob.

45
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,460
Bob.

46
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:26,900
Yes, sir.

47
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,600
You are well enough.

48
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,200
Yes, sir.

49
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:28,660
Bob.

50
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:28,980
Bob.

51
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,220
Bob.

52
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,740
Yes, Bob.

53
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,660
Bob, hey, Bob.

54
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,440
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, we love you.

55
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,320
Bob, hey, Bob.

56
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,960
I'd like to request free bird.

57
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,520
Bob, Bob, Bob, what's the meeting like?

58
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,120
Yes, Bob.

59
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,020
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

60
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,440
Yeah, Bob, I need to talk to Bob.

61
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:40,920
Yeah, Bob.

62
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,320
Yeah, Bob.

63
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:43,960
Yeah, Bob.

64
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,040
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

65
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,920
Baby, baby, we need to get you out.

66
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,960
Baby, baby, we need to get you out.

67
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,140
Baby, baby, we need to get you out.

68
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,200
Baby, baby, we need to get you out.

69
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,260
Bob, Bob, yeah, Bob.

70
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,680
Hey, Bob.

71
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,560
Yes, I am.

72
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,320
Hi, Bob.

73
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,240
Bob, Bob.

74
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:23,780
Bob.

75
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,340
Hello, Bob.

76
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,360
Hello, Bob, now here you go again.

77
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,440
Yeah, Bob, don't stop your eyes.

78
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,320
Look what's going on.

79
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,980
Goodbye, Bob.

80
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:59,300
Outro Music

81
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,880
We're live outside the courthouse where religious cult leader has just been indicted on several counts.

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,220
Included are conspiracy, tax evasion, kidnapping, resisting arrest, and jury tampering.

83
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,960
Surely what everyone must understand about this is that it is not religious persecution.

84
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,420
The Church of Subgenius is not a church at all. It's a front.

85
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,760
It's a tax shelter set up solely for personal financial gain.

86
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,400
Well, how do you see the situation now?

87
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,800
Excuse me. Reverend, could we get a statement?

88
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,640
The Reverend has no statements at these times.

89
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,160
I'd like to say that this is a very old story.

90
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,660
If you don't understand something, then you attack it.

91
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,140
You call it weird or a cult, and you try to destroy it.

92
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,980
Well, the person who is leading the attack is usually someone who is on very shaky moral ground himself.

93
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:12,100
He's unsure of himself, and so he lashes out in a paranoid way against those of us who have ascended to a higher plane of consciousness and awareness.

94
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,460
Well, we'll survive this. We always have in the past.

95
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:23,080
And when Mr. Reese loses his anger and his fear, we invite him to join us in spreading our message of love and profit.

96
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,120
Thank you very much.

97
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,440
Shirley!

98
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,160
This is pure crap.

99
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,220
From NPR News in Washington, I'm swept away by a tsunami.

100
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,340
In the town of Cedar Grove, Bob made a mess of the property his family has spent a lifetime developing.

101
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,900
A top Treasury Department official has told a congressional panel that President Obama was arrested in an FBI sting.

102
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,060
Some badly needed Obama supplies are beginning to reach a remote area of NPR News in Washington.

103
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,340
Remind me of one of those cleverly amoral PR flats who sell their services to industries that pollute.

104
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,760
Remind me of one of those cleverly amoral PR flats who sell their services to industries that pollute.

105
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,200
Remind me of one of those cleverly amoral PR flats who sell their services to industries that pollute.

106
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,460
Remind me of one of those cleverly amoral PR flats who sell their services to industries that pollute.

107
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:23,280
Bob exposes that these are the messages we want Bob to expose worldwide.

108

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,200


111
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,200

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,200


113
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,720
I must... must pull myself together.

114
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,640
Good evening.

115
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,800
The story of Ivan was filed under unsolved.

116
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,200
What?

117
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:54,900
Story?

118
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:55,900
Story.

119
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,180
Yeah?

120
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,680
I know who he is.

121
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,880
You got time to listen?

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,380
Shoot.

123
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,220
Well, this begins in a stormy night long ago.

124
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,600
1924 was a howling wintry day.

125
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,420
Neighbors later testified to seeing Ivan's massive eyes flailing open in the wind.

126
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,660
It was the last time they saw him.

127
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,220
What happened then?

128
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,060
He testified that Ivan covered with a piece of black velvet.

129
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,000
Ivan, well, glad to see you.

130
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,660
Yes.

131
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,600
Thanks.

132
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,000
Thanks.

133
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:27,180


134
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,660
Uh, did you, um, get a lot done today on the head, I mean?

135
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,980
See for yourself.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,520
Good.

137
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,800
Come closer.

138
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,260
Oh, I see.

139
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,080
Here.

140
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,880
You poor fool.

141
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,320
Well, shall we start, Ivan?

142
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,460
Yes.

143
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,320
Why, Ivan.

144
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,560
Ivan.

145
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,220
How quaint.

146
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,700
But tell me.

147
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,240
Yes.

148
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,160
Why are you so set on the head?

149
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,160
I see.

150
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,480
I'm tired of your stupid cats.

151
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,480
Yes.

152
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,800
One, two, three, four cats with their heads cut off.

153
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,080
And another one.

154
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,800
And I'm so tired of them.

155
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,240
I think I've got to get out of here.

156
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,240


157
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,240


158
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,240


159
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,240


160
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,240


161
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,240


162
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,240


163
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,460
And filled with all the exciting smells of good cooking.

164
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,680
Get out before I break your neck.

165
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,540
Six more times.

166
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,720
What a story.

167
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,560
He's a bum on a barge.

168
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:41,880
Yeah.

169
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,660
No.

170
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,040
Ivan died penniless and insane a year later.

171
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,300
For heaven's sake.

172
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,240
Ivan was raised in an asylum.

173
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,160
That's right.

174
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,900
I was raised in an asylum.

175
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,200
You don't mean.

176
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,120
Yes.

177
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,880
Ivan.

178
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,700
No.

179
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:58,820
No.

180
00:07:59,540 --> 00:07:59,860
Yes.

181
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,520
Yes, dear friends.

182
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:09,140
Ivan was sent to an insane asylum after he lost his fortune.

183
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,740
When no one would call the station during the pledge drive.

184
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,180
But that was fiction.

185
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,300
A cut and edited there by the great Fernanda Nande.

186
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,820

187
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,380
The story of Ivan there.

188
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,660
Thank you, Fernanda Nande.

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,560
We've heard many little cuts by the large.

191
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,000
The mysterious and large.

192
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,980
The large.

193
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,560
And one long cut.

194
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,900
The tax evasion business there.

195
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,440
And he also did our titles this time.

196
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,780
Lots of little.

197
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,020
This music isn't exciting enough for a pledge drive.

198
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,540
And that song.

199
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,200
With a lot of.

200
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,140
Bobs in it.

201
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,860
That kind of driving song.

202
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,940
Was by a new person.

203
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,320
Christian Blatter.

204
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,840
And that's not a description of his music.

205
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,340
It's.

206
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,860
Or his philosophy.

207
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,020
Apparently that is the person's name.

208
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,020
This last week.

209
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,080
We got mailed to us.

210
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,820
A number of really interesting CDs.

211
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,400
And even a cassette tape.

212
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,120
They were almost all.

213
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,980
Except for one.

214
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,360
Which we won't be playing tonight.

215
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,180
Was Handling.

216
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,880
The

217
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,520
This is a bad sign.

218
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,880
Usually it means amateurish junk.

219
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,120
Well this was amateurish.

220
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,840
Great stuff.

221
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,420
And that is the kind of thing that you only hear.

222
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,380
On stations like this.

223
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,280
And on shows like this.

224
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,540
Music.

225
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,560
That is made by real people.

226
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,760
Without the intervention of a record company.

227
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,400
Or.

228
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,780
Very expensive equipment.

229
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,080
In most cases.

230
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,560
But.

231
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,160
It just sheer talent.

232
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,840
Nerve.

233
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,520
And.

234
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,480
Often times a sense of humor.

235
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,500
The music in the background.

236
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:01,820
Theoretically.

237
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,400
Is the Rudy Schwartz project.

238
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,240
Although now I'm starting to wonder.

239
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:06,940
What I've got.

240
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,520
All mixed up here.

241
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,000
Anyway yes.

242
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,560
Thanks to Christian Blatter.

243
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,040
We'll be playing some of his music in the background.

244
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,060
And we'll be playing all kinds of horrible things.

245
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,120
If you don't pledge.

246
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,800
And here's how you do that.

247
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,020
You call this station.

248
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,800
The number of.

249
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,020
Of which.

250
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,020
Is this.

251
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,680
I'm only going to say it once.

252
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,560
This whole show.

253
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:28,900
Tattoo.

254
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,440
The best.

255
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:29,920
Yes.

256
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:30,560
Yes.

257
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,200
Yes.

258
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,660
No.

259
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,080
Here's the hard part.

260
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,640
Sixty nine hundred.

261
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,080
Six nine.

262
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,380
Oh.

263
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:36,780
Oh.

264
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,220
Is that number.

265
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,120
To call.

266
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,520
Two.

267
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:39,780
Yes.

268
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,020
Yes.

269
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,180
Yes.

270
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,100
Sixty nine hundred.

271
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,540
In beautiful Cleveland.

272
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:42,860
Now.

273
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,680
If you happen to be listening to this show.

274
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,420
By internet.

275
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,460
Or on another station.

276
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,540
You can still.

277
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,460
Donate to your station.

278
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,540
Even if they're not having a pledge.

279
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:51,780
Drive.

280
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,200
Or.

281
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,300
You can donate to this station.

282
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,660
Anything I say now.

283
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,620
Will continue.

284
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,600
To hold true.

285
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:57,940
Well.

286
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,180
Maybe not that phone number.

287
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,840
After a week.

288
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,120
But.

289
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,220
You can always.

290
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,500
Get any information from us.

291
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,040
That you need.

292
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,020
By writing me.

293
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,680
Stang.

294
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,180
At subgenius.com.

295
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,220
At.

296
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:10,640
Or.

297
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,620
Post office box.

298
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,680
One eight one four one seven.

299
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,580
Cleveland Heights.

300
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:13,780
Ohio.

301
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,300
Four four one one eight.

302
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,780
And we'll.

303
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,280
I'm sure.

304
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,980
Do that again later.

305
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,800
But in the meantime.

306
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,680
The important thing.

307
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,940
That you must know.

308
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,520
Is.

309
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:21,780
Is that.

310
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,840
You must donate.

311
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,180
You.

312
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,820
In fact.

313
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,460
Have to.

314
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,240
Or you will go to hell.

315
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,640
Subgenius hell.

316
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,700
The worst.

317
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,080
Place.

318
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:30,840
In the.

319
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,480
In.

320
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:31,840
In.

321
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,480
The afterlife.

322
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,400
Actually.

323
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,820
Some people say.

324
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,060
That subgenius hell.

325
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,860
Is the best place.

326
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,300
In the afterlife.

327
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,100
Sit next to subgenius heaven.

328
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,400
Better than some of our rival.

329
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,540
Afterlives.

330
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:45,820
From.

331
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,680
Other religions.

332
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,480
Let's see what.

333
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,100
Happens.

334
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,460
If I.

335
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,080
Punch.

336
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,680
Dave.

337
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,480
In the.

338
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:51,700
Baby.

339
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,000
In the.

340
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,700
Labanzas.

341
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,260
As it were.

342
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I punched.

343
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,440
Dave.

344
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,520
In the baby head.

345
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,920
As you are.

346
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,560
We're captain.

347
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,940
Of all mysterious realities.

348
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,680
To float.

349
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,040
By.

350
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,280
We're captain.

351
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,380
We're captain.

352
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,480
We are all.

353
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:07,880
Captain.

354
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,240
Of our own destiny.

355
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,680
Yes.

356
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,260
Friends.

357
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,600
And.

358
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,280
And.

359
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,400
And.

360
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,080
As such.

361
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,460
Why.

362
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,840
We're cool.

363
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,860
And.

364
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,200
And.

365
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,680
We're.

366
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:16,940
We're.

367
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,760
WCSB.

368
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,260
Listeners.

369
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:18,660
We're listeners.

370
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,360
Not only to WCSB.

371
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,200
But to this station.

372
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,720
The all-important.

373
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,540
This station.

374
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,320
Have I mentioned.

375
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,660
Any of the benefits.

376
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,360
That.

377
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:28,640
That.

378
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,180
They get.

379
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,340
Besides.

380
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,620
Hearing.

381
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,260
What they're hearing.

382
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:32,760
Right now.

383
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,980
The lilting voices.

384
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,380
Of lonesome cowboy Dave.

385
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:35,780
And.

386
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,040
Reverend Stang.

387
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,900
And Princess Wee.

388
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,560
If she's.

389
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,880
Not answering the phones.

390
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,320
In there.

391
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,080
Hi.

392
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,680
I'm arguing.

393
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,180
In her.

394
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,560
In her.

395
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,580
Doing the other room.

396
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:44,820
And.

397
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,620
Well.

398
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,040
And.

399
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,460
Dr.

400
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:46,960
Sinister.

401
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,400
Is here.

402
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,340
He's also answering.

403
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:48,940
Phones.

404
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,560
And.

405
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,560
People are calling.

406
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:50,960
Because.

407
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,080
Because.

408
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,620
You know.

409
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,080
Because.

410
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,700
You know why.

411
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,580
Why.

412
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,120
Because.

413
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,780
They know.

414
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,340
That.

415
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,180
When they donate.

416
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,340
To WCSB.

417
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:57,860
Or.

418
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,740
This station.

419
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,800
They don't just.

420
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,340
Get the great feeling.

421
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:02,840
Of knowing.

422
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,760
They've kept.

423
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,580
The station.

424
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,220
On the air.

425
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,880
They don't just get.

426
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,480
The great feeling.

427
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:07,920
Of knowing.

428
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,500
That they don't have to live.

429
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,260
In a place like.

430
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:10,700
Dallas.

431
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,280
Texas.

432
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,060
That has only.

433
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,380
Stations.

434
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,880
That are.

435
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,800
To suck.

436
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,220
But.

437
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:16,940
They are.

438
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,420
Listening.

439
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,240
To this.

440
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,160
Cleveland station.

441
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,520
The.

442
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,420
Greatest.

443
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,020
Of.

444
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:22,960
All.

445
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,520
Cleveland.

446
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,520
Stations.

447
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,620
I must say.

448
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,020
I agree.

449
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,240
Because of this show.

450
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,160
And the previous show.

451
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,040
And the following show.

452
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,560
And the shows later on tonight.

453
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,460
And the shows tomorrow as well.

454
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,820
I've been in the future.

455
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,540
Friends.

456
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,440
I'm going to prove it.

457
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,020
Later on tonight.

458
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,600
On this show.

459
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,660
I've been to the future.

460
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,040
And I know what we're going to do tonight.

461
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,580
We're going to start out with.

462
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,760
Polite.

463
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:43,660
Requests.

464
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,440
For donations.

465
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,040
And.

466
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,200
Simple explanations.

467
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,980
Of your pledge premiums.

468
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,240
Which.

469
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,060
We've got some special ones.

470
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,040
We will then progress to.

471
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,380
Insistent.

472
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,220
Weedling.

473
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,980
And guilt tripping.

474
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,020
We will finally.

475
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,480
We will finally.

476
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,500
Move on up to.

477
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,540
Angry demands.

478
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,840
And unreasonable.

479
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,120
Promises.

480
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,760
And threats.

481
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,640
Even.

482
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,300
And finally into depressed.

483
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,420
Begging.

484
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,560
Which is.

485
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,300
The ultimate culmination.

486
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,480
Of any pledge drive show.

487
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,300
And then a sort of.

488
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,460
And then shout outs.

489
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:17,860
Of course.

490
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,200
You know.

491
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,260
When you.

492
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:19,980
Make that.

493
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,420
Phone call.

494
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,400
And make that promise.

495
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,500
Whether it's.

496
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,360
A real.

497
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,640
Heartfelt promise.

498
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,560
Whether you're planning.

499
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,860
To back out later or not.

500
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,700
You get to talk.

501
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,960
To Princess Wee.

502
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,320
Or Dr.

503
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:31,860
Sinister.

504
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:32,920
Or.

505
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,480
Even.

506
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,000
The.

507
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,680
The double mean baby head.

508
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,720
That hangs off the side.

509
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,460
Of Dave's head.

510
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,740
That wonders.

511
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,500
A lot of the night.

512
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:40,880
I.

513
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,300
He'll be taking calls.

514
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,240
We'll be taking calls.

515
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,060
She'll be taking calls.

516
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,320
We want your calls.

517
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,000
As quickly as possible.

518
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,100
Because we're back loaded.

519
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,320
There's thousands of people.

520
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,100
People right at this moment.

521
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:50,820
Who.

522
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,520
If not.

523
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,120
Actually.

524
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,040
Calling.

525
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,880
They're thinking of calling.

526
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,500
They need to be calling.

527
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,020
And remember.

528
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,120
It's their calling.

529
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,740
Stan has promised.

530
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,860
To punish you.

531
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,200
With all forms of rhetoric.

532
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,000
Rhetoric available.

533
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,440
As means is disposable.

534
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,700
I have.

535
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,440
I had a calling.

536
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,660
I had a calling.

537
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,040
To preach the word of Bob.

538
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,420
And you have a calling.

539
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:09,960
To call.

540
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,360
The station of Bob.

541
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,040
That's.

542
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,440
That's.

543
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,060
That's 6900.

544
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,140
Right here in Cleveland.

545
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,080
That's a 216 area code.

546
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,120
Friends.

547
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,920
Don't be redundant.

548
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,820
Don't call.

549
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,740
Don't recall.

550
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:20,960
Recall.

551
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,220
What.

552
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,880
CSB has meant to you.

553
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,120
Remember.

554
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,880
For these many years.

555
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,360
Remember.

556
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,140
And then recall.

557
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,180
Oh.

558
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,680
Yes.

559
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,100
Yes.

560
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:28,440
Yes.

561
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,500
What is this music in the background?

562
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,220
Is this Christian Blatter still?

563
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,720
I'm actually kind of confused as to what's happened.

564
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,400
Dave.

565
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:36,840
Go ahead.

566
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,760
Go ahead and distract them for a second.

567
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,980
I was just going to say.

568
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,040
Do you think it might be the right time to remind all of our listeners out there that

569
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm wearing a huge.

570
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:44,960
Huge.

571
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,600
Prophylactic device of some kind on the top of my head.

572
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,280
And I look kind of like a baby bottle right now.

573
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,140
And that's the kind of lowbrow stunt that I'm willing to stoop to.

574
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,920
Is that what's making that hum?

575
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:58,980
That's.

576
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,280
I think it's my phone's dang.

577
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,940
Can you hear that stop?

578
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,320
Hum.

579
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,420
I was hoping nobody could hear it.

580
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,240
Not even me.

581
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,220
That was your electric.

582
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,840
Your new.

583
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,920
Your brand new electric forehead that you bought.

584
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,720
I haven't really followed through on.

585
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,980
On buying a forehead.

586
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,620
Oh.

587
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,380
Because.

588
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,740
Because you don't have enough money.

589
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,020
Right.

590
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,560
No.

591
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:18,800
I.

592
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,080
I've just.

593
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,020
I've shopped around.

594
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,140
And I want to save money when I get the right one.

595
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,440
Oh.

596
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,180
I thought you were.

597
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,080
We're supposed to say.

598
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,320
We.

599
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,060
We don't have enough.

600
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,500
Dave needs a new forehead.

601
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,700
I need new ears.

602
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,260
I do.

603
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,640
Why.

604
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,220
How long do you think we can keep preaching the word of Bob with no forehead and no ears?

605
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:33,840
Yeah.

606
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,440
What if some.

607
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,100
For instance.

608
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,560
Some night.

609
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:35,820
I was.

610
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,580
Think about that.

611
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:36,880
Friend.

612
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,420
It's.

613
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:38,780
It's.

614
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,760
There's too many things to think of at one time.

615
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,300
We're facing with the awful possibility that if WCSB does not get funding.

616
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,600
Enough funding.

617
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:48,720
That it.

618
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,760
Might not get enough funding.

619
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,960
And therefore.

620
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,060
It.

621
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,640
Won't be quite as much fun around there.

622
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,180
Well.

623
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:56,520
It's.

624
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,460
It's not just that.

625
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,300
We're trying to.

626
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,660
Not just keep the station on the air.

627
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,040
Which.

628
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,980
Requires a lot of money.

629
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,960
But we're trying to improve our service.

630
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,080
Did you know.

631
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,620
That what we're going to do with the money you're about to pledge to us.

632
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,060
Is start archiving WCSB programming.

633
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,320
Like other great stations that already do that.

634
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,120
Such as WREK in Atlanta.

635
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,600
Their listeners.

636
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,260
Are so lucky.

637
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,540
If they happen to miss Susie.

638
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,120
The floozies.

639
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,880
Bob slack time funhouse.

640
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Or hour of slack.

641
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,920
Any time during the week.

642
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,640
They can listen to it on the internet.

643
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,720
WCSB must have this capability.

644
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:31,980
Archiving.

645
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,660
So that.

646
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,580
And we have to improve our website.

647
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,540
So that you can do that thing.

648
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,940
So if you miss.

649
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,560
For instance.

650
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,760
Radio synesthesia.

651
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,800
Or say you heard something on radio synesthesia.

652
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,760
Or hour of slack.

653
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,740
Or African abstract.

654
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,760
It's so great.

655
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,440
You wished you had your.

656
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,200
Your recorder on.

657
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,080
Well you can.

658
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,420
Play it again later on.

659
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,880
And anytime later on in the week.

660
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,360
That's the archiving.

661
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,200
Now it's true that the hour of slack.

662
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,860
Is already archived.

663
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,080
On my dime.

664
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,760
On my website.

665
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,280
But it doesn't usually appear.

666
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,820
On the.

667
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,000
On the internet.

668
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,700
Until after.

669
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,340
We've.

670
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,420
For several days after we've done one of these live shows.

671
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,640
But sometimes it takes months or even years.

672
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,660
With the way things are financially right now.

673
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,180
Sometimes it takes.

674
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,400
Years.

675
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,400


676
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,400


677
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,420
You know.

678
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:18,420


679
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:18,420


680
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:18,420


681
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:18,420


682
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,380
Years just for us to.

683
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,480
Eat breakfast.

684
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,260
That's how poor we are.

685
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:22,760
Yeah.

686
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,780
And so far.

687
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,720
As far as concept development goes.

688
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,140
We're absolute aeons behind.

689
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:28,900
So please.

690
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,240
If you've got anything to join with us.

691
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,600
Join.

692
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,440
Join us now.

693
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:33,700
Humans.

694
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,440
Join us humans.

695
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,040
Sure.

696
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,440
Why not.

697
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,520
Even if you're a human.

698
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,440
You can join us.

699
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:38,940
Or.

700
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,620
We'll accept humanoid.

701
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,500
You know.

702
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:41,900
If you can.

703
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,760
A good facsimile will work.

704
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,480
If you're a sentient being.

705
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,280
And you've got some sort of.

706
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,400
You know.

707
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,400


708
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,400


709
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,400


710
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,400


711
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,140
Fish collateral.

712
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,260
Or some sort of.

713
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,000
Gravy that you can spread around.

714
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,620
Like money.

715
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,640
Please.

716
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,720
Pledge now.

717
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,920
Or forever.

718
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,540
Be held.

719
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:56,980
In a.

720
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,600
Strange.

721
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:58,820
Position.

722
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,400
Because.

723
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,440
Things are desperate out here.

724
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,820
And not only do we need these archival materials.

725
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,660
Archivists.

726
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,220
Materials.

727
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,400
We also need to send you a wonderful.

728
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,080
Wonderful.

729
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,080
What are they called?

730
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,200
The.

731
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,480
The t-shirt.

732
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,020
The logo.

733
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:16,860
Premiums.

734
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,240
The.

735
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,080
Four pack.

736
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,320
Of.

737
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,960
Shot glasses.

738
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,640
The.

739
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,180
Sin.

740
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,520
Pack.

741
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,000
Friends.

742
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,640
Get this.

743
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,840
Now get this.

744
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,200
I'm about to.

745
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,120
Explain to you.

746
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,760
If I.

747
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,020
Get.

748
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,380
Yourself.

749
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,540
Music.

750
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:27,940
Here.

751
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,200
In the.

752
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:28,620
Back.

753
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,320
You know.

754
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,500
You can't do a subgenius show.

755
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,160
Without confusing background music.

756
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,300
Should I recall.

757
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,300
Because of the horrible.

758
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,800
Buzzing.

759
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,400
And see if it doesn't.

760
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:35,840
Go away.

761
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,020
No.

762
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,900
It always does that.

763
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,940
It does that.

764
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,440
Whenever you.

765
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:38,620
But.

766
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,300
When I have the background music up.

767
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:48,560
But.

768
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,080
Your pledge will get you stuff.

769
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,600
Here's what it'll get you.

770
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,140
Number one.

771
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,360
Any pledge we get.

772
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,880
Over.

773
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,380
Uh.

774
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,260
Ten.

775
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:56,700
Well.

776
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,760
Fifteen bucks.

777
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,700
For fifteen bucks and up.

778
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,640
Here's your subgenius premiums.

779
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,120
Get ready.

780
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,080
Number one.

781
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,440
A.

782
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,140
Bob.

783
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,540
Head.

784
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,520
Condom.

785
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,100
Yes.

786
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,760
A subgenius condom.

787
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,700
They really exist.

788
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,340
We also have a Connie condom.

789
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,680
But to keep things calm.

790
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,840
We'll probably just offer the Bob condom.

791
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,180
Nobody cares about Connie anyway.

792
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:18,380
So.

793
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:18,380


794
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:18,380


795
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:18,380


796
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,000
And these are real condoms.

797
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,380
Plus.

798
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:27,040
You get a triple X rated hour of slack show that we could not play on any of the broadcast

799
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,600
stations.

800
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,620
It was an internet only show.

801
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,540
Number twelve hundred seventy nine A. Or X.

802
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,600
And it was the nastiest.

803
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,680
Nastiest stuff from triple X day.

804
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,940
Or thirteen X day recently.

805
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:39,960
Including.

806
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,920
Dr. Legumes famous sermon or parable about the seven year rape.

807
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:52,200
Priestess Pisces most filthful feminist sex songs.

808
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:58,460
With great music by Reverend Anguillaire and Philo Drummond and Dr. Sinister and so forth.

809
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,000
All kinds of great stuff.

810
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,380
That's.

811
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,340
You never could hear it on any broadcast radio.

812
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,640
In the United States.

813
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,240
Legally.

814
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,180
So.

815
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,300
You can hear that.

816
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:08,880
And.

817
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,720
With your fifteen dollar premium pledge.

818
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,360
And this is just a pledge.

819
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,440
Of course we'll come after you for it later.

820
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:15,900
But.

821
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,640
You get.

822
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,440
The WCSB sin pack.

823
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:27,560
That means an ashtray shot glass bottle opener and condom all emblazoned with the famous WCSB

824
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:27,820
logo.

825
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,840
For like a twenty dollar pledge.

826
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,780
There's such things as CDs and VHS tapes and DVDs.

827
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,300
Yes.

828
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,120
You heard me right.

829
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,700
VHS tapes.

830
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,800
Of the most disgustingly bad horror movies.

831
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,640
Such as Alien Visitor.

832
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,460
Arachnid.

833
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,400
Children of Night.

834
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,360
Doppelganger.

835
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,600
Earth vs. the Spider.

836
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,320
Eve of Destruction.

837
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,220
E-Vo-Lution.

838
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,280
That's just a E's.

839
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,900
And the E's with which you can get these is just a call.

840
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,420
It's sixty nine hundred.

841
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,220
That's not a hard number to remember by any means.

842
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,540
It's easy.

843
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,460
Sixty nine.

844
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,520
That's a dirty word.

845
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,180
Sixty nine.

846
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,020
You know what that means?

847
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,540
It means you're the opposite of ninety six.

848
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,720
What you'd like to be doing with one of those premiums right now.

849
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,180
Yeah.

850
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:15,900
Is that you hold it in your hand.

851
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:15,900


852
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:15,900


853
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:15,900


854
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:15,900


855
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:15,900


856
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:15,900


857
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:15,900


858
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:15,900


859
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,380
You hold it tenderly in your arms and you look.

860
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,400
Perhaps someday it might be a coffee cup.

861
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,740
But right now it's a bunch of wonderful T-shirts and strange VHS's you'll never find anywhere

862
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,480
else in your life.

863
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,320
And why should you look any further than you're looking right now at your radio dial.

864
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:28,840
So please.

865
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,700
If you've got a brain left behind those ears.

866
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,200
Stop staring at the radio dial and get to a telephone.

867
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,140
These amazing devices.

868
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,740
Some say were invented by Alexander Graham Bell.

869
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,940
But many people know that in the same epoch, the same period of time in France, there were

870
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,320
other numerous developments that were very similar to an actual telephone.

871
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,740
Look at some of these amazing CDs.

872
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,820
We only have one each here.

873
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,880
But if you're the one who demands it, you'll get it.

874
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,480
Here's negative lands.

875
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,720
Great album.

876
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,360
A big ten eight place.

877
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,700
My personal favorite of all of theirs.

878
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,280
It was handed to me by them the first time they ever played out live, which was at the

879
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,260
night of Slack in San Francisco where Bob was shot.

880
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:12,540
Yes.

881
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,820
Negative land open for Bob's death.

882
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,320
And we have that album.

883
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,620
Nucleon.

884
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,600
That's a Cleveland band.

885
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,420
They did the great hit Green Acid, which is about flying through outer space out of

886
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,900
control on green acid.

887
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,120
Their album Hyper Emitter is here.

888
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,940
Stinking Lizaveta.

889
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,660
Our another hour of Slack favorite, Kirkendall Void.

890
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,120
Their CD Graveyard at GoGo is sitting here waiting for ye.

891
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,140
And guess what, friends?

892
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,920
If you come to the, if you make your donation tonight and then come to the Oval Office,

893
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:52,620
open house of Cleveland WCSB down here near downtown in a couple of weeks, why, we'll

894
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,840
hand you that premium personally.

895
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,100
And thank you for listening.

896
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,260
And you can then kiss our hand for being famous radio DJs.

897
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,500
But we'll be humble and we'll go, no, no, no.

898
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,980
We did this for you.

899
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,600
And here's your premium.

900
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,900
Here's your Bob condom.

901
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,420
Here's your triple X rated album.

902
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,920
Here's your sin pack of WCSB.

903
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,500
Em blazin or whatever.

904
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,280
kosher island drive the blue sky for the city was harder than is drive.

905
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:34,660
A little static that you bring on ifele didn't know what left to add wheel and that was

906
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:34,660


907
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:41,900
A hot supply coming up early to the city seats for ainizi a stopover that'd be plain � Вид

908
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,900
Today special time at Kobe Bryant Headquarters at the het lobby in the middle of observation

909
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:44,900


910
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,660
of a vestigial tail left, that's all right.

911
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,340
We could say maybe three legs, and for some of those guys out there,

912
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,240
I'm sure they'd love to be called a three-legged man,

913
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,040
but that doesn't matter at this point in time.

914
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,180
What matters at this point in time is that you get close to that vacuum tube thing.

915
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,100
Well, that's what they used to be back in the days of a Wendy's film,

916
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,700
an old-fashioned radio, the kind that was fashioned of worms

917
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,660
that fit directly into your ears.

918
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,220
You place them just enough close to your skull,

919
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,180
and they would actually climb into your ear and weave their way in

920
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,580
and tell you what you needed to hear.

921
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,220
And now we are continuing to tell you what you need to hear.

922
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,720
Friends, you need to know that you have a friend in WCSB.

923
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,400
Not an arm and a leg, not a person who will show up at midnight

924
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,700
with an army behind him and expect your deportation.

925
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:37,540
No, we're talking about men with raincoats and also umbrellas.

926
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,020
The kind of people that know to keep the snoot away

927
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,020
and to keep the vomit at their feet like it was

928
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,160
when they were young.

929
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,680
Back in the days of yours, mine truly, I'm telling you, please pledge.

930
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,720
If you've got the wherewithal to pledge,

931
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,840
it doesn't matter whether you're a steamer or diesel punk,

932
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,400
you don't have to use an actual credit card or any of those modern devices.

933
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,420
You can actually send some sort of postal money order,

934
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,980
or you could, well, you don't send that, you just pledge,

935
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,740
and then you could send a check later after.

936
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,420
I'm sure you could probably stuff some money in a bag

937
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,980
and you could make your way to Oaxaca,

938
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,740
but you don't have to.

939
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,520
But let's say that you're just going to stay here in Cleveland.

940
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,400
Let's just pretend that everything's okay.

941
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,040
Yeah, that everything's just fine,

942
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,940
and might even continue to be fine

943
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,160
as long as you support little teeny portals

944
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,500
into the world you'd rather have.

945
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,780
Now, you know, what we could do is just change right now

946
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,120
in the middle of the show to whatever all the other stations are playing.

947
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:41,740
Exactly.

948
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,540
I don't know.

949
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,480
That would be because I don't ever listen to any of the other stations.

950
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,400
We don't need to.

951
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,420
In fact, I don't really listen to much of anything

952
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,260
because I am almost completely stone deaf

953
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,460
and cannot even hear anything Dave has just said.

954
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,900
I'm guessing, however, and I'm a good guesser.

955
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,320
And you're not as good a guesser as you are a guesser.

956
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,340
But I don't want to bring your past into this at this point in time.

957
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,120
Give us your goodest guess.

958
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,340
Give it. Whip it out, baby.

959
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,340
Anyway.

960
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,400
Whatever he said.

961
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,980
It's all true.

962
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:14,940
Yes, yes.

963
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,620
And 6900 is the number to call.

964
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,760
Now, I'm going to look through this glass studio window here

965
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,380
and I see that Princess Wee is on the phone right now.

966
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,440
But poor Dr. Sinister has got...

967
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,140
Oh, wait. No, Princess Wee isn't on the phone.

968
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,980
There's nothing happening.

969
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,260
Princess Wee's just sitting there all by herself.

970
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,160
Friends, you better call.

971
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,580
This is your one chance to talk to Princess Wee.

972
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,980
And if you happen to be a little bit too late,

973
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,480
you'll get to talk to the...

974
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,600
real Dr. Sinister.

975
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,400
Of course, he lets anybody talk to him

976
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,120
every Sunday night.

977
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,100
And we're not really quite sure if he is real.

978
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,240
But he is the real Dr. Sinister.

979
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,220
As far as his reality goes in another direction,

980
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,460
you'll have to measure that yourself

981
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,080
when you call into his show later.

982
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,860
But right now, at this point in time,

983
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,840
remember,

984
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,960
you must call to receive the benefits

985
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,600
that Dobbs has intended for you.

986
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,160
And these benefits are many.

987
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,700
You get to listen to primo lectures

988
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,940
and arguments between people in bus stops.

989
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,240
No, no, you wait, you...

990
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,520
You get to hear the mentally ill people

991
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,320
that call the subgenius foundation answer machine.

992
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,480
Yes, yes, yes.

993
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,220
And you get to hear

994
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:33,360
peer-reviewed argument.

995
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,660
I mean, you get to hear

996
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,140
your synapses flying like

997
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,780
somebody put them in bacon grease.

998
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,120
Just listen to this.

999
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:41,920
Look.

1000
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,040
My third non-starly is opening.

1001
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,840
Ah, what a blissful smell that is.

1002
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,360
A psychic smell.

1003
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,800
An aroma of freedom.

1004
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,360
Of slack.

1005
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,280
Of lots and lots of luxury

1006
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,420
at your feet.

1007
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,360
Be prepared to grow, Morphe.

1008
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,260
Remember,

1009
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,980
it's on its way.

1010
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,380
And you'd better be prepared.

1011
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,680
Friends...

1012
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,740
I don't know why I said that,

1013
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,740
and I'm glad I didn't.

1014
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,620
Because I...

1015
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,840
Oh, go ahead, Dye.

1016
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,300
Go ahead.

1017
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,680
I just...

1018
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,520
I was saddened by the fact

1019
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,820
that so many of our listeners

1020
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,360
are still calling right now

1021
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,220
and they can't get through.

1022
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,420
Please, keep trying.

1023
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,660
It's very simple.

1024
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,600
It's no game like

1025
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,700
who can actually get in

1026
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,560
or something like that.

1027
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,180
You just keep hitting that redial button

1028
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,700
and you're going to get in.

1029
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,280
And when you get in,

1030
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,060
the liberation from them.

1031
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,460
But, sir, we have no money.

1032
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,580
We gotta get some money.

1033
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,940
Wait, dirty...

1034
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,360
Egg flapping, flopping, rubbing...

1035
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,720
Friends, the sounds in the background

1036
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,660
are from Outmouth,

1037
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,060
an otherwise unlabeled...

1038
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,200
Actually, this CD was sent to us

1039
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,440
in the mail by Outmouth

1040
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,120
with handwritten liner notes

1041
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,160
and an intricately made outer cover

1042
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,100
made from a very, very, very

1043
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,800
carefully cut up grocery bag.

1044
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,940
And listen to...

1045
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,600
Now, this is the kind of stuff...

1046
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,000
This.

1047
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,040
That you...

1048
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,800
You're not going to hear this

1049
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,980
on any other station, hardly,

1050
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,580
because other stations only play

1051
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,580
what the conspiracy approves.

1052
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,580
You can't get your mind raped

1053
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,980
like you can on these

1054
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,960
independent stations

1055
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,540
and college stations that we're on.

1056
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,200
Let me read you this touching thing

1057
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,840
that Outmouth wrote

1058
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,600
on the Instagram page.

1059
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,900
I saw it personally to us,

1060
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,120
to you, the listener at WCSB.

1061
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,720
My middle school...

1062
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,880
No, how would he say this?

1063
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,380
My middle school science teacher

1064
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,740
told me once that I had a nice body.

1065
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,880
That's neither here nor there.

1066
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,920
More importantly, he told me

1067
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,400
if it were possible to hear

1068
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,200
all the radio waves passing over our head

1069
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,140
every second of every day,

1070
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,560
we would go insane

1071
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,720
from the constant barrage of noise.

1072
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,240
That idea has always entertained me,

1073
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,420
and this recording is an attempt

1074
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,340
at distilling that experience.

1075
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,420
All samples are used illegally.

1076
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,640
I claim no ownership,

1077
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,080
and neither should they.

1078
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,040
Public domain is everything

1079
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,580
we see, feel, touch, and hear.

1080
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,820
Although you shouldn't taste

1081
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,420
anything in public.

1082
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,420
And, uh, and yes,

1083
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,800
squatting on intellectual properties

1084
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,060
is the name of this CD,

1085
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,360
and it's the name of this philosophy.

1086
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,880
This is beautiful.

1087
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,940
This is one of the best objections

1088
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,540
you asked by your recent customers.

1089
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,300
I don't even know if he's a subgenius.

1090
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,020
I don't know if he paid his bribe to Bob.

1091
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,020
I don't know if he's even ever pledged to WCSB.

1092
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,900
But it was quality cut up.

1093
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,000
It's the sons of negative land.

1094
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,240
And, uh, and we love, we love that.

1095
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,920
We love things that...

1096
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,900
Yes, both the descendants

1097
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,480
and the antecedents.

1098
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,080
Both of these vast art movements

1099
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,080
found their beginnings

1100
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,680
in a strange back room

1101
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,440
in a place in Cleveland Bluffs.

1102
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,200
On the afternoon of

1103
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,780
1927,

1104
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,700
Earl Boggs...

1105
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,920
You know, I'm gonna have to

1106
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,200
pot that one down now, Dave.

1107
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,760
You know why?

1108
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,620
Because I haven't heard the rest of it.

1109
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,760
Our power went out yesterday

1110
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,980
right in the middle of this CD.

1111
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,600
Probably, probably, probably, probably.

1112
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,640
It's caused by the CD.

1113
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,580
So I have to take off the outmouth.

1114
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,360
Let's play him just a song for two minutes

1115
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,140
and let him rest for a second.

1116
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,420
Let people take those, make those calls.

1117
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,080
Dave, I'm gonna play a song

1118
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,340
I think you mighty like

1119
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,200
that you may not have heard.

1120
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,420
It's by the singer-songwriter

1121
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,700
Dewey Cox, the late Dewey Cox.

1122
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,800
This was featured in the movie

1123
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Walk Hard.

1124
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,320
And it's a love song.

1125
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,720
And I think you and everyone else

1126
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,580
will have to like it.

1127
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,420
For two and one half minutes.

1128
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,500
I'm gonna love it.

1129
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,560
Hello, Darlene.

1130
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,040
Hello, Mr. Cox.

1131
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,360
You ready to sing one?

1132
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,460
I'm always ready.

1133
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,240
All right.

1134
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,740
In my dreams, you're blowing me

1135
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,380
Some kisses

1136
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,920
That's one of my favorite things to do

1137
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,640
You and I could go down in history

1138
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,300
That's what I'm praying to do with you

1139
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,580
Let's do it

1140
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,620
In ways that make us feel good

1141
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,380
Let's do it

1142
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,580
And make that song feel good

1143
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:11,580


1144
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:11,580


1145
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:11,580


1146
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:11,580


1147
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:11,580


1148
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:11,580


1149
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:11,580


1150
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,560
Let's do it

1151
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,460
Put two and two together

1152
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,720
Perfect harmony we found

1153
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,980
We know it's only natural

1154
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,280
Let's do it

1155
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,600
I'm gonna beat off all my demons

1156
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,940
That's what love and Jesus are about

1157
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,400
Let's do it

1158
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,920
Looking in your eyes

1159
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,560
I start believing

1160
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,680
Let's bring this whisper to a shout

1161
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,640
Let's do it

1162
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,720
In ways that make us feel good

1163
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,340
Let's do it

1164
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,900
And make that sacred sound

1165
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,380
Put two and two together

1166
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,800
Perfect harmony we found

1167
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,060
We know it's only natural

1168
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,320
Let's do it

1169
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,320
Did I hear you sighing?

1170
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,800
What are you implying?

1171
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,420
You look a little tired

1172
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,140
The music got me wired

1173
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,740
Pretty good looking

1174
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,060
Boy, we're really cooking now

1175
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,680
I just wanna make out what you're saying

1176
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,080
Read my lips, it's what you're looking for

1177
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,280
Here I am, I'm sneaking up behind you

1178
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,660
You can always come in my back door

1179
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,360
I just wanna make out what you're saying

1180
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,860
Let's do it

1181
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,900
In ways that make us feel good

1182
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,580
Let's do it

1183
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,080
And make that sacred sound

1184
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,700
Put two and two together

1185
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,980
Perfect harmony we found

1186
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,140
We know it's only natural

1187
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,440
Of course it's only natural

1188
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,700
God knows it's only natural

1189
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,960
Let's do it

1190
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,880
All right, that beautiful.

1191
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,120
Yep.

1192
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,000
Dewey Cox.

1193
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,440
And I forget the girl's name.

1194
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,060
He had an affair with her later

1195
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,080
in the movie.

1196
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:02,120
I thought Dewey Cox was still in the vacuum cleaner business.

1197
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,420
I had no idea that he'd taken his cue

1198
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,880
from that strange profession

1199
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,580
of breaking into people's homes

1200
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,680
and arguing with elderly people.

1201
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,020
He was a married man.

1202
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,020


1203
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,720
And he was a married man.

1204
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:11,940
And he was a married man.

1205
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,320
And he was a married man.

1206
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:12,720
And he was a married man.

1207
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:12,720


1208
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:12,720


1209
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,940
And kind of an erotic

1210
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,140
country western anthem

1211
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,240
produced in the mid-90s

1212
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,500
by Gerald Hiskos.

1213
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,260
Hiskos, as you remember,

1214
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,360
was a cross-eyed.

1215
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,200
And when he would do his scores,

1216
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,080
he had to be corrected numerous times.

1217
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,160
But friends,

1218
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,240
and I know we have friends out there.

1219
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,780
Yes, Dave, it's true.

1220
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,940
They love us.

1221
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,320
I'm going to say their names.

1222
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,520
I'm going to do shout-outs here

1223
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,380
because these people,

1224
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,220
these beloved listeners,

1225
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:46,020
actually went to the trouble of calling and promising their hard-earned something.

1226
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:52,160
Reverend King, now, see, some of these people even are from Cleveland,

1227
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,460
but Reverend King, he called from Ann Arbor, Michigan.

1228
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,980
Think of that.

1229
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,640
Reverend Jason from Ohio managed to call in.

1230
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,700
He wanted that negative land, Big Ten 8.

1231
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,620
See, he's smart.

1232
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,880
Well, these people have warmed the cock.

1233
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,460
Are there more?

1234
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:14,780
Dr. Dark, you know Dr. Dark and Her Highness Hell No, a faithful, faithful pledger.

1235
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:20,260
And he wanted that triple X rated hour of slack that comes as a premium.

1236
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:28,380
And since his donation was so large, why, he could get just about anything he wants.

1237
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,080
And Hewitt, he hewed to the word of Bob.

1238
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,980
And these are our beloved listers.

1239
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,200
Then there's our...

1240
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,720
Ignored listeners, which is all the rest of you haven't called yet.

1241
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,480
Because I've got no use for you.

1242
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,560
I've washed my hands of you.

1243
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,260
Well, I think if we're going to have people...

1244
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,100
I'll wash my feet of you, for that matter.

1245
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,680
Well, that's what they used to do in the days of our Lord.

1246
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,260
They would wash their feet.

1247
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,000
You walk into someone's house and they start sucking on your toes.

1248
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,680
That's what we'll do for you if you pledge.

1249
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,620
But they ain't pledging, see.

1250
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,120
We're feeling down.

1251
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,200
It's looking bad.

1252
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,640
I don't know if we'll be on the air next week.

1253
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,200
Actually, I won't be on the air next week.

1254
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,800
Well, I won't either.

1255
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:16,000
But if I could, I would have like an enormous, huge, psychic tickler.

1256
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,960
It would be like a feather.

1257
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,440
It would be more like a wand.

1258
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,600
And I would stick it right into the vacuum of space.

1259
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,780
And I would tickle those radio waves that go on forever.

1260
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,620
And there are so numerous that we can't count them.

1261
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,340
And I would force...

1262
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,620
Love it with force.

1263
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,900
Well, I wouldn't force anybody to...

1264
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,020
Blank it with love.

1265
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,540
I would force them to consider...

1266
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,760
Whack it over the head with your hard love, baby.

1267
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,420
Yeah.

1268
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,980
Do that to this station.

1269
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:41,720
Wait a minute.

1270
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,360
This is the parallel.

1271
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:42,840
Wait.

1272
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,080
This is not the caramel.

1273
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,120
This is the parallel theme.

1274
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,820
Are you still doing the other thing?

1275
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,800
Yeah, I just realized something.

1276
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,400
I'm going to...

1277
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,060
I'll be seeing that Reverend King next week at the Detroit Devival.

1278
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh, I hope it's not one of those.

1279
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:55,940
Yes, I...

1280
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,600
Yeah, it is.

1281
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,320
See, people will...

1282
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,820
They'll come to see the word Bob preached.

1283
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,740
They'll even pay good money to see it in some places.

1284
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,620
I don't know about Cleveland.

1285
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,280
I might as well just move back to Dallas.

1286
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,920
Me and Reverend Gene Scott might as well just move back to Dallas.

1287
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,800
I might as well just shut off all this background stuff.

1288
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,440
Might as well...

1289
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,120
Might as well just play my saxophone.

1290
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,340
Which I never did learn how to play.

1291
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,860
But that's all they deserve, these listeners, if they ain't going to call.

1292
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,740
They won't even promise us money.

1293
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,020
We're not trying to get the money out of you right this minute.

1294
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,840
We'll get it later.

1295
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,860
We're just trying to get you to promise, that's all.

1296
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,320
I see a whole bunch of people listening by internet.

1297
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,420
I ain't getting them...

1298
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,120
I ain't seeing them call.

1299
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:39,720
Them call?

1300
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,480
Buttons light up.

1301
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,740
I guess we might as well just become Southern Baptists, Dave.

1302
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,500
Yep.

1303
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,440
We'd get paid a lot better.

1304
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,900
We might as well just give them the word and let them do whatever they want to do.

1305
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,760
They're going to do it anyway.

1306
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:55,040
If we quit this subgenius church and these little piddly stations,

1307
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,220
why, we could be like Rush Limbaugh or Jimmy Swaggart.

1308
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,400
Well, nobody remembers who they are anymore.

1309
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,940
Who's the new ones?

1310
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:05,720
Chorus.

1311
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,100
Towers.

1312
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,860
Kind of leave.

1313
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:08,340
Grim.

1314
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,340
And Gwen Becker.

1315
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,400
Gwen Lendbecker?

1316
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,600
Yeah, we could be like that.

1317
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,900
We could be preaching some other gospel besides slack.

1318
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,860
Who cares about...

1319
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,380
Nobody cares about slack anymore.

1320
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,920
We could be building huge cathedrals, too, just like they do.

1321
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:29,220
Had we not the decency and honesty to inform our fellow men and other members of other species

1322
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:34,740
that if they would just pick up the telephone, their life might be broadened beyond conjecture.

1323
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,500
They might be more...

1324
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,700
They might be happier than they've been in the last three weeks or something.

1325
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,680
They might say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1326
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,320
Here comes my T-shirt, man.

1327
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,560
Oh, thanks, you PS guy or regular...

1328
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,940
That's a big if.

1329
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,240
That's a real big if, and you're talking about a bunch of big butts.

1330
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,420
And that's what they ain't going to get off of, because the phone, it might be across the room.

1331
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,800
It's a little bit easier to just sit there listening by a computer or whatnot.

1332
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,820
We're going to be doing this show anyway.

1333
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,700
It's going to be free.

1334
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,480
Why should they...

1335
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:06,620
Why should they help?

1336
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:13,180
Why should they demonstrate that anybody except those four people that called in have ever listened to this show?

1337
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,680
As far as I'm concerned, they're the only people we ever talked to this whole...

1338
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,300
All the 20-something years I've been doing this.

1339
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:27,560
The only ones that ever paid any attention was Dr. Dark and Reverend King there and James and John and Jason and Joe.

1340
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,960
No, Joe wasn't even listening, was he?

1341
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,080
Well, Piker was...

1342
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,320
Joe just gave up on us.

1343
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,440
Jim Bowe and the Alarm Room.

1344
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,040
I said...

1345
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:36,700
And...

1346
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,180
And...

1347
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:37,700
And how...

1348
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,540
How bold are you guys?

1349
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,380
Why should we...

1350
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,460
Why should we keep...

1351
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,560
You know I have to drive all the way down here to this station once a month?

1352
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,940
Why am I going...

1353
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:53,520
If they can't even go across the room to pick up that phone and call this station, they can't be bothered to do that.

1354
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,420
Why should I be bothered to do anything?

1355
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,500
Anything at all?

1356
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:02,500
Now, the form of rhetoric you're taking up is a form based on pity and stuff.

1357
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,460
Now, I'm not going to speak to you...

1358
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,200
There's nothing wrong with...

1359
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,320
Hey, I'm just hating them.

1360
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,520
No, it's just pure hate.

1361
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,240
Depression.

1362
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,380
And I'm depressed, sure.

1363
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,640
I'm going to go home and commit suicide.

1364
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,780
That's why I'm not going to be here next week.

1365
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,700
I'm going to go just kill myself because four listeners ain't enough.

1366
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,580
And if one more, just one more, that's all we're talking about.

1367
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,500
Do you think we'd lie to you?

1368
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,360
Do you think there'd really be 400 listeners I'm just saying for?

1369
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,440
Do you think a subgenius would come up with a silly lie like that?

1370
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,260
I don't think so.

1371
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,760
We've got four million listeners, Stang.

1372
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,060
Just calm down.

1373
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,440
Sit back in that little easy chair.

1374
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,100
Four million dead listeners.

1375
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,260
Four million listeners in the afterlife.

1376
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,120
Yeah, sure.

1377
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,580
Oh, yeah.

1378
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,240
People.

1379
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,080
Yeah, people, sure.

1380
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,840
But this...

1381
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:47,940
Perhaps.

1382
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,740
I mean, I'm just throwing this out there.

1383
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,080
Perhaps people in this dimension have a hard time remembering that number.

1384
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:03,440
Now, if we've accidentally, perhaps on purpose, transversed into the next string,

1385
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,380
and the string is vibrating at the right rate,

1386
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,340
we've zoomed off into a place where there are four million listeners

1387
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:16,540
who cannot comprehend past the last sentence they heard.

1388
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,160
They can't remember.

1389
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,700
This is 6900.

1390
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,940
They can't remember the hour of slack.

1391
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,840
The church of the subgenius.

1392
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,480
Yeah, what was that show I used to hear back in those days?

1393
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,600
The hour of flack?

1394
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,440
Or was it the week of slack?

1395
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,920
Or hour of Bob?

1396
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,040
What was it?

1397
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,140
Oh, that show.

1398
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,800
That show made me feel so good.

1399
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,880
I've been so depressed ever since that show went off the air.

1400
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,500
Oh, come to think of it, that whole station went off the air

1401
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,580
because nobody gave to those independent stations.

1402
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:54,660
All they did was listen to the top 40 drive time classic rock stations

1403
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,220
or their supposedly hip modern new music station

1404
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,820
that always plays exactly what Clear Channel prescribes.

1405
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,600
You know, it's prescription music for the brain dead.

1406
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,700
They want to keep you sick, you know.

1407
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,040
They want to keep you hearing.

1408
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,220
They want to make you be one of those people that just,

1409
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,580
oh boy, they're playing my favorite song again.

1410
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,340
They played that ten minutes ago.

1411
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,120
I'm so happy they're playing it again

1412
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,760
because I don't like anything new

1413
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,340
because I'm a stupid pig.

1414
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,920
I'm a stupid, normally, warmly human.

1415
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,700
I'm a pathetic, and I don't have enough money to give it to the station

1416
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,940
because I'm too stupid and poor

1417
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,840
because I'm too chintzy

1418
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,440
because I'm a...

1419
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:34,560
a...

1420
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,020
a...

1421
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,080
a...

1422
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:35,580
a...

1423
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:35,580


1424
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:35,580


1425
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:35,580


1426
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:35,580


1427
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:35,580


1428
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:35,580


1429
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:35,580


1430
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:35,580


1431
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:35,760
a...

1432
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,740
a selfish, fat hog

1433
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,160
that can't do, even if I'm skinny,

1434
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,280
I'm just a hog that can't be bothered.

1435
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,040
Can't be bothered to lift the phone.

1436
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,640
Can't be bothered to call this station

1437
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,360
and show the tiniest...

1438
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,940
tiniest gram of gratitude.

1439
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,100
No, sir.

1440
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,420
No, that's too much work for them.

1441
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,960
That's not their idea of slack.

1442
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,260
Their idea of slack is

1443
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,580
to drink Miller similar

1444
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,940
Uh-huh. That's what they'd like because it's the cheapest in old Milwaukee.

1445
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:19,040
And smoke some of their dirt weed and listen to whatever that station is that they listen to.

1446
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:23,100
That's not this one. Or they listen to this one going, well, I guess I'm cool.

1447
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:31,940
Even though I have no mind, I'm just cool because I must be smart because I listen to Frank Zappa albums.

1448
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:36,260
Oh, that shit makes me sick.

1449
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:42,880
I'm spraying spittle and foam all over this expensive equipment.

1450
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,260
Well, it's not very expensive equipment.

1451
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,980
Who cares if I'm spitting all over this equipment?

1452
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,640
We can't afford these equipment.

1453
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,100
We can't afford a maid to come in here and clean up my spittle.

1454
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,360
Because that's the way these people are.

1455
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,920
How do you wash this stuff out of your nasal hairs?

1456
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:01,920
Check.

1457
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:09,060
I think you've gone over the edge, but I do agree that maybe you should have stepped a little bit further and kicked a few more groins.

1458
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,260
Or is that the plural of it?

1459
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:16,220
They don't have groins. The kind of people I'm talking about don't have enough groin to kick.

1460
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,740
They've got kind of a space between their legs, but that's all.

1461
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,880
And they don't have an eye for an egg.

1462
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:30,400
You're listening to a preacher who's only got six up front.

1463
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,980
And you ain't got none, as far as I'm concerned, if you haven't called.

1464
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,440
Now, there are those who have called, yes.

1465
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:45,960
There are those true subgeniuses, the men and women of Bob, the children of Bob,

1466
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,120
who cared enough to call the station and donate.

1467
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,740
That's just a tiny, you know, who means the most to Bob?

1468
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:59,580
The rich man who could have given a million dollars and only gave 15?

1469
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:00,780
A hundred?

1470
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:06,680
Or the poor old lady who's only got $10 to her name, but she gave nine to the station?

1471
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,520
I think you know the answer.

1472
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,120
That Bob loves that rich man.

1473
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,700
Because he gave more money.

1474
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,900
That's what it all comes down to.

1475
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:24,980
Friend, can't you feel deep down in your heart and into that place even more close,

1476
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,440
even more you than your heart?

1477
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:28,980
Your wallet.

1478
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,200
Your wallet.

1479
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,960
Can't you reach down into that and spare the ministers of Bob

1480
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,500
and the Home for Slackless Children just a little bit?

1481
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,200
Give generously.

1482
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,340
I mean, we're going to spend more on postage than you, your premiums,

1483
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,300
than we'll actually make.

1484
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,760
Now, come on, friend.

1485
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,140
You can do it.

1486
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,240
I know you can.

1487
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:56,980
I know that somewhere out there, there is one true, honest man or woman

1488
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,180
or something.

1489
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,840
Some gender along in there.

1490
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,020
At least nearby.

1491
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,680
That will fork it over.

1492
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,080
You know?

1493
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,480
At least they'll often do in your part of the world.

1494
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,240
So give generously now.

1495
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,820
Oh, my gosh.

1496
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,240
All that screaming and yelling I just did got three more people to call in.

1497
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,380
Three more people called?

1498
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,420
Can you believe the Princess Marie?

1499
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:18,880
That's amazing.

1500
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,220
It is amazing.

1501
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:27,140
They went for that Southern preacher crap and actually pledged?

1502
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,520
What?

1503
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:28,760
Well, now it's...

1504
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:28,960
Well, now it's...

1505
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:28,960


1506
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,660
It's my turn to get a little bit angry.

1507
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,680
If that kind of dramatic over-drama is going to get you to send in some money,

1508
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,540
then I'm going to come up...

1509
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,600
I'm going to go on...

1510
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,760
Now, here's the funniest thing.

1511
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,160
Get this.

1512
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,880
Only one of these new pledgers is from Ohio.

1513
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:47,860
Well, it figures.

1514
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:48,860
A lot for that.

1515
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,400
Our brother Hoffmeister has coughed...

1516
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,160
Hoffmeister could cough.

1517
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,460
He's a coughmeister, and he coughed up a really good donation.

1518
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,900
He's going to get...

1519
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:03,120
Get him a black zip-up men's hoodie with a gray WCSB logo.

1520
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,260
Brother Sears called from...

1521
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:06,760
Get this.

1522
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,580
Pittsburgh, North Carolina.

1523
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,380
Well, that's a strange thing for a preacher here.

1524
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:18,100
It costs Brother Sears more to make that phone call than anybody in Cleveland has donated,

1525
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:23,240
except Dr. Dark hardly and Reverend Hoffmeister and the other ones that donated.

1526
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,120
And here's...

1527
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:24,660
Get this.

1528
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,540
After all my bad mouth in Dallas, we got one from Dallas.

1529
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,860
Reverend Michael in Dallas.

1530
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,340
Oh, my goodness.

1531
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,560
He coughed up.

1532
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:42,000
He hocked up a loogie that'll get him that triple X rated hour of slack show that you can't get on the broadcast world.

1533
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,200
Now we're talking some trash.

1534
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,240
This is like homily grits in the middle of email services.

1535
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:51,220
This is beyond any form of success I could have imagined.

1536
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:52,680
Yes, yes.

1537
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,780
Seven donators.

1538
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,900
Well, that's seven more skulls that we haven't trepanated.

1539
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:58,840
That's seven more skulls.

1540
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,640
That's seven more skulls that we could be invading right now, and we are invading.

1541
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,740
And we want to invade as many as we possibly can.

1542
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,260
We want to get right inside that cerebral cortex.

1543
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,340
We want to get right into the...

1544
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,620
What's the part in between that joins everything up?

1545
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,140
The medulla oblongata, the MO there?

1546
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:14,720
Is that the part?

1547
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,040
That's the part we're looking at right now?

1548
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,000
It's moving.

1549
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,260
The hindbrain.

1550
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,340
Oh, the hindbrain.

1551
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:19,540
Yeah.

1552
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,540
It's right near the fore...

1553
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,020
It's the area that we want...

1554
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,860
The hindbrain.

1555
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,160
Oh, yes.

1556
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:26,600
Yes.

1557
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,660
It's also called...

1558
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,100
It's the place that's dimly lit from within.

1559
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:38,840
That means we're calling on you in a suspenseful, Uruguayan, perhaps even spiritualist, demonic way

1560
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:46,200
to enter your wallet and look and see how many dollars of U.S. currency or any other kind.

1561
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,120
You know you can also donate to this station with Canadian money.

1562
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,480
We'll take it.

1563
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,760
I mean, they'll take it.

1564
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,720
Don't you...

1565
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,700
Don't you want to...

1566
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:04,340
Have some identity that separates you from the others?

1567
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,600
The faceless?

1568
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,040
Don't you want to feel and know?

1569
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,860
Now, everybody likes to feel special.

1570
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:23,280
But wouldn't you like to know that you were like those few, those brave people that called into this station, this station, and made that pledge?

1571
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,600
Made that promise to J.R. Bob Dobbs?

1572
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,620
You know Bob's a rich...

1573
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,020
He's the richest, luckiest man in the world.

1574
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:29,960
He doesn't need your money.

1575
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,480
But he needs to know that you trust him.

1576
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:41,640
And the only way to do that is to get from you that which is more important to you than your own life, your children, your spouse.

1577
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,260
Yes, it's your money.

1578
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,740
That's the only way he can know that you've given up something you really care about.

1579
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,640
And we're not asking for all your money.

1580
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,600
If we were some of these other religions, we'd have...

1581
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:57,500
We'd make you bow down to Dallas every day at 6.

1582
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:58,380
6 o'clock in the evening.

1583
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,120
Or we'd make you get up at 7 in the morning and go to work.

1584
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:10,600
Or we'd make you kneel down by your bed and say whisper to Bob, even though he's not really paying any attention in the slightest.

1585
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,300
But we don't.

1586
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,220
We just give you slack.

1587
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,400
We'd rather be selling you slack.

1588
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:24,160
But, you know, the day that the conspiracy can package and sell slack is the day they've won.

1589
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,640
As long as they don't know what slack is, they can...

1590
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,120
They don't win!

1591
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,820
And you!

1592
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:37,080
You and your donation is the one thin hair-like line, the tiny thin cellophane wall in between

1593
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:43,300
total world destruction by the conspiracy and slavery and freedom.

1594
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:44,480
You!

1595
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:55,580
Your call is that one thing that could make freedom, slack, love, warmth and beauty and full belly forever

1596
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,620
versus your non-success.

1597
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:06,140
Stop calling in and just might as well just go back in time to become a slave under the pharaoh,

1598
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:14,280
hauling stuff up that pyramid wall, whipping the mammoths, cleaning the mammoth poo up as they haul those bricks up.

1599
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,300
Isn't that what you're doing right now, friends?

1600
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:20,400
That's kind of what I'm trying to do right now.

1601
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,960
Huge granite bricks up a monolithic mammoth mammoth every day.

1602
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,620
One more inch closer to the very...

1603
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,220
Are you going to let that happen?

1604
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,140
Are you going to be the person who causes the avalanche that destroys civilization?

1605
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:44,940
Or are you going to be the Abraham Lincoln that stands up against the conspiracy for once in this benighted world

1606
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:51,960
and says, yes, Bob, yes, yes, this station, I believe, I believe.

1607
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,600
Well, that was the last woman tracked from...

1608
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:04,740
Aldo Zinger's spy remedies and the other unfortunate victims of the heretofore non-existent crap.

1609
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,300
Yep, that's it.

1610
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:13,500
It's a long-winded opus and perhaps one of the best ways to describe it was it requires some audience participation.

1611
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:23,780
And so as a part of the continuing survey going on right now, those of you who have registered and with those comments and feel...

1612
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,040
I'm packing up. I'm getting out of here. I've had it.

1613
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:26,880
Please call.

1614
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,100
Call if you can now or if you cannot.

1615
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,660
This is the assignment.

1616
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,020
I'm going to do a show next week.

1617
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:35,360
I'm going to mail it to those seven people that pledged.

1618
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:35,660
That's it.

1619
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,500
They're the only ones that are going to hear a show next week.

1620
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:37,920
That's it.

1621
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:44,380
Are you saying the wagon wheel of time is approaching when no one gets the opportunity to be saved?

1622
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,120
Not ever again.

1623
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,280
This was the last chance.

1624
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:52,800
Now, it's possible that a few of them were thinking, I can't bear to miss a single word that Lonesome Cowboy Dave says,

1625
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,860
so I'm not going to call in until Stang starts playing prerecorded.

1626
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,320
I don't blame him.

1627
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,900
I don't blame him for waiting.

1628
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,060
That's okay.

1629
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,080
We're patient.

1630
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:09,520
I mean, you've got to remember that people are going to form some form of astrophysical drift out there,

1631
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:15,300
and if their fingers get too small, they're not going to be able to dial the phone right.

1632
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,880
I can say this.

1633
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,940
I can say this.

1634
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,620
I can say this tonight.

1635
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,860
In fact, I have to say it.

1636
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,480
Now, that may not ever...

1637
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,860
Now, that may not ever...

1638
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,240
I'll never have to say that again if nobody ever coughs it up.

1639
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,460
Anyway, I'm going to...

1640
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,280
We're off.

1641
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,040
This is the end.

1642
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:32,940
This is probably the last show.

1643
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,200
That's it.

1644
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:35,460
So, oh, well.

1645
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,120
Oh, well.

1646
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,620
It's going right now?

1647
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,620
Unless a few people call in when I get off the air here and let Dr. Sinister take over,

1648
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,920
and that's what I'm going to do right now.

1649
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,420
So, Dave, I'm going to fade you out.

1650
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,160
There it goes.

1651
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,180
Okay, but I really hope some people call because they really should.

1652
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,540
It'd be a lot better for everybody, especially...

1653
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,540
So, I'm fading you out.

1654
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,460
Actually, I'm going to start fading me out, too.

1655
00:56:59,360 --> 00:56:59,920
Okay.

1656
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,160
Come on!

1657
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,880
Get up off that chair!

1658
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,040
Follow me!

1659
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,560
Now you can have something to sell.

1660
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,940
We all know we're in the art of selling.

1661
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,460
We create a mental and an emotional climate of unconscious selling.

1662
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,840
Right in your own home.

1663
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,820
And you can call in and you can talk to the...

1664
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:26,320
There's some sexy ministers on the lines tonight.

1665
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:33,080
Your prayer partners are here ready to receive your promise.

1666
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,940
Your covenant with Bob, friends.

1667
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:41,180
Why, the evil Dr. Zaphod here picked up...

1668
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:44,920
He got one from Joseph Prowl for 200 bucks.

1669
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,040
And I happen to know that that one's not a joke.

1670
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,180
But we got to sell you, friends.

1671
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,300
We're not just going to sit here and talk.

1672
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,500
Bob said we had to party.

1673
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:52,920
Didn't he?

1674
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:53,820
Didn't he?

1675
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,700
He said we had to party.

1676
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:56,300
He didn't say we couldn't.

1677
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,000
He said we had to.

1678
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,000
And so, we must also sell.

1679
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:02,200
Praise Bob and thank you.

1680
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,640
Or they're destroyed.

1681
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,920
When everybody sells...

1682
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,200
We're all selling.

1683
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,900
We all have something to sell.

1684
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,280
Yes, everyone selling together.

1685
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,040
Mighty symphony of prosperity.

1686
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,960
For we all have something to sell.

1687
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,400
Ha! Ha! Ha!

1688
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,580
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

1689
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,260
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

1690
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:22,900
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

1691
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,100
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

1692
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,000
A candy-colored clown.

1693
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,300
They call us Santa.

1694
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,020
Tiptoes to my room every night.

1695
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,500
Every night.

1696
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,640
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper.

1697
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,080
To whisper, dear friend.

1698
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:36,340
Go to sleep.

1699
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:37,580
Go to sleep.

1700
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,800
Everything is just fine.

1701
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:40,860
It's just fine.
