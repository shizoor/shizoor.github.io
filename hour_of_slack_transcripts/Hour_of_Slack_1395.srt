1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,000
Bob!

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,640
Bob!

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,480
Bob!

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,420
Dobbs!

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,620
Bob?

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,460
Dobbs!

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,120
Oh, hello, Dobbs. What is it?

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,760
Well, it's probably not...

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,460
The subgenius power of Slack!

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,300
My God!

11
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,760
Okay, that was that hour.

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,520
Now we start...

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,080
No, no.

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,660
Well, soon. In a couple of...

15
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,760
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

16
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,360
I have to do another minute of this when I'm done.

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,680
Radio or not, here I come!

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,020
Radio or not.

19
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,580
This is giving us fade-out time.

20
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,300
Oh, God.

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,260
I know the answer to that one.

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,320
Radio or not.

23
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,680
No soap.

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,600
We need to work on this radio you can smell.

25
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,040
Oh, no, no, no.

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,520
Have you heard radio recently?

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,160
Aside from WREK?

28
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,520
I can proudly say I haven't.

29
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,600
Oh, my good...

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,000
I haven't even heard WCSB outside of WREK.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,940
I was quite tickled to find out that the second-string right-wing station in town has gone all Spanish-language.

32
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:17,700
Sports!

33
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,160
Oh, what juicy butthurt.

34
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,760
Oh, the shot in the right eye.

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,540
They're going to be Shelly Dankerting all over Atlanta.

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,280
Oh, they're a bunch of guys out looking for a job now.

37
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,640
I'm unemployed.

38
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,260
I can laugh at them.

39
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,980
Holding sides outside of the John Birch Society waiting for pickups to come by with microphones.

40
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,520
That was Alex Jones coming by with the microphone in the pickup.

41
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,920
That's how he started out.

42
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,440
Oh, yeah?

43
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,940
Yeah, he'd drive around with a PA and yelling at us for pickup.

44
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, waking life.

45
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:06,620
Yeah.

46
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,380
Yeah.

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,500
Mm-hmm.

48
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,220
Mm-hmm.

49
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,620
We are officially an hour or two, ladies and gentlemen.

50
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,540
Yes, now here we are.

51
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:20,160
The program you're about to hear, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse, is parody, satire, and comedy.

52
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:27,380
Any reference to Bob, the Church of the Subgenius, religion, politics, or any other touchy subject

53
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:33,980
is intended only as humor and should cast no reflection on the high standards of WREK Atlanta,

54
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,020
its staff, or that of Georgia Tech.

55
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,400
Wow, you've got another take of it now.

56
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,460
After all those years.

57
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,600
And you say it so much slower in person.

58
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,500
I've been tweaking it up higher and cram more content.

59
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,040
We're very content-heavy emphasis here.

60
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,440
Content is king.

61
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,260
Yeah.

62
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,480
Boy, the subgenius shows have been on a long time.

63
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,640
Puzzling evidence started in 1980 and two.

64
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,100
I was 12.

65
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,620
Wow.

66
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,420
I've been a subgenius for one year.

67
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,020
I was a father already.

68
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,820
Oh, wow.

69
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,000
You, wow, there is a resemblance.

70
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,720
Oh?

71
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,160
Papa?

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,760
Sean!

73
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,220
It's like Popeye finding his pappy, and he hates him.

74
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,780
Riverdiving trucks.

75
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,460
Oh.

76
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,640
It has a ring to it.

77
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,340
I van trucks.

78
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,180
It all fits.

79
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:42,700
Yeah.

80
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,600
Oh, no.

81
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,680
His middle name's Carr.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,400
Yeah.

83
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,140
I van car and trucks.

84
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,620
That's terrible.

85
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,880
I'm sorry.

86
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,360
Oh, there's going to be another hour of that sort of material.

87
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,760
Oh, man.

88
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,080
It's comedy gold.

89
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,160
Well, in the previous hour.

90
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,920
Oh, that's just corn in it.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
That was fool's gold.

92
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,600
Yes, it is.

93
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:07,880
Circling.

94
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,280
The previous hour of fool's gold, we managed to play two cuts by other people, but they

95
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,880
were really long and bad.

96
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,500
And I bet there's more long and bad things besides live radio that we can do.

97
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,600
I'll bet there are.

98
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,220
Oh, I brought long and bad with me tonight.

99
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,040
Hi.

100
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,660
How's it going?

101
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:27,380


102
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,080
You've got your

103
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,880
bad goes to the crazy.

104
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,840
Bad and long.

105
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,200
Bad.

106
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,480
Yeah.

107
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,480
That sounds like a drive time DJ team.

108
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,940
So come here often?

109
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,800
Your shirt says, kill legume.

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,560
Yeah.

111
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,640
Yeah.

112
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,200
That's a legume fan club shirt.

113
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,820
That's the way his fans feel about it.

114
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,940
Think how his enemies feel.

115
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,440
They're like, don't kill him yet

116
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,320
Don't kill him

117
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,520
Hold him down

118
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,640
Too easy

119
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,720
Don't kill him before we get to him

120
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,120
We've been going through the country

121
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,660
Stopping in unexpectedly on the homes of subgeniuses

122
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,560
And grading them

123
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,940
According to their level of weirdness versus pinkness

124
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,800
I was lucky, I had an hour's notice

125
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,340
Well, you've done pretty well so far

126
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,280
Hey Susie, we're here

127
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,440
Susie cleaned up the floozeum for us

128
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,340
Yeah, it's more than just paths

129
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,060
Actually, if you Google floozeum

130
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,420
And if you can guess how to spell it right

131
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,460
You'll be looking at pictures of

132
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,800
And it is a museum

133
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,940
Oh, thanks, absolutely

134
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,520
It's an incredible museum

135
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,060
Thanks for feeding my legion of stalkers

136
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,300
Well, you had those already

137
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:46,960
Yeah, true

138
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,900
And we're gonna, we'll make even

139
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,920
Wish they'd do me some good

140
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,200
Yeah

141
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,320
Yeah

142
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,320


143
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,560
I know how you feel

144
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,540
Why can't we get the, you know, the productive stalkers

145
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:58,960
Yeah

146
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,340
At least get you in the newspaper

147
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,260
Get you some PR

148
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,560
What would I do with

149
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,920
No, I'm not going to go there

150
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,360
No, let's not

151
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,560
Whatever it was

152
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,180
I have no idea what it is

153
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,960
But let's not

154
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,440
Suddenly higher brain function and judgment kicked in

155
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,560
That's not a good sign

156
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,380
Here, drink this, it'll help

157
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,340
Oh, no

158
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,360
This old church

159
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,220
But yeah, Hour of Slack started in 1985

160
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,520
On Halloween, pretty much

161
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,140
And when did it, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse start?

162
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,980
January 1st, 1994

163
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,540
1994, well, that was just yesterday

164
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,800
So, yeah, yeah

165
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,380
Just 18 years, my damn show could vote

166
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,540
Oh, wow

167
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,200
It's all kind of relative

168
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,320
I was trying to talk my show into not, you know, being a fan of the show

169
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,900
I was not voting and I wasn't going to vote

170
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,420
No, actually, it's not relative

171
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,220
And it sneaked out and voted

172
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,020
They'll do that

173
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,960
Yeah, can't trust it, don't

174
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,680
No

175
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,120
Turn your back for one minute and the show's out the door

176
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,920
Yep

177
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,000
I wish

178
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,200
Man

179
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,320
Don't we have a pre-recorded show where we can just put it on and rock it

180
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,220
What do they do at KPFA, the Puzzling Evidence Show?

181
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,360
They really do

182
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,180
Just put on a tape of

183
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,300
Yeah

184
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,680
It's a years old show

185
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,060
And go out on the balcony and take a break for a while

186
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,260
People call in

187
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,420
Princess, we called in, in fact

188
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,400
And talked to a tape recording for about half an hour

189
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,280
Joined the conversation that had previously existed

190
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,340
And you couldn't really tell

191
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,500
You know, that's the funny thing

192
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,100
Well, it was that kind of recording

193
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,080
She knew that it was a recording

194
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,400
Recycled reality

195
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,220
She was playing along with it

196
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,840
Performing, sorry

197
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,340
Sure

198
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,420
Yeah

199
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,440
I mean, but I think

200
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:52,860
She

201
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,960
She called in

202
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,320
And Wellman picked up the phone and said hello

203
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,240
And put her on the air

204
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,360
But then he put on a tape

205
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,480
And went out

206
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,860
But the recording was full of people saying

207
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,540
Hello

208
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:03,940
Hello

209
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,620
Hello

210
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,040
So it was

211
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,280
Quite fun to play along with

212
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,800
It was your show at that point

213
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,240
Yes

214
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,220
Pretty much

215
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,140
I had the whole Puzzling Evidence Show

216
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,580
All to myself

217
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,380
While I shivered out in the car

218
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:19,880
Yeah

219
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,720
Yeah, she couldn't call from inside the house

220
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,320
Because it's like three in the morning

221
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,460
And all of her relatives

222
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,980
Were sleeping in there

223
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,200
So she had to go out to the car and call

224
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,540
But it was bitter cold

225
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,380
And yeah, she was

226
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,360
You were on all over Northern California

227
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,140
Talking to an old recorder

228
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,880
These things happen

229
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,600
Yes, they do

230
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,560
And friends, that's what's happening now

231
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,640
We're all just talking to old recordings of each other

232
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,640
Shivering outside in the car

233
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,120
Loops

234
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,420
And it's so random

235
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,700
That it appears to be

236
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,920
It could all be happening at once

237
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,740
But really, every sentence was recorded years apart

238
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,420
At least we aren't using

239
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,480
An all-computer generated show

240
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,460
Like Dr. Howell uses

241
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,120
Skillfully spliced together

242
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,940
Yes, you can hear the razor cuts

243
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,800
And the splices

244
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,120
If you listen very carefully

245
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,140
Like right there

246
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,780
Right

247
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,860
Very carefully

248
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,240
This show is printed on paper

249
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,500
I like it that way

250
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,820
When you hear the

251
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,740
The clumsy little edits

252
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,140
The hiss changes

253
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,500
The dub

254
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:22,620
The dub

255
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,040
The dub wing hat

256
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,660
Sewing machine

257
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,680
Where's the bobbing head

258
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,500
Talking old grain in a printed sack

259
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,500
I love you, Pappy

260
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,860
The dust blows forward

261
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,020
And the dust blows back

262
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,240
And the wind blows

263
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,720
Black through the sky

264
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,200
And the smokestack blows up

265
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,540
In the sun's eye

266
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,180
When am I gonna die

267
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,840
A white flake riverboat

268
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,980
Just flew by

269
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,540
Bubbles pop big

270
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,600
And the sun's eye

271
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,960
And a lipstick Kleenex hung on a pointed four-kid twig.

272
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,900
Reminds me of the Bobby Girls.

273
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,960
Never was my hobby girls.

274
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,200
Handful of worms and a pole fishing.

275
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,840
Cork bobbing like a hot red bulb.

276
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,500
And a blue jay squeaks.

277
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,480
His beak open an inch above the creek.

278
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,100
Gone fishing for a week.

279
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,660
Well, I put down my pole.

280
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,240
And I took off my pants and felt free.

281
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,040
The breeze blowing up me.

282
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,860
And up the canyon.

283
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,040
As far as I could see.

284
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,140
It's night now and the moon looks like a dandelion.

285
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,340
It's black now and the blackbird's sitting on rice.

286
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,380
And his red wings look like diamonds and lice.

287
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,480
I can hear the mice toes scampering.

288
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,080
Go for a walk.

289
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,080


290
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,820
Birds rumbling.

291
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,720
In pile crater rock holes.

292
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,720
One red bean stuck in the bottom of a tin bowl.

293
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,760
Hot coffee from a crimped up can.

294
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,860
Me and my girl named Bimbo.

295
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,480
Limbo.

296
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,640
Spam.

297
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,240
Thank you.

298
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,280
Captain Beefheart.

299
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,780
Yes.

300
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,600
A poem done completely from memory.

301
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,780
By two memories.

302
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,360
That's about all they came to.

303
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,180
Including the little skips in the record.

304
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:25,740
Yes.

305
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,700
That are mixed in.

306
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,200
Yes.

307
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,240
Well, you know, the way that that song was recorded is that

308
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,940
that was the way during the recording of Trot Mask Replica

309
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,980
that all of the lyrics were done is he would walk around

310
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,400
with a little portable tape deck.

311
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,900
And he would sing the lyrics into it and get as far as he could

312
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,180
in one take and then pause it.

313
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,520
Oh, is that what it is?

314
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,660
And then he would unpause it and sing some more and pause it.

315
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,720
So it's a pause cut.

316
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,020
Yeah.

317
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,660
Oh, yeah.

318
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,220
Oh, OK.

319
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,320
So since we're on a new hour, I guess we should go down the line

320
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,380
and introduce ourselves.

321
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:57,960
Oh.

322
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,120
Are we the same people we were when we started?

323
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,720
I'm Uncle Onan Canabite.

324
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,180
Here's Reverend Velveteen Sly with me.

325
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,820
You can call me Velvet for short.

326
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,160
Yeah.

327
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,240
I'm Dr. Hell.

328
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,940
And I am Brother Xavier Onassis.

329
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,920
Xavier Onassis.

330
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,880
Well, that was all mixed.

331
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,400
I think we'll do that.

332
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,340
Oh, Xavier.

333
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,940
My charming wife, Mia Culpa, to my left.

334
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,180
Yeah, Uncle Onan Canabite can do that song,

335
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,180
that Captain Beefheart thing.

336
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,520
I can do that whole damn album.

337
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah, I probably could, too.

338
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,260
I do.

339
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,220
It was an influential thing.

340
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,760
It was a long time ago, kids.

341
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,540
Yes.

342
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,900
Trout Mask Replica by Captain Beefheart.

343
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,560
Yes.

344
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:57,920
Yes.

345
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,600
That was where many of us went, oh, my God, I'm not alone.

346
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,700
Well, I am alone, but there's something almost as weird as me

347
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,580
or weirder in that.

348
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,960
In the case of Captain Beefheart, he was a very, very weird man.

349
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,520
I didn't know much about his real life until after he died.

350
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,440
Then people started talking about what a jerk he was.

351
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:18,820
Yeah.

352
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,600
He was a very controlling, domineering band leader.

353
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,220
You would not want to have been in one of his bands.

354
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:30,800
He made some glorious music, but he was a very insecure human being.

355
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Yeah, great albums.

356
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,300
But at what cost?

357
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:33,700
Yeah.

358
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,240
Which actually reminds me of my newest musical predilection.

359
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,740
I've recently been introduced to the music of the Shags.

360
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,320
They are pure.

361
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,140
Yes.

362
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,580
They are.

363
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,080
They are.

364
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,080


365
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,080


366
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,080


367
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,080


368
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,080


369
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,080


370
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,080


371
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,080


372
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,640
Very pure.

373
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,460
Their father is very much a Captain Beefheart figure.

374
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,900
Whatever happened to the Shags?

375
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,640
I mean, that was years and years ago that they had their brief moment in the spotlight.

376
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,060
They did.

377
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,140
And they reformed ever so briefly at the bequest of NRBQ singer.

378
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,140
No, it was the drummer, Tom Ardolino.

379
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,360
Ardolino.

380
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,740
Yeah.

381
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,060
He was on the song poem.

382
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,020
And yes, at the time,

383
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,780
the original drummer, Helen, Helen?

384
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,500
Helen.

385
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,840
Had passed away.

386
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:28,440
So Tom actually played with Dot and I can't remember the other girl's name.

387
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,460
So it was NRBQ's drummer with the two original Shags guitarists.

388
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,820
And they opened for NRBQ for an entire tour back in 93.

389
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:38,980
Wow.

390
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,500
Yeah.

391
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,520
I wish I could have heard of that.

392
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,520
But I only just now in the last month or so discovered their music.

393
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:46,960
Goodness.

394
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,520
Yes.

395
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,060
I remember one of those moments of, I love this and everyone hates it.

396
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,920
Well, it is terrible.

397
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,560
It is.

398
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,820
The Shags were.

399
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,680
It sounded as still.

400
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,760
It was a couple of, was it what?

401
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,500
Three sisters?

402
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,160
Three sisters.

403
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,140
Wigan family.

404
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:01,480
Yeah.

405
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,500
Their dad thought they were good and he paid to have a record made of them.

406
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,100
They were actually really, really terrible.

407
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,440
Yes.

408
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,580
But they were so terrible that they became the darlings of the snarky underground all

409
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,540
through the 80s.

410
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,400
The story goes that their father.

411
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,040
It's heartfelt.

412
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:18,760
Yeah.

413
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:26,420
Their father received a palm reading from his mother and was told that his daughters

414
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,800
would be the biggest girl group of all time.

415
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:36,180
So when they were still in school, like ages 11 through 14, he pulled them out of school.

416
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,900
And while he worked all day, their job was to rehearse and write songs.

417
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,480
And when he thought they were good enough, he brought them into your New York to record

418
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:45,980
an album.

419
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,380
Yeah.

420
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:46,380


421
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:46,380


422
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:46,380


423
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,660
He was like Murray Wilson.

424
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,860
Now, this father was also very strict.

425
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,640
He didn't let the daughters listen to any music or go to any dances.

426
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,240
So any influence that you hear in their music is purely coincidental.

427
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,620
They made all of it up.

428
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,980
They had no idea what music was, how it was formed.

429
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,080
They never had any lessons.

430
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,760
Their father just bought them instruments and said, go.

431
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,080
Their most famous song is about their dog, isn't it?

432
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,660
Foot Foot.

433
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,920
My pal Foot Foot.

434
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,420
Yes.

435
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,000
Wow.

436
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,880
Well, it's nice to see.

437
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,640
And the shags are still inspiring people to new depths.

438
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,800
Well, yeah, that's the roots of doctor music.

439
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,420
Yeah, they were a true doctor band.

440
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,860
It was like they didn't care about the audience.

441
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,660
They were doing it.

442
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,920
Well, actually, they had.

443
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,880
They were doing it for their dad.

444
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,700
That's that's new.

445
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,700
Most doctor bands aren't doing it for their dads or they're doing it.

446
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,820
They're doing them in spite of their dad.

447
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,080
Right.

448
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,300
In spite of their dad.

449
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:43,820
Yeah.

450
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,220
Yes.

451
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,160
On their up there in there.

452
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:46,520
Yeah.

453
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,660
Through their dad.

454
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,820
All the prepositions you can think of.

455
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,940
Actually, I never even bothered to tell Pappy about any of the bands that I was in.

456
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,280
But then I wouldn't want anyone to hear any of those anymore.

457
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,240
Oh, we used to sell tapes of Doctors for Wotan.

458
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,440
That was the band that Philo and I.

459
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,440
It was a copy band.

460
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,580
We were copying Doctors for Bob.

461
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,220
They were much more.

462
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,460
Doctors for Bob of Little Rock were much more conceptual.

463
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,160
You were like the Doctors for Bob tribute band.

464
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:16,740
Yeah.

465
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,480
They were.

466
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,920
They were way more pure.

467
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,280
I mean, our our band, we none of us knew how to play anything and we use children's instruments.

468
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,820
So that was that was that.

469
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,360
But Doctors for Bob, for instance, they did a song called Subgenius Alphabet.

470
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:36,080
And a I think was a drawer full of silverware being pulled out and crashing on the floor.

471
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,380
B was a pickup truck driving around town in circles.

472
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,300
Spike Jones.

473
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:41,840
Yeah.

474
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,140
Oh, they were way.

475
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,980
It was more like Christo or Andy Warhol.

476
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,840
You know, see, and this was these are this is a song that in fact,

477
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:59,300
Sternow put an ad in the Little Rock paper for a drummer and a guy showed up and said,

478
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,560
Oh, OK, what do you what do you guys play?

479
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,520
What do you want to hear?

480
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:07,980
And Sternow goes, OK, well, for for our first song, you're going to get a pickup and drive

481
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,320
over across town and and roll the pickup down into the river and then come back.

482
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,380
That's the first song.

483
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,040
Yeah.

484
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,100
I think the guy felt that he was being made fun of and went away.

485
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,360
And I'm not sure to this day if he was being made fun of or not.

486
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,300
They were headed.

487
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,220
They were so avant garde.

488
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:40,200
Doctors for Bob were that to this day, the world hasn't caught up to them and they still sound horrible.

489
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,300
No, actually, that's not true.

490
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,920
They they like so many doctor bands.

491
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,200
They eventually learned.

492
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:46,840
They learned how to play.

493
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,000
And in fact, Sternow is a killer bass player and he's learned.

494
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:58,140
He now plays sax and Doctors for Bob finally ended up doing a whole album of real songs.

495
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:05,040
But then Janer went Janer and we can't do anything with with.

496
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,360
There are none more Jane.

497
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,120
No, he was Janer than thou.

498
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,360
You might say, but he's he's Mr. TV now.

499
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,120
Mr. TV.

500
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,680
Wow.

501
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,360
Well, he.

502
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,220
He's a sidewalk busker.

503
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,220
The former subgenius superstar, Janer Hyperclete.

504
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:28,820
Well, the band broke up with him one by one and then reality broke up with him.

505
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,100
But the sidewalks embraced him.

506
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,300
And and he does.

507
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:43,660
He puts a TV, a hollow television on his head and does takeoffs on TV shows using like little.

508
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,400
If he's doing takeoff on a cop car.

509
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:52,880
He puts a little toy cop car up against the edge of the TV and moves it around and does sound effects and so forth.

510
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,820
It's a police squad.

511
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,880
The first time you see it, it's it's probably funny.

512
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,420
You can YouTube it.

513
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:04,280
YouTube Mr. TV and you'll be seeing the new Janer.

514
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,680
Boy, my ears.

515
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,240
Either my ears just popped or the volume increased or I touched the.

516
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,020
Your ears.

517
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,620
I mean, touch your.

518
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:11,900
No.

519
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,720
Hey, stop that.

520
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,440
Move.

521
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,080
Stop that.

522
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,420
Stop that.

523
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,360
Your knob like.

524
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,220
I'm going to touch it.

525
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,900
Have more.

526
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,280
How embarrassing.

527
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,960
That really is not on the Monster Hunter.

528
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,980
Have you no shame?

529
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:25,660
No.

530
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:25,940
No.

531
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,440
There it goes.

532
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,300
Easy come, easy go.

533
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,900
I think having no taste pays off better than having no shame.

534
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,320
But if you can do that, both.

535
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,980
There was taste in my family, but it skipped a generation.

536
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,960
My son inexplicably has taste and I know he didn't get it from his mom.

537
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,360
What does it taste like?

538
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,000
Good.

539
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,900
What's this flavor?

540
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,400
It's a good taste.

541
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,260
This is starting to bother me.

542
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,920
I'm uncomfortable now.

543
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,940
Oh, velvet.

544
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,760
How could you?

545
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,940
Is that a Mad Magazine quote?

546
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,160
You know.

547
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,060
Anything with a word.

548
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,060


549
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,060


550
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,060


551
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,060


552
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,060


553
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,060


554
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,060


555
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,060


556
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,060


557
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,060


558
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,060


559
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,060


560
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,080
The word Melvin, the name Melvin in it, I instantly think of old Mad Magazine.

561
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,100
At this point, I think everything is an old Mad Magazine quote.

562
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:27,240
They've written enough that I think that any string of words can be found in Mad if you look hard enough.

563
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:27,600
Yeah.

564
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,840
Yeah, probably so.

565
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,380
And now they've all been scanned so you can do a search.

566
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,560
What? Me?

567
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:36,960
Google?

568
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,880
Maybe we should play something from that horrible.

569
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,360
Horrible album.

570
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,200
Which horrible album?

571
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,620
You brought buckets of horrible albums.

572
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:48,980
Yeah.

573
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,500
When Susie, Susie the floozy has.

574
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,640
I've got a few bad records.

575
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,540
She has entire rooms of horrible albums.

576
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,460
Yeah, basements full of horrible albums.

577
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,180
My bad record is going to follow me along.

578
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,860
Yeah, she has a bad record that follows her, she says.

579
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,340
She worked hard on that.

580
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,380
Which bad one is this?

581
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,960
Developing that bad record.

582
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,280
The one of the martyrs things.

583
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,880
Oh, are we back to the world?

584
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,040
World War II.

585
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,100
Worlds of youth.

586
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:15,560
Yeah.

587
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,500
More worlds of youth martyrdom?

588
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,340
Picture is the nasty picture.

589
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,640
The nasty picture.

590
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,700
That sounds pretty nice.

591
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,500
Ah.

592
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:32,300
This is two middle-aged fellows in the 50s communicating with today's youth.

593
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,220
Ah.

594
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,480
Feels good.

595
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:43,560
Yeah, on the previous hour show, we had an ex, but the inter...

596
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:50,900
The entirety of cut four and side two, the martyr.

597
00:22:51,720 --> 00:23:00,620
It was pompous and sophomoric and yet...

598
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,640
He said pompously.

599
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,820
Be pompous, obese and eat cactus.

600
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,420
Be dull and boring and omnipresent.

601
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,580
Criticize things you don't know about.

602
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,000
Be oblong and have your knees removed.

603
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,600
What is that from?

604
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
That is Steve Martin from Let's Get Small.

605
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,900
That's the grandmother song.

606
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,400
No wonder.

607
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,340
It seemed like something so buried so deep under so many layers and...

608
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,920
It's like the Grand Canyon of my mind.

609
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,380
Featuring Ted Nugent on guitar.

610
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,140
Yeah.

611
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,200
Man.

612
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,800
It's...

613
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,920
So we're about to hear the horror.

614
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,500
Yes.

615
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,360
Worlds of youth.

616
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,140
Pictures, the nasty pictures.

617
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,800
They smell so bad.

618
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,220
I see you're looking at that picture.

619
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,960
I'm cutting it out.

620
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,120
Do you know what you're doing?

621
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,980
Sure, I'm cutting it out.

622
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,060
I mean, what you're really doing.

623
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,760
What do the people think?

624
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,680
People like who?

625
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,720
People like anybody.

626
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,940
Well, let's start with you.

627
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,340
What do you think?

628
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,460
I think it's a controversial picture.

629
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,320
I think it's a dirty picture.

630
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,000
A real dirty picture.

631
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,840
It depends on how you look at it.

632
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,500
One of the dirtiest pictures I ever saw.

633
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,080
And you're saving it.

634
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,060
I'm displaying it.

635
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,740
I'm displaying it in front of my bed.

636
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:42,740


637
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:42,740


638
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:42,740


639
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:42,740


640
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:42,740


641
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:42,740


642
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:42,740


643
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:42,740


644
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:42,740


645
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:42,740


646
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:42,740


647
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:42,740


648
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:42,740


649
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:49,320
best friend this controversial, dirty, filthy picture.

650
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,400
Like how?

651
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,720
I'm mounting it and presenting it to the council.

652
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,660
The student council.

653
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,460
The church council.

654
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,500
That dirty picture?

655
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,400
That dirty picture to the men and women of this congregation.

656
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,520
And then to the whole congregation.

657
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,920
What for?

658
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,780
For Lent.

659
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,300
For the council for Lent.

660
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,760
You're kidding.

661
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,720
We won't take it down.

662
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,720
When they see it, no one will take it down.

663
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:31,960
No one.

664
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,620
That dirty picture will hang out there in front of the people.

665
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,540
The women and the children and the youth.

666
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,220
What's the matter with you?

667
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,400
Are you some kind of pervert?

668
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,700
Some kind of maniac?

669
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,160
No one will take it down.

670
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,640
They will look at it for weeks and weeks.

671
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,200
While they sit and sing and stand to pray.

672
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,420
They'll see it while he preaches.

673
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,560
You've got your nerve.

674
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
Everyone's got their nerve.

675
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:06,600


676
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,340
The man has to have his nerve.

677
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,760
This nerve.

678
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,220
To look at the two of them.

679
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
And him hanging there.

680
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,280
Naked between them.

681
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,400
It's a dirty shame.

682
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,880
A dirty, dirty, rotten picture.

683
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,440
Jesus did not escape sin.

684
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,780
He was no playboy, no superman.

685
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,700
No middle of the road politician.

686
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,560
Jesus lived and lives in the middle of everything.

687
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,080
He was born of a woman and came to pay all the consequences.

688
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,800
People lied about him.

689
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,160
Gave him false trials.

690
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,720
Hunted him like a criminal.

691
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,620
Tricked him.

692
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,840
And eventually they got him.

693
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,320
His life was under every strife.

694
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,600
Every segregation.

695
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,040
And he endured every form of sin in slow motion.

696
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,420
In Jesus we have the prediction of how it would all end.

697
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,320
How it would always be on the earth.

698
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,620
Like hell.

699
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,940
Hell on earth.

700
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,620
In Jesus we have the promise of what it could be among men.

701
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,820
Like heaven.

702
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,180
Heaven on earth.

703
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,540
The dirtiest and most disappointing picture in the world

704
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,280
is the picture of the son of man suffering and dying.

705
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,320
The picture is continually reprinted in all the black and white pictures of suffering and dying.

706
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,560
In the south.

707
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,440
And the north.

708
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,400
And anywhere.

709
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,780
There are many, many pictures.

710
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,140
Dirty and inhuman in every newspaper.

711
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,860
They need to be hung on the walls of the chancels.

712
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,260
So that all church councils can see them.

713
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,060
And so that congregations can do something about dirty pictures like that.

714
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,620
As vicious as pornography.

715
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,340
Oh, good heavens.

716
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,220
Someone get her some oxygen.

717
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,680
I always knew religion was pornographic.

718
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,180
But now you've got proof there.

719
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,280
Dirty.

720
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,560
Dirty pictures.

721
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,260
Sausage is not without sin.

722
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:09,740
No.

723
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,580
Yes, that was from an album called Worlds of Youth.

724
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,620
My goodness.

725
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,380
Jeez.

726
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,000
Sausage did not escape sin.

727
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,040
That is some of the most warped Christian themed stuff from the late 60s

728
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,500
when they were going for relevance.

729
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,360
The guy on the left here.

730
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,140
Herbert Brokering.

731
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,560
He looks a bit like Leo Laporte from the Twit Network.

732
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,540
If any of you know him.

733
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,460
The guy on the right here.

734
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,120
Man, he almost looks like Billy Graham.

735
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,340
Yeah.

736
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,000
This John Ridgegrain guy.

737
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,640
Yeah, he has sort of a bobbly.

738
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,780
The highlights on his hair though.

739
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,260
It's getting.

740
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:47,920
Yeah.

741
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,440
Very Grahamian.

742
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,880
Downright Dobbsian.

743
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,520
Dobbsian.

744
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,520
The Dobbs Graham bill.

745
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:01,720
I cannot figure out for the life of me what audience they were going for on this thing.

746
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:16,040
Just think at some point, sometime in history, those two were in a studio and it was the most important thing in that engineer's life to make these two gentlemen sound exactly the way they just sounded.

747
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,260
That was someone's job.

748
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,920
You started lilting.

749
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,840
Can we try it again in a monotone?

750
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,140
Their mission.

751
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,380
Their goal.

752
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,320
Exactly.

753
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,600
Mounting the dirty picture.

754
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,720
Their highest aspiration.

755
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,700
Get more Barry White on the show.

756
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,360
You could have made a lot of money right into that, could you?

757
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,980
Their highest aspiration.

758
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,740
Yes, yes.

759
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,320
Much better.

760
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,000
That studio must have been full of snakes.

761
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,340
There you go.

762
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,840
My voice doesn't Barry White very well.

763
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,640
No, it doesn't.

764
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,400
But that's okay.

765
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,900
The rest of you does just fine.

766
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,840
Oh no, he's letting Stang in.

767
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,000
Stang.

768
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,640
Oh no.

769
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,420
He's in the neighborhood.

770
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,940
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

771
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,560
Here he's putting on his cardigan and his slippers.

772
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:01,680
Reverend Stang, exactly.

773
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,220
There's no need to change your shoes and put on a cardigan, man.

774
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,400
Just come on in and sit down.

775
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:05,920
Really?

776
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,560
No smoking jacket needed.

777
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,100
No, no smoking jacket needed.

778
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,920
Put the jacket out, man.

779
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,300
So?

780
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,740
What was that about?

781
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,940
Oh, you missed it.

782
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,980
You missed the filthy pictures.

783
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,500
Hey, no spoilers, man.

784
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,000
Oh, you missed it.

785
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,180
Oh, man.

786
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,420
You missed it.

787
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,300
It was smut.

788
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,200
Oh my God.

789
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,280
I'm still missing it.

790
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,660
The ghost of Luther King.

791
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:31,660


792
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:31,660


793
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:31,660


794
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:31,660


795
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,040
Luther Vandross inhabited the second speaker's body and all of a sudden-

796
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,640
The lower chakras were thrumming.

797
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,020
Exactly.

798
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,080
His voice was somewhere in the 32 hertz range.

799
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,920
It proved Christianity equals pornography.

800
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,280
Boy, I did miss it.

801
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:47,640
Yeah.

802
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:47,900
Yeah.

803
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,500
You'll never hear it again.

804
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,440
Damn.

805
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,320
You know, the subgenius A.I.

806
00:30:54,340 --> 00:31:00,000
Zeppo, he occasionally utters these heavy statements.

807
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,660
And one of his best quotes is,

808
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:01,660


809
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,820
thought is pornography.

810
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,020
For most of us, that's true.

811
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,020
Yeah.

812
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,840
Out of the mouths of robots.

813
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,580
I thought he was real for so long.

814
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,700
Another thing, Zeppo.

815
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,200
Yeah.

816
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,540
You can have conversation.

817
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,200
I thought that's somebody I'd really get along with.

818
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:29,300
If you get on the, it's one of the more friendly people on the subgenius IRC chat network.

819
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,660
If you go to subgenius.com.

820
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:35,680
You can get into a pretty abusive little chat room.

821
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,360
Uh-huh.

822
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:45,320
And of, on which the most friendly person is Zeppo, who is in fact an A.I.

823
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,860
Robot.

824
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,920
But you wouldn't know it for a long time.

825
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,800
Slack will get you through times of no Slack.

826
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,180
Right.

827
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,860
That was Zeppo's great Bob.

828
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:58,700
He channeled Bob and said Slack will get you through times of no Slack.

829
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:05,640
Only a robot could come up with something or Bob himself would be capable of something

830
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,020
that was so inherently contradictory.

831
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,220
Is it possible that it is the actual Zeppo?

832
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,720
The Marx Brothers straight man?

833
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,240
The fourth Marx Brother?

834
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,340
Is it possible Bob is a robot?

835
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,380
I heard that.

836
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,540
That was a song.

837
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,220
Robob.

838
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,060
Bob is a robot.

839
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,380
There was a song by that name.

840
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,060
Oh.

841
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,960
By some band.

842
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,260
By some band.

843
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,340
But I don't know.

844
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,620
I don't know about these bands.

845
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,040
I'm quite sure Voltron would have defeated him by now if that was the case.

846
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,060
More than meets the eye.

847
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,240
Autobots.

848
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,220
Decepticons.

849
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,880
I can't remember the...

850
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:56,280
You know, those Transformer movies were shamefully abusive of the original story, but I understand

851
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:04,720
that the Transformers video games are absolutely cleaved to the original Transformers TV show.

852
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,100
Well, good.

853
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:11,260
Given that that is the Bible, the true Bible of the Transformers was the cartoon.

854
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,840
How can you expect to improve on that?

855
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,880
Have you seen the most recent Transformers movie, Dark of the Moon?

856
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,520
Yeah, I did.

857
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,180
It made me angry beginning to end.

858
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:26,260
They had this Michael Bay character somehow arranged it so that on film they go to the

859
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:31,200
moon and they have this guy, Buzz Aldrin, to come on screen and talk about how the moon

860
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,540
landing was a government cover-up, number one.

861
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:33,960
Right.

862
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:39,160
Number two, they had a space shuttle explode in the course of the movie.

863
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,020
Too soon.

864
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,520
Too soon.

865
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:41,520


866
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,500
Number three, they got...

867
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,060
Those things do that.

868
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:50,060
They got Leonard Nimoy to say the goods of the many outweigh the goods of the one or

869
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,400
the few in the course of trying to blow up the Earth.

870
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,760
That was...

871
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:55,900
Yeah.

872
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,100
There's no Iron Sky.

873
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,960
That's for sure.

874
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,040


875
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,060
Oh.

876
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,400
That's for sure.

877
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,560
Iron Sky.

878
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,620
Yeah.

879
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,900
Listener, if you're not familiar with the movie called Iron Sky...

880
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,900
You know I just have one.

881
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:11,140
You can certainly get offended by checking out the movie, Iron Sky.

882
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,480
Nazis on the Moon.

883
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,760
It's in a nutshell.

884
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,700
Oh, with President Sarah Palin.

885
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,260
Yes.

886
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,560
Yes.

887
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,000
President Sarah Palin versus Nazis on the Moon.

888
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,140
The moon reef installed.

889
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,020
And it was produced and directed by people in Finland.

890
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:25,820
Mm-hmm.

891
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,660
And it was working with Australians and financed by the internet.

892
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,100


893
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,420
Yes.

894
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:30,820
Yeah.

895
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,620
Yeah.

896
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,940
It's an amazing movie with gorgeous, wonderful special effects.

897
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,460
Mm-hmm.

898
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,080
Slightly awkward racial...

899
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,880
Very awkward.

900
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,340
Yeah.

901
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:42,880
It's...

902
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,480
You can...

903
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,840
It's kind of...

904
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,760
It reminds me of 1970s race movies in the US.

905
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,640
It's a little bit...

906
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,900
The Nazis weren't PC?

907
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,240
The astronaut that gets...

908
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:56,240


909
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:56,240


910
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:56,240


911
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,200
The astronaut that gets stranded on the dark side of the moon and captured by the Nazis

912
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,080
happens to be black and they turn him white and send him back to Earth where he becomes

913
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,660
a hobo.

914
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,380
Yeah.

915
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,800
It's like water...

916
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,520
Yeah.

917
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,180
Yeah.

918
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:10,640
Yeah.

919
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,280
Yeah.

920
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,300
Yeah.

921
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:11,920
Yeah.

922
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,700
Yeah.

923
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:13,180


924
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:13,300


925
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:13,300


926
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:14,520


927
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:14,920


928
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:14,920


929
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:14,920


930
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:14,920


931
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,600
Great.

932
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,580
That's sometimes...

933
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,240
Of course.

934
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,060
And he said to the Nazis, like, okay, this ghost ship is ours.

935
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,360
This was old.

936
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:26,420


937
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,640
osa.

938
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,760
There's a HahYouN tweet.

939
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,160
Ooh.

940
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,380
There you go.

941
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,520
And he just says...

942
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:43,520


943
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,900
I don't know that he has a ho

944
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,340
in the future, hence the 25th Reich.

945
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,760
And in the future, they've put their minds

946
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,140
into giant robot spider Nazis.

947
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,560
And even the protagonist is a,

948
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,700
it's kind of subtly done actually,

949
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,980
but the protagonist is a gay dude.

950
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,860
A Reichsniess.

951
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,500
And although it has a happy ending,

952
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,840
just the arg moment, the big climactic arg moment,

953
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,480
he gets sodomized by the giant Nazi robot spider.

954
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,460
This is all on screen.

955
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,080
It's tastefully done, though.

956
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,580
I'd pay good money to see that.

957
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,420
That's the most bizarre thing,

958
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,440
is that what I just described

959
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,040
is actually almost sort of tastefully done.

960
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,220
The camera averts, you know,

961
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:29,660
the sensitive viewer is not...

962
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,640
I'm sorry, you have to see the sodomy.

963
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,560
Well, yeah, so that's the subgenius movie review, friends.

964
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,340
It's tasteful robot sodomy.

965
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,660
Iron Sky and the 25th Reich.

966
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,820
There's all sorts of...

967
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,540
Also, a Nazis at the Center of the Earth movie.

968
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,520
I can't remember the title of that one,

969
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,860
and it's not very good.

970
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,100
They're Nazis like the new zombies.

971
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,220
Oh, they're in Antarctica,

972
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,720
and it's all done on a white set.

973
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,820
It's just they got a white psych,

974
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,680
and that's Antarctica.

975
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,820
Everything's white.

976
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,400
Well, yeah.

977
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:05,800
And it has CGI that appears to have been done

978
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,920
on the old program Bryce.

979
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,120
It has that look to it.

980
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,820
It's about as good as I could do,

981
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:21,760
which is not very good of CGI on my old, old Mac.

982
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,980
Not as old as me.

983
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,680
I think probably, though,

984
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:30,280
the best bad film I've seen recently is Birdemic,

985
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,040
shock and horror.

986
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:32,980
Have you seen this?

987
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,540
Shock and terror.

988
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,200
Excuse me.

989
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,660
Birdemic?

990
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,340
Birdemic.

991
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,120
Birdemic?

992
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,640
Yes.

993
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,640
It's almost kind of like a redo,

994
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,180
of Hitchcock's The Birds,

995
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,820
but with an ecological bent to it.

996
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,580
But the special effects are ridiculous.

997
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,060
You have, you know,

998
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,480
the way you know that the birds are attacking

999
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,660
is that in the extreme foreground,

1000
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,220
there are three CGI birds hovering,

1001
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,740
flapping their wings,

1002
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,200
not moving at all,

1003
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,640
while the actors swat their hands in front of their faces

1004
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,680
and try and fend off these birds.

1005
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:08,700
Yes.

1006
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,660
I can just see the director,

1007
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,320
we're going to add the birds with CGI.

1008
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,100
Yeah.

1009
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,320
Yeah.

1010
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,060
And then at some point,

1011
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,340
the CGI dude goes,

1012
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,460
wait a minute,

1013
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,700
we can't release this in a week.

1014
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,220
I think it's going to take me five weeks

1015
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,920
just to render one shot on this little computer of mine,

1016
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,800
my home computer.

1017
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,920
Well, we'll use it anyway.

1018
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,080
My cousin just bought a copy of Raster Man.

1019
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,560
He'll do it.

1020
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:33,780
Yeah.

1021
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,060
Yeah.

1022
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,360
Let's use the test.

1023
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,140
You know,

1024
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:38,960
when War of the Worlds,

1025
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,480
the Spielberg War of the Worlds,

1026
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:40,820
came out,

1027
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,220
there were two rip-off War of the Worlds

1028
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:49,000
that managed to get released just before the Spielberg one,

1029
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,780
so that Pobuckers entering Walmart would go,

1030
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:51,960
whoa,

1031
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,260
there's that War of the Worlds movie.

1032
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,820
This doesn't have Tom Cruise in it.

1033
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,120
One of them is,

1034
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,480
word for word,

1035
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,480
the entire H.G. Wells novel,

1036
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,900
and it's four hours long.

1037
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,420
Cool.

1038
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,220
It's so low budget

1039
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,560
that they didn't even have

1040
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,560
real horses,

1041
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,380
and they used horses from that program Poser.

1042
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,700
The crowd scenes are done by the same ten actors

1043
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,780
in the different costumes,

1044
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,820
blue-screened over each other,

1045
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,780
against a, like,

1046
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,160
generic brick wall,

1047
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,540
and that's London being attacked by the,

1048
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,640
and yet,

1049
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,540
the funny thing is,

1050
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,900
it shows you what happens

1051
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,180
if you try to literally make a novel into a movie.

1052
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,020
You end up with a really boring four-hour movie

1053
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,900
with a guy stumbling through the woods

1054
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,780
for ten minutes at a stretch

1055
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:51,860
while somebody reads H.G. Wells' prose.

1056
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,480
Right.

1057
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,280
I mean,

1058
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,040
I read the War of the Worlds every two years

1059
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,160
out of sort of a religious thing.

1060
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,280
Sure.

1061
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,140
They made you.

1062
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:02,920
I understand.

1063
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,340
Yeah, science, you know,

1064
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,940
it was the first sci-fi book I ever read

1065
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,980
because it's a time machine,

1066
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,920
then War of the Worlds.

1067
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,960
Right, and as soon as you memorize,

1068
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,160
it's a time machine.

1069
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:10,940
You have to burn it,

1070
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,060
and then that will be,

1071
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,460
you will be War of the Worlds

1072
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,360
from that point forward.

1073
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,160
Yes, I understand.

1074
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,780
Actually, I'm probably more the time machine

1075
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,700
and island of Dr. Moreau.

1076
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,540
War of the Worlds is a little long

1077
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,980
for me to remember.

1078
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,600
Oh, well.

1079
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,500
But, yeah,

1080
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,800
there was yet another,

1081
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,660
like a made-for-TV type of War of the Worlds

1082
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,180
that they obviously rushed out

1083
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,940
to get out before Spielberg

1084
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,080
because the CGI is,

1085
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,220
isn't even CGI.

1086
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,400
It's more like production drawings

1087
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,260
that they cut to.

1088
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,260
And you only two or three of those.

1089
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,200
So you hardly ever see

1090
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,140
the Martian war machines that are,

1091
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,660
and it's updated to modern times.

1092
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,340
The four-hour version

1093
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,600
was done as a period piece.

1094
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,740
And with, you know,

1095
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,620
like dinner theater,

1096
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,560
Victorian or Edwardian British clothing,

1097
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,240
all shot in,

1098
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,340
they probably shot it in,

1099
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:09,940
what's that?

1100
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,880
Town in New Jersey

1101
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,760
that HG Wells,

1102
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,620
that Orson Welles used.

1103
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,840
Ah, Grover's Mill.

1104
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,640
Yeah, Grover's Mill.

1105
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,020
Yeah.

1106
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,660
That's probably where they really shot it.

1107
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,360
So.

1108
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,380
By accident.

1109
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,660
Jersey dinner theater,

1110
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,260
people trying to do British accents.

1111
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:24,680
Yeah.

1112
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,180
Oh, yeah.

1113
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,040
Oh, it's,

1114
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,880
it's unwatchable,

1115
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,060
but you can't miss it.

1116
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,480
The guy did come back

1117
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,080
and re-release a shortened version of it,

1118
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,580
which I,

1119
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,660
I don't care about.

1120
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:39,640
It's,

1121
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,800
it's best to see the uncut,

1122
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,060
horrible four-hour mess.

1123
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,500
They managed to pack it all into one DVD.

1124
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,280
If you're gonna,

1125
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,320
if you're gonna commit to the Ring of the Nebulon,

1126
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,100
you gotta stay for the whole 12 hours.

1127
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,500
Yeah.

1128
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,240
Yeah.

1129
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:53,580
Yeah.

1130
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,180
It's unbelievable.

1131
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:56,980
You know,

1132
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,840
was Eric von Strohan did Greed, right?

1133
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,320
I don't know.

1134
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,000
A silent movie

1135
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,520
based on McTeague,

1136
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,480
the novel.

1137
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,540
And it was,

1138
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,160
it was originally nine hours long.

1139
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,800
That fabulous print is lost forever,

1140
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,620
but they managed to reconstruct

1141
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,700
a four and a half hour version of it.

1142
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,400
Well,

1143
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,400
you do know that before Dino De Laurentiis

1144
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,820
got his fingers on,

1145
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,880
on Dune,

1146
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,340
the David Lynch version of Dune,

1147
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,280
David Lynch wanted to make it about six hours long.

1148
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:31,740
Right.

1149
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,960
I understand the first cut was nine hours

1150
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,140
and they managed to get,

1151
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:35,760
well,

1152
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,120
I,

1153
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:36,700
right.

1154
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,100
It's like Lord of the Rings.

1155
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:38,300
You,

1156
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,280
it would have been,

1157
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,680
it would have been great as three movies.

1158
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,440
I'm sure.

1159
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,980
But the De Laurentiis is kind of what,

1160
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:45,420
no,

1161
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:45,600
no,

1162
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,620
six hours too long.

1163
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,900
Cut it down to two hours.

1164
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:48,820
Color.

1165
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,160
And it's like a coloring book.

1166
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,320
Yeah.

1167
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,000
It doesn't make a lick of sense.

1168
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,240
No,

1169
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:53,360
no.

1170
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,120
Here's something,

1171
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,680
here's a great experiment to try

1172
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,760
the next time you're wanting to

1173
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,720
have an evening killed on Netflix.

1174
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,300
Watch Flash Gordon,

1175
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,260
the De Laurentiis Flash Gordon.

1176
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:04,660
Yes.

1177
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,340
Followed by the De Laurentiis Dune.

1178
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,120
Yes.

1179
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,360
It's the same sets.

1180
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,060
It's the same,

1181
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:09,740
costumes.

1182
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,760
They both use,

1183
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,100
um,

1184
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:11,980
uh,

1185
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,600
Prague rock bands from the 80s.

1186
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:14,760
Yes.

1187
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,380
Toto on one and Queen on the other.

1188
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:16,660
By Jove,

1189
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,160
you're right.

1190
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,740
It's,

1191
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,680
it's the same movie.

1192
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,420
Wow.

1193
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:19,780
We had,

1194
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,600
we had,

1195
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:20,780
uh,

1196
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,360
uh,

1197
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,880
we were forced to watch the 80s Flash Gordon recently.

1198
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:25,720
Very recently.

1199
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:26,320
Yeah.

1200
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:26,560
The,

1201
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:26,940
the,

1202
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,380
our station in Cleveland,

1203
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,540
WCSB had a Halloween party with a Flash Gordon theme

1204
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,800
and it was my job to project.

1205
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,240
So I had to dig up,

1206
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,120
I dug,

1207
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,320
I dug up the original Flash Gordons,

1208
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,140
the,

1209
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,060
the TV show Flash Gordon,

1210
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,000
which was really forgettable.

1211
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:43,820
I didn't even project.

1212
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,320
I was Flash Gordon,

1213
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,100
which was much funnier than I remembered it.

1214
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,720
And it's only like R rated.

1215
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,020
It's not as nearly as nasty as people think it is.

1216
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,560
Well,

1217
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,640
actually there were two versions there.

1218
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,480
I've seen the,

1219
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,780
the hard X version.

1220
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,360
What,

1221
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:57,820
what we,

1222
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,600
what I downloaded was the normal X version.

1223
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,680
Semi soft.

1224
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,320
Yeah.

1225
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,380
Candy samples was in that,

1226
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,300
uh,

1227
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,040
but it has some great lines.

1228
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:09,280


1229
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:09,960
involving

1230
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,400
take Gordon to the sex depletor.

1231
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:18,400
No.

1232
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,680
Yeah.

1233
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,440
Emperor Wang.

1234
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:23,900
Yeah.

1235
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,060
That's an Emperor Wang.

1236
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:26,180
Yeah.

1237
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:26,680
It was,

1238
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,860
and there's a penisaurus at the end.

1239
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,420
He doesn't,

1240
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,880
there's some Jim Danforth animation.

1241
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,840
Yeah.

1242
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:33,660
Right.

1243
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,180
Yeah.

1244
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,380
So all the,

1245
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:35,900
all the,

1246
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,120
uh,

1247
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,280
sub Harryhausen guys got together,

1248
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:38,940
you know,

1249
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,080
you didn't get much work as a stop motion.

1250
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,420
Harryhausen wannabe back then.

1251
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,640
Uh,

1252
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:45,860
but to,

1253
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,160
yeah,

1254
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,860
flesh Gordon,

1255
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,480
it did have a penis source.

1256
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,000
That was,

1257
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:49,480
uh,

1258
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,040
uh,

1259
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:51,440
uh,

1260
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,940
and a stop motion wiener with,

1261
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,580
with,

1262
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:54,980
uh,

1263
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:55,560
teeth.

1264
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,200
And then there was a real one.

1265
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,080
Then there was like a dirty old monster at the end that carried a little Dale

1266
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,760
Arden around.

1267
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,820
And they did,

1268
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:04,300
uh,

1269
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,980
a lot of tip of the hat tips of the hat to,

1270
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:08,260
uh,

1271
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,780
the King Kong and seventh voyage of sin bed.

1272
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,000
Oh,

1273
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,720
there's a robot fight that is shot for shot.

1274
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,320
Just like the skeleton fight in seventh voyage of sin.

1275
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:16,660
Ah,

1276
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,900
only it's a robot.

1277
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:18,280
Yeah.

1278
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,300
But it's a,

1279
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,560
it goes up staircase,

1280
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,940
little spiraling staircase.

1281
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,320
And the music is even kind of a rip off for,

1282
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:25,940
for us.

1283
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,460
A stop motion nerds.

1284
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,960
It was an orgy.

1285
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,520
Well,

1286
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,980
speaking of stop motion,

1287
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,460
it was like Harry house.

1288
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,080
Have you seen a para Norman yet?

1289
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:35,580
No.

1290
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,120
Okay.

1291
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:36,600
There is,

1292
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,240
there is a,

1293
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,240
there is a tip of the hat.

1294
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,560
To Harry housing in this,

1295
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,160
but the one thing that they,

1296
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,720
I'm surprised that they snuck it into a kid's film that it's set in this new

1297
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,260
England town.

1298
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,120
That's supposed to be cursed by a witch.

1299
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:49,440
And they,

1300
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,100
the town does what every town that has something supernatural about it does

1301
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,160
all of the shops are witch related,

1302
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:57,700
right?

1303
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,340
So,

1304
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:58,960
you know,

1305
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,360
there's,

1306
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,480
there's witches everywhere.

1307
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:00,860
Well,

1308
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,800
the end of the movie comes along and the town is in shambles.

1309
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,560
And,

1310
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:04,960
um,

1311
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,680
the hot dog stand has been,

1312
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,220
um,

1313
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,100
tipped over and the name of the hot dog stand is witchy wieners,

1314
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,060
but it's,

1315
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:16,240
but it's in neon and the w is blinking off.

1316
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,040
The first w,

1317
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,100
the first w,

1318
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,180
not the second,

1319
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,160
not the second one.

1320
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,160
Witchy wieners.

1321
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:26,640
Now,

1322
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,080
what would make a hot dog stand?

1323
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,660
You can put it in the hands of your attorney,

1324
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,240
but it'll never stand up in court.

1325
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,720
I think you're familiar with our state's penal code.

1326
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:38,160
Yeah.

1327
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:38,340
Yes.

1328
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:38,480
Yes.

1329
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,420
Oh man.

1330
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,020
When,

1331
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:43,440
when I,

1332
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,780
those jokes are all over my head.

1333
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,880
I don't get any of that.

1334
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,160
Three more hours of this thing.

1335
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:49,920
Three.

1336
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,160
Wow.

1337
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:51,640
Oh yeah.

1338
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,540
They didn't tell you.

1339
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:52,960
Yeah.

1340
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,460
Yeah.

1341
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,460
And the doors don't open until,

1342
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,080
until,

1343
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,140
until four 30 in the morning.

1344
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,240
It's a good thing.

1345
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,060
I packed a brick.

1346
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,540
Rick tease.

1347
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,000
Oh my good heavens.

1348
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:08,940
Well,

1349
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,660
what other horrible parables of,

1350
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,260
of morality do we have on,

1351
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,840
on old LP records?

1352
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:18,820
Oh,

1353
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:19,640
we haven't,

1354
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,300
we haven't.

1355
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,700
I'm really sorry.

1356
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,900
You didn't bring the Christmas amoeba.

1357
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,380
Oh,

1358
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,840
it really was a song called.

1359
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,320
It was,

1360
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,300
it was terrible.

1361
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:30,780
Mitochondria.

1362
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,400
You panned it.

1363
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:33,840
Well,

1364
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:34,760
it was awful,

1365
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:35,620
but that doesn't,

1366
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,000
that doesn't disqualify it for a subject.

1367
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,020
Stang told me it was lame and awful,

1368
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:38,220
and now it's awful.

1369
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:38,220


1370
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:38,560
Actually,

1371
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,280
I left it at home and was castigated.

1372
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,260
No,

1373
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,680
you're so thin skinned,

1374
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,120
Susie.

1375
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:49,660
Only because he's beaten it to a thin sheet of meat.

1376
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:50,720
Yeah.

1377
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,220
I'm so,

1378
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,600
I'm such a control freak.

1379
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,580
Thin sheet of meat.

1380
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,260
Lousy jerky.

1381
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:02,800
Yes,

1382
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,800
we're a princess.

1383
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,200
We and I are traveling across the country in the I van,

1384
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,220
checking on,

1385
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,940
on subgenius shows and grading them.

1386
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,340
We're,

1387
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,140
this is our inspection tour.

1388
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:14,820
Oh,

1389
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,260
and we've also been inspecting the children of our,

1390
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,800
of the subgeniuses.

1391
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:23,020
This was the first place we stopped where there,

1392
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,240
where there weren't kids or animals,

1393
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:25,820
right?

1394
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,320
Pop.

1395
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:26,520
Now,

1396
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,180
next we're going to lizards.

1397
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:28,600
Next,

1398
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,520
we're going to see Papa,

1399
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,540
Papa Joe mama,

1400
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,160
or otherwise known as father,

1401
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,240
Joseph mother in Tallahassee.

1402
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,640
And he's,

1403
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:37,860
uh,

1404
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,340
a dad.

1405
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,040
All of a sudden he's got a five month old dad now,

1406
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,020
but,

1407
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:42,600
uh,

1408
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:42,980
yeah,

1409
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:43,240
we,

1410
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:43,580
we,

1411
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:43,640
we,

1412
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,300
a real father,

1413
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,320
a real Papa,

1414
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,140
uh,

1415
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,980
Pisces and suds Shaw.

1416
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,060
We visited in,

1417
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,440
in,

1418
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:50,920
uh,

1419
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,500
Virginia,

1420
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,440
my mother's favorite subgenius.

1421
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,920
That's some very promising up and coming subgenius youth.

1422
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,180
Uh,

1423
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:03,840
the,

1424
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,900
the younger one.

1425
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,460
I don't know.

1426
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,840
I can't remember her subgenius.

1427
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,420
I don't know her subgenius name.

1428
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,180
Well,

1429
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,720
you want me to go to the band and find out for you?

1430
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,740
The older one is Reverend Echo Bad.

1431
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,100
And I have a lot of hope for the youth of tomorrow.

1432
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:15,700
I know,

1433
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,500
I know many of my fellow ministers are not the,

1434
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:24,800
don't have parenting instincts and think that children should be eaten and not seen or heard.

1435
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:25,540
Oh,

1436
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:29,360
but Echo Bad really refreshed our faith in youth.

1437
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:29,920
Yeah.

1438
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,060
Yeah.

1439
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,120
She's twisted,

1440
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:32,560
sick,

1441
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:34,700
perverted,

1442
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,260
full of hate and really talented graphic artist.

1443
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:37,820
Really talented.

1444
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:38,760
Takes after her pa.

1445
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,300
Yeah.

1446
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,060
Hardworking little artist there.

1447
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,220
What shall it be,

1448
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:42,640
Susie?

1449
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:43,580
Oh,

1450
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,640
I'm trying to decide.

1451
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,800
What about forgiveness?

1452
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,420
The boy looking natural.

1453
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,980
You can enjoy a jelly roll.

1454
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:50,600
Oh,

1455
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,040
well,

1456
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:51,500
there you go.

1457
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,080
This is more worlds of youth.

1458
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:54,660
Yeah.

1459
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,060
Yeah.

1460
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:55,120
Well,

1461
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:55,140
see,

1462
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,840
these will be good for these up and coming younger preteen subgeniuses.

1463
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,020
Or there's computers.

1464
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:58,960
Oh,

1465
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:58,960


1466
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,500
I wish I had a brain like that.

1467
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:00,920
Teenagers.

1468
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,280
Oh.

1469
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:02,980
Have what?

1470
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:03,360
Yeah.

1471
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,660
Some computer thing or baptism.

1472
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,680
Come to work,

1473
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,680
girls too.

1474
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,120
What a lovely war.

1475
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,580
That sounds pretty cynical.

1476
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,400
Want to try the war thing?

1477
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,000
Yes.

1478
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,620
Make it happen.

1479
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,540
Make it so,

1480
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,120
number one.

1481
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,180
I wish I had a brain.

1482
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,560
I just wish I had a brain to begin with.

1483
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,660
I'll do a number two.

1484
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,940
Not just a brain like that,

1485
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,160
but I wish I had a brain.

1486
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,160
Well,

1487
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:26,540
you know,

1488
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,420
Princess Wee,

1489
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,560
where I come from,

1490
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,920
we have the learned men.

1491
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,780
They're known as professors.

1492
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,940
And all they have that you don't have is a diploma.

1493
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,800
Which costs them several dollars.

1494
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:37,800


1495
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:37,800


1496
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:37,800


1497
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:37,800


1498
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:37,800


1499
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:37,800


1500
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:37,800


1501
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:37,800


1502
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:37,800


1503
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:37,800


1504
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:42,420
And you too can have a diploma.

1505
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,460
They have no more brains than you do.

1506
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,040
If I only had a diploma.

1507
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,180
I'm sorry.

1508
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,840
I don't know what came over me.

1509
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,100
Don't give me lines like that.

1510
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:58,380
Oh.

1511
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,840
Ah.

1512
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:02,780
Ah.

1513
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,020
They sighed in unison.

1514
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:07,800
Oh,

1515
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:07,800


1516
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:07,800


1517
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:07,800


1518
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,420
I love when that happens.

1519
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,860
Me three.

1520
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,220
Suicide.

1521
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:19,620
And then there's when you do Captain Beefheart routines in unison.

1522
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,040
By reflex.

1523
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:21,640
Yeah.

1524
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,660
Much less sexy than two girls sighing in unison.

1525
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,100
Much,

1526
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:27,380
much.

1527
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,400
110% lady proof,

1528
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,000
that is.

1529
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,520
Yeah.

1530
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,600
It's kind of that acid reflex disease.

1531
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,720
Because you sound like you was tripping.

1532
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,640
On that beer fart thing.

1533
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,140
Marijuana is the fuse.

1534
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,600
But LSD is the Bob.

1535
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:45,560
Yeah.

1536
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:46,960
Okay.

1537
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,360
Oh.

1538
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,360
Now where's Worlds of Youth?

1539
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,340
I don't know.

1540
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,040
Do we have to shut up first?

1541
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:52,340
No.

1542
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:52,600
Well,

1543
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:52,960
if.

1544
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,320
It's not up to me.

1545
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,360
Maybe it's 10 minutes long and we'll be able to leave.

1546
00:51:59,420 --> 00:51:59,700
No.

1547
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,020
No.

1548
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,220
Those magic worlds.

1549
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,520
And locking grooves.

1550
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,380
You're stuck in this groove.

1551
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:04,880
Round.

1552
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:05,620
Oh yeah.

1553
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,040
That's right.

1554
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,300
This is a record with locked grooves.

1555
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:07,620
Succulent.

1556
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:07,780
Yeah.

1557
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:07,780


1558
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:07,780


1559
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,920
That's very Christian.

1560
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,220
Tightly packed worlds.

1561
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,560
There's an amazing.

1562
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,140
Worlds within worlds.

1563
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,140
This sounds heavy handed.

1564
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,420
Come to the war.

1565
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,900
You mean I should volunteer?

1566
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,060
You are drafted.

1567
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,880
Now come.

1568
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,800
You mean I don't even have a chance to volunteer?

1569
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,660
You have a chance.

1570
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:37,780
I dont.

1571
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:37,780


1572
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:37,780


1573
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:37,780


1574
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:37,780


1575
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:37,780


1576
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:37,780


1577
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:37,780


1578
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:37,780


1579
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:37,780


1580
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:37,780


1581
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:37,780


1582
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:48,780
to come as a draftee. Are you calling in everyone my age? Not everyone. Only the boys? Girls

1583
00:52:48,780 --> 00:53:02,140
too. Which ones? The ones drafted. Come. Where will we go? To war. But my father just finished

1584
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:31,960
a war. This is another war. What's the name of this one? The war to end all wars. You mean we now use the secret weapon we almost used in the one just ended? Not really. This isn't that weapon. How do you describe this

1585
00:53:31,960 --> 00:54:01,700
war? It's war between wars. You mean a war getting ready for the next war? I mean getting rid of the last war and if possible the next one. You mean it's a war on war? Right. The war of peace. Who will train us? You are trained.

1586
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:30,040
You have the armor. You know the strategy. Are you kidding? I don't even know the names of the battlefields of the last war and the ammunition factories have been converted. Come to the war. My folks may not let me go. At least let me say goodbye. They are also drafted. You are all in the troops of this war.

1587
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:31,940
Okay.

1588
00:54:31,960 --> 00:55:00,160
Okay. Then I give in. You mean you give up? Give up? Yes. Give up war. Which ones? The last one of your father and the one of your grandfather and the one waiting for your children. What's the secret weapon? Forgive the enemy.

1589
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:28,880
Which enemy? The ones already dead and the ones just being born. The enemies of your children in 20 years. Is that the battle line? That's two of them. The third is the big battle. Where's that one? Your enemies. How do I fight this war on wars?

1590
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:55,360
Give your enemies. Must I? You are drafted. Who are the draftees? All the baptized. You are all called to war. To the war against wars. Come. The war of peace has begun.

1591
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:59,040
Why didn't you tell me about this before?

1592
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,360
How could I?

1593
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:02,360


1594
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:28,000
The Christian is never safe from the world. To be baptized into the body of Christ means to be baptized into the world of Christ.

1595
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:32,000
The Christian is in the world. He is called.

1596
00:56:32,360 --> 00:57:00,080
Not to easy street, but to battle fronts. In baptism, he is named a member of a warring people. One understanding of man is that he is a soldier. Daily reminded and daily equipped to wage war defensively and offensively. Why fight in this world? Because it is the father's world.

1597
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,640
Why?

1598
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:09,200
With this kind of war comes peace. Daily peace. Eternal peace.

1599
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,600
Wow. Man.

1600
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,440
That was dark.

1601
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,080
That green stuff isn't guacamole. It's world peas.

1602
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,020
War is peace. War is peace.

1603
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,840
I love Big Brother.

1604
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:31,620
Eternal peace.

1605
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,660
War is peace.

1606
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:32,880
War is peace.

1607
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:33,260
Oh, man.

1608
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,600
My God.

1609
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:37,680
Subgeniuses are called to eternal slack.

1610
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,940
Sounds like a better deal to me.

1611
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:41,440
Bob?

1612
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:41,700
No kidding.

1613
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:43,460
Bob?

1614
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:43,840
Bob.

1615
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,520
Bob.

1616
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,400
Bob.

1617
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:47,580
Bob.

1618
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:47,980
Bob.

1619
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,380
The terrible, rotten smell of burning flesh.

1620
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:53,280
Bob?

1621
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,320
I'm hungry.

1622
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:54,860
Bob.

1623
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:55,760
Bob.

1624
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,040
I hear Ennio Morricone in the background.

1625
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:00,520
Hmm.

1626
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,500
The background music.

1627
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:01,900
Yeah.

1628
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,040
That's much better than anything we could say.

1629
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,660
I love this music.

1630
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,020
That's from For a Few Dollars More, isn't it?

1631
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:17,900
Yes.

1632
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:18,720
Yes, it is.

1633
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,480
Does not lover come back?

1634
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,320
I just love them rock huds and movies where it acts straight.

1635
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:27,960
Yeah.

1636
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:29,660
Marion.

1637
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,820
Then Rocktree marries Doris Dogg and he piddles on her.

1638
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,500
I'm doing it, friends.

1639
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,700
I'm playing a video game while doing a subgenius radio show.

1640
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,000
Congratulations.

1641
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,460
You are now 16 years old.

1642
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:48,500
Yeah.

1643
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,180
That's right.

1644
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:55,400
I finally caught up with the 16-year-olds of the world who can multitask.

1645
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:01,400
This music really goes perfectly with the little thing on my screen.

1646
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,460
Let's not talk about the things we see on our screens on the radio.

1647
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:09,080
Well, one thing you see on the screen is subgenius.com.

1648
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:10,360
That's right.

1649
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:16,260
Don't call the number you see on your screen because you're hallucinating that number.

1650
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,240
It's not really there and there's not a screen.

1651
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:18,940
Bob?

1652
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,840
But this show does have that effect on some people.

1653
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:22,820
Bob.

1654
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:23,760
Bub.

1655
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:24,640
Bub.

1656
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,120
What's all the hubbub?

1657
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,120
Bob.

1658
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,280
Bob.

1659
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,480
Okay.

1660
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:30,880
Okay.

1661
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,100
Mmm.

1662
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:32,980
Bob.

1663
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,040
Okay.

1664
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,600
I owe Bob, but just this once.

1665
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:38,960
Oh.

1666
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:51,340
Well, friends, it's been lovely being here at the studios of WREK Atlanta, Georgia Tech.

1667
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:52,860
The posh studios.

1668
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:53,960
Yes.

1669
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,360
Posh and polished.

1670
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,620
We are honored to once again be, and it's a brand new, it's the newer studio.

1671
00:59:59,040 --> 00:59:59,700
It is fabulous.

1672
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,400
I've been here when it was the olden days.

1673
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:01,620
It's fabulous.

1674
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,040
It's a groovy.

1675
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:02,720
Oh, yeah.

1676
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,380
As you said.

1677
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,320
They burned that down in 2004.

1678
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,600
I had nothing to do with that.

1679
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,340
For Micah, as far as the eye can see.

1680
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,240
Oh, it's for everybody.

1681
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:19,080
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

1682
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:24,780
For free information, write to P.O.

1683
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:29,420
Box 181417.

1684
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,100
Cleveland.

1685
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:35,700
Flint Heights, Ohio 44118.

1686
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:41,920
Or see www.subgenius.com.

1687
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,000
Praise Bob.

1688
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,780
Thank you.

1689
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:04,980
It's just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1690
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:12,980
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you, you should

1691
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:19,540
go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages

1692
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:22,900
and help out financially as best you can.

1693
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:29,240
Now we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty and we don't want any subgeniuses

1694
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,900
to make their own situations worse.

1695
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,840
But some of you still have jobs.

1696
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:37,180
Even five bucks makes a big difference.

1697
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:43,120
Even if it's only once a month from enough of you, 50 bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1698
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:51,280
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay

1699
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:51,660
dogs.

1700
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:57,420
We also take checks and money orders to subgenius foundation.

1701
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,120
P.O.

1702
01:01:59,140 --> 01:01:59,900
Box 181417.

1703
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:00,880


1704
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:09,900
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1705
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:15,100
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1706
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,120
We'll see you next time.

1707
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1708
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1709
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1710
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1711
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1712
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1713
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1714
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1715
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1716
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1717
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1718
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1719
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1720
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1721
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1722
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1723
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1724
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1725
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1726
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1727
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1728
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1729
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1730
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1731
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1732
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120


1733
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,120
