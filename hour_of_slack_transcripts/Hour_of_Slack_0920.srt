1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
Now won't you dig, Daddy Slack, now won't you dig?

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,620
Now if you wanna hear some boogie that I'm gonna play

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,420
Now that it's just an opiator and a mega bass

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,980
Now the drummer man has it eight feet late

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,920
Now I guess you remember Slack and old B, B-Daddy Wayne

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,480
Mother selling chicken, fried and bacon, grease

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,100
Let us walk along Slack down the road of peace

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,240
Let's make you walk on down the road of peace, Slack

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,780
Don't step on my feet, man, you know that's gonna hurt

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,940
I'm sorry, Wayne, I didn't mean to

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,680
Be alright down the road of peace

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,080
Dig the space, this is crazy

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,720
Be alright down the road of peace

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,060
Watch the Snatch Space, man

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:12,040
Don't step on my feet, man, you know that's gonna hurt

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,740
I'm sorry, Wayne, I didn't mean to

17
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:12,840
Be alright down the road of peace, Slack

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:12,840


19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm sorry, Wayne, I didn't mean to

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,200
Be alright down the road of peace, Slack

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:58,440
Don't step on my feet, man, you know that's gonna hurt

22
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,520
Don't step on my feet, Slμο, don't pay for me

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,900
I'm sorry, Wayne, you know that's gonna hurt

24
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,960
I'm sorry, Wayne, you know that's gonna hurt

25
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,620
Go back on your feet, don't step on my feet

26
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,780
Swish away from me

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,200
There's no point in

28
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,040
Don't go up there, man, yeah, yeah, yeah, you said it

29
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,080
There's no point in

30
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,780
There's no point in

31
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,880
Egyptian stuff.

32
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,560
And he was talking about how he cried

33
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,340
the night back in

34
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,760
1977 or something like that

35
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,680
that the Grateful Dead

36
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,920
played at the pyramids.

37
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,060
They set up so many amplifiers

38
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,380
and when he was standing on the pyramids

39
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,200
while they were playing he said he could feel

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,120
the stones vibrating.

41
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,700
And you know, stuff inside

42
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,500
the place was probably crumbling

43
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,580
and everything. The secret chambers

44
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,620
were probably...

45
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,880
He said he cried.

46
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,140
It broke his heart so bad. The teenagers were out

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,460
just getting drunk in front of this sacred place.

48
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,960
You know.

49
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,840
Just drunk and

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,940
tripping and

51
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,640
a big party.

52
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,780
I guess sooner or later

53
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,740
the showbiz takes over

54
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,320
everything sacred and holy

55
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,740
and makes it drunken.

56
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,380
Like Michael Jackson's bedroom.

57
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,300
Yeah, I heard that some little kid

58
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,840
raped Michael Jackson.

59
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,940
Everyone it seems from the ordinary

60
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,700
Kuwaiti in the street to the sophisticated

61
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,240
planners in the Pentagon was taken by surprise

62
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,960
by Saddam Hussein's strike

63
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
at his tiny neighbor.

64
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,020
Brutal aggression launched last night

65
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,660
against Kuwait illustrates

66
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,760
my central thesis. The world remains

67
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,340
a dangerous place

68
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,640
with serious threats to

69
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,300
important U.S. interests.

70
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,500
President Bush

71
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
convened an emergency session of the security

72
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,760
committee.

73
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,700
The invasion was condemned.

74
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,900
Sanctions levied and Iraq's

75
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,540
assets frozen the following day.

76
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,680
Iraq was to suffer economic isolation

77
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,780
and intense hardship until

78
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,880
it relented. It was perhaps the most

79
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,560
complete blockade of a country

80
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,940
seen in recent times.

81
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,900
The U.S. State Department then sent a message

82
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,520
to the countries of the Arab League.

83
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,020
The West has done its duty

84
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,740
but the Arab nations are doing

85
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,920
nothing. If they do not take a firm

86
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,220
stand on the Kuwaiti affair

87
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,300
they can be sure that in the future

88
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,600
they will no longer be able to count on America.

89
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,800
With the world united, hopes were high

90
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,640
that the Security Council would now

91
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,200
be an effective force for peace.

92
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,720
Mr. President, this is a far more

93
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,620
important issue than simply the invasion

94
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,780
of Kuwait. This is in its own way

95
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,740
the first real test of this new world

96
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,320
order that we're trying to put together.

97
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,140
In the meantime,

98
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,000
resolutions flowed from the Security Council.

99
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:06,080
A blockade was sanctioned. Dependent on imported food, Iraq now faced starvation.

100
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,760
On September 4th, James Baker said that US gold now included the destruction of Iraq's military.

101
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,940
On September 15th, Dugan said targets would include...

102
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,900
What is unique about Iraqi culture? That they put very high value on. That psychologically would make an impact.

103
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,320
If push came to shove, the cutting edge would be downtown Baghdad.

104
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,980
If I want to hurt you, it would be at home, not out in the woods someplace.

105
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,280
Over 100,000 troops were now stationed in the Gulf, without congressional debate or authority.

106
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,020
And the build-up continued.

107
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:50,480
In the biggest operation since World War II, Western equipment and troops have been landing at the Saudi port of Jubail, less than 200 miles from Kuwait.

108
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:51,880
Question.

109
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,620
Questions were asked.

110
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,120
Why should the West defend a country which has no democracy?

111
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,920
When he was gassing his own Kurdish people, when he was invading Iran, where were all the clever politicians then?

112
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,340
And answers given.

113
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:11,640
The President stated reasons vary, from upholding international law, to protecting oil fields, putting down a new hip-hop...

114
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,420
I don't believe they are...

115
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,820
...improving regional security...

116
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,240
...their concern in the region is purely and simply...

117
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,880
Our jobs, our way of life, our own freedom...

118
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,740
...would all suffer if control of the world's great oil reserves fell into the hands...

119
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,420
We armed him, we fed him, we gave him his country...

120
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,780
...that one man, Saddam Hussein.

121
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,760
We made him what he is.

122
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,600
So it isn't oil that we're concerned about.

123
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,780
It is aggression.

124
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,660
It's all about hope.

125
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,340
Just wait.

126
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,680
I watch and learn.

127
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,680
It's the devils.

128
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,660
Devils and demons in the military.

129
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,820
All over again.

130
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,460
And why have they come to you, Stag?

131
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,660
Have you not considered your fate?

132
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,120
Because I am the one.

133
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:11,900
I am he who is foretold by the Oracle, and the Architect, and the Janitor, and the Toymaker...

134
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,920
He was foreskinned as chosen in the days of Santa and the Big Bombers.

135
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,900
He was told by the three wise guys.

136
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,880
He was...

137
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,840
He was released from his duties as one of the Herald Vipers.

138
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,240
I'm not exactly the one.

139
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,800
Bob is the one, but I'm one of the ones.

140
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,180
Are you one of the ones who merely witness, or are you one of the ones who merely pittish?

141
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,700
No, I'm one of the ones.

142
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,880
Just the one.

143
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,140
Wait.

144
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,940
What was that?

145
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,200
That was another one of them.

146
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,640
It's the necrotic eye again.

147
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,900
It's another one of them military demon things.

148
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,500
I can't believe that they would sign up with the...

149
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,540
A necrotic eye.

150
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,920
The minions of hell itself.

151
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,540
You understand?

152
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,660
I understand what it means.

153
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,060
Your eye is dying.

154
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,320
I mean, that seemed like something the Republicans would do, not the Democrats.

155
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,380
I am not in your head.

156
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,920
Failure to do so may result in prosecution for...

157
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,200
It's a myopic dream.

158
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,060
You have 15 seconds to comply.

159
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,480
It's everything you've never wished for.

160
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,540
You have 10 seconds to comply.

161
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,620
Get ready.

162
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,100
On dope?

163
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,480
It's everything you've never wished for.

164
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,260
You have 5 seconds to comply.

165
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
You have 4 seconds to be on...

166
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,540
On dope.

167
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,720
You have 3 seconds to spit.

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,640
You have 3 eyes.

169
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,320
You will become thick.

170
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,580
Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down.

171
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,900
We're like the bullies of the world right now.

172
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,320
You know that?

173
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,560
And the voice of the harpers shall be heard no more at all indeed.

174
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,940
Throwing the pistol at the sheep herder's feet.

175
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,920
And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all indeed.

176
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,760
Pick it up.

177
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,100
This is CBN.

178
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,580
This is PBS.

179
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,880
This is PBS.

180
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,400
This is ABC.

181
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,220
This is the National Broadcasting Company.

182
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,340
Good evening.

183
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,860
The United States of America is at War.

184
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,320
Esta vez se parlaba este radio.

185
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,580
Pick Up...

186
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,180
F mira estas canciones.

187
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,780
Estaba simple la muchísima votación iPad of flores tio pero이는 que tu no portrayós eloquemos de forma inhuman.

188
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,800
O mastra elHAHAHelloSaturburcomen.de.

189
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:13,800


190
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,580
No si si 넣or 적нд dayar elderkshowera de tacwéf questions that are not taken state orders.

191
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,780
Instead targets all over iraq would be obliterated.

192
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,140
Imagine Iraq like a human body.

193
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,640
What happens if you sever their spinal cord?

194
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,940
They can't function, right?

195
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,580
Tomahawk cruise missiles, F-14 Tomcats, devastating JP-233 bombs

196
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,020
targeted the most intense aerial bombardment the world has ever known.

197
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,740
American B-52s flying high above the reach of Iraqi fire.

198
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,500
The casualties on the Iraqi side will be extremely high.

199
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,240
Saddam Hussein must be seen to be the loser.

200
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,560
This was tremendous. Baghdad was lit up like a Christmas tree.

201
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,040
1,300 sorties so far.

202
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,580
The first airstrikes were probing, testing the efficiency of Baghdad's defenses.

203
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,160
On Friday, the tactics changed to heavy saturation bombing.

204
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:09,920
The first 24 hours consisted of more attacks than the entire number of targets

205
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,320
in the years 1942 and 1943 during the combined bomber offense in Europe.

206
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,620
Six minutes after the stealth bombers left,

207
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,240
the cruise missiles arrived.

208
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,220
Others dropped carbon filament to short the electrical grid system.

209
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,900
American, British and Saudi bombers and fighters from air bases and carriers

210
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,160
joined in a single concerted attack.

211
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,700
There's another wave of bombing just starting.

212
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,380
This is the first time anybody's seen a war like this.

213
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,240
Britain still hasn't formally declared war on Iraq.

214
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,500
Apparently the Foreign Office nowadays considers it a bit old-fashioned.

215
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,380
Mr. Ambassador, you have virtually the entire world community ranged against you.

216
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,560
It is an emergency.

217
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,000
It's an American game.

218
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,320
At this point, I'm not looking through my goggles and looking at the TV screen.

219
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,460
I gave the code word, get some.

220
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,440
Mr. Ambassador, we bid you good morning.

221
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:55,900
Get some.

222
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,260
AWACS planes, packed with computer equipment, helped control the battle.

223
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,340
I select my gun.

224
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,880
Iraqi soldiers ran through the crosshairs.

225
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,920
Vietnam is a ghostly state.

226
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,860
Gradually, they are being starved quite apart from the aerial bombardment.

227
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,520
Daybreak saw no letter.

228
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,520
New targets were sought out.

229
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,600
Some of those not destroyed overnight returned to you.

230
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Allied aircraft have now flown a total of 4,000 sorties.

231
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,860
Many people are dying at the moment, Mr. Ambassador.

232
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,760
Sixty-seven hit records have been banned by the BBC for reasons of sensitivity.

233
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:41,680
Phil Collins, In the Air Tonight, Boom Banger Bang by Lulu, and Cat Stevens, I'm Gonna Get Me a Gun.

234
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,640
Yet the record most requested by our boys in the Gulf is Barry Maguire's The New Destruction.

235
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:54,480
What we cannot be proud of, Mr. Speaker, is the unshaven, shaggy-haired, drunk culture,

236
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,480
poor excuses for Americans wearing their tiny, round, wire-rimmed glasses,

237
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:06,220
a protestor symbol of the Blame America First crowd out in front of the White House burning the American flag.

238
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,220
But the main development in the war is tonight's scut missile attack on Israel.

239
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,600
Saddam Hussein has now twice sent extremely dangerous weapons into the middle of a built-up war.

240
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,780
The most intense air attack since the Second World War.

241
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,120
The system dispenses hundreds of tiny bomblets.

242
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,840
Allied planes have flown over 8,000 sources.

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The attacks on Baghdad, Tikrit, Samarra, Nasiriyah, and Basra.

244
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,800
The electricity got off everywhere in the whole city.

245
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,560
There was no water, no telephone, no communications for anybody.

246
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,360
Military briefings have emphasized the threat still posed by Iraq's scum missiles.

247
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,600
The

248
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,820
Yes.

249
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:56,580
Yes.

250
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,160


251
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,160


252
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:58,380


253
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,760
Yes.

254
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:11,980
Yes.

255
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,760
They did.

256
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,060
They caught me with their machenst

257
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,280
The Mesmeris.

258
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,900
Yes.

259
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,840
It's an experiment.

260
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,620
They love us there.

261
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,200
And we're in on it.

262
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,000
Yes, deep in the heart of the Pentagon in the basement building.

263
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,140
There are thousands of resources.

264
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,700
I thought that was against, like, you know, Occupation 101 rule that, you know.

265
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,100
I thought you learned that in Occupation 101 that you don't do it alone.

266
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,620
They're breaking the rules of occupation throughout the world.

267
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,840
They just, that's what they're doing.

268
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,820
They have been doing it since day one.

269
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,600
It's our 51st state now.

270
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,260
Iraq is now our 51st state.

271
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:03,760
They're getting the quick.

272
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,360
New Texas.

273
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,400
Yee-haw!

274
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,620
Our 52nd state.

275
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,480
Actually, Canada is our 51st state.

276
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,580
Getting plenty of money.

277
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:10,920
Pussies.

278
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,520
The equivalent of some larger states.

279
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,620
They're getting an aid in divestments.

280
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,820
You should have heard Cheney spouting his bullshit today.

281
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,760
He was saying that Iraq is going to have the second strongest coalition force.

282
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,200
And pretty soon, they're going to outnumber the U.S. soldiers.

283
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,820
Isn't that kind of like the NVA in the South Vietnamese situation?

284
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,900
They're doing it all according to plan.

285
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,820
They're purposely doing another Vietnam.

286
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:40,640
They think, well, let's not change horses since actually Bush is a flying monkey and not an equestrian.

287
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,000
The End

288
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,800
200,000 people killed in an industrial accident in India.

289
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,600
With a mother.

290
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,920
Total mother.

291
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,500
Hurricane killed 25 in Florida.

292
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,520
With a mother.

293
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,280
A real damn mother.

294
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,920
Mine from San Bernardino.

295
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,680
But it hurt.

296
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,760
It was a mother.

297
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,300
T-S-E-A-V mother.

298
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,940
There's some facts to go down.

299
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,700
Uh, shit going down.

300
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,220
150,000 people killed in an earthquake in Mexico City.

301
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,260
It was a bummer.

302
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,820
A real bummer.

303
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,720
It's a total fucking big ass bummer, man.

304
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,300
It's a total fucking big ass bummer, man.

305
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,880
It's a total fucking big ass bummer, man.

306
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,580
My mouth got run over.

307
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,580
Bummer.

308
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:37,940
Bummer.

309
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,280
P-A-B.

310
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,280
Bummer.

311
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,760
Garbage is getting purely for feeding the garbage out.

312
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,540
Bummer.

313
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,360
It's the bummer.

314
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,600
80,000 people died in the North Wing of China.

315
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,580
Bummer.

316
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:58,820
Bummer.

317
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,240
Bummer.

318
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:00,680
Bummer.

319
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,100
Bummer.

320
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,680
Bummer.

321
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,660
Bummer.

322
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:02,660


323
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:02,660


324
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,420
It's the bummer.

325
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,360
Bummer.

326
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,960
There was a guy in California that couldn't get his nut one night.

327
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,440
Bummer.

328
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,360
Bummer.

329
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,100
Total fucking bummer.

330
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,920
The guy in California was with his best girlfriend and he didn't get his nut.

331
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,340
Bummer.

332
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:20,660
Bummer.

333
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,980
Real bummer.

334
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,680
I burned my finger the other day.

335
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,040
Bummer.

336
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,360
Bummer.

337
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,160
Bummer.

338
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,840
What's the difference?

339
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,580
B trophy, huh?

340
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:42,580


341
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,900
Anyway, you're known in the world forнаutica drug.

342
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:52,500
every contrite chicken patty is adarso

343
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:58,420
You're a berman given these movies that pop on their head.

344
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,340
All the talking is random.

345
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:00,340


346
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:00,340


347
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:00,400
I give you one.

348
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,220
P Ultimately, I was we have a neighbor named

349
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,780
So what about you?

350
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,760
It's possible.

351
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,000
Real bummer!

352
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,100
TNT, TNT!

353
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,460
You know about the bad ass noise?

354
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,040
My insurance rates just went up!

355
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,740
Bummer!

356
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,860
And right after that, the news came on.

357
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,000
And they started rah-rah-ing about, you know,

358
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,480
all these soldiers who were all staging to leave tomorrow,

359
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,360
to go back up to soldiers.

360
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,080
And they're showing patriotic, you know,

361
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,460
and they're going to save our country from the evil demons,

362
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,920
and stuff like that.

363
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,880
I mean, I swear to God.

364
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,540
What, at war with demons now?

365
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,600
And it's like, you know.

366
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,000
See, I thought I was the only one.

367
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,840
Bottomless budget for that, man.

368
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,100
You know, for fighting demons.

369
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,740
So it's still, you know, wait till they start, you know.

370
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,300
We need millions and billions and billions of dollars to fight them.

371
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,000
There's a three to six to seven, three to seven deaths.

372
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,340
Africa.

373
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,280
Average of up to one death per day.

374
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,620
Well, it's a little bit more than that now.

375
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,960
That's got to be bumming somebody out over there.

376
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,640
Because there's like days with three to seven, you know.

377
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,140
Well, there's whole days to go by when nobody dies.

378
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,560
Maybe somebody loses a couple of legs.

379
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,040
Yeah.

380
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,960
A couple blind guys.

381
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,620
Three, four arms.

382
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,940
I mean, who cares about that?

383
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,580
They'll come back.

384
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,100
What the hell are we doing there?

385
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,240
They'll get their handicraft thing.

386
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,880
What the hell are we even doing there?

387
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,760
Yes, it's quite disturbing.

388
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,020
If you're easily disturbed.

389
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,460
Buying cheap oil for the next...

390
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,800
For the next 20 years, I think, was the original basic idea.

391
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,140
It ain't cheap.

392
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,800
Go cheap.

393
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,580
Well, it's cheap.

394
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,480
It's blood.

395
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,680
I mean, what did it cost?

396
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,000
It cost some blood, okay?

397
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,640
Oil is blood.

398
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,160
Blood, oil.

399
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,920
The blood of ancient, ancient reptiles.

400
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,680
Squished between tiny fossilized pieces of limestone and sandstone.

401
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,700
Selling us out.

402
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,640
Enough to brew in its own goo-goo for millions and millions.

403
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,760
Selling us out.

404
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,580
Millions and millions.

405
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,440
Right in front of our eyes.

406
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,260
They're just going to sell us out right there.

407
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,540
And tell us about it, Eric.

408
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,420
And so now...

409
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,700
This is the way it's happening.

410
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,480
George Goblin now can give away his own guys.

411
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,680
You know, he can report on CIA people.

412
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,900
Oh, yeah, well, you know...

413
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,140
Oh, that's a real good one.

414
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:13,840
Yeah.

415
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,100
That's a real good one.

416
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,220
She's a CIA agent.

417
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,060
Go ahead.

418
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,100
The secret CIA leak.

419
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,440
How could any...

420
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
That's going to be good.

421
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,140
That's like God coming in with his finger.

422
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,560
Right here.

423
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,060
Oh, George.

424
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,340
Here's George and Cheney.

425
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,520
Don't know what you're doing.

426
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,220
Here's George and Cheney concocting things in the White House Oval Office.

427
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,500
Well, Mr. President, I remember when President Nixon and I got down on our knees and prayed.

428
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,120
Maybe this is the time to pray.

429
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,840
Oh, Lord.

430
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,960
Oh, Satan.

431
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,120
Oh, great Shaitan.

432
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,700
Oh, great eye of the evil...

433
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,220
Here comes the finger of Nixon.

434
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,740
Shai-Halut.

435
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,060
The finger of Nixon is about ready to come down upon me.

436
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,300
Yeah, just when everything looks really good.

437
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,920
Oh, don't worry about it, Henry.

438
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,200
Everything's going to work out.

439
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,220
Just trust in God.

440
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,460
Believe in the great...

441
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,220
Great, great, great spirit.

442
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,460
Just like Chief Honolung taught us back in the old days in Peabody.

443
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,120
You remember those, Henry?

444
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,200
I mean, Henry.

445
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,980
I mean, what's your name again?

446
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,000
Henry.

447
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,040
All right, the way we're going, we should be able to steal a few more elections.

448
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,400
Yeah.

449
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,420
I could have played organ with Grand Funk Railroad.

450
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,480
But it would be wrong.

451
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,100
Yeah, that was a great poster.

452
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,220
Remember the poster of Nixon?

453
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,240
Yeah, the poster of Nixon.

454
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,400
He was with Iron Butterfly for a short time.

455
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,960
For a short time.

456
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,480
But he actually did try...

457
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,440
He did audition for Grand Funk.

458
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,100
And they did some promo shots of him and everything.

459
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,000
And he was on Laugh-In.

460
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,540
And they did the one where he was like, you know...

461
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,340
Him and Nico.

462
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,140
He's like this way, looking this way, under the closer to home one, you know?

463
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,660
And he's like...

464
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,860
But, you know, there, he's always with the, you know, the peace sign up, the other word,

465
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,360
victory sign.

466
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,400
Yeah, nobody really knows about the underground tapes of him with the velvet underground.

467
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,640
Yeah.

468
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,800
Well, you know...

469
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,340
There's the finger of Nixon.

470
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,020
He was tortured then, you know?

471
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,060
But that makes great art, you know?

472
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,980
Oh, George W.

473
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,940
I've been walking around the boys' site for a long time now.

474
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,240
Nothing but bad kids everywhere.

475
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,900
I've been a waiter and a cab driver.

476
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,420
I've played a few places here and there in the lower village, but nobody wants to hear my stuff.

477
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,040
They all called me a dick.

478
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,960
They say there's something strange about my voice.

479
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,840
What is it, Henry?

480
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,400
Henry, they don't like my voice.

481
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,760
How about the way I talk?

482
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,620
I'm not a dick!

483
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,460
I'll bring you a news bulletin.

484
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,900
The express train from Monterey has been derailed outside of Mexico City.

485
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,360
Early reports indicate an appalling loss of weight.

486
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,660
There are eyewitness accounts which state that monster scorpions have swarmed around the wreckage,

487
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,680
creating havoc.

488
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,380
I don't know.

489
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,820
I don't know.

490
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:01,820


491
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:01,820


492
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:01,820


493
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:01,820


494
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:01,820


495
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:01,820


496
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:01,820


497
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,240
Time is running out for the planet Earth.

498
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,760
You don't expect me to believe that, do you?

499
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,560
Once again, Mr. President,

500
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,000
I have made the United Provinces of America

501
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,540
the greatest power in the known universe.

502
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,440
The forces of good are sworn in.

503
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,400
And I repeat, they must be exterminated.

504
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,300
And I mean lethally.

505
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,940
Your race has no women.

506
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,220
It can't have children.

507
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,140
It will die out.

508
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:30,040
It can't have children.

509
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,720
It can't have children.

510
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,780
Yes, dear friends.

511
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,840
DJ, Reverend Dr. Imam did that.

512
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,460
That was actually a clipped up part of the soundtrack

513
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:12,080
of Reverend Abdul Smithy's incredible video

514
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,000
called Osama's Video Fatwa.

515
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,360
If you ever get a chance to see Osama's Video Fatwa,

516
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,800
well, I will help you to try to get a chance to see that.

517
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,820
Hey, friends, welcome to Hour of Slack number nine.

518
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
Nine hundred and twenty.

519
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Kind of a war-ish show tonight.

520
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,900
Because, well, we talked about that a lot over the months

521
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,340
on ESO Swamp Radio.

522
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,500
So there are lots of edits of that

523
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,280
that I kind of gathered together.

524
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,940
Earlier, friends, we heard that song

525
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,160
Total Badass Bummer

526
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,620
by the Swingin' Love Corpses

527
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,800
who are also heard in the background.

528
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,820
And our new title,

529
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,400
played at the very beginning,

530
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,340
was Dig Daddy Slack

531
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,020
by Madman Taylor.

532
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,060
Thanks to New Monet for posting it.

533
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,720
And we'll hear some

534
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,460
lemur cut-ups

535
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,240
throughout this show.

536
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,180
But what you're wondering is

537
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,560
those collages

538
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,440
of Gulf War history.

539
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,460
All that Gulf War stuff.

540
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,120
What the hell was that?

541
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,560
Well, the first stretch of it

542
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,820
was by the

543
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,640
by Soma.

544
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,080
And the second was by Pansonic.

545
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,820
And cut up a bit by me.

546
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,760
And those are from a deconstruction

547
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,540
of the Gulf War.

548
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,780
Sort of a history CD

549
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,960
mixed by various people

550
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,400
like Apex Twin and such like.

551
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,360
There's a collection called

552
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,780
The Fire This Time.

553
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,000
And for copies of that

554
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,360
and more information about it

555
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,040
you can check out

www.firethistime.org

560
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,420
That's fire this time

one word dot org

562
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,340
educational and frightening

563
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,080
like the church of the subgenius itself.

564
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,360
And you want to know

565
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,740
what it's about.

566
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,200
But it,

567
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,300
what it,

568
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,940
what the church wants to know from you

569
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,400
is this.

570
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,980
You a backdoor beauty?

571
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,480
You like it from behind?

572
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,080
Ha ha ha.

573
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:30,700
Ha ha ha.

574
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,380
Ha ha ha.

575
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:31,700
Ha ha ha.

576
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:31,800


577
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:31,800


578
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:31,800


579
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:31,800


580
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:31,800


581
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:31,800


582
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:31,800


583
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:31,800


584
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:31,800


585
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:31,800


586
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:31,800


587
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,620
What from behind?

588
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,360
Our politics?

589
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,340
Our preternatural existence?

590
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,420
Come on, Legume.

591
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,380
You're asking a woman

592
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,840
an anti-sexual question.

593
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,600
It's almost like having

594
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,620
a big man back.

595
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,720
Do I like things from behind?

596
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,880
How about from the behind

597
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,520
of our backs

598
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,660
the way we were snuck up to

599
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,480
on 9-11?

600
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,600
And literally

601
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,680
gripping the hands

602
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,540
out of the back.

603
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:50,900
That's right.

604
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,340
They poked America's

605
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,020
fudge tunnel.

606
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,420
America's fudge tunnel

607
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,300
woke up that day.

608
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,460
America's fudge tunnel

609
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:57,980
in crisis.

610
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,880
Very clearly.

611
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,340
And it went back to sleep.

612
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,840
Ta da ta.

613
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,860
jaz totalmente

614
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,120
en skincare bar

615
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:15,340
Y'all here for me?

616
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,960
Good morning,

617
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,800
Judgement morning, you better get ready

618
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,740
Judgement, my God, it's coming down

619
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,420
The gambler, the drunkard, the liar

620
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,500
And that I doubt to rest too

621
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,640
Well, all these false pretenders

622
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,420
And all them hypocrites too

623
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,060
Better get ready for judgment

624
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,660
You better get ready for judgment morning

625
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,360
You better get ready for judgment

626
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,180
My God, it's coming down

627
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,440
The best ever, new, better, faster, easier

628
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,840
Click, exit, fast, new features, so easy

629
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,200
New

630
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,360
Statistics and figures, mid-force, they're on me

631
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,760
L.A. watch CNN on my TV

632
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,680
You give me information, but where is the truth?

633
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,760
Sitting there, hiding behind designer suits

634
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,560
How can you sit there and tell me this?

635
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,040
Without a movement of your eyes

636
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,340
How can you sit there and smile on your face?

637
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,500
Will you show us my destruction of the human race?

638
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,380
Day after day, you show us the pain

639
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,260
How many mores have you had to ignore?

640
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,180
Just sit there

641
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,060
Just sit there

642
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,440
The films that wouldn't show to me

643
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,320
I didn't cry on my TV

644
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,260
You show me the world 24 hours a day

645
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,240
But it seems so unreal, cause it's so far away

646
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,340
How can you sit there and smile on your face?

647
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,040
Will you sit there and tell me this?

648
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,660
Without a movement of your eyes

649
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,220
How can you sit there and smile on your face?

650
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,080
Will you show us my destruction of the human race?

651
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,900
Day after day, you show us the pain

652
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,160
I've been free from it for corporate gain

653
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,740
Just sit there

654
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,960
Just sit there

655
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,300
You drag me in the face

656
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,260
Don't trouble me with the grief

657
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,320
That Assembly-to-WeWork Foundation

658
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,320


659
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,320


660
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,660
Without a movement of your eyes

661
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,360
I can't believe this

662
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:20,360


663
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,160
How can you sit there and smile on your face?

664
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,760
Out of your comfort to believe

665
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:22,760


666
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,920
Will this até a Yaroslavむ house falls?

667
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:23,920


668
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:23,920


669
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:23,920


670
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,260
Are you trying to convince your whiskersеры

671
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:24,420
Realize that the end of light would be anything but hell

672
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,080
Could there be a better battery to theовой

673
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,080


674
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,080


675
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,080


676
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,080


677
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,080


678
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,080


679
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,080


680
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,080


681
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,600
C.D. Truth.

682
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:32,200
C.D. Truth, friends, from their album Chemically Dependent.

683
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:39,460
And you can find more of them at www.cdtruth.com.

684
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,640
One word, cdtruth.com.

685
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,780
Also, you can reach them at, got that tape recorder running,

686
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:56,920
610 Phillip Avenue, Akron, Ohio, 44305.

687
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:01,480
And before that song, we heard the Lemur News,

688
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:10,140
and that song, Judgment Morning, or whatever, by Sister Mary Nelson.

689
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,580
But seriously, is this church of the subgenius serious?

690
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,300
Friends?

691
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,140
We're serious about fine Malaysian cooking.

692
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,160
Yep, I'm talking about Dobstown Restaurant.

693
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,200
When was the last time you had you a big steaming hot bowl of Dobstown brand monkey brains?

694
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,800
Speaking of frying monkeys, what is George W. doing again?

695
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,000
I'll take mine.

696
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,340
Fuck.

697
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,000
You said the FCC.

698
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,780
I'm hiding, man.

699
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,060
I'm getting down in the back.

700
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,540
I'm getting my cellar ready.

701
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,760
I mean, I've never seen anybody who looks more like one of the flying monkeys.

702
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:51,580
And yet folks continue to believe his lacrimonious, evil, spiteful talk.

703
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,200
I don't even know if anybody believes it anymore, though, either.

704
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,000
I don't think they do.

705
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,200
I don't think anybody does.

706
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,940
But the witch has everyone under their spell.

707
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,400
Yeah, but the witch has everybody under the spell.

708
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,040
And they'll do whatever the monkey says.

709
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,780
But who is the witch?

710
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,220
Who is the witch that's keeping the monkey?

711
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,200
Laura is the head of the Grand Cabal and Coven.

712
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,020
Oh, yeah.

713
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,480
Yes, she's cany.

714
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,580
A lot of people think that it's like, you know, old lady bush and all this stuff like that.

715
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,140
But no, it is.

716
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,900
I like how Chaney sits behind Bush when he speaks in the chamber like that.

717
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,020
And it's kind of he's got that cockeyed mouth thing going on.

718
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,760
I can't tell the guys that I'm wrong.

719
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,500
Say the right thing, monkey.

720
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,240
Tom and I are down.

721
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,920
There's some creature with its arm all the way up George's butt, working his jaws like a puppeteer.

722
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,940
He is an Augustus.

723
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:43,300
He's a sock puppet for some thing with an arm longer than his torso.

724
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,980
He's one of those red hankies.

725
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,140
And guys, it is later.

726
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,880
What does this remind you guys of?

727
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,060
This sound coming in here right now.

728
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,260
And you think.

729
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,360
In the 30s, it was so easy to make a bunch of po-bucker idiots think the world was really ending.

730
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,920
Now the world really is ending.

731
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,860
And nobody believes it.

732
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,360
Brilliant people to swallow.

733
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:07,820
Yeah.

734
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:13,600
I mean, they're sitting there in a chair that's duplicating itself and then evacuating itself at the same time.

735
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,280
They're dying in these chairs.

736
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,080
You know, strapped up the way they are.

737
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,260
And they think it's, you know, a Christmas party or something.

738
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,560
And meanwhile, they bayoneted Santa Claus to death somewhere near Baghdad.

739
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,300
It's like the world is ending and they vote for it to keep ending.

740
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,840
That was in Black Hawk Down.

741
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,120
I saw that movie.

742
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,720
Where they bayoneted Santa Claus.

743
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,340
And then there goes your leg.

744
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,320
There goes the top of your head.

745
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,440
Ah, war.

746
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,520
War is good.

747
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,420
War is good.

748
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,820
War is my favorite flavor.

749
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,920
And it's Bush's flavor of the week.

750
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,220
War.

751
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,420
You know.

752
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:49,900
War.

753
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,760
Coming and going idea that he can entrap people with.

754
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,300
Capture their imagination.

755
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,180
Well, he doesn't want to be looked at as one of those terrible presidents like Carter.

756
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,520
He should wear those weird like white knee stockings when he's do that and wave the flag and go,

757
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,600
Hurrah for the money, blue flag with a star.

758
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,260
Hurrah.

759
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,740
He dreamed I was on the top of an aircraft carrier.

760
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,760
And it looked like them guys in The Wizard of Oz go,

761
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,540
Oh, Rio.

762
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:14,900
Leo.

763
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,580
Leo.

764
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,160
Leo.

765
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,220
And all these flying monkeys were coming down.

766
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,540
Oh, Leo.

767
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,580
And I looked at them.

768
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,500
Oh, Leo.

769
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:20,600
Oh, Leo.

770
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:20,720
Oh, Leo.

771
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,880
The flying, head flying monkey was George W. Bush.

772
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,560
Oh, Leo.

773
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,420
And right behind him was Dick Call Me Richie Chaney.

774
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,980
And, oh, shit.

775
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,520
War is good.

776
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,400
War is good.

777
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,140
War is good.

778
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,400
War is good.

779
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,520
War is good.

780
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:44,900
War is good.

781
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
War-ooo-oo.

782
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,880
Money can cost the brain!

783
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,600
Fighting in Asia, fighting in France, fighting for my face.

784
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,100
War is good for large invaders, it makes the elephants cry.

785
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,900
War is good for man and baby, it makes things die.

786
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,160
War is good.

787
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,980
War is good.

788
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,860
War is good.

789
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,700
War is good.

790
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,300
War is good.

791
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,700
War is good, it makes the angels and the babies cry.

792
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,300
It's good to control the population, it makes the people die.

793
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,000
War is good around the world, fighting here and there

794
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,960
Fill the streets with blood because we're gonna win the general war

795
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:28,700
War is good, war is good, war is good, war is good

796
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,060
If I had a dime or dollar for all the things they said

797
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,520
Trying to get me back around and put me back in bed

798
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,040
My eyes are closed, my ears open, I cannot see a thing

799
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,820
But war is good for everyone, it's good for living things

800
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:50,720
War is good, war is good, war is good, war is good

801
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,720
Love it!

802
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,920
War is good, war is good

803
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,540
War is good, war is good, war is good

804
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:57,180
War is good, war is good, war is good War can make the angels sing and legal the audience sigh

805
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,540
War is good for plastic people and their other kin

806
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,460
War can tell you the time of day, war will do you win

807
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:09,680
War is good, war is good, war is good, war is good

808
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,020
War is good, war is good, war is a deal

809
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,020


810
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,020


811
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,300
War is good

812
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,120
Don't call me gringo you fucking viner

813
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,500
Stay on your side of the goddamn river

814
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,960
Don't call me gringo you viner

815
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,120
No me digas viner mister puñetero

816
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,600
Te sacare un susto por raciste culero

817
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,040
No me llames frijolero

818
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,160
Pinche gringo puñetero

819
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,060
Check out

820
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,860
Now I wish I had a dime

821
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,920
For every single time I've gotten stared down

822
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,600
For being in the wrong side of town

823
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,020
In a rich man I'd be if I had that kind of chips

824
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,460
Lately I wanna smack the mouths of these racists

825
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,540
Podrás imaginarte desde afuera

826
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,000
Ser un mexicano cruzando la frontera

827
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,420
Pensando tu familia mientras que pasas

828
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,940
Dejando todo lo que tu conoces atrás

829
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,480
Tuvieras tu que esquivar las balas

830
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,020
Desde el fondo de la tierra

831
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,900
De unos cuantos gringos rancheros

832
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,280
Les seguirás diciendo good for nothing

833
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,940
We're back si tuvieras tu que empezar de cero

834
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,360
Now why don't you look down

835
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,700
At where your feet is planted

836
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,280
That US soil that makes you take shit for granted

837
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,520
If not for Santa Ana just to let you know

838
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,960
That where your feet are planted

839
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,200
Would be Mexico, correcto!

840
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,540
Don't call me gringo you fucking viner

841
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,940
Stay on your side of the goddamn river

842
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,380
Don't call me gringo you viner

843
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,020
No me digas viner mister puñetero

844
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,020
Te sacaré un susto por racista y culero

845
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,000
No me llames frijolero

846
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,580
Pinche gringo puñetero

847
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,120
Molotov!

848
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,700
Very shortened

849
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,380
And before that, War is Good

850
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,700
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

851
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,500
Live at the Beachland D-Vival in Cleveland last month

852
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,240
With Bob and Chaz and Backup Babes

853
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,080
Reverend Cinzia and Princess Wee

854
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,060
And you know friends

855
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,620
In this day

856
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,500
Which isn't to be confused with the day

857
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,140
Today these days there's a law against not only behavior

858
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:20,540
But actually individualized laws against individuals

859
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,020
For instance what's the law against you and Ashtabula

860
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,520
I would think that there's somewhere there's a you know

861
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,040
Thou shalt not on the streets of Ashtabula do

862
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,680
Foul smells are strange

863
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,060
Apocalyptic improvisational

864
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,760
Nothing above 250

865
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,700
50 decibels

866
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,340
And spouting

867
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,080
And not only has it been passed recently in law

868
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,620
I guess they want to get it on the state books

869
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,660
Which I don't know if it's a real law

870
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,480
I think it's just some book about a state of consciousness

871
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,040
None of us have ever had

872
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,500
You know what I'm saying

873
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,920
You can get arrested for drinking while thinking in some places

874
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,880
Yep

875
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,200
Branchwater, Texas

876
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,400
Isn't that your original hometown?

877
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:00,960
Dead Branch

878
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,820
Dead Branch

879
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,400
Dead Branch, Texas

880
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,940
Yep where the water was

881
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,560
The fish are floating straight up and down

882
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,700
Little X's on their eyes

883
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,280
We like it all dry and rough there

884
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,380
Well three I's and three X's

885
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:18,980
Yep the possums got a drooly cake and they got problems with their hoosh

886
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,940
Drooly cake

887
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:26,600
We use possums as the same way that you city folks use toilet paper

888
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,980
Now what's the difference between an armadillo and a possum down there

889
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,480
You got both

890
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,180
That's quite a difference

891
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,500
The armadillo of course is rough and harsh

892
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,960
Kind of like Tina Turner right

893
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,140
Smooth inside

894
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:44,840
Although possums will and they play pop they go limp on you see

895
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,020
Yes it's disgusting to see

896
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,220
You don't have to and they clean themselves

897
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,880
Yes

898
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,140
So you don't have to kill them

899
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,760
You'll stand back to back when I give the signal

900
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,140
You'll each walk forward fifteen paces turn and fire

901
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,860
Is that clear?

902
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,420
You ready mister?

903
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,000
Ready

904
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,900
Alright let's go

905
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:30,780
Ready

906
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,520
One

907
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:32,560
Three

908
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,480
Five

909
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:34,620
Seven

910
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:35,680
Thirteen

911
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:36,660
Hold it

912
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,700
There's something I have to tell you

913
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,080
Killing a man is good son

914
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,120
You know that

915
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:43,820
Yes sir

916
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,220
When you kill a man you kill a little bit of your dinner

917
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,200
I've never heard it said better

918
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,520
What is it?

919
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,440
This is a very arrogant apology

920
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,120
Well I might be old fashioned to say this but uh

921
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,780
That kind of Johnny

922
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,560
I'm going back to being proud of America

923
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,180
Come on use your intelligence

924
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,660
You know that the United States is based on the big lie

925
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:14,260
And if I didn't live in a country where there's planes that roll around

926
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,120
Golly

927
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,260
And if I didn't live in a country where there's planes that roll around

928
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:18,860
Golly

929
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,640
That is the American capitalistic system

930
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,500
Will it be tragedy?

931
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:25,880
Or hope?

932
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,560
Baby Janet's too young to understand the big dick

933
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,740
Now why should a normally decent, normally intelligent young person like John Smith

934
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,080
Choose the road to communism over America and freedom?

935
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,960
He's a victim of irresponsible tactics

936
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,680
He has missed the stabilizing influence of a good home and religious upbringing

937
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,820
Yet somewhere along the way he chose the road to Anarchy and freedom

938
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,180
That night I'd see dick

939
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,200
That night I'd see dick

940
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,860
It is true there are three things

941
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,040
Wrong in this country

942
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,580
It is true there are things wrong in this country

943
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,740
Come on use your intelligence

944
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,280
You know that the United States is based on the

945
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,820
Loose morals and wanton destruction

946
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,300
I hate it

947
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,000
Let's all think real hard

948
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,240
And if I didn't live in a country where there's planes that roll around

949
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,100
Golly

950
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,260
And if I didn't live in a country where there's planes that roll around

951
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,140
Golly

952
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,200
And if I didn't live in a country where there's planes that roll around

953
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,060
Golly

954
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,240
And if I didn't live in a country where there's planes that roll around

955
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,160
Golly

956
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,040
Let's all think real hard

957
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,980
Let's all think real hard

958
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,140
Let's all think real hard

959
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:33,760
Whether it be tragedy

960
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,380
Whether it be tragedy

961
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,060
Or hope

962
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,500
Or hope

963
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,320
Reverend Norell Preff did that

964
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,060
Called Golly

Before that, The Duel by Lee Murr

967
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,380
Incidentally, Lee Murr has had a rough time lately friends

968
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,140
And you can email me, stang at subgenius.com

969
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,260
If you want to help

970
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,000
An old subgenius doctor out

971
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,260
Who is Lee Murr, you ask

972
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,100
Well you might as well ask who are you

973
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,800
And who is this guy

974
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,480
I'm an enormous erect phobos

975
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,040
Ready to strike your country with instant hate and venom

976
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:16,100
And plenty of nucleus, nucleus, nucleus weapons

977
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,120
You've almost got it right

978
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,660
Nucleus

979
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,460
Nucleus

980
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,260
Nuclear

981
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,340
Nucleus weapons

982
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,060
So I wonder what all those nuclear weapons are

983
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:29,760
And what the rat wingers think about their pill-popping fatty radio boy now

984
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,160
But how long have you been talking about this for the last long

985
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,580
Another friend of mine was pointing out

986
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,800
How come with Arnold Schwarzenegger

987
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,180
Womanizing

988
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,380
I'm sorry, I didn't do it

989
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:42,580
But it wasn't the wrong thing to do at the time

990
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,340
You know what the tabloids say

991
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,480
I apologize for not doing it

992
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,780
But somehow when Clinton does it

993
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,760
Then it's terrible

994
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,260
It's unthinkable

995
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:52,520
For a

996
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,100
Why can't an Austrian get away with

997
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,520
Popping a feel

998
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,520
And an Arkansanian can't

999
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,020
He doesn't have an Ava Brown

1000
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,180
And a little Shotzi Dog

1001
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,820
The better story is he has not a little shotzi dog in this country

1002
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,300
That's why

1003
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,220
Every Austrian needs a little Shotzi Dog

1004
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,260
And a little Ava Brown to fondle

1005
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,820
The better story is he has one ounce of experience for the job

1006
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,260
But they're willing to stick the guy in there

1007
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,900
I've got a good idea

1008
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,440
Oh no, a movie star becoming governor

1009
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,920
That guy owes me bacon, I'm sorry

1010
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,280
California?

1011
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,800
A movie star?

1012
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,820
Governor of California?

1013
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,140
That's not so bad

1014
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:27,600
What can a movie star governor of California do?

1015
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,120
Well my first act would be

1016
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,920
To have the state legislature make California Uber Alice

1017
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,580
The state song

1018
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,740
I'm sorry

1019
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,640
I wonder what Reagan thinks of all this

1020
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:38,980
Yeah

1021
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,100
Yeah

1022
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,820
He said

1023
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:06,560
For the good of the power Stirring the cousins

1024
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:12,240
And for Nelson what you think of

1025
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,620
I'm probably going with

1026
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:14,620


1027
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,740
That what chakra into the

1028
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:15,740


1029
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,540
From those two

1030
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:17,760
God

1031
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,120
I am holding the battlefield for my Lord.

1032
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,980
I am holding the battlefield for my Lord.

1033
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:31,480
I come to obey the heavens and my God.

1034
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,320
I am holding the battlefield for my Lord.

1035
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:43,420
Thank you for realizing that war is good and the world is a monster club.

1036
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:47,600
And each and every one of you must reflect that individual monsterhood

1037
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,120
and ah, fuck this shit.

1038
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:57,500
I'd like to salute the flag to which we all swear a republic

1039
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,720
to the United States of America.

1040
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,420
The flag known as Ogori.

1041
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:27,040
Well, I'm proud to salute Ogori.

1042
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,160
Ogori.

1043
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,520
And the colors for which she stands.

1044
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,560
She stands.

1045
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,860
Red for the blood.

1046
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,820
Pew, pew, pew.

1047
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,120
White for the guts.

1048
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,400
Pew, pew, pew.

1049
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,340
Blue for the blue body.

1050
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:42,860
Bye.

1051
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:43,940
This.

1052
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,320
And I'm proud.

1053
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,800
To tell the story.

1054
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,840
The story.

1055
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,960
Of the United States of oil.

1056
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,520
Of the United States of oil.

1057
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,140
They come and take.

1058
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,300
The brain's gonna break.

1059
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,420
Turn and live the song.

1060
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,700
The story of the world.

1061
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:12,760
The story of the world.

1062
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,740
Well, I'm proud to salute Ogori.

1063
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:17,900
Ogori.

1064
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,660
Oh, Ogori.

1065
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:21,820
And the colors for which she stands.

1066
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:22,380
She stands.

1067
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,800
Red for the blood.

1068
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,260
She stands.

1069
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,900
White for the guts.

1070
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,360
She stands.

1071
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,380
Blue for the blue body.

1072
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:29,920
Bye.

1073
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:30,940
Yep.

1074
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,240
And I'm proud to tell the story.

1075
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,180
Story.

1076
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,260
Oh, freedom and financial gain.

1077
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,120
Cha-ching.

1078
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,240
Free to Carlisle.

1079
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:43,740
Cha-ching.

1080
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,240
Free to Bechtel.

1081
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:45,700
Cha-ching.

1082
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,440
Free to Halloween.

1083
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:47,580
Cha-ching.

1084
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:47,580


1085
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:47,580


1086
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:47,580


1087
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:47,580


1088
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:47,580


1089
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:47,580


1090
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:47,580


1091
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,120
Cha-ching.

1092
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:49,700
Cha-ching.

1093
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:51,640
Free to Halloween.

1094
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:51,880
Hey, hi.

1095
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:52,380
Hey, hi.

1096
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,000
Well, Mama.

1097
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,740
I'm comin' back to Airf Mistress Air Force Base.

1098
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,400
Dressed in a brand new white suit.

1099
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,140
They done some work on me.

1100
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,880
But I think I'm gonna be alright.

1101
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,120
Planes keep comin' in.

1102
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,800
coming in every day.

1103
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,000
Well, Mama, I ain't got no arms or legs.

1104
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,940
I just got studs.

1105
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,660
But that's good,

1106
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,360
because I got a new job in the polling alley.

1107
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,220
I'm going to work there every day.

1108
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,480
I'm going to sell off my car

1109
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,540
and sell off the house and the bar.

1110
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,560
So I'm proud to salute old Dory

1111
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,420
and the colors for which she sang.

1112
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,340
Red for the blood,

1113
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,260
white for the guts,

1114
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,140
blue for the blue-bodied fight.

1115
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:07,240
And I'm proud to tell the story

1116
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,220
of freedom and financial gain.

1117
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,080
Free to have fun,

1118
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,040
free to car ride,

1119
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:16,340
free to change,

1120
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,760
free to Halliburton.

1121
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:20,820
Halliburton!

1122
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,580
Hey, hey, hey!

1123
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,660
Well, Mama,

1124
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:33,480
there's a few things I forgot to tell you.

1125
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:37,640
I've got part of my head blown off.

1126
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,960
But that don't matter

1127
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,940
with the kind of job skills I got anyway.

1128
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,040
I'm missing a few digits.

1129
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:46,740
Ooh!

1130
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,220
I'm missing big chunks of my skull.

1131
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,260
Ooh!

1132
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,080
Oh, what the hell!

1133
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,740
Ooh!

1134
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,080
Ooh!

1135
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,080
Ooh!

1136
00:51:59,200 --> 00:51:59,580
Ooh!

1137
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:04,800
So I'm proud to tell the story

1138
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,720
The story!

1139
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,580
of freedom and financial gain.

1140
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,400
Cha-ching!

1141
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,480
Free to car ride.

1142
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:11,980
Cha-ching!

1143
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,580
Free to back tail.

1144
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,000
Cha-ching!

1145
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,080
Free to have a bird.

1146
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:16,140
Free to have a bird.

1147
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:16,140


1148
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:16,140


1149
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:16,140


1150
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:16,140


1151
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:16,420
I love her time.

1152
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,580
I love her time.

1153
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:19,680
I love her time.

1154
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,380
Hey, hey, hey!

1155
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,360
One more time.

1156
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,340
So I want to salute

1157
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,580
Old Dory.

1158
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:27,660
Old Dory.

1159
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,440
And the colors for which she sighs.

1160
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,380
She sighs.

1161
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,380
Red for the bush.

1162
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,200
White for the guns.

1163
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,120
White for the guns.

1164
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,800
And Bush laughs and laughs and laughs

1165
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,020
because somebody voted for Nader.

1166
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,960
You know, I guess some people thought,

1167
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,080
I know, I'll vote my conscience this time

1168
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,200
instead of the lesser of two evils.

1169
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:25,260
Better stick with that lesser of two evils next time, friends.

1170
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:25,760
I don't know.

1171
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,680
Uncle Simon's gonna give me thunderbolt.

1172
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:32,300
He want me to fly away up above the clouds.

1173
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,120
Uncle Simon's gonna give me thunderbolt.

1174
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,760
He want me to fly away up above the clouds.

1175
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,360
He want me to drop a bomb on the Japanese.

1176
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,860
I really got to make my baby proud.

1177
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,320
I want a machine gun.

1178
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:03,380
And I want to be hit out in the woods.

1179
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,580
I want a machine gun.

1180
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,880
And I want to be hit out in the woods.

1181
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,220
I want to show old man Hitler

1182
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,300
that Sonny Boy don't mean him no good.

1183
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,200
I want to drop a bomb

1184
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,240
and set the Japanese city on fire.

1185
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,580
I want to drop a bomb

1186
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:44,720
and set the Japanese city on fire.

1187
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,080
Not because they are so rotten.

1188
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,020
I just love to see them die.

1189
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,840
Well, all right.

1190
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:00,460
Okay.

1191
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:01,760


1192
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,640
Okay.

1193
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:04,320


1194
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:04,840
Okay.

1195
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:04,900
Okay.

1196
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:05,780
Okay.

1197
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:05,780


1198
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,240
I've got this victory blue

1199
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,280
Because I know I've got to go

1200
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,600
I've got this victory blue

1201
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:45,660
Because I know I've got to go

1202
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,780
Not to keep the dirty Japanese

1203
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:55,980
From slipping into my baby's back door

1204
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,840
Sonny Boy Williamson

1205
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,940
Sonny Boy Williamson

1206
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,000
Sonny Boy Williamson

1207
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,480
Win the War Blues

1208
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,040
from Smithsonian Victory Collection, disc number one.

1209
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,160
Thanks to New Monet for posting this old-timey stuff

1210
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,120
to altbinaries.slack.

1211
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:20,260
Before that, Old Gory by Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1212
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:23,720
live at the Beachland Devival just recently.

1213
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:28,740
And that song, I'm on the Battlefield for My Lord,

1214
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:32,760
was by Reverend D.C. Rice and his Sanctified Congregation.

1215
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,260
From the Anthology of War,

1223

Ending World War XIX is imposed,

1227
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,680
and it's allah.

1228
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,120
The Union of Protestant Northern Ireland,

1229
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,300
American Aviator,

1230
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,520
Soviet Socialist Republics is proclaimed.

1231
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,060
Lenin dies in 1924.

1232
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,620
And the former German strip pole.

1233
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,000
Oh, man.

1234
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:25,900
It's real.

1235
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,660
Of course it's real, son.

1236
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,820
Everything's real, even the unreal.

1237
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,040
Yeah.

1238
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:33,720
The needle.

1239
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,040
Terrible.

1240
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,320
The needle.

1241
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:37,620
Yeah, baby.

1242
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,540
Wire off, dude.

1243
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,760
Sit down in the chair.

1244
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,980
Take some of that smack over there.

1245
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,740
That smack that the terrorists

1246
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,600
are bringing into our country.

1247
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:53,400
Yeah, you're gonna feel real groovy.

1248
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,520
Yeah, man, the terrorists

1249
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,520
brought some smack into my veins.

1250
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,500
They'll do that every time.

1251
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,400
It's not my fault.

1252
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:03,360
The terrorists shot that dope

1253
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,180
into my needle using my hands.

1254
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,720
Those terrorists mind-controlled me into driving drunk.

1255
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:14,400
Those terrorists mind-controlled me into destroying the Freedom of Information Act.

1256
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:20,360
Those terrorists forced me to declare war on terror and freedom both at the same time.

1257
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,780
I'm not responsible.

1258
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:26,520
For Johnny Apple Seed and the Boys Under the Hills.

1259
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,760
It's a world of death.

1260
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,160
It loves it.

1261
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,540
It's death.

1262
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:34,840
Death.

1263
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,020
They worship death.

1264
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,260
Not at strip joints, they have.

1265
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:41,220
No.

1266
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,820
You ain't been going out enough, Dave.

1267
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:43,340
Dollars.

1268
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:44,080
Oh, yeah, man.

1269
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,420
I've been going out plenty.

1270
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,960
Out of my mind.

1271
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,020
Don't you see what they're doing in the strip joints even, man?

1272
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:50,700
It's everywhere.

1273
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,280
That girl takes off this, she takes off that.

1274
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,740
She's putting something back on in your mind.

1275
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,040
You know what I'm saying, man?

1276
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:56,800
Until next week.

1277
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,760
Keep your head on tight.

1278
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,740
Back to the wind.

1279
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,460
And you're sacking the saddle.

1280
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,200
Get that tank.

1281
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:05,880
Repair.

1282
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,380
Beneath the stains of time.

1283
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,720
The feelings disappear.

1284
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,620
You are someone else.

1285
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,960
I am still right here.
