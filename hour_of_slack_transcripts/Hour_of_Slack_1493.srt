1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,040
What is it?

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,240
What's the matter?

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,140
I just had a terrible dream.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:07,380
What?

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,600
It was blood and fire and thunder

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,380
and something awful was moving in the middle of it.

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,140
I could hear it roar and bellow.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,700
The Self Genius Hour of Sight.

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,800
If I were to allow that to continue,

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,360
he would blow every circuit in his body.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,160
That is correct, sir.

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,800
The birds!

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,840
He rises!

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,680
Who's there?

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,000
He's there.

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:02,820
He's there.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,120
He's there.

18
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,020
It turned out the story about the raccoon wasn't true either.

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,640
However, some things that were more,

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,060
much more horrible than raccoon.

21
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,700
Well, just today, on the way down here,

22
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,200
we saw a deer fleeing with unnatural celerity,

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,620
an unusual amount of terror.

24
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,920
I've never seen an animal run with such terror.

25
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,980
Right across the road.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,780
And I've seen a lot of deer running.

27
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,040
Full grown doe.

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,360
Yeah.

29
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,880
Well, clearly there was some reason to be running

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,280
from that dark part of the woods.

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,880
Friends, I'm afraid we must start this hour of slack out

32
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,000
on a rather somber note.

33
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,020
Then we'll get back to the fun and the giggles and laughs

34
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,880
and gags and so forth.

35
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,740
But right now, this is a moment for reflection

36
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,820
and consideration.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,600
Uh...

38
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,820
To begin with,

39
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,080
not that anybody is going to miss him.

40
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,120
And we can go ahead and say this now.

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,240
The body, or rather the remains,

42
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,800
oddly, there was no body,

43
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,760
but there was a wrist bracelet.

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,620
There was no body because there was no murder.

45
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,620
And if it was done by an animal, it's not a murder.

46
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,540
And we're closing in on the culprit.

47
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,840
But anyway, we've ID'd the male.

48
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,800
And that was indeed the guy known as Reverend Bastion.

49
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:29,800


50
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:29,800


51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:29,800


52
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:29,800


53
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:29,800


54
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:29,800


55
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:29,800


56
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:29,800


57
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:29,800


58
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,460
I forget his real name.

59
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,200
Mike Aston or something like that.

60
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,820
As I said, nobody's going to miss him,

61
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,300
but we still don't know who the female was with him

62
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,780
or if there was a child.

63
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,760
There was another thing found a little bit further into the woods,

64
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,000
which was bloody burst condoms.

65
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,080
Burst, I tell you.

66
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,100
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,260
What I'm trying to say?

68
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,820
Yes.

69
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,240
All this while I'm waiting,

70
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,020
waiting in the water,

71
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,140
trying to do the baptism.

72
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,480
Yes, all this happened.

73
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,580
Well, I'm sorry about that,

74
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,240
but we could have called the cops.

75
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,320
No, we can't have police here.

76
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,420
I think everyone is a realist enough to know

77
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,700
that this is no place for the police.

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,540
As my former show partner, Chicken John, once said,

79
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,020
if you have an emergency, a crisis, something wrong,

80
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,800
and you call the cops,

81
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,100
now you've got something wrong and cops.

82
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,160
Well, so we're trying to avoid that.

83
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,900
We're trying to avoid that sort of thing,

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,760
but I got the results back from the university

85
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:41,220
on the various claws, shells, bits of flesh, and so forth.

86
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:41,840
Expensive.

87
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,020
It's really confusing.

88
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:50,320
The detached beak we found was, in fact, from a prairie squid,

89
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,480
not an arboreal squid,

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,180
so it probably had been used for sex,

91
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,940
but we weren't able to scrape any human DNA,

92
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,940
off of the beak.

93
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,340
Of course, you wouldn't if the squid was de-beaked properly,

94
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,080
which indicates maybe not an animal culprit.

95
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,700
On the other hand, we also found,

96
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,300
and this pains me to have to tell you this,

97
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:21,540
but a face-fucking bat with its wings torn off,

98
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,820
possibly so that it couldn't fly away.

99
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,160
Did you bring that to show the people here?

100
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,420
No.

101
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,100
The university didn't send that back, but they did.

102
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,900
I've been using my trusty microscope here

103
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,220
to make some examinations myself,

104
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,640
and also in the woods near the scene of the crime or accident or whatever,

105
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,160
you don't want to get too close,

106
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,300
and this is sealed up in a medical bag,

107
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:57,720
but this horrible kind of bloody-looking encrusted filth and dirt encrusted thing.

108
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,340
I know what that is.

109
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:58,920
You know what?

110
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,300
Yeah.

111
00:04:59,560 --> 00:04:59,880
Yes.

112
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,100
Go ahead and explain.

113
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,840
What this is is what is called a tampion.

114
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,020
It's a kind of a plug which a bear puts in its anus during hibernation

115
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,600
to keep ants from getting in.

116
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,200
Somebody needs to get a photograph of this.

117
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,880
Does anyone here have a camera?

118
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,600
You can post it on...

119
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,260
A small camera or a phone that would get a picture of this.

120
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,780
I guess we could put it by the microscope to show its scientific...

121
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,580
And by the Geiger counter to show its strange level of...

122
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:29,860
Radioactivity.

123
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,660
Try to get the Geiger counter.

124
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,560
Ivan Stang, martyr to science.

125
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,600
There we go.

126
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,500
Okay, thank you.

127
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,040
Thank you.

128
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,560
Now you guys are the official photographers of X-Day, and I can quit.

129
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,700
We are exploring a little-known realm of strangeness here.

130
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,660
So tonight, friends, I would be very careful going out into the woods.

131
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,220
I know that's one thing.

132
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,200
One thing I don't have to worry about.

133
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,800
Subgeniuses entering the forest or even leaving their chairs or cars.

134
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,140
Did you have something to add?

135
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,060
Sistar has something to read into the record at this time.

136
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,940
I had an experience this morning in the big house.

137
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,780
An experience?

138
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,740
Which reminded me of a movie.

139
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,300
I don't know if you've ever seen The Conversation.

140
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,440
I have seen it.

141
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,020
Francis Ford Coppola movie.

142
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,080
Well, when I did my...

143
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:37,680
I did my duty unto Bob, and I was about to cast its remains to the earth, I thought for a moment that I'd seen blood.

144
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:44,760
And it occurred to me that perhaps someone had buried parts of the body.

145
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,720
But how did they get the body out of the clothes?

146
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,400
Well, I guess you could take the body out of the clothes and then put the clothes back together.

147
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,120
I don't know.

148
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,260
See, that points to someone like Philo or Legume.

149
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:56,960
It does.

150
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,200
That's the prankster.

151
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,000
Because that's the kind of thing a criminal mind would think of.

152
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,220
But, you know, I was put to mind in the conversation there.

153
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,640
And then when I looked again, it was perfectly clean.

154
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,840
Well, that sounds like what happens at your condo all the time with the ghost and the absent-minded old man in there.

155
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,020
They probably came on my skin.

156
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,160
Well, I don't want to go there.

157
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,580
Well, the ghosts do.

158
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,120
Maybe.

159
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,700
Maybe.

160
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,760
Oh, the other thing was we found a bunch of golf clubs all bent up.

161
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:45,880
If anybody needs a set of broken and bent golf clubs, there was a big mess of those found in the woods.

162
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,020
Twisted by some unimaginable force.

163
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,700
The monster, the murderer, whatever it is.

164
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,380
The irate golfer, whatever it is.

165
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,580
They didn't just kill the victims.

166
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,520
The bloody condoms.

167
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,060
And the...

168
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,200
And the...

169
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,080
And, of course, the tampion.

170
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:11,440
This is a huge tampion, which indicates the presence of rape bears, which were thought to have been wiped out since the unfortunate accidents last year at the campground.

171
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,020
For the last seven years, actually, I'm afraid to say.

172
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,520
And it may be that the seven-year cycle of the rape bear has started again.

173
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,680
And you don't want to be the subgenius that gets pulled into the rape bear's den for hibernation.

174
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,760
I remember those.

175
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,080
I don't even want to think about how he keeps the victim alive.

176
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,040
Those illustrations that Pantiara drew I've seen online.

177
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,100
Anyway, no, we hope everyone has a fine X-Day.

178
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,340
Yeah, yeah.

179
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,120
Don't let any of these horrible...

180
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,940
Magic, mystery, merriment, and mirth.

181
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,720
Frightening things bring you down or anything.

182
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,500
That's right.

183
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,180
You know, if you decide to, quote, drop, as the kids say.

184
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,320
Yes, don't let the unimaginable horror...

185
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,760
Or crimp the edges of the party.

186
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,120
No, no.

187
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,180
No.

188
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,780
And if you feel like you're starting to have a bad trip, go talk to Andrew the Impaled.

189
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,940
He has a surefire cure for that.

190
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:11,960
Seriously.

191
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,700
He does, does he?

192
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,980
Well, that's interesting news also.

193
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,580
Oh, yeah.

194
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,380
Oh, he's got a great treatment for bad trips.

195
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,020
What is the first phrase?

196
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,180
It's something like...

197
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,300
The first law of immorality.

198
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,660
Impalement.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,600
Dude, you better calm down, because it's going to be like this forever.

200
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,960
Something like that.

201
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:41,480
Really, the least handy phrases you want to hear when you're having a horrible, bad, ego-shaking acid trip.

202
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,760
Some of us, life itself is like that.

203
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,280
Yeah.

204
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,640
It's like...

205
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,300
You know what happened?

206
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,120
Hausner, your show started now.

207
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,300
It did start.

208
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,760
See, that's it right there.

209
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,240
Jeez.

210
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,440
What do we do now?

211
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:06,940
It's starting.

212
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,500
No, it's already started.

213
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,700
It's actually here now.

214
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,100
Oh, this one's really going to...

215
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,840
Oh, the show is here.

216
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,420
This one's going to be a firecracker.

217
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,180
This one's going to be a huge explosion.

218
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,380
This one's going to be...

219
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,740
This one's going to take the seat of your pants and just blow them right off.

220
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,720
This one's really going to take the cake.

221
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,340
I mean...

222
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,140
Don't sit on it.

223
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,140
Well, no.

224
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,100
You have to realize this one's really going to...

225
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,080
No, it's onions.

226
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,040
This one's going to have its way with you.

227
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,840
Well, me?

228
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,400
Oh, uh...

229
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,680
So, Dr. Howell has triumphantly returned to the show.

230
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,320
I would love to listen to all the apocryphal stories of what happened.

231
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,800
What happened to Old Sequa?

232
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,820
Did Sequa live, or did you guys cook him down?

233
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,260
Old Sequa was not harmed remotely.

234
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,940
That's ridiculous.

235
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,220
But what did happen...

236
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,300
That's the most important thing, that everyone, regardless of whether the exes came or not,

237
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,180
they had to know what happened to Sequa.

238
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:11,420
Well, there was some talk that some monstrous monster had killed him, you know, but this was all BS.

239
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,840
However, there was a monster...

240
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,860
As opposed to your lovable little funny kind of fuzzy monster, right?

241
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:26,200
There was a monstrous monster, and it did stalk the woods, and it turned a little dog named Snuckles into a horrible...

242
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:35,760
pile of protoplasm and goo, and then, allegedly, it killed this nasty subgenius whose pants and roundabout were found,

243
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,340
and Stang handled this investigation.

244
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,520
I was there in an advisory capacity, and he made videos.

245
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,380
Some might say too many videos of the sorry...

246
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:48,860
You can...

247
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,900
Well, you know my tribe.

248
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,080
You can never have too much.

249
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,600
The problem is going through the too much once you've...

250
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,560
Well, um...

251
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:02,780
And then the whole story is being told on special Stang radio, and I might have blown the whole thing,

252
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,140
but no, I didn't, because I didn't say what that monster turned out to be.

253
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,140
Ah, well, that's very...

254
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,920
That was very nice of you not to reveal the...

255
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,860
Who that monster turned out to be.

256
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,900
I agree.

257
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,460
I agree.

258
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,340
Ah!

259
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,040
It's church.

260
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,400
They're stored behind the doorway.

261
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,460
Who's that?

262
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,780
It's A.D.

263
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,760
Oh, yeah.

264
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,560
Anyway, after we blither-blather here for a while with the entertaining hour of Slack show,

265
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,540
we'll do Ask Dr. Hal, and then from 5 to 6, the end of the Bulldada auction,

266
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,560
from 7 to 8, the Bobby Awards, and you won't want to miss that,

267
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,140
because there's more awards than there are subgenius.

268
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,620
Yes, the coveted Bobby Awards.

269
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,280
And finally at 8, the costume ball, which I'm really excited about.

270
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,140
And tonight, the Mutant Mountain Boys, Andrew the Impaled,

271
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,880
and the Burning.

272
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,740
The Burning.

273
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,540
By Stephen King, America's most popular author.

274
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,460
The Burning.

275
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,600
One thing we know, this thing fears fire.

276
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,040
Yes, most creatures fear fire.

277
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,820
During the... when night falls.

278
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,180
And the burning.

279
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,840
And the burning.

280
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,880
And the burning.

281
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:32,840
And the burning.

282
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,840
And the burning.

283
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,640
Ha, ha, ha.

284
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,100
Stangor here.

285
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,780
Now you hear how Stangor tricked little weak glasses man Stang

286
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,320
into hunting monster in woods.

287
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Stangor even tricked him into tricking all other soft, fat, white subgenius boys and girls

288
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,920
into hunting monster in woods, too.

289
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,460
Wearing silly fake hunter armor.

290
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,560
Ha, ha.

291
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,500
Stangor played your world and world of Bob Pipe Man like gay.

292
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,000
Like silly gay.

293
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,800
Ha, ha, ha.

294
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:29,700
Tinky.

295
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,660
Hi.

296
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,740
This was just turned in, Reverend Stang.

297
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,840
It's a gift from...

298
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,200
Let's see, the woods are full of Amish ripe bear.

299
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,020
And the Temple of Mass Consumption has proof.

300
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,600
Found in a local cemetery about an hour ago.

301
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,840
And is it in this bag?

302
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,160
Apparently.

303
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,400
So, I just...

304
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,300
I've learned not to just reach into it.

305
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,500
Reach into some bag that came from a cemetery.

306
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,180
Right.

307
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,540
Right.

308
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:56,620
Yeah.

309
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,860
I've, uh...

310
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,320
But what...

311
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,280
At each day, you don't just grab anything.

312
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,480
What appears to be...

313
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,060
Oh my God.

314
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,300
Well, a...

315
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,060
A fossilized or petrified, uh...

316
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,340
What is it?

317
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,180
It looks like a...

318
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,080
It looks like a...

319
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,700
Did it come with a note?

320
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,480
Uh...

321
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,180
Oh my God.

322
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,640
The cellular structure.

323
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,020
I've never seen anything like it.

324
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,520
The cellular...

325
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,520
The cell walls seem to have forked tails.

326
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,540
Each individual...

327
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,260
Each individual cell.

328
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,200
Look at this, Professor Mandy.

329
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,400
They...

330
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,060
They're wiggling little forked tails of each...

331
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,540
And yet the...

332
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,120
They're so motile.

333
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,320
And yet they're...

334
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,840
They...

335
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,600
They have features of both plant cells and animal cells.

336
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:39,960
Like...

337
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,400
I can't...

338
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,940
Like that primitive organism...

339
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,680
This is new to science.

340
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,600
The Euglena.

341
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,660
It is from McDonald's.

342
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,180
Well, the bag is from McDonald's.

343
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,820
It smells like that stuff Bob smoked.

344
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,820
Hmm.

345
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,380
Could he have been smoking?

346
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,720
This sausage like thing?

347
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,920
But it's unsmoked.

348
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,440
Uh...

349
00:15:59,440 --> 00:15:59,920
This...

350
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,340
This...

351
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,680
Corn dog of the gods.

352
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,340
Recently found.

353
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:03,660
It's...

354
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,260
It's like an anal probe or something.

355
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,080
Or could be.

356
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,460
Well, some people have stuff like that on their minds all the time.

357
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,760
And this was found in a cemetery.

358
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,260
And what were you doing lurking around a cemetery in the middle of the night?

359
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,260
Uh...

360
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,360
Where ghouls leave anal probes lying around.

361
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:19,680
Temple mass conception.

362
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,740
Mm-hmm.

363
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,720
No one is beyond suspicion.

364
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,280
But...

365
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,700
But thank you for your submission.

366
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,600
Have you ever seen the movie The Thing?

367
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,340
Well, it's like that.

368
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,560
The Thing.

369
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,740
Oh yeah.

370
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,940
Just, uh...

371
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,380
You have a great work ethic.

372
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,280
You know, I've always appreciated...

373
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:36,740
We'll do the job.

374
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:45,020
When you attend yourself to a problem, be it, you know, painting or drawing or memorizing a thing or answering a question, you...

375
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,000
You just...

376
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,700
You know, you don't...

377
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,040
You don't stop before it's done.

378
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,240
Or eating a hamburger.

379
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,020
You're getting that right.

380
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,820
Or if I'm demonstrating...

381
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,840
You're gonna answer a question, you gotta answer the hell out of that.

382
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,240
Oh, my God.

383
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,300
You're not eating that specimen.

384
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,700
Oh, no, I see...

385
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,660
No, no, this isn't gonna happen.

386
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,340
He's not eating the dildo.

387
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh, my God.

388
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,440
Wait a minute.

389
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,560
Oh, my God.

390
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,100
He's eating the dildo.

391
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,560
No.

392
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,380
It's like that scene in, uh...

393
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:07,880
What was it?

394
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,360
Pulled Porky?

395
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,620
Actually, it's pretty good.

396
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,660
Disgustipating.

397
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,100
Well, I'm gonna...

398
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,920
I'm not just gonna eat this dildo found in a graveyard.

399
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,200
I'm gonna eat the hell out of it, baby.

400
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,420
Get out of this dildo found in a graveyard.

401
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,420
All right, all right.

402
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,320
Uh, I guess...

403
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,240
How many dildos does it take to...

404
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,920
What can I say?

405
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,820
... find your way through the graveyard on a...

406
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,320
... hungry, hungry night?

407
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,720
You know, there was an...

408
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:34,640
... an interesting, um, medieval monograph published, uh, as I remember, called, um,

409
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,920
uh, De...

410
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,940
De mortuis...

411
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,060
De mortuis?

412
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,320
... masticatorum in tumulus.

413
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,420
That is to say, of the chewing of the dead in their graves.

414
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,320
Wow.

415
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,780
It is reported in, uh...

416
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,600
Like a ghoul gate.

417
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,760
Well, uh, Timorous...

418
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,820
To break it all down, Timorous Soul...

419
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:54,820


420
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:54,820


421
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:54,820


422
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:54,820


423
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:54,820


424
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:54,820


425
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:54,820


426
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:54,820


427
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:54,820


428
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:54,820


429
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,340
... the devils passing by a graveyard have been disturbed by hearing, coming faintly

430
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,980
from underground, the munching and chewing of the dead in their graves.

431
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,620
Uh...

432
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:10,900
And indeed, when several of these were opened by the magistrate, they found that the debtors

433
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,220
inside had et their linen.

434
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,160
They'd eaten their lemons?

435
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:16,860
Linen.

436
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,820
Oh, their linen.

437
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:24,020
You wrap a corpse, or you used to, up in linen, and you bind the jaw so it doesn't drop alarmingly

438
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,680
on its breast.

439
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,800
Like the ghost of Jacob Marley.

440
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,600
Ahhhh.

441
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,520
You put two coins on the eyes and a penny under the tongue to pay the ferry, the, uh,

442
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,920
the ferry boatman, um, Charon, and, uh...

443
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,700
I missed the boat, but I caught the ferry.

444
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,120
And then you, uh, well, as...

445
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,280
Then you chew the linens.

446
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,540
Well, if they're dead, how do they chew them, or were they not dead?

447
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,160
Exactly.

448
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,840
They may be dead, but they're still a-chewin'.

449
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,180
That means they weren't dead.

450
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,820
Uh, that's my point, uh, to people who want to chew and consume mysterious things.

451
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,380
I mean, there's objects found in graveyards, um, well, uh...

452
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,440
Isn't that why some graves have little bells?

453
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,120
Sloppy seconds.

454
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,940
The bell is so if they wake up and find that they accidentally got buried but are still

455
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,380
alive, they can ring the little bell and supposedly, technically, someone will come and dig them

456
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,220
up and let them out.

457
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:20,640
But with today's scientific methods of hygienic embalming, no one comes back.

458
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,820
Even if you were in a cataleptic state that mimicked death by the time you were born,

459
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:30,480
by the time the mortician finishes, uh, with you, there's a guarantee, unlike in previous

460
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,080
ages, that you will be gone.

461
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:38,240
And not able to experience the indignity of waking up entombed.

462
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:45,080
But perhaps your life itself was an example of, uh, being confined and entombed when you

463
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,920
only wished to be free, to live instead of, uh, a living death.

464
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,800
Friend, are you entombed in your 24-7 brain?

465
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,080
Three weeks ago I enjoyed a 9 year long detailed meeting with my little brother,

466
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,080


467
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,080


468
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,800
It was traditional, fine data entry job for Facebook.

469
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:56,900
Sorry.

470
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,060
Bury him with a cell phone, but how long can the battery last?

471
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,140
Anyway, they don't need it because the, uh, uh, mortician has been there with his trocar

472
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,120
and his, uh, procedure.

473
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,860
Trocar, don't bother me!

474
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,340
Trocar....

475
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:24,780
Trocar...

476
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:31,200
Because they stick a butt plug in the ear of our Lord to keep embarrassing sounds from coming out.

477
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,160
Hot.

478
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:43,540
Yeah, Reverend Sifu was passing out butt plugs for corpses as gifts one X day.

479
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:43,860
No.

480
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,640
Yeah, because he works as an undertaker.

481
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:52,800
And he had had a very busy year as a New York City mortician.

482
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,160
In a New York state of mind.

483
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,740
Right after September 11, 2001.

484
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:57,660
Oh, gracious.

485
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,420
His job was to put remains into shoe boxes.

486
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,920
They were 9-11 butt plugs?

487
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,100
They were 9-11-ated.

488
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,700
Well, they didn't need them for most of them.

489
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,620
They would fit into a shoe box.

490
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,440
Oh, gracious.

491
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,840
That's about how much space human remains take up when there's no water at all.

492
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,340
Right, it's quite portable.

493
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,140
Squished out.

494
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,580
But my point is,

495
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,780
if you wake up in the morning,

496
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,000
if you wake up dead,

497
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,180
you won't be able to fart because of that plastic plug.

498
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,500
And they're a one-size-fits-all, by the way.

499
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,020
They've graduated rings.

500
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,920
Actually, dead people fart all the time.

501
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,500
That's why they have to use the plug.

502
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,780
Because, you know, you go to an open casket situation,

503
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,520
and there's poor old Aunt May laying there.

504
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,880
Just farting away.

505
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,240
Suddenly,

506
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,760
the most horrible smell fills the whole church.

507
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,700
Yes, dead farts are worse than the farts of living.

508
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,860
And the most horrible smell is the farts of living.

509
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,100
Yeah, Dr. Dark suggests we seek a police whistle up there.

510
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,740
You know, after the indignity has already occurred,

511
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:05,700
if you've simply added an audio dimension to an unfortunate experience,

512
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,960
it's already distinguished by a hideous, moist sound effect.

513
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,340
Fart.

514
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,100
Fart.

515
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:19,600


516
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,600
Fart.

517
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:20,640
Fart.

518
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,420
Fart.

519
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:21,420


520
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:21,420


521
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:21,940
Fart.

522
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,400
Fart.

523
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:22,740
Fart.

524
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:22,740


525
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:22,740


526
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:22,740


527
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:22,740


528
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:22,740


529
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:22,740


530
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:22,740


531
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:22,740


532
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:22,740


533
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:22,740


534
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,380
Fart.

535
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:23,500
Fart.

536
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,020
Fart.

537
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,060
Fart.

538
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,260
Reverend Angry Larry,

539
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,860
you've been involved with the investigation into the mysterious happenstances around the

540
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,360
campground lately, haven't you?

541
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,040
Let's let him have this mic for a minute.

542
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:46,180
I wondered if you, did you see the tampion of a right bear?

543
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,800
They apparently have, their seven-year cycle has started anew.

544
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,760
And that's a feral.

545
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:52,760


546
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:52,760


547
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:52,760


548
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,440
It's a fresh, you can see by it's kind of bloody.

549
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,080
We've all watched that now.

550
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,140
A fresh tampion from a right bear.

551
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,320
A tampion would be bloody.

552
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,640
But not a tampon.

553
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,380
This is different.

554
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:10,520
This is what the bear makes and inserts into his rectum to, during hibernation to keep

555
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:10,780
the ants out.

556
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,660
Rectum in propter sese.

557
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,220
Yeah.

558
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,400
And this is not, obviously not a black bear.

559
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,020
Actually, that's interesting because the word rectum or rectus were not used in the

560
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,740
Latin.

561
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:22,760
Yeah.

562
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:22,760


563
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:22,760


564
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:22,760


565
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:22,760


566
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:22,760


567
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:22,760


568
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:22,760


569
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:22,760


570
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,040
But when you think about modern day?

571
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,360
Rectum means the rat.

572
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,220
Rectum Gadish.

573
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:25,220


574
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:25,220


575
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:25,220


576
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,560
And you must use them for something.

577
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,500
These Mahi Huang beck estas cutthroat oriented beds.

578
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:29,520
Yeah.

579
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,540
And that's from 1688 is которое that by now, up until 3000, back in the history of mankind.

580
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,300
Which is, adventures in space緩 Till, theyそして, Mein Land.

581
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:40,200
But those times, these the kind of black bears, as probable forethought, poor off rackets

582
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,200


583
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,640
Cuz this mind这小!

584
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,560
What a in the mythos anthing of subsistence.

585
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,280
So I don't swear to it, and water.

586
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,280


587
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,460
What is going on here?

588
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,820
So like nonhanded

589
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,020
a sie-

590
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:59,040
I just wondered if you had any, had observed any other strange phenomena or heard.

591
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,880
No, not just yet.

592
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,280
But I'm on it.

593
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,140
Okay.

594
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,900
I'm on it.

595
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,280
We've got our eyes open.

596
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,620
You look a little sleepy.

597
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,020
You don't look like you're on it.

598
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,300
The reason I ask, you look like you're about half asleep.

599
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,740
Well, you should have been out with us.

600
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,900
We've got a Geiger counter here.

601
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,800
Turn it on.

602
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,340
Did you try it on that?

603
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,020
Good God.

604
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,300
It's him.

605
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,360
Of course it's me.

606
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,860
Sorry, he's radioactive anyway.

607
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,400
Yes, of course it is.

608
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:21,980
Look at that.

609
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,520
It pegged.

610
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,640
As soon as I turned it on, it pegged.

611
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,500
Are you sure you have that adjusted right?

612
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:26,900
I'm turning it over here at you.

613
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,940
Look at that.

614
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,820
It goes down to nothing.

615
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,400
Don't point that thing at me, Daddy.

616
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,520
No, it doesn't shoot rays.

617
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,560
It senses rays.

618
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,280
It's a sensory instrument.

619
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,200
Oh, my goodness.

620
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,020
Is it properly calibrated?

621
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,460
You've spent a lot of, huh?

622
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,520
How should I know?

623
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,420
Properly calibrated, of course.

624
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,140
Are you kidding?

625
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,320
It's been appropriately calibrated by calibrationists.

626
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,580
You know?

627
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,600
Equipment.

628
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,520
You've spent a little bit too long around.

629
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,200
There's aliens.

630
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,980
There's amino acids.

631
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,640
Somebody has to.

632
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,080
There must be a Bureau of Standards.

633
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:57,760
Yes.

634
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,340
So what happened to the amino acids?

635
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,400
Their ship broke down.

636
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,440
They suffered vehicular attrition.

637
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,500
Yes.

638
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,320
Okay, this is turned to zero.

639
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,500
Thank you.

640
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,420
If I turn it to times 100, let's see how much residual radioactivity is in this room.

641
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:15,800
Go to sleep.

642
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:16,940
Nothing.

643
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,300
It's clean.

644
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,220
There's no radiation in here.

645
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,540
So maybe.

646
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,660
Maybe it's not functioning.

647
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,900
Turned a circuit check.

648
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,520
Oh, yeah.

649
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,440
It works fine.

650
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,580
Look at the fiddling with that Geiger counter.

651
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,820
The new toy of the subgeniuses.

652
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,240
I don't know what it read when you pointed it at me, but I mean.

653
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,380
It was pegged.

654
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,140
It pegged.

655
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,480
It went all the way.

656
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,580
Yes, it does.

657
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,480
Now that Doc Howell is touching it, it is.

658
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,300
At X1, we get a radiation which is off the dial.

659
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,280
Oh, that's my own personal journal.

660
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,280
That wouldn't be radioactive.

661
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,700
Let me just move it over.

662
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,040
You holding on to it is.

663
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,260
Well, this says everything's radioactive.

664
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:05,080
Well, assuming this thing, this monster, whatever that's right in the campground is the usual kind of monster.

665
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,320
We're guessing it might be radioactive.

666
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,600
Hey, wait a minute.

667
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,000
And therefore, we can track it, hopefully.

668
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,740
But yet, I'm very radioactive.

669
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,560
So am I under suspicion?

670
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,100
You are.

671
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,720
Everyone here is under suspicion.

672
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,160
Right, but I'm part of the investigation.

673
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,060
Right.

674
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,260
And I'm not the butler.

675
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:24,780
Well, this is the church.

676
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,580
I did not do it.

677
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,620
Well, this is the church of the subgenius.

678
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,360
Well, I mean, I was the one to discover the body or the remains, whatever you call it.

679
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,300
We'll use it in time.

680
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,100
We'll not auction this Geiger counter at the Bulldada auction.

681
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:45,960
We now cut ahead to the subgenius costume ball in progress at the main stage at the edge of the woods.

682
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,440
The costume theme happened by coincidence to be Warriors for Bob.

683
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:58,000
So many attendees were wearing faux armor, squirt guns, and Nerf weapons.

684
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,860
Well, I just hope something doesn't happen to ruin the fun.

685
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,540
We've had so many weird incidents.

686
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,520
You guys getting your car raped with you in it.

687
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,860
That poor dog.

688
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,100
Weird noises in the woods.

689
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,420
That dog.

690
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:14,860
Snuggles.

691
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,860
That bastard, revered bastard.

692
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,400
Just, you know, even he didn't deserve that.

693
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,120
Nothing.

694
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,320
I mean, everybody's having so much fun.

695
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,760
I just hope that we don't have a repeat of one of those unpleasantries.

696
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,120
Wisteria is still denying knowledge of anything, right?

697
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:41,660
Yeah, Wisteria says it's, you know, they said all of it's lies and rumors and subgenius silly stuff.

698
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,020
But they look scared.

699
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,980
They look real scared.

700
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,980
They know something's going on.

701
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,700
They know there's something going on.

702
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,020
They just don't want it getting out.

703
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,260
You know, the town's folks would blame them.

704
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,980
Maybe for whatever.

705
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,400
Well, it could discourage people from coming to the festival next week.

706
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,140
Yeah, that's true.

707
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,240
But our fuckers would be like...

708
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,140
Those superstitious pagans will be...

709
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,200
They don't like monsters, man.

710
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,740
They don't like monsters.

711
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,500
They don't even like toy devils.

712
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,320
They get easily bummed out.

713
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:19,080
And, you know, if they find out that all this horrible stuff is associated with the subgeniuses,

714
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,580
I think what it would do to our reputation.

715
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,240
I don't.

716
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:21,680
No.

717
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,320
Our reputation's always been so great among all of the pagans.

718
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,380
They really get our sense of humor.

719
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,220
They love it when the bobs come.

720
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,280
Yeah, right.

721
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,340
Oh, I know they love when the bobs come.

722
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,180
They're so respectful, too.

723
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,160
Tolerant.

724
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,960
Well, they all have open minds.

725
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,480
They know what it's like to be persecuted, all right.

726
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:43,800
Yeah.

727
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:50,400
I don't want to unnecessarily scare people, you know, right in the middle of this rock and roll party.

728
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,080
Oh, man.

729
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,420
You know, there have been some more noises and screams and bloody, scraped-up trees.

730
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,600
There have.

731
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,100
Yeah.

732
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,760
You heard about the tampion.

733
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,660
Yes.

734
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,420
It was from no black bear.

735
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,480
That was not...

736
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,400
It was a seven-year tampion.

737
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,360
You know what that means.

738
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:08,920
I do.

739
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,560
Those kind of bears.

740
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,600
Very aggressive.

741
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:13,840
Mm.

742
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,800
Well...

743
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,040
This infernal noise could wake the dead or old sequoia, for that matter,

744
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,940
if you think about it.

745
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,020
And its offspring.

746
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,540
Now that that ring has been taken away out of its domain.

747
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,260
Did you hear about that?

748
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,060
I did not.

749
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,080
Baby bear got in the pond the first day here.

750
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:41,840
And what initially looked like a large, fat, hippie silver ring slid onto her foot.

751
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,320
She picked it up with her toe.

752
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,840
And it had hieroglyphs, engravings on it.

753
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,680
It looked new at first, but...

754
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,020
That's when that...

755
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,320
That brown stuff started forming on everyone's skin, right?

756
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:54,460
Right.

757
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,420
Not everyone.

758
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,580
Not everyone.

759
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,640
It performed on...

760
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,180
I didn't get any of it.

761
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,200
But then I never see the UFOs when everybody else...

762
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,980
Something in the jeans.

763
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,680
Later tonight we will set Bob on fire for screwing us over again.

764
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,920
This mask makes it hard for me to talk.

765
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,080
Oh, there.

766
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,800
That's much better.

767
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,700
Well, friends, you're going to love the Mutant Mountain Boys if you haven't seen them before.

768
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,940
They're the greatest thing this side of heaven.

769
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:43,280
And they'll help us swash the butt hurt that we got from, well, you know, the usual.

770
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,220
I hate saying that.

771
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,420
My phone is doing something.

772
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,000
I was trying to get it to work.

773
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,000


774
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,000


775
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,460
I was trying to...

776
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:59,160
I was just mentioning to Potter and Petal that I really hope that the festivities and

777
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,500
fun here wouldn't be disrupted like so many other events have at X-Day this week.

778
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:14,700
What with the little dog and the mangled and the, you know, that guy and the other animals.

779
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,560
And, well, I just hope everybody can keep their heads together.

780
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,420
Don't be worried.

781
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,220
Don't be scared.

782
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,220
That's the important thing.

783
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,600
Wisteria is a safe place.

784
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,660
There's no cover-up.

785
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,480
Everything's fine.

786
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,120
No trouble.

787
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,460
And I think that, uh, I think the Mutant Mountain Boys...

788
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:32,680
Hold on.

789
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,420
My phone is...

790
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,920
It's...

791
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,400
It's Philo.

792
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,320
What?

793
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,320
Dr. Drummond?

794
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,300
No, I'm at the stage.

795
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,480
Where are you?

796
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,480
What?

797
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,760
I'm at the stage.

798
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:49,760


799
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:49,760


800
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:49,760


801
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:49,760


802
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:49,760


803
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:49,960
I'm at the stage.

804
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:49,960


805
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:49,960


806
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:49,960


807
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:49,960


808
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:49,960


809
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:49,960


810
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,000
I'm at the stage.

811
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,260
I'm at the stage.

812
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:51,460
So, you...

813
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:51,560
You...

814
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,300
Man, this could...

815
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,180
People could get hurt.

816
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:54,660
I don't know.

817
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,480
Most of these people have never been off the road, much less down the woods.

818
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,420
Jesus Christ.

819
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,260
Oh, okay, I won't...

820
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,020
I won't come alone.

821
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,860
I'll see if I can get some people to go with me.

822
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,420
We gotta hurry.

823
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Friends, there's...

824
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,440
Something has come up down at the Hickory Grove.

825
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,220
Dr. Drummond says that the thing has...

826
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,420
Is on its way just out of there, and it may be possible...

827
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,220
...that if we go...

828
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:25,720
fast enough we can pursue it. Now we have weapons, sort of, some of these, I mean, I

829
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:31,000
guess they're Nerf swords and stuff, but, you know, pick up any pitchforks, torches,

830
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,260
flashlights, we're going to need them. It gets really dark in there. And I guess I'll,

831
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:46,240
maybe we can intimidate the thing or Dr. Legume or whatever it is. Come on, who's with me?

832
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,280
This is our last stand. What are we, just some kind of pink boys that sit around watching TV

833
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:58,560
and playing video games, downloading crap off the internet? This is our chance to prove

834
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:06,140
to Wisteria and the world that we can kick ass for real, man. It would be cool. Don't be a pussy.

835
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:15,100
Well, it's okay, Teeters. You don't have to be ashamed, poor crippled thing. But come on,

836
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,120
don't be like Teeters.

837
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,760
Follow me!

838
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,720
We're going on an adventure!

839
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,460
This is some geniuses following me right now!

840
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,060
Good God!

841
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,440
Get off your butt and off the stage!

842
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:32,720
Somebody, Philo's in trouble, man! Don't you care about Philo? Doesn't anyone care

843
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,200
about Dr. Drummond?

844
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,640
Look, not one person raised his hand.

845
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:38,740
Can you believe that?

846
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:46,000
Oh, no, no, it's this way. The yellow trail. Follow me! Follow me!

847
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,000
Down the yellow trail!

848
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,880
Follow the stairs!

849
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:57,980
Take these harpoons and lances, melt them down. Forge me new weapons that will strike deep

850
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:07,540
and hold fast. But do not douse them in water. They must have a proper baptism. What say ye,

851
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:13,000
all ye men? Will you give as much blood as shall be needed to temper the steel?

852
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,260
No!

853
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,180
No!

854
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:24,280
To my anger now add your own. You be the cogs that fit my wheel, the gunpowder that

855
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:43,580
takes my torch. Pledge yourselves heart, soul, body, life and lungs. As I pledge myself,

856
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:45,560
I pledge my life and soul to the Lord.

857
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,420
Eager to protect their quaint little town.

858
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:56,720
Ross, getting groovy with his gargantuan greatsword. Barry, blowing haunting howls with his hunting

859
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,300
horn.

860
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,780
Susie, slicing up lizard scum with her longsword.

861
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,840
And Aaron, letting arrows fly with his beautiful bow.

862
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,080
Saltaire and

863
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,100
Rose!

864
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,160
Let the wind blow your way north and south.

865
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,960
Oh, damn it, whale!

866
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:58,420
Don't urinate down here just because it says it's the yellow trail.

867
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,140
There are candiru frogs, so don't stop.

868
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,700
If you need to do your business, do it now.

869
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,640
That's all I'm saying.

870
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,140
Just a little bit further.

871
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:09,940
Come on, Matt.

872
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,880
Now, wait a minute.

873
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,680
Maybe we should split up.

874
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,760
Yeah, sure.

875
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,440
That's what they always do in the...

876
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,840
What the hell?

877
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,260
For God's sake, turn around!

878
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,100
Please turn around!

879
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,120
Don't go!

880
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,340
Don't go!

881
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,580
What is it?

882
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,680
Is Philo okay?

883
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,720
Oh, that chicken shit.

884
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,260
Come on.

885
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,940
Philo's gone.

886
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,160
It's getting dark.

887
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,620
Hey, man.

888
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:43,280
It's awesome.

889
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,000
It's awfully quiet all of a sudden.

890
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,540
Too quiet.

891
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,740
Careful, Doctor.

892
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,260
We don't know what's in this place.

893
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,040
Look, it's like Blair Witch Project or something.

894
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,920
I'm inocuous hobos leaving.

895
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,460
Yeah, it's like some primitive thing has been out here.

896
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:03,920
What the?

897
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,800
Holy shit.

898
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,960
Oh, my God.

899
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,520
Oh, God.

900
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,320
I just felt a chill go up my back.

901
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,140
Oh, no.

902
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,820
There's a place.

903
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,340
That used to be...

904
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,140
A human...

905
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,640
What is that?

906
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,580
It's not guts.

907
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,220
It looks almost gelatinous.

908
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:19,900
Like a...

909
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,540
A pipe!

910
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,980
Hey, run!

911
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,200
Here, use my flashlight.

912
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,660
Give us more light here.

913
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,540
Now, friends, this is a...

914
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,840
Somebody keep your eyes out in the woods.

915
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,140
We're all looking down.

916
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,500
This thing could be...

917
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,480
Yeah, that's it.

918
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,360
Now, but...

919
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,440
That's a crime scene.

920
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,180
We probably shouldn't touch the evidence, but we can't call the cops.

921
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,300
Take the picture while you have the...

922
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,740
What are those metal things?

923
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,180
They always show up in your stomach.

924
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:43,740
Cotter pins.

925
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,760
We can determine later.

926
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,180
Are those cotter pins?

927
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,080
Cotter...

928
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,280
Welcome back, cotter pins.

929
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,200
Could that be just plain jello?

930
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,400
Not guts?

931
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:53,800
Well, I...

932
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,600
And that pipe...

933
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,180
Cotter pins in the gelatin.

934
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,140
What is this?

935
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,660
Good Lord.

936
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,440
Oh, my God.

937
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,100
Beautiful.

938
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:04,880
Okay.

939
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,720
I don't know if everybody's read their prescriptures, but the cotter pins and jello...

940
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,980
That means Bob's been here.

941
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,860
From where I'm standing...

942
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,520
I can see the personalized label inside that shoe.

943
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,600
Will you look at it, please?

944
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,500
That was sewn in.

945
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,740
That's not added in with Photoshop.

946
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,260
Feel it.

947
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:23,800
Look at it.

948
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,240
That is an actual personalized label that says Connie.

949
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,660
On this red high-heeled shoe.

950
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,900
One red high-heeled shoe.

951
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,340
One broken pipe and pipe stem.

952
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,100
Maybe we better take these for evidence.

953
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,040
No, no, no.

954
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,560
We should leave.

955
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,220
We should...

956
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,520
What the...

957
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,180
Is this...

958
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,240
This was a person?

959
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,680
Oh, God.

960
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,260
Oh, Jesus.

961
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,200
Oh, my God.

962
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,520
Look.

963
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,680
Arnold Palmer.

964
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,800
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

965
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,180
The hideous...

966
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,200
All hail the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer!

967
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,240
Bleeding head good!

968
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,080
Healed head bad!

969
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,080
Bleeding head good!

970
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,040
Healed head bad!

971
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,000
Bleeding head good!

972
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,780
It goes on and on.

973
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,720
Wait.

974
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,520
Wait.

975
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:13,880
Wait a minute.

976
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,240
Wait a minute.

977
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:14,600
Wait a minute.

978
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:14,940
Wait.

979
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,260
Don't do that with your bare hands.

980
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,280
...far from this place.

981
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,460
Didn't you watch the...

982
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,860
I think it's a rubber one.

983
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,240
I don't think this is...

984
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,260
Tip it up a little bit.

985
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,120
This is one of Bob's collectibles.

986
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:24,580
There's something in it.

987
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,240
Is that a noise?

988
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,240
I think it's just...

989
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:26,800
It's not a...

990
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,040
It's...

991
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,880
Friends, it couldn't be the real bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

992
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,620
No, no.

993
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,260
Or we'd be dead.

994
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,680
Does anybody have that Geiger counter?

995
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,020
I left it back at the...

996
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,960
I did not bring it.

997
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,840
Oh, my God.

998
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,920
Oh, my God.

999
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:38,820
Whatever the...

1000
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,160
Wait a minute.

1001
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,600
Did you ever...

1002
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,440
Do you know what this implies?

1003
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:41,940
What?

1004
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:49,540
We've been chasing old Sequa or a ripe bear or Dr. Legume or whatever.

1005
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,960
There have been a million theories.

1006
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,500
But they've all been...

1007
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,180
Crazy red herrings.

1008
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:59,940
It must have been Bob that raped the car of Potter and Petal Nostril.

1009
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:08,840
That took that little expensive annoying puppy dog Snuckles and imploded him or turned him inside out somehow.

1010
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:09,640
It must...

1011
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,240
It was...

1012
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:17,120
It surely has been J.R. Bob Dobbs himself on some mad ex-day-related spree out here.

1013
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,280
Probably with the consent of Snuckles.

1014
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,140
And Connie.

1015
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,320
Connie must have been...

1016
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,940
But why one shoe?

1017
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,020
Maybe that's part of some prophecy somewhere.

1018
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,940
Would someone who's not carrying a camera or a flashlight...

1019
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:39,800
See if you can pick up that shoe and put it in a lead-lined vault with that pipe.

1020
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,180
This is...

1021
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,960
We've got to...

1022
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,260
We've got to rethink everything now, friends.

1023
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,500
I just don't know...

1024
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,580
I just...

1025
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,580
How could he do this to us?

1026
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,660
How could...

1027
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,860
How could Bob...

1028
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,060
First off, what happened to the damn exes?

1029
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,860
And why is he trying to frame us?

1030
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,780
We could get in serious trouble.

1031
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,860
It could be the end of ex-days if word of this got out by Jove.

1032
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,500
Jekyll and Cotter pins aren't too...

1033
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,360
Too severe.

1034
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,880
What's with the Cotter pins?

1035
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,700
Yeah, Cotter pins.

1036
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,620
When you see Cotter pins in Jello, that means Bob was here.

1037
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,840
There's no other...

1038
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,680
The last time he showed up in an ex-day was the...

1039
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,120
Ding-dong.

1040
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,700
The one...

1041
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,620
The conspiracy called 1998.

1042
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,980
Could we make our way back to the...

1043
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,800
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

1044
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,480
We need to let the other people know that it was...

1045
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,180
That's real.

1046
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,460
For good...

1047
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,660
For better or for worse, I mean, what can we say?

1048
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,500
We can't call Bob...

1049
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,540
Bob a murderer...

1050
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,340
Any more than we are murderers for killing chickens.

1051
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,020
Right.

1052
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,060
Is Colonel Sanders a murderer?

1053
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,220
How can we say Bob is a murderer?

1054
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,560
Yes, well, it's a matter of...

1055
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,900
Just because he killed a couple...

1056
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,680
They were just Bobbies that he killed, okay?

1057
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,480
They were asking for it.

1058
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,080
The important thing is to keep this, you know...

1059
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,920
What happens at Wisteria stays at Wisteria, you know?

1060
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,100
I think that's what they say.

1061
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,700
The Howells are not what they seem.

1062
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,000
Man, I can't believe this.

1063
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,700
Fuck.

1064
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:16,120
Holy Jesus, fuck, fucking, fucking, fuck.

1065
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,160
Fuckity-fuck-fuck.

1066
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,380
I don't know.

1067
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,680
I don't want to be taken aback by this stressful situation like this.

1068
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:36,820
I don't want to be taken aback by this stressful situation like this.

1069
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,780
försö

1070
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,460
you

1071
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:54,320
I need a mic. I need to be able to tell people what happened. Let me put down this stupid

1072
00:43:55,060 --> 00:44:05,880
plastic helmet and silly plastic sword. Those things were no use at all. I don't know where

1073
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:18,140
to begin. Friends, no, I can't. I'm sorry, but I can't guarantee. You did sign that waiver,

1074
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:27,200
right? The liability waiver. I trust everybody did. Philo was, my God, could that have been

1075
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:33,780
Philo? That shell? It was literally just a shell. It looked like his skin looked like

1076
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,920
corrugated cardboard.

1077
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,900
Covered with blood. We don't, we, no telling who it is. Now, first off, don't panic. Don't

1078
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:54,240
panic. But, friends, what we found, first of all, cotter pins and Jell-O. A pile of

1079
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,980
Jell-O. We thought it was guts at first. Simple cherry Jell-O with fruit in it and cotter pins.

1080
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,440
Several different sizes of cotter pins. Absolute proof that J.R.

1081
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,520
Bob Dobbs was here and is the killer.

1082
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:23,340
To be enraged with a dumb brute that acted out of blind instinct is blasphemous.

1083
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:33,820
Speak not to me, you blasphemy man. I'd strike the sun if it insulted me. Look here, Starbuck.

1084
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:35,860
All right, I'm going to go.

1085
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:35,860


1086
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:35,860


1087
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:35,860


1088
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:42,540
All visible objects are but as pasteboard masks. Some inscrutable yet reasoning thing

1089
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:53,140
puts forth the molding of their features. The white whale tasks me. He heaps me. Yet

1090
00:45:53,140 --> 00:46:01,540
he is but a mask. Just the thing behind the mask I chiefly hate. The malignant thing that

1091
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,740
has plagued and frightened man since time began.

1092
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:13,980
The thing that molds and mutilates our race. Not killing us outright, but letting us live

1093
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,960
on with half a heart and half a lung.

1094
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,720
Keep us, keep us all.

1095
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:29,580
I don't know what to make of this. I don't know whether to be glad somehow that Bob is

1096
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:34,720
taking action. But I tell you, the last time we found cotter pins and Jell-O in a subgenius

1097
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,120
exhibit.

1098
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:41,520
The campground was in the next day of the what the year the pinks called 1998. We found

1099
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,420
also this broken pipe.

1100
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:51,940
What happens when Bob breaks his pipe?

1101
00:46:52,580 --> 00:47:00,460
A broken pipe. Connie, Connie's presence and she's not always a good influence on Bob.

1102
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,660
And then this.

1103
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,980
What's inside it?

1104
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,640
The A, not the, but A.

1105
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:05,720


1106
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,280
The A, bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

1107
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,920
But something's inside it.

1108
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,600
Some kind of stuffing.

1109
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:15,300
Well, I think it's just, it's stuffed with paper because it's made of rubber, Pisces.

1110
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,660
That's not a real shrunken human head.

1111
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:24,120
But the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer replicas are exceedingly rare. We know of only four

1112
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:30,160
on this continent. This is the fifth one. More evidence that Bob is running around here

1113
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,760
doing God only knows what.

1114
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,580
Certainly, Bob himself probably isn't in control.

1115
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,040
He never really is.

1116
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:42,560
On the other hand, since it's Bob, there's nothing we or anyone else can ever do about

1117
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:42,840
it.

1118
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:47,160
And he has basically by being Bob escaped.

1119
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,780
I mean, we could go tearing through the woods looking for him.

1120
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,840
If it was old sequel or a right bear or man bear pig or something, that'd be a cinch.

1121
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,660
We've got all these great weapons here.

1122
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,880
We'd be able to take them down.

1123
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,440
But my God, you can't hunt Bob.

1124
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:05,560


1125
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:10,460
But unless he wants to be hunted, you can't catch Bob unless he wants to be caught.

1126
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:15,040
And since we're not running through the woods right now, I'd say that indicates that not

1127
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,720
only did Bob escape, but he has already won simply by virtue of being Bob.

1128
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:27,860
And whether his acts are good or evil, that matters very little in the long run.

1129
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,440
There are some things man was not meant to know.

1130
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,080
God in his infinite forgetfulness.

1131
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:34,760
Oh, God.

1132
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:40,120
Managed to cause all sorts of strange things to accidentally happen, including J.R. Bob

1133
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:40,820
Dobbs himself.

1134
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,080
And for that matter, us.

1135
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:49,980
So friends, I guess it's whatever's going to happen next is up to Bob.

1136
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:56,940
But we can send him a message with when we go to the great burning tonight, friends,

1137
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:02,020
we can send a message to Bob that although he may break his own laws.

1138
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,740
He also must obey.

1139
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,080
His own laws.

1140
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,880
Well, he doesn't have to, but we can pretend he has to take out our frustrations on it

1141
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,020
by throwing things at that dummy of him and and laughing as he burns up.

1142
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:15,540
Praise Bob.

1143
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:22,320
And who knows, by expert performances, we may draw Bob in from the outer darkness.

1144
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:27,540
He may come to visit us if we make this a congenial enough spot for him.

1145
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:29,960
Oh, yeah.

1146
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,020
You go up and meet Bob after in the mood he's in.

1147
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:34,720
Dr. Howell.

1148
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,620
Oh, go ahead.

1149
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,000
Go.

1150
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,800
Go communicate with it, Professor.

1151
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,140
Oh, yeah.

1152
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:39,520
Yeah.

1153
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,860
Go communicate with Bob.

1154
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,420
Why don't you?

1155
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,940
Well, he's a reasonably intelligent life form.

1156
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:44,700
Sure.

1157
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:48,540
We ought to be able to as members of a similar species.

1158
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:54,140
Anyway, there's nothing we can do about it but live in fear or hope.

1159
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,880
It's up to each individual subgenius which path to choose.

1160
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,760
Which shall it be?

1161
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,600
The red pill, the blue pill or that polka dot pill that they the guy didn't even want

1162
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,380
you to notice.

1163
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,580
Meanwhile, we must let this festival go on.

1164
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:16,220
Try to enjoy the rest of X Day, friends, despite the murders and the failure of the

1165
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:16,860
world to end.

1166
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,680
Well, that was, we were going to be murdering half the planet at least.

1167
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,660
So what the hell are we worried about a couple of Bobbies laying out dead in the woods?

1168
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:25,760
Have fun.

1169
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,060
Small sacrifice by comparison.

1170
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:28,840
Praise Bob.

1171
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:29,500
Yeah.

1172
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:29,700
Yeah.

1173
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,220
Yeah.

1174
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:30,500
Yeah.

1175
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:30,600
Yeah.

1176
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,340
That's how I read it.

1177
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:41,560
You know, it's just a very interesting story.

1178
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:47,320
Yeah, well, we'll be right back.

1179
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,580
You know, we've had to talk for days about it.

1180
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:50,740
Oh, yeah.

1181
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,780
That's right.

1182
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,260
That's right.

1183
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:55,640
Yeah.

1184
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:55,980


1185
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:55,980


1186
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:55,980


1187
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:55,980


1188
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:55,980


1189
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:55,980


1190
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:55,980


1191
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:55,980


1192
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:55,980


1193
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:55,980


1194
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:55,980


1195
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:55,980


1196
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:55,980


1197
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:55,980


1198
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:56,700
Yeah.

1199
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,440
Yeah.

1200
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:58,440


1201
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:58,440


1202
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:58,440


1203
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:58,440


1204
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:58,440


1205
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:58,440


1206
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,120
this boiling blood and smoking brow.

1207
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,080
Why palsy the arm and the oar,

1208
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,540
the iron and the lance?

1209
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:16,400
I feel old, Starbuck, and bowed,

1210
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,500
as though I were Adam,

1211
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,840
staggering under the vile centuries since paradise.

1212
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,120
What is it?

1213
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:35,760
What nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing

1214
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:41,500
commands me against all human lovings and longings

1215
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:46,860
to keep pushing and crowding and jamming myself on all the time,

1216
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,640
making me do what in my own natural heart

1217
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,820
I dare not dream of doing?

1218
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,120
Is Ahab Ahab?

1219
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,320
Is it I, God, or who?

1220
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,140
Who that lifts this arm?

1221
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:06,240
But if the great sun cannot move

1222
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,380
except by God's invisible power,

1223
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,340
how can my small heart beat,

1224
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,780
my brain think thoughts,

1225
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,020
unless God does that beating,

1226
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,240
does that thinking,

1227
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,800
does that living,

1228
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,900
and not I?

1229
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,060
By heavens, man,

1230
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,580
we are turned right,

1231
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,060
round and round in this world,

1232
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,380
like yonder windless,

1233
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,500
and fate is the hand spike.

1234
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,120
And all the time,

1235
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,300
that smiling sky

1236
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,060
and this unsounded sea.

1237
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:52,160
Look ye into its deeps

1238
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,700
and see the everlasting slaughter that goes on.

1239
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,960
Who put it into its creatures to chase and fang one another?

1240
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,920
Where do murderers go, man?

1241
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,800
Who's to doom when the judge himself is dragged before the bar?

1242
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,140
No, please, everyone.

1243
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,460
Don't worry.

1244
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,480
This is not really J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1245
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,700
And if it was,

1246
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,460
it would be because he wanted us to do this.

1247
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:25,560
He does smell like kerosene or something.

1248
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:25,940
Yes, he does.

1249
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,400
I can't believe I'm...

1250
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,020
I can't believe I'm giving you盾

1251
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,160
Neither did I want

1252
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:42,160


1253
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:42,160


1254
00:53:42,160 --> 00:54:00,220
I was build to goay support going way over from the road.

1255
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,060
I guess that magic fire water really worked.

1256
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,660
His shoes are twitching.

1257
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,200
How can he play?

1258
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,380
What have we done?

1259
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,320
His face was the first thing to go.

1260
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,180
Of course.

1261
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,200
Well, Bob did give us one thing today.

1262
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:34,960
He gave us warmth.

1263
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,020
Thanks for the warmth, Bob.

1264
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,540
If you look close.

1265
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:45,680
Oh, yeah, his heart, his soul is glowing.

1266
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,880
I hear him talking.

1267
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,480
I hear him trying to communicate.

1268
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,460
Now this is altogether too creepy.

1269
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:56,200
Behind his face, there is an icon, the sacred icon.

1270
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,360
He'd burn his face.

1271
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,020
Oh, my.

1272
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,820
But the symbol of his face survived.

1273
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,940
He has been cleansed by fire.

1274
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,380
It's been purified.

1275
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,820
You can't see the icon.

1276
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,280
The icon has appeared.

1277
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,140
Bob's face is gone and the icon has appeared.

1278
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,320
Milagro.

1279
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,120
Milagro.

1280
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,000
Come see this miracle of subgenius proportions.

1281
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,620
I'm sure there's no danger of explosion.

1282
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:26,180
There's no way that Bob would be so fiendish in this weird fit of his

1283
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:27,420
as to give him a chance.

1284
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:27,820
This is the first time I'm in a range.

1285
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:33,920
I'm going to use this whole complicated thing to draw us here to be close enough to a small,

1286
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:37,600
dirty nuke in his glowing red heart.

1287
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,300
Well, you left the Geiger counter.

1288
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,400
Yeah, I did.

1289
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:40,720
Why?

1290
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,280
I shouldn't.

1291
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,640
What is that blue flame coming out of there?

1292
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,180
That's a strange river of actinic fire there.

1293
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,980
That's probably where the alcoholic beverage is.

1294
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:53,320
Reverend Fid Chooley went and lit a cigarette off of Bob.

1295
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,640
That's pretty disrespectful, Reverend Chooley.

1296
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,640
Well, now he can't.

1297
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,920
He's getting off better than he deserves anyway.

1298
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,340
I mean, really, this is a slap on the wrist compared to what...

1299
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:04,360
Oh, yeah.

1300
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:04,900
Yeah.

1301
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:05,480
Sure.

1302
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,420
Slap on the wrist.

1303
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,060
Not even that.

1304
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:12,100
I'm trying to smoke Bob, but I can't get close enough to actually light the thing.

1305
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,080
You're lighting it off the shoe, I see.

1306
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,080
The sacred shoe.

1307
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,960
Well, at least you get to smoke Bob's shoe.

1308
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,960
Again, this isn't really Bob.

1309
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,180
That's probably 808's shoe.

1310
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,440
Wait, wait.

1311
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,500
That's not really Bob?

1312
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:27,420
No.

1313
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,060
No?

1314
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:28,720
No.

1315
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,360
I don't think so.

1316
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,800
Well, you know, I was hoping I'd meet Bob here.

1317
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:33,820
He keeps...

1318
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:37,580
His secretary keeps sending me these very nice letters for...

1319
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,980
You want to meet Bob here?

1320
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:44,420
Do you realize what he did to some of the people here and their pets and their cars?

1321
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:48,280
Well, that's kind of why I wanted to meet him.

1322
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,420
I had a couple of grievances I wanted to address.

1323
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,420
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1324
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,900
No complain to Bob.

1325
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,620
Well, that'll happen if Bob wants to hear it.

1326
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,120
I'm not going to hear your complaint.

1327
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,380
So keep your hopes up, man.

1328
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,440
Oh, that's right.

1329
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,380
Never let your...

1330
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,420
Yeah, if he wants it to happen, it'll happen.

1331
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,480
I should never let go of my grudges because...

1332
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,180
Cling to your grudges!

1333
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:09,460
Right.

1334
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,780
Hold onto your hate and your perversions.

1335
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:17,000
Because the moment you let go of your grudge, that could be when Bob comes and then...

1336
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,540
You had your chance to kill him.

1337
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,060
Right.

1338
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,600
And save the world, but no.

1339
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,200
It's snowing.

1340
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,980
It's snowing Bob particles.

1341
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:27,620
Bob.

1342
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,120
Snowing flaming bits.

1343
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,340
They're flying up from the fire and snowing down on us.

1344
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,700
Dobbs ash.

1345
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,220
It's a good way to spread the poison around.

1346
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,240
Indeed.

1347
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,840
Wow, watching a person burn like that makes me hungry.

1348
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:42,700
It's like one of my old...

1349
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,140
I think it's time for another Slim Jim.

1350
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,040
...not to learn from.

1351
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:54,500
From hell's hot isopathy, for hate's sake,

1352
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,600
I spit my life out.

1353
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,600
I've lost breath at thee.

1354
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,600
Oh, dammit, whale.

1355
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,560
I should be ashamed.

1356
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:47,740
I'm carrying the gun now.

1357
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:47,740


1358
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:47,740


1359
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:47,880
I've got to come back after I get a brief wh

1360
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:47,920
Maybe he's left majors?

1361
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:48,880
Will you be my舒?

1362
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,180
Oh, no.

1363
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:19,320
I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

1364
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:57,580
To be continued...

1365
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:03,740
For more information, see www.subgenius.com.

1366
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,800
Praise Bob!

1367
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:11,680
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1368
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:17,920
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1369
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,960
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1370
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,460
But if you truly love Bob,

1371
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:30,040
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1372
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:35,520
you should go to subgenius.com, front page, or especially the radio page,

1373
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,540
or the catalog store pages,

1374
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,840
and help out financially as best you can.

1375
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:45,220
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1376
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,860
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1377
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,800
But some of you still have jobs.

1378
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,140
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1379
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,440
even if it's only...

1380
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,180
Only once a month,

1381
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,720
from enough of you.

1382
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,120
50 bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1383
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,420
All we're saying is that

1384
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,900
blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1385
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,480
We also take checks and money orders to

1386
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,260
subgenius.com

1387
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:17,460
P.O. Box,

1388
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,200
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio,

1389
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:25,800
44,

1390
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:33,040
Thanks for anything you can do to help Let There Be Slack!
