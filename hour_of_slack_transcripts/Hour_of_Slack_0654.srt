00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:13,680
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:28,440
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station and only in the city of...

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,440
Test, test, test, test.

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:40,240
Yes, dear friends, and I'm sorry about having to send out a rerun last week on the Hour of Slack,

5
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:47,920
but it was either that or never finish the rough cut of the X-Day video, and oh, it's going to be worth it.

6
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:58,940
I think there's really quite an interesting video to be culled from the footage from the five different cameras.

7
00:00:59,420 --> 00:00:59,980
The...

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,320
That's what I've been doing, and I've been healing up from an operation I had, dear friends.

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:13,840
My family and friends refuse to listen to me when I tell them about irrigating my nasal passages, my sinuses.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,760
And they say it's gross, and they flee.

11
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:24,300
But you, my dear friends and radio listeners, are sort of a captive audience.

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,060
Sure, you have the off button, but I bet you want to know how, after my...

13
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:38,080
operation for a deviated sinus, which is meant to clear out my sinuses and allow the snot to drain,

14
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,820
they drill...

15
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,620
There are already drain holes there, but they drill them a little bigger,

16
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:52,520
and they scrape out any polyps or other growths that may be inhibiting the free flow of air and drying in the sinuses.

17
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,180
After the operation, and after they've pulled the large splints and...

18
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,260
and...

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,040


20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,040


21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,040


22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,040


23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,040


24
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,580
long tubing packing material out of there,

25
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:08,940
they have me irrigate the nasal canal with salt water, my dear friends,

26
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,260
with a little bit of bicarbonate of soda as a buffer.

27
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,900
But it's like being splashed in the face real hard by a wave at the ocean,

28
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,460
and you suddenly get all this salt water shoved up at your face.

29
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,620
It's great!

30
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,040
You take one of those air bulb inventions, like...

31
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,040
much like the rubber bulb device used...

32
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,540
to suck snot out of a baby's nose.

33
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,180
You may not remember that.

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,620
If you're not a parent, you probably don't remember it being done to you.

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
But, um...

36
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,660
It's...

37
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,140
If you use a bulb and squeeze bulb invention, sort of like that,

38
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,480
and you suck water into the bulb and then squirt it towards the back of your head,

39
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,280
through your nose, hard enough that it...

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,300
As you squirt it in one nostril, it comes out the other nostril,

41
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,020
and down the back of your throat.

42
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,060
It's...

43
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,920
It's kind of a fun sensation.

44
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,460
Because if you do it right, you can feel it hit the back of your sinuses

45
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,600
and kind of back up against the back side of your eyeball.

46
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,860
It's not really touching the back side of your eye,

47
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,220
but it kind of feels that way.

48
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,880
It makes you go...

49
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,100
When you first do it.

50
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,360
Anyway, friends, now that I've finally managed to...

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,300
Oh, and I have to mention that little particles...

52
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,500
You know you're doing it right when little particles,

53
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,960
kind of reddish chips of things,

54
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,840
or strange...

55
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,860
Strange-looking boogers come out.

56
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,360
Now, it's in our local FCC rules.

57
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,940
This is not exactly obscene,

58
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,900
so I can talk about these bodily functions,

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,720
I think, without fear of getting the station in any trouble.

60
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,920
Okay, that's enough of that, friends.

61
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,480
I'm going to go back to the tapes,

62
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,180
the lovely tapes that we have building up around here.

63
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,480
Got a lot of new material from Hell Pope Huey,

64
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,580
one of the first radio doctors.

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,360
We hadn't seen in a while.

66
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,060
So, uh, we had a lot of stuff.

67
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,120
We had a whole bunch of stuff set up at X Day in Brushwood.

68
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,640
Oh, listen.

69
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,760
That's ESO in the back.

70
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,180
Sort of.

71
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,380
I think it's Chaz and some strangers jamming in the background

72
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,440
at X Day at Brushwood.

73
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,520
We, of course, have lots of...

74
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,420
Oh, let's just go.

75
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,420
Let's just do it.

76
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,680
I swear upon a box full of Marvel Comics action figures,

77
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,280
especially the coveted chrome Iron Man set,

78
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,880
that you're listening to the official divine ramblings

79
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,640
of the Reverend Ivan Stagg

80
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,540
on the subgenius hour of slack tune in next week and learn how you can win your very own repulsor

81
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,780
ray bob is a great shot with him thanks too i once saw him pick a mole off the neck of an obese

82
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:47,000
senator at 300 feet we are going now to the white house for an emergency press conference with the

90
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:22,560


91
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,360
of having been contacted by an alien species from another planet

92
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:35,180
now calm down everyone please the the aliens have assured me that they mean us no harm

93
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:44,440
they the aliens have an intelligence equal to our own but they do not resemble us physically

94
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:52,160
they are much smaller they are small enough in fact to fit inside my trousers which they

95
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,400
have

96
00:05:52,580 --> 00:06:00,940
colonized now i'd like to introduce you to the leader of the aliens but i caution you once again

97
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:10,180
they do not look like us they are more i would say snake-shaped i present to you fellow citizens

98
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:20,040
the alien leader now he has a name calm down everyone please he has a name and that is one-eyed

99
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,560
red willie and he oh iirler ë¬¼man i guess you got it woe lester it is woe existe but it is not a

100
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:22,560


101
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:22,560


102
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:22,560


103
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:22,560


104
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:22,560


105
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,280
I think he's going to say something.

106
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,880
I think he's going to talk.

107
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,120
Hi, everybody.

108
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,560
I'm an alien.

109
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,540
Do-de-de-lee-doo.

110
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,140
It would appear the president of the United States

111
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,680
has lost his mind.

112
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,580
As you can see, the alien has respected

113
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,220
the formality of these proceedings

114
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,120
by rising to his full height.

115
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,040
The Secret Service has seized the president.

116
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,580
You're going to anger the alien.

117
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,660
You're upsetting the alien.

118
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,060
They are attempting now to remove him.

119
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,580
We risk interplanetary war.

120
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,120
Now let go.

121
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,900
Please, no.

122
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,800
Shoot us.

123
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,480
He told me about all these lasers he's got.

124
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
He's going to shoot.

125
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,600
Oh, there he comes.

126
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,000
He's going to shoot.

127
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,960
Oh, he's shooting us.

128
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,660
He's shooting like crazy.

129
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,460
Oh.

130
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,120
Suddenly shut off, waiting for the approach of Zyra.

131
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,580
The silence, an eerie foretelling of the destruction

132
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,900
to come has won us last.

133
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,980
The hour of doom.

134
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,060


135
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,880
Things are flying.

136
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,560
Things are dying.

137
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,060
20 million miles to the world.

138
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,640
Here they come again.

139
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,280
The end of time.

140
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,200
20 million miles to the world.

141
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,900
Forward.

142
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,400
The world.

143
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,380
World.

144
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,360
Think you're going to go.

145
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,120
20 million miles to the world.

146
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,360
Mr. Mistmatch is all over the world.

147
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,160
20 million miles to the world.

148
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,620
Here they come.

149
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,640
Here they come.

150
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,660
Here they come.

151
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,500
Here they come.

152
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,640
Ha, ha, ha.

153
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,900
Here they come.

154
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,560
Here they come.

155
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,580
Here they come, here they come

156
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,840
Here they come, here they come

157
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:57,440
We're falling behind schedule. Trucks are waiting to load plasma and medical supplies. They should have been aboard now. Hurry, hurry!

158
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,160
Here they come, here they come

159
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:09,280
Here they come, here they come

160
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:16,400
Here they come, here they come

161
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,500
Here they come, here they come

162
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,100
Here they come, here they come

163
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,020
Way outside, far in your head

164
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,720
Twenty million miles to Earth

165
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,120
And the sky to the left, your brain goes dead

166
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,900
Twenty million miles to Earth

167
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,060
And the world's pulled behind, there's nowhere to hide

168
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,680
Twenty million miles to Earth

169
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,260
And there's nothing you can do, especially when you're going blind

170
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,660
Twenty million miles to Earth

171
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,600
Here they come, here they come

172
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:05,780
Here they come, here they come

173
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:12,940
Here they come, here they come

174
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,880
Here they come, here they come

175
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,800
Here they come, here they come

176
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,060
Here they come, here they come

177
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,620
Here they come, here they come

178
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,320
Here they go, here they go

179
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,320


180
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,460
Here they come, here they go

181
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,440
From the land beyond the arms

182
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,320
From the world of hope and fear

183
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,840
And did you speak mind?

184
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,300
And were Prem of fear?

185
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,420
It's Candy Frappy.

186
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,620
It's Frappy Candy.

187
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,400
Stop.

188
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:49,760
Eh?

189
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,980
You're both right.

190
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,780
Introducing new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

191
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,060
Stripes and stripes and stripes of colors, colors, colors, colors, and colors.

192
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,740
Colors that go below infrared and way above ultraviolet.

193
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,640
And the taste?

194
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,900
Frappy Candy.

195
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,780
Well, I can see these two won't need any words or worms.

196
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,560
For several days now, I should say, I think.

197
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,480
So don't forget.

198
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,420
That's new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

199
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,680
Now with Extra Dimension Love Hamster 16.

200
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,440
Habitual not included.

201
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,640
Tell Jeff and all your Acer friends, this one's the beans for maximum best fun.

202
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,400
Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

203
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,620
From Squidco, the Gobi Bar people.

204
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,900
Masturbation is a sin.

205
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,480
The masturbator murders an average of 25 million potential souls every time he succumbs to this activity.

206
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,100
That's equivalent to dropping a hydrogen bomb on Southern California.

207
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,400
Just for a few seconds.

208
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,240
Sick moments of pleasure.

209
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,060
To assist our young people in avoiding this wholesale slaughter of billions of human lives annually,

210
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,800
the Daugherty Corporation is introducing the all-new Daugherty Pocket Sex Diverter,

211
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,140
a remarkably simple device that plays an effective motivational recording

212
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,960
developed especially by leading psychologists from around the world.

213
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,380
Thinking about masturbating?

214
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,600
Simply click on the Pocket Sex Diverter, listen, and be saved.

215
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,040
Only we offer this exclusive radio demonstration.

216
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,980
Think about a nasty girl.

217
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,700
Would you like me?

218
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,700
I'm really nasty.

219
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,340
Quick!

220
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,800
Turn on your Daugherty Pocket Sex Diverter and listen.

221
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,340
His blood-gorged monster inched forward.

222
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,940
This is really going to feel good.

223
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:36,340
The woman squealed oddly as her midsection suddenly became transformed into a commercial ice crusher.

224
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,380
Hello.

225
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,040
I'm a girl.

226
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,300
Hello.

227
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,940
I'm fat and sticky.

228
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,760
Hey, I'm marching along, singing a song.

229
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,140
I really feel great.

230
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,620
Don't masturbate.

231
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,880
Hi, this is Leonard W. Kramer, president of the United States Steel Corporation.

232
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,580
I do not masturbate.

233
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,820
Although I could if I wanted to, I don't.

234
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,300
I am the president and chief operating executive of the United States Steel Corporation.

235
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,900
Smart kids don't do it.

236
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,960
Leonard W. Kramer doesn't do it either.

237
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,440
Remember what God says.

238
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,800
Girl, I'm nasty.

239
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,140
Boy, I feel better now.

240
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,360
Hey!

241
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,140
Let's play some ball.

242
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,500
All right.

243
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,460
Hey, hey, all right.

244
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,120
Hey, hey, come on.

245
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,360
Come on.

246
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,520
All right.

247
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:12,720
Come on.

248
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,920
All right.

249
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,740
All right.

250
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,000
The Daugherty Pocket Sex Diverter works, and God knows it.

251
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,120
Don't risk having to explain why you don't have one on Judgment Day.

252
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,440
Order your Daugherty Pocket Sex Diverter now.

253
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,540
Hello.

254
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,000
You've reached the Subgenius Foundation.

255
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,760
All our operators are busy right now.

256
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,920
If you're calling to order merchandise, please phone again at 1-888-669-2300.

257
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:47,460
At the sound of the tone, please enter your ten-digit priority code, and leave a brief, concise message,

258
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,960
Thank you, and praise Bob.

259
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,120
Thank you.

260
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,640
Thank you.

261
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,520
Slack is different for each person.

262
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,820
Although, for much of the world, Slack is nothing more than a good meal.

263
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,700
One might call it something for nothing.

264
00:14:51,480 --> 00:15:03,440
But the normals, the mediocritans, the somnambulacks, and pseudo-subslans have tried to make it something which we've been led to believe we must work to buy.

265
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,340
It is this yearning for Slack that separates us from them.

266
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,100
The human may live out his entire life in a grinding cycle of slacklessness.

267
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,720
His hours consumed by meaningless toil, interspersed with meaningless leisure.

268
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,020
Yet, he never feels cheated.

269
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,460
He thinks it's natural.

270
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,160
Perhaps we should pity them.

271
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,080
But face it, most people are venal jerks.

272
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,740
Half-witted cattle racing each other to be first to the slaughterhouse.

273
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,920
And stampeding you along with them.

274
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,280
Awake, I'm awake.

275
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:39,400
Awake, I'm awake.

276
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,900
More orange in the sun.

277
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,720
Tell them to wake up.

278
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,140
This one's not very reliable because there are no definite rules.

279
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:06,520
This is Dr. Onan's Wotan Band.

280
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,900
Now, the next thing you'll notice in the subgenius is, you will pay to know what you really think.

281
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,300
Go ponder.

282
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,160
Go ponder that.

283
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,560
Don't believe any of those other imposters.

284
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,500
None of them.

285
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,500
This is the real hello.

286
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,700
Wait, that third imposter said we could believe him.

287
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,300
He said it.

288
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,220
Yeah, that's me, though.

289
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,520
I'm the third imposter.

290
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,480
Well, that's the trinity of our Lord right there.

291
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,140
It said that it would come in threes.

292
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,440
Our third imposter.

293
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,020
Our own great imposter.

294
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:45,620
Hello?

295
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:53,160
So you're not only the son of the great imposter, and also a supernatural inquestory and bullfrog thing over there.

296
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,680
I'm the father of the great imposter.

297
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,640
You're its own daughter in some sort of cyclical retrench.

298
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,760
Oh.

299
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,600
That's terrible.

300
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:09,040
Well, they had, as I say, it was a genetically engineered mold, and they're able to, like, you know, clone it around your pet.

301
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,060
And it's this custom-made thing, and it makes your pet into, like, a slow-moving pet statue golem thing.

302
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,620
So you're explaining Stang as a preternatural mold who became golemized?

303
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,280
Osmolite.

304
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,720
Hey, I just joined the conversation, so I'm, uh, clueless.

305
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:26,840
Uh.

306
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,060
That's kind of the way we all are, too, Reverend Stang.

307
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,620
We, you know.

308
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,080
It seemed like.

309
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,480
Hey, we could form a club of the people who don't quite know what's going on.

310
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,060
And might be geniuses.

311
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,300
Except.

312
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,600
Except they're too stupid to be geniuses.

313
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,000
I wonder why we could call this a club.

314
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,060
Why we could.

315
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,480
Because we talk about many, many things that seem deep.

316
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,520
And we seem to get to the, the core of, of questions.

317
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,780
And then we, we get distracted.

318
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,760
Hey, I know.

319
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,540
Let's call that club the Too Stupid Club.

320
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,620
How about a bunch of frots of morons?

321
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,040
That's kind of negative.

322
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,760
Too stupid.

323
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:08,240
How about the, the almost smart, you know, that's, that's too show-off.

324
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,220
How about, how about something like this?

325
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,140
Under intelligent.

326
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,040
Below brilliant.

327
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,820
Oh, I'm sorry.

328
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,260
How about kind of smart?

329
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,940
Kind of smart.

330
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,940
That's not so negative.

331
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,180
How about.

332
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,140
I like that sound.

333
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,640
How about the.

334
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,080
Kind of smart.

335
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,040
The not too messed up club.

336
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,760
Yeah, but then we'd have to get a bar and a funny guy with a handlebar mustache and a

337
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,540
big orange pumpkin head to push us liquor.

338
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,500
How about the brilliant retard?

339
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,160
Yeah, how about.

340
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,840
Yeah, that's more like it.

341
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,720
I like that.

342
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,560
Well, but that's sort of offensive.

343
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,340
That is.

344
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,220
What, retard?

345
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,760
Brilliant retard?

346
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,200
Yeah.

347
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,060
Maybe it could be the.

348
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,520
The retarded geniuses.

349
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:40,900
Huh.

350
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,360
Okay.

351
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:41,820
How about.

352
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,400
That's kind of not.

353
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,060
Intellectually.

354
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,260
That's not very nice terminology anymore.

355
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,480
You're not allowed to use that word.

356
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,920
How about nearly challenged?

357
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,180
Uh, no, wait.

358
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,500
You already.

359
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,260
No, you can't use the word challenged anymore.

360
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:51,820
You can't.

361
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,900
Challenged is no longer PC?

362
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,160
No.

363
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,340
What can you say?

364
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,220
Uh.

365
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,140
Not really.

366
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,980
On or off?

367
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,860
On or off.

368
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,900
But off is pretty much, uh, you know, thought of as negative.

369
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,480
So you can basically, all you can say now is on.

370
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,720
The on people.

371
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,500
The on people.

372
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,020
The on.

373
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,140
So the on people are not.

374
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,000
The retard age.

375
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,480
And the retard age.

376
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,640
The no people.

377
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:13,940
The no people.

378
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:13,960
Oh.

379
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,820
And there's the sideways version of the oz people.

380
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,440
The bonobo people.

381
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,100
The done people versus the not done people.

382
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,260
The overcooked people versus the dunghill spiral gyros.

383
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,520
Didn't we figure that it was the bonobos and the no.

384
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,220
No blows.

385
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,200
The no bozos or the no.

386
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,200
The no blows were the ones.

387
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,720
The no blows.

388
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,580
That's what I was getting at.

389
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,060
The no blows.

390
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,280
And copulate with a lot of.

391
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:39,700
A lot of monkeys.

392
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,560
The no no blows.

393
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,080
Victor Bonobo.

394
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,860
The no bozos.

395
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,220
Victor Bonobo?

396
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,660
No.

397
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,560
Victor Bonono.

398
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,880
No, no.

399
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,240
That's not a real name of a real man.

400
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,540
No, he died in that helicopter.

401
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,400
He was a psychologist, a musicologist, a fish monkey squirrel, uh, entertainer.

402
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,400
Yeah, didn't he die in that helicopter crash?

403
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:54,720
Playing the underwater piano.

404
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,700
Playing, yeah.

405
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,480
Twilight Zone.

406
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,620
Yeah, his feet were chopped off in the helicopter accident with the two Mexican.

407
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,280
That was the day the music died.

408
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:02,740
Yeah.

409
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah.

410
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,400
That's what that song was based on.

411
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,160
It sure did for me.

412
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,460
Halle Berry.

413
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,040
I sent him a single white rose in one shoe.

414
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,000
Speaking of songs.

415
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,320
I got a song here based on a chapter from the Apocryphon.

416
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,060
I want to see Priapus with a drum solo.

417
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,820
You know, the big zonker weasel one.

418
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,420
The big smacker.

419
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,920
You know, the priaptic one.

420
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,260
You'll be seeing it soon.

421
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,360
It's coming your way.

422
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,880
And it's coming and coming your way.

423
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,900
Don't forget your duty.

424
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,720
Your duty is clear tonight.

425
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,880
As you look out on the strong minions of vast, vast sea of faces here.

426
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,300
Be assured that none of you will falter in your duty tonight.

427
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,960
When it comes your time to kill Bob, you will kill Bob.

428
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,080
You will stand forth and deliver that fatal blow.

429
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,040
And he will love you all the more for it.

430
00:20:53,300 --> 00:21:02,300
So stand tall, hold your arms and your legs high, and sing the happy song that we just learned a few short moments ago.

431
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,620
Tim, would you like to run me back?

432
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:03,980
Uh-huh.

433
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,760
Rafe, would you like to sing a chorus, please?

434
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,980
Now, Mr. Bleepo Abernathy would like to.

435
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,900
Would you like to lead the chorus in a song for Bob?

436
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,360
Oh, Bob is on your air.

437
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,020
And he is in your chair.

438
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:27,640
And as you stand before your guy, you can know there is none higher.

439
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:34,400
Bob is on your thing without a shingling.

440
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,380
Because Bob has that thing.

441
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,080
He knows everything is green.

442
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,760
Woo-hoo!

443
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,280
I forgot what the words were, but that was the original version.

444
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,420
That was a beautiful rendition.

445
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:46,800
Yeah.

446
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,380
It doesn't matter.

447
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,060
It doesn't matter.

448
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,080
We're going to kill him anyway.

449
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,040
Bob, everything is green.

450
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,400
It's beautiful.

451
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,120
Yep, that was the Green Bob song to celebrate.

452
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,160
It's beautiful.

453
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,380
Once again, folks, friends, this is yours truly, the Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

454
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:07,980
The reason why you haven't heard any new High Time shows is because I've been preparing for this show with Einstein's Secret Orchestra and the Church of the Subgenius.

455
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,980
And friends, I want to say it's been wonderful.

456
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,460
It's been worth it.

457
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,680
Because the shish kebabs were very well-

458
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,340
The bobs were delightful.

459
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,900
The bobs were the best bobs I ever, ever, ever.

460
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:23,100
And on the phone this evening, we're so happy to have with us the Reverend Ivory Shannon.

461
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,300
And the lovely Miss Dr. Lester Squanks also with the Ivan, Reverend, Reverend?

462
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,220
Is it?

463
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,420
Simply yes.

464
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,360
And what are you going to sing for us tonight, Barbara?

465
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,260
Yes, well, I have not made that decision.

466
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,540
My manager, you must talk to him.

467
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,260
And where would we find your manager?

468
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,440
He's right over there.

469
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,320
Ask him.

470
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,420
Oh, hello.

471
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:45,800
Yes.

472
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,400
What's your name, please, sir, for our broadcast?

473
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,680
Pablo Vigente.

474
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,880
Pablo Vigente.

475
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,200
Pablo Vigente.

476
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,000
Pablo.

477
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,400
Pablo.

478
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,160
Pablo.

479
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,320
Paolo.

480
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,320


481
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,840
Paolo.

482
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,600
Paolo Vigente.

483
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,540
Vigente.

484
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,560
V-I-G-E.

485
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,120
Vigente.

486
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,260
Yes.

487
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,260
And what, you're Barbara's manager?

488
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:08,840
Yes.

489
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,300
I manage the firm substance she called for a long time.

490
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,800
I mold her and shape her like a little piece of clay.

491
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,740
And boy, you can really see it when you look at her.

492
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,940
And standing before us tonight is Barbara Lashane, who is wise.

493
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,680
My Barbara Lashane.

494
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,820
Your Barbara.

495
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,400
My Barbara Lashane.

496
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,220
I worked her from some, she was small.

497
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,940
I visit her family in Puerto Rico.

498
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,940
And her fabulous success is only unequaled by even such likes as the towering Jesus.

499
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,780
The towering Jesus was pretty good.

500
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:42,680
But I don't think she got the kind of shape, the same kind of figure like you were saying the other day.

501
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:48,100
And of course the new Menudo show that, I think that outsold every single pay-per-view program ever made.

502
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,080
It did, but you know, nothing like what Barbara can do, someone she really put in her...

503
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,520
You mean she outflanks ten-year-old boys naked?

504
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,640
Oh, she outflanks them like a soldier without a weapon.

505
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,980
Man, she's scared sometimes.

506
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,240
Well, I think the entire Western world is standing by hoping to see this moment.

507
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,620
And I think this is perhaps the penultimate moment in hers and every career.

508
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,220
That may ever be and may ever appear.

509
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:10,780
That's right.

510
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,320
We have so many long distances.

511
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:18,800
So, Stang, do you have anything to say about this entire thing that we're about to premiere?

512
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,420
Yes, yes.

513
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,160
All right.

514
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,720
We're just waiting for him to...

515
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,960
Do you want me to say something or what?

516
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,920
Yeah, are you going to say something now, Stang?

517
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:37,400
Oh, it is this thing that we are about to premiere is by far the greatest thing that we have ever...

518
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,740
been about to premiere.

519
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:39,840
Thank you.

520
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,900
You can say that again.

521
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,100
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream.

522
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,680
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.

523
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:06,260
Row your boat gently down the stream.

524
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:17,300
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream.

525
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:26,360
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream.

526
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,380
That was wonderful.

527
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,700
That was simply wonderful.

528
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,180
That was the best thing I ever did.

529
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,300
I'm so proud of that.

530
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,840
And that was just the first time anyone has ever heard...

531
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,360
such high art.

532
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,100
That was commissioned by the same people that commissioned that opera by Stuart Copeland.

533
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,060
And Barbara, what do you have to say about that now?

534
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:54,380
Well, I'm just glad that this has all been acknowledged because it is very difficult to get that perfect, you know,

535
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,260
row, row, row your boat feel, you know.

536
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,300
And the opera house built for this was built by you, Charles Foster Kane.

537
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,020
Charles Kane, I can't believe that you're still hanging after all this time and making opera.

538
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:12,020
And you can go back to the opera houses for starlit wives who basically pleasure you orally and yet...

539
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,120
nevertheless, you continue with this chaotic lifestyle.

540
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,440
Well, I've been doing it for so long I can't stop now.

541
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,140
I tried to give it up, but you know I see a glistening tall monument like that

542
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,740
and I think about a voice like Barbara has and the next thing you know, I'm building a new opera house.

543
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,020
I was doing some work last week at La Scala as a matter of fact,

544
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,620
and believe me, I don't think time's ever going to stop me.

545
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,300
I like to build opera houses.

546
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,920
Build them and build them large.

547
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,820
I build them. I build them large. I build them big.

548
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,480
That's the way I am, actually, from the new Republic of Brazil.

549
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,080
Are you planning on starting any wars with your newspapers anytime soon?

550
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,580
No, I think we're going to burn the whole thing down,

551
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,880
because, you know, if you want the real kind of money,

552
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,400
you've got to go after the insurance money.

553
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,060
I never really made it in the business.

554
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:00,840
Well, our reporter from down in Arkansas, Texas, has this to say.

555
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,480
Oh, I have the watch. Pardon me. I can't hear you.

556
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,640
I said, oh, our reporter down in Arkansas, Texas,

557
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,160
has this to say about the entire thing.

558
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:18,200
What you have just heard was perhaps the most astounding thing

559
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,420
that I shall ever hear.

560
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,440
Hear, hear. Hear, hear.

561
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,640
And it's only available for an unlimited time now.

562
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,720
Do you want to switch gears?

563
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,840
Yeah, sure.

564
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,420
Whatever.

565
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,680
Okay.

566
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,340
Let's take a look.

567
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,940
I cannot hear you.

568
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,920
Let's take advantage of Ivan.

569
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,340
Oh, should we be closer to the phone?

570
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,020
Is this better now?

571
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,400
Is that better?

572
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,640
Not much.

573
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,200
No?

574
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,440
If you huddle down here, can you hear if we're down here?

575
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,420
I can hear that better.

576
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,200
Oh, well, if we all got down here,

577
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,020
and we could have, like, a real bonding moment.

578
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,560
Stan, can you hear me better now?

579
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,160
Is this better now?

580
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,000
Oh, except it kind of smells bad down there.

581
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,940
It's okay. It's just the cats.

582
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,360
Gather round the phone, friends.

583
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,080
Get close now.

584
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,460
Am I here? Am I near?

585
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,320
You have to kind of snuggle together.

586
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,000
It's the only way he can hear us.

587
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,060
Oh, now I kind of like it down there.

588
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,200
You can push me deeper down there if you would like.

589
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,040
It's so fun to step on you though, Dave.

590
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,740
You're so soft and mushy.

591
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,600
Yes, they were stuck in self-mushroom denial.

592
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,740
It was a mushroom of denial mushrooming around them,

593
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,720
fetid as the mushroom basement of cats.

594
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,340
Oh, I see.

595
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,720
All right, are you ready? I'm gonna do it.

596
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,640
Okay, here it comes.

597
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,740
The cat was in the next room expressing himself.

598
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,060
Fuck!

599
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,520
exclaimed the cat.

600
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,540
That was some great barbecue you got down there.

601
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,020
Yes, for it turned out their cat had come from down south.

602
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,180
Down where the smoke was so thick,

603
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,920
even the trees couldn't lick it off their own leaves.

604
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,960
I could spend forever down there.

605
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,800
Down south.

606
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,280
And the further he bent, the hotter it got.

607
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,520
And the hotter it got,

608
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,460
the more the steam rose to the top of the tips of the ceiling.

609
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,020
And the sultry-voiced siren waved

610
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,980
with her bra strap falling down across one shoulder blade.

611
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,820
And she called out to the subway car,

612
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,620
running hot, hot in this young subway night.

613
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,160
I can hardly hold onto these buttons.

614
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,160
Listen to that subway run.

615
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:32,200
The prizefighter's gloves glistened hungrily.

616
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,020
On the mantelpiece of the fireplace that lay with the war photographs.

617
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,100
On her family and the other families before them.

618
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,940
Going all the way back to the first families.

619
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,520
Let us share meat now.

620
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,140
And they shared the meat before them as they had a thousand times.

621
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,460
And a thousand bloody platters just like them.

622
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,700
And on a billion-zillion be-knighted,

623
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,200
beef-fouled, filth-covered,

624
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,380
encrusted planets like this one, dear friends.

625
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,040
Price-bop.

626
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,760
Quit your job. Slack off.

627
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,820
Quit your job. Slack off.

628
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,280
This Christmas will be the last Christmas.

629
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,740
And what are you getting Jesus for his birthday?

630
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,520
Jesus works very hard.

631
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,360
Down at the packing plant for the Subgenius Foundation.

632
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,220
Filling thousands of orders every week.

633
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,640
Sweating, blood running out of the holes in his hands.

634
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,460
He deserves a present this Christmas.

635
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,980
It's his birthday.

636
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,640
Let's remember Jesus.

637
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,480
Send large packages of unmarked bills to

638
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:57,620
Jesus, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

639
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,180
Praise Jesus, who is a God of peace.

640
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,500
Great friends and good youth.

641
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,300
Great meetings as classes,

642
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,180
great

643
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,280
left to die or to dive in to another existence

644
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,320
because so far the readings have not been positive.

645
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,160
Tom, we've got another remote.

646
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,080
It says that the radioactive levels have gone up beyond five,

647
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,700
which, as you know, means we may have to evacuate these studios soon,

648
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,760
but the children here are still our utmost concern.

649
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,160
Oh, come on.

650
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,400
We can provide our own roasted meat in the form of our own flesh that we eat.

651
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,200
And the children.

652
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,760
The children.

653
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,300
Look at them turning on their little spit.

654
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,640
And Harry Como roasting them with facing them in vast.

655
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,040
Man, he knew no mercy back then.

656
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,920
Was that just a transmission from the other Dave in the capsule?

657
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,900
That was from another idiot who stays up until four in the morning.

658
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,280
That's the club.

659
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,880
The club of idiots that stay up until four in the morning.

660
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:20,580
Yeah.

661
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,180
Only it shouldn't be a club.

662
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,580
It should be like the lodge or something.

663
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,560
It'd be like the moose lodge.

664
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,160
The guild.

665
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,560
Yeah.

666
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,720
We should be a guild.

667
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,280
It should be a mystic fellowship.

668
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,180
Yeah.

669
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,740
Yeah, a mystic fellowship.

670
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,140
Yeah, so it had a bunch of mumbo jumbo on it.

671
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,780
Yeah, we've got to have like a secret avatar or some kind of thing,

672
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,840
a figurine, like a little cat figurine.

673
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,620
The church of the idiots that stay up all night.

674
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,700
The church of the idiots that stay up all night.

675
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,380
So, no, the stay up before four in the morning.

676
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:49,780
Is that it?

677
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,360
Yeah.

678
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,740
That sounds better, I think.

679
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,680
That's the usual hour.

680
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,920
It's when the birds sound obnoxious is when it's best.

681
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,400
Yeah.

682
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,640
Tweet, tweet.

683
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,540
And who occasionally stay up.

684
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,400
Stay up until the birds actually are chirping.

685
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,080
And then go to bed for an hour and then get up and go to work.

686
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,420
Right.

687
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,580
It's your real job.

688
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,980
Were you guys spying on me last night again?

689
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,280
You can go teach at a university.

690
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,060
Oh, we are spying on you, man.

691
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,660
There are bugs all over your house, and we're not talking about cucarachis.

692
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,660
We're talking about, we know when you take a, when you're experimentally meditating.

693
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,660
We know who you're thinking about when you do that, too.

694
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,500
We know why you're thinking who you're thinking about.

695
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,100
We know what it smells like when you're thinking about it.

696
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,100
Oh, is that who was smelling my refrigerator?

697
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,720
This morning?

698
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,500
Yeah, man.

699
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,060
That's the guy.

700
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,440
That was you guys.

701
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,080
Okay.

702
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,300
That's the you guys.

703
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,840
Well, why didn't you just say so?

704
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,300
Well, because we were in our luminous bodies.

705
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,920
Oh, the luminous egg parts of your stomach.

706
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,120
You can't talk when you're in the luminous body.

707
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,440
Yeah.

708
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,020
Right.

709
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,980
And I was in that state between wakenedness and sleep called television.

710
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,540
I mean, the other people who are also in their luminous bodies can talk to each other.

711
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,020
Yeah.

712
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,980
But you can't talk.

713
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,740
Just say you were at that state between waking and sleep that's called television.

714
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,720
That's correct.

715
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:56,940
Yeah.

716
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,620
Yeah.

717
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:57,620


718
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,080
Yeah.

719
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,080


720
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,080


721
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,080


722
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,080


723
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,080


724
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,080


725
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,080


726
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,080


727
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,560
I thought I heard you say that.

728
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,700
I thought I heard that, too.

729
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,120
That's actually a quote from Les Brown, the television critic.

730
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,260
Oh, okay.

731
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,920
Yeah, that's a good quote.

732
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,300
I used to kind of date Les Brown's daughter.

733
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,840
Oh, the band of renown?

734
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,320
No, no.

735
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:09,540
Seriously.

736
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,540
This is a guy named Les Brown.

737
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,980
He used to be the television critic for the New York Times.

738
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,920
And one day, it was like really late at night.

739
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,180
The guy's actually pretty smart.

740
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,360
He writes like encyclopedia television stuff.

741
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,420
And I knew his daughter, Jessica, from camp.

742
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,960
We were sitting around.

743
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,180
I was trying to figure out a way to feel Jessica up.

744
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,280
Without her parents noticing at the table?

745
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:28,540
Right.

746
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,020
And we're watching some strange, banal thing like the A-Team or something.

747
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,720
And he'd had several brandies.

748
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,100
And he looked at me with bleary eyes, and he said,

749
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,540
There is a state between wakenedness and sleep called television.

750
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,200
This guy was a renowned TV critic.

751
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:47,720
Yep.

752
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,200
Yep.

753
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,120
I'm telling the truth there, too.

754
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,680
He was gazing at the meat on the end of his fork.

755
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,220
It was the moment of naked lunch.

756
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,600
Just for the sake of public record, I never did get to second base with Jessica.

757
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,240
I think I was born in the early 80s.

758
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,740
Well, you know, there's probably a good reason that you didn't.

759
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,520
That Bob had in the back of his mind.

760
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,800
He had other plans for you.

761
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,460
Possibly.

762
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:06,880
Possibly.

763
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,920
I want you to remember that experience.

764
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,340
You got to go with it.

765
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,960
You know, you got to be ready to go with that mission that's handed to you.

766
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,740
You were saying, Bob, let's run down there and mount all of those cows.

767
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:26,640
And Bob was saying, no, let's walk down there and mount all of those cows.

768
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,900
Oh, and you know what's great?

769
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:33,160
The older you get, the more you actually get to do those things that you thought you would never get to do.

770
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,160
Like, for instance, a greater affection for cows.

771
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:39,360
Like, I never wanted to have sex with, like, a whole herd of cows, let alone one, you know?

772
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,700
And, yeah.

773
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,020
You never went cow tipping, Dave?

774
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,700
Not with using old Priapus there, the old pluvia tube.

775
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,760
That was the whole idea.

776
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,740
No, I never.

777
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:56,280
I tipped some over just as a crude, rude stunt and a buff, but I never tried to mount one or even walk slowly to try and mount one.

778
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,360
For easier mounting?

779
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,460
I didn't realize that.

780
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,520
No, no, you tip them over after you mount them.

781
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,680
They don't even notice.

782
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,220
Cows, you know, you city boys don't realize how dumb a cow really is.

783
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,160
It doesn't know what has happened behind it.

784
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,500
You know, you could cut the back half of it off.

785
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:22,180
So it's timed legs off, and it would, about ten minutes later, it would turn its head around and move.

786
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,140
Notice that something had happened.

787
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,340
So in your childhood, you would go out and have sex with cows?

788
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,880
And then, like, butcher them with chainsaws and then tip them over?

789
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,640
No, no.

790
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,200
No, we didn't butcher them with chainsaws.

791
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:32,780
They're valuable.

792
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,820
You'd go out there.

793
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,680
Not just, this wasn't, like, for any real lustful.

794
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,120
It was mainly just to show off.

795
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,780
You know, a bunch of guys would go out, and the cows sleep standing up, you know, out in the pasture.

796
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,500
And you'd go out there, and you'd have your way with three or four of them.

797
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:53,920
And when you're finished, you'd knock them over, and they'd just fall right, you know, they, they're no fun.

798
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,020
We'd knock them over, and then we'd close Fireside Theater.

799
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,920
Oh, he's no funny.

800
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,180
No.

801
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:57,640
He'd run over.

802
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,820
And, and, and as far as I know, none of the cows ever had any little subgenius babies.

803
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:10,700
But the kids, the kids used to say, uh, Red Rover, Red Rover, let Stangy tip over in his neighborhood.

804
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,300
That's what they would chant.

805
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,300
Move over, Rover, let Stangy tip over.

806
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:16,880
Yeah.

807
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:21,980
Didn't you see Stang, like, looking like he does right now, only as a real little kid with the glasses are, like, really huge.

808
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:22,360
Yep.

809
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,760
No, I didn't have glasses then.

810
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,340
I looked exactly and sounded just like Bobby Hill on that cartoon.

811
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,360
I was on that cartoon show, King of the Hill.

812
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,640
Did you have a little beanie cap?

813
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,560
When I was that, when I was tipping cows, I was a little...

814
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,960
Did you have a little beanie cap with a propeller on it?

815
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,280
Huh?

816
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,580
Did you have a little beanie cap with a propeller on it?

817
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,220
No, I, I wanted one.

818
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,000
I thought you could fly if you had one of those.

819
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,900
Well, the ones that, the, the ones with the wings...

820
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,120
I thought you could fly if you...

821
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,340
Really, the wings really worked.

822
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,060
I thought you could fly if you became a nun.

823
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:55,240
No, Princess We had, had one that would make you fly, but then when the UFOs left, it lost that power.

824
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,200
Oh.

825
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,340
No, the one, the one you gave me.

826
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,060
The one you gave me, Princess, worked.

827
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,700
Yes, I do have the wings, but those are different.

828
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,860
Oh, yeah, these are the ones you strap onto your back.

829
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,660
Yeah, we're talking about the beanie, the propeller and the, and the, the lid of the helmet.

830
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,580
Oh, well, those are much less efficient than the wings you fit on your back anyway.

831
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,440
Is this the same as the, like, inflatable duck statuettes?

832
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,380
I mean, it does the same thing?

833
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,820
The slow motion animal ones?

834
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,200
Yeah.

835
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,220
I don't know.

836
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,200
I'm not sure.

837
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:22,540
How the hell are we gonna make it for, what do we got now, 300 and some days?

838
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,260
I gotta do this show for how many more weeks?

839
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,120
For...

840
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,160
For 52...

841
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,240
For 12 seconds?

842
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:29,520
I know the feeling.

843
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:37,520
I feel real sorry for the WCSB listeners because the ones that are real hardcore and listen to this show and Hour of Slack.

844
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,080
Yeah.

845
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,160
Because the next Hour of Slack is nothing but the last four of this show.

846
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:42,540
Yeah.

847
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,300
Re-edited.

848
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,120
Mixed with your re-edit of the last four shows.

849
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,200
So it's like I had the original shows and the re-edit.

850
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:50,880
Uh-huh.

851
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,940
And, uh...

852
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,520
And you're gonna be getting a whole lot more of that.

853
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,700
But yeah, he's sending you the tapes of the original unedited.

854
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,340
The tone of this show is gonna be getting that working out.

855
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,140
Channing's again.

856
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,200
Really good.

857
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:01,660
Blank.

858
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,420
Well, thanks.

859
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,620
With our Mel Bates.

860
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,740
You're having Smith boys more.

861
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,760
Realize who you're talking to.

862
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,320
I am the commander-in-chief of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force.

863
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:16,600
I call on all loyal Americans to picket the White House right to your congressman.

864
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,300
Don't let them pour any new water.

865
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,280
I have deposed.

866
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:26,640
Oh, for God's sake, let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the dead of seeing.

867
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,460
Once more into the breach, dear friends.

868
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,780
Once more into the breach.

869
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,460
That was after the Washington-Denis flap.

870
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,860
A UFO flew in triangular formation over the White House.

871
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:49,400
But you see, the brain of Charles Dorff is preserved in the British Medical Museum in London.

872
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,800
I've opened the skull and looked at the brain.

873
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,740
Now, the heads are a little bit large.

874
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,120
But after all, you see, megasophallic little people yourself.

875
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,480
Many little people have heads that are a little too big.

876
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,440
Oh, yeah.

877
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:12,300
Well, he helped the oil man who made the talk.

878
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,180
He is the one who told the oil man all about it.

879
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,840
These groovy cats could care less about what happens in Washington.

880
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,480
It's really not their bag.

881
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,840
It's like getting into the aliens, you know.

882
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,260
Going back and remembering when I first became an alien.

883
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,960
Now the big one.

884
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,360
Why?

885
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,160
Why is all of this being done?

886
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,320
What have they built you to do?

887
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,380
I don't know.

888
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,600
I don't think anybody really knows except...

889
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,980
that it's over in Moscow.

890
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,140
And my American operator here...

891
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,360
Okay.

892
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,000
To break the political juncture.

893
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,040
I'm cats right now.

894
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,220
I just don't diez know who I had this boy.

895
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,560
That's just the story.

896
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,560
But I'd rather have boomerangs and stuff as a partyã³

897
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,080
because those things are weird things.

898
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,680
But what the hell why are you here?

899
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:18,780
What are you trying to add?

900
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,500
Well, my friend and I have a lot of exciting stories...

901
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:25,720
I have a father.

902
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:25,720


903
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:31,960
anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that

904
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:37,040
has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president and by saying

905
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,560
conspiracy they're saying lunatic they're saying mad they're saying out of the mainstream and

906
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,160
therefore not to be taken account of you know if you find a turtle on a fence post it didn't get

907
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:53,020
there by accident and i just look at the landscape around here and i see just lots of big old turtles

908
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:57,920
sitting on lots of fence posts possibly the best book ever written on the subject of turtle stacking

909
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,880
she's got that right the the length and extent of this conspiracy is absolutely fantastic

910
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,900
actually that's where i'm going right now there's a vast conspiracy meeting downtown

911
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:14,520
that the proof of this the sophistication of this conspiracy is the utter absence of evidence for

912
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,100
the conspiracy that's how clever the conspiracy is at covering itself up this is about as

913
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,900
conspiratorial as a steam calliope he didn't believe there was a

914
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:28,220
conspiracy he didn't believe there was a plot but let's talk common right now yeah common sense

915
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:34,000
it's called conspiracy would you give me a chance it was a first class mess in my estimation aren't

916
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,360
you glad i never get political so anyway lenny and carl are never around on wednesdays and they

917
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:43,160
don't tell me where they go it's like a conspiracy a conspiracy eh you think they might be involved

918
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:51,020
in the kennedy assassination in some way i do know sources within the united states using perhaps

919
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,760
cubans

920
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:58,760
in this conspiracy i still believe that it is conspiracy thank you very much mr chairman super

921
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:06,700
patriots fellow crackpots members of the constitutional underground republicans and fellow

922
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:14,080

923
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:21,460
brothers kennedy he was very much upset very much upset about what kennedy had been doing to hopper

924
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:29,140
he felt uh sympathetic towards papa describing as a man very much of the workers very much

925
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:36,180
bobby kennedy our attorney general the most outrageous appointment since caligula named

his horse a console and uh my informant heard him say very distinctly that in order to do away

927
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:48,140
with bobby uh you had to uh get rid of the president of the united states and that you

928
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,880

929
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,640
christmas gift you slap stephanie still say him about earnest gilbert appreciating the

930
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:53,640


931
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:58,080
boucher doesn't have to bury us our leaders are burying us stupid as i am sometimes i

932
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:03,940
started digging about the kennedys jesus wasn't it too bad that bobby kennedy had you picked

933
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:09,880
up in the border to guatemala just to see what he'd say you know and then he said don't

934
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,700
worry we're taking care of that the editing keeri says you know you kill the head the

935
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,000
tail drops off you're going to kill bobby kennedy for years he said no you tell the

936
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,880
president bobby gets taken care of once upon a time a home on his dog with a lover i blackam because

937
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:22,880


938
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,820
in a deep forest. Out of food, the starving hunter sat by his fire one night and finally

939
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:30,240
he could stand it no longer. He whipped out his knife and whacked off his dog's tail and

940
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,060
put it on the fire to boil. When he was through, only the clean bones were left and he tossed

941
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:38,060
them to the whimpering dog who devoured their remains and then licked his master's hand

942
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,800
in gratitude. That's the story of federal aid.

943
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,780
Later on, he'll put the fire

944
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,580
every tree by the fire

945
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,220
to peace and a place

946
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,960
to life and to faith.

947
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,840
Plato said the penalty good men pay for indifference to public affairs

948
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:04,620
is to be ruled by evil men. I think we are being ruled

949
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,500
by evil men.

950
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,220
What can one person do?

951
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:14,760
Hello?

952
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,500
Isn't this what you're trying to do?

953
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,280
What?

954
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,800
It appears as though something has happened in the motorcade group.

955
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,740
There has been a shooting. I repeat, a shooting in the motorcade in the downtown area.

956
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,160
You shot that guy and killed him too.

957
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,340
Huh, huh, huh, huh.

958
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,400
If the hard disk of your mind is emitting smoke,

959
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,020
then the downright cuddly referend I'm saying

960
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,040
says the only cure is to douse it

961
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,600
with a big old bucket of the subgenius hour of slack,

962
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,220
which you're listening to now,

963
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,420
even as I lovingly baste my previous employer's

964
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,920
scribbled-up heart in a white wine sauce.

965
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,120
Bon appÃ©tit!

966
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,520
The only way you can hope to escape

967
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,060
the fields of heaven that William Burroughs after he died

968
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,780
is to mentally attach yourself to this weekly dose of

969
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,740
the subgenius hour of slack

970
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,620
with a suspicious yet riveting reverend I'm saying.

971
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,020
This station takes no legal responsibility

972
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,840
for making him the way he is.

973
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:48,580
Thank you!

974
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,140
Oh, quite welcome there, Hell Pope Huey.

975
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,100
Well, dear friends, I guess it's time to switch

976
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,000
this combustible Edison music in the background

977
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,180
over to Call of the Space Siren

978
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:10,100
and give you credit for sticking through this show for so long

979
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:14,060
and credit for those who helped make this show

980
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:17,920
so very, very difficult for us all.

981
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,400
Um.

982
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:23,540
Let's see, from the very beginning of the show

983
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,720
that business, President Clinton's announcement

984
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,200
about the alien leader in his pants

985
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,280
was from The Onion,

986
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:36,100
the increasingly famous humor newspaper

987
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:40,880
out of Madison, Wisconsin, there,

988
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:45,280
and they did a CD called Not For Broadcast

989
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,800
about three, four years ago, 1994.

990
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:48,700
Um.

991
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,060
Lots of fun.

992
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:54,400
All in good, clean fun.

993
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,300
Now, where's my notes?

994
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:55,680
Oh, yeah.

995
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:58,100
And Hell Pope Huey, who we just heard

996
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,980
with those hour of slack drop-ins,

997
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:05,340
he has dropped in again and did the drop-in at the beginning.

998
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,080
Of course, there's plenty of Einstein's secret orchestra

999
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:14,400
with Lonesome Cowboy Day and Chaz Smith, the maestro,

1000
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,560
Princess Wiardo, and Reverend Lepo Abernathy.

1001
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,560
Uh, guesting.

1002
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:25,300
And who, Reverend Lepo, who also did Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

1003
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:30,140
Um, the Dorothy Pocket Sex Diverter comedy piece

1004
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,760
was sent by Hell Pope Huey.

1005
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:34,940
I don't know who did that, but I bet it came from KPFK,

1006
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:39,220
the Houston, Texas, uh, Pacifica radio station

1007
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,960
that used to be cool, uh, a long time ago.

1008
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:48,840
There were some musical sweeps and amazing bits

1009
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:48,920
of music.

1010
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:48,920


1011
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:52,980
That's by Ludwig Sears, a piece called Low Flying Maps.

1012
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,160
That's not available anywhere.

1013
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,160
Praise Ludwig Sears.

1014
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,880
Uh, it's bits and pieces from, uh, the old hour of slack,

1015
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,260
uh, number 79.

1016
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,800
We're now on hour of slack number 654.

1017
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,840
And there we just, uh, switched over

1018
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,940
to Hell Pope Huey's, uh, lush background music.

1019
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,680
Uh, it's strange to think.

1020
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:23,800
That such a, a brute of a man, uh, could create such, uh,

1021
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,340
uh, lovely sounds and music.

1022
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,220
Anyway, uh, where was I with those credits?

1023
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,860
Um, also, uh, friends, yes, uh, oh, Onan Canobite

1024
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,660
did that song Think a Bob, fragment of Think a Bob.

1025
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,580
Um, again, lots of Einstein Secret Orchestra.

1026
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:42,920
A long, long stretch of radio business there.

1027
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:47,040
Friday Jones, uh, at the beginning of, uh, Show Side 2,

1028
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,660
uh, with her Christmas song.

1029
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,380
And, uh, the Christmas subgenius ad had background music

1030
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,140
by Yukon Jack.

1031
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,820
Praise Yukon Jack there.

1032
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:01,340
And, uh, uh, Suzy the Floozy, needless to say,

1033
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,880
did the, uh, Conspiracies Media Barrage,

1034
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,380
or audio collage, we might say, that was, uh, culminated

1035
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,200
in a Kennedy assassination media barrage,

1036
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,340
uh, blaming the Three Stooges.

1037
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,980
Uh, that will be continued probably next week.

1038
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,640
Suzy's Conspiracy Barrage is one

1039
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,760
of the most amazing audio collages I've heard

1040
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,240
in a long, long time.

1041
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,720
And in general, hers have been just, uh, uh, truly, uh,

1042
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:30,900
stagger-fying.

1043
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:35,240
And, uh, praise, praise the beautiful, uh, Reverend Suzy

1044
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,080
the Floozy there on WREK in Atlanta.

1045
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:43,780
And all of those of WREK and all the other shows

1046
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:48,520
who have come to praise Bob and to help us share,

1047
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,420
uh, his word and his deed with you.

1048
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:59,160
You, our beloved listener, to whom we so desire

1049
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:04,900
to bequeath what slack we may, but yet you know slack

1050
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:12,240
can be known by you only for you and all over you,

1051
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:15,520
on you and under you, and kind of getting the, your pants

1052
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,560
all over your lap.

1053
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,640
And it's embarrassing when you don't know that.

1054
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:18,640


1055
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:18,640


1056
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:18,640


1057
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:18,640


1058
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,260
And you walk across the restaurant or the classroom

1059
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:26,940
and they can see what you have done and that you had slack.

1060
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,700
Praise Bob.

1061
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,760
Oh, and you can have more slack, of course, friends,

1062
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,380
by, uh, getting our paper information.

1063
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,900
If you've never seen that, if you've only ever just heard

1064
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,380
the Hour of Slack radio show and other, uh, or even maybe seen

1065
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,260
the Arise video and, and maybe even checked out the website

1066
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,620
at www.subgenius.com.

1067
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:48,620


1068
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,380
Friends, long, long before those highfaluting

1069
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:56,520
electronic distractions, there was always the one true book

1070
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,280
and the second, uh, other true one book,

1071
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:05,560
the book of the subgenius and Revelation X.

1072
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:11,880
And, friends, you can get more print information

1073
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:17,200
in your physical mailbox, not just a flippery little, uh,

1074
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,620
signal going, uh,

1075
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,720
through analog waves on the air, nay,

1076
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,960
and not a digitally, uh, recoded, uh, thing oozing up

1077
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,960
out of your computer, but real paper you can hold

1078
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,420
and grip in your hand and tear up and stamp upon, my friends.

1079
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:40,120
And you can have it for free from, from good old J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1080
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,180
Yee-haw, friends, and that's in Dallas, Texas.

1081
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,340
Just get that, uh, pencil out and write to the Subgenius

1082
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,560
Foundation or just write Bob.

1083
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,540
We'll leave the pipe lit for you at P.O.

1084
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:56,300
Box 140306.

1085
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,380
That's right, Dallas, Texas.

1086
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:05,120
The zip code is 75214.

1087
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,320
One time somebody said, Reverend Stein,

1088
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,480
where did you get that fake Texas accent?

1089
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:14,800
And I said, at 7-Eleven.

1090
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,500
And that was the honest answer, friends.

1091
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:20,780
Christ, Bob.

1092
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,180
Oh, I should also mention Einstein's Secret Orchestra

1093
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,840
at P.O. Box 81555.

1094
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:37,780
That's P.O. Box 81555, Cleveland, Ohio.

1095
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,340
44181.

1096
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,860
For even when Bob lost, Bob won.

1097
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,360
4-4-1-8-1.

1098
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:59,180
You're listening to the subgenius hour of slack.

1099
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,760
Too late to stop now.

1100
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,620
You might as well go all the way.

1101
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,980
Going all the way back to the first families.

1102
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,560
Let us share meat now.

1103
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:15,240
And they shared the meat before them as they had a thousand times,

1104
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,480
and a thousand bloody platters just like them.

1105
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,040
And they appeared instantaneously.

1106
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,340
Stop with the meat.

1107
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:27,420
And the corn was roasted and looked so like a fish,

1108
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:32,520
they couldn't believe it until they peeled the very skin from the corn goddess herself.

1109
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,780
And she sighed.

1110
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,740
And she thanked the corn god.

1111
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,540
And the corn people danced before the moon.

1112
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:46,000
They held the corn high like a pharisee,

1113
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,080
for they wished to impregnate the earth

1114
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:48,620
with their own blood.

1115
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:51,020
With their own misbegotten ill-designed juices.

1116
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:55,260
It wouldn't be long before the corn god would reemerge,

1117
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,280
taking them all with it.

1118
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,740
And this was the night.

1119
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,000
The night their king appeared before all the others,

1120
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:04,400
and told them of the dress.

1121
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,440
The dress stained.

1122
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:10,600
Yes, this was the dress, the garment, the very soiled garment,

1123
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,220
as very much perceived in all the other ancient texts,

1124
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,600
of the garment of the king's mistress,

1125
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,480
which would be stained so,

1126
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,000
as to bring shame upon the king.

1127
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,100
But no, the king would lay upon the throne,

1128
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,620
and stroke it for all it was worth.

1129
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,060
Once again.

1130
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,780
And the corn people danced.

1131
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:30,940
They danced.

1132
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,460
Forgetting the words of the king of the others.

1133
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,000
And they danced.

1134
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,680
You know how them Smith boys are.

1135
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,300
They're meal blanks.

1136
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,180
Even when they're shooting blanks, they can still kill a stuntman.

1137
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:42,940
That's right.

1138
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,120
Who is dumb enough to put it up to their noodle.

1139
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:47,900
I wouldn't...

1140
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:48,840
A lot of those stuntmen,

1141
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,000
especially the people without their...

1142
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,280
all their limbs are gone.

1143
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,460
Well, the golfers, especially.

1144
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,160
The stumpy.

1145
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,320
You flip them off a building, and you don't even need one of them devices.

1146
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,700
Well, there's a whole union for those guys.

1147
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,580
The pro-stumpy.

1148
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,360
Yeah, they get a lot more...

1149
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,480
Their scale is a lot higher than the regular stumpy.

1150
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,120
You know, I think golfer head launching is pretty much on its way out.

1151
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:09,420
I mean, the palmer head is gone.

1152
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,520
It is in orbit.

1153
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,140
Thank Bob.

1154
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:12,840
It's left the planet.

1155
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:13,700
Yeah, thank Bob.

1156
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:14,860
It was ruptured.

1157
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,540
You were gonna launch a tennis player's testicle,

1158
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:18,920
and you said you were gonna do that.

1159
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:19,900
That was...

1160
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,800
You said about four different things you were gonna launch.

1161
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:23,680
I don't know if the idea of launching is maybe over.

1162
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,040
He said 20 pounds and 20 miles in 20 minutes.

1163
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,660
So you should actually launch your own homemade device right into the crowd.

1164
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,000
Your own little rocket ship you make.

1165
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,660
That should be the stunt.

1166
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,660
So we're gonna do that right now.

1167
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,340
Liquid?

1168
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,060
It's got a body part attached to it, or it's not a subgenius religious...

1169
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,940
Liquid or solid propelled, Dave?

1170
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,860
I would say it would have to be liquid

1171
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,880
to kill all the people on the planet.

1172
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:47,880


1173
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:48,900
Well, if it's gonna kill people in the front row at least...

1174
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:49,060
Yeah.

1175
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,140
Oh, solid fuel would kill them all, but you want a pretty gory scene in the front row

1176
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:53,520
if the vehicle comes...

1177
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,880
Well, once you start the solid fuel, you can't turn it off.

1178
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,920
You can't turn off solid fuel?

1179
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:58,220
No.

1180
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,020
Well, that's more dangerous.

1181
00:56:59,100 --> 00:56:59,840
I'd try that one, then.

1182
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:00,680
All right.

1183
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:03,200
What if you cut it in half while it's burning?

1184
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:04,600
You could do that, yeah.

1185
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,340
Is it still solid when it burns?

1186
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:07,100
Yes.

1187
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,560
So the smoke is solid, too?

1188
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,420
They could knock out a lot of people with a concussion, after that.

1189
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:10,620
Absolutely.

1190
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,760
Set up a concussion stand, make money.

1191
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,240
Smoke is...

1192
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,680
So you do like a combination of the liquid and solid?

1193
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,360
You can do that, yeah.

1194
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:17,860
Liquid.

1195
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:18,360
You can do that with a colloidal...

1196
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,060
Yeah, I was gonna say I do that every morning.

1197
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,580
But if you get a burn through, well, then you get what's called the...

1198
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:22,980
It burns.

1199
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:23,900
...the challenger.

1200
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,020
We used to call that liquid in high school.

1201
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,940
I'd just eaten too many hot peppers.

1202
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,420
I challenged her out, man.

1203
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,060
Yeah.

1204
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,920
You don't wanna do that.

1205
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,740
It's dangerous.

1206
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:36,840
It's unnecessary, too.

1207
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,460
You know, we lost another rocket.

1208
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:38,780
What?

1209
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:39,420
Was it yesterday?

1210
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,200
Man, they've been losing bunches.

1211
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:41,420
Really?

1212
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,460
There was like a $6 billion one or something, right?

1213
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,080
Yeah.

1214
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,440
Well, they're putting them little Evan Root Outboard Motors on the back of some of them.

1215
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,620
You guys are arguing about solid or flatulent food.

1216
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,840
Well, and they're built by...

1217
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,260
They're built like a woman.

1218
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:54,880
...union gremlins.

1219
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:55,820
Yeah.

1220
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:56,540
They're built like...

1221
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,760
Built by golems, actually.

1222
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,640
It's those experiments to... for alternate fuels, you know.

1223
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,160
Well, you know, if I was...

1224
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,160
Well, if I was...

1225
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:12,520
I should say when we put our satellites up, I'm just gonna use Chinese rockets.

1226
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,380
You know, that's what an awful lot of industry uses, Chinese rockets.

1227
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:16,620
Right.

1228
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:17,720
Yeah, right.

1229
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,420
So the Chinese are the workhorses of the rocket industry now?

1230
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,060
Well, they're good at putting your payload up in orbit.

1231
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:23,500
Yeah.

1232
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:23,920
With...

1233
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,500
You know, you...

1234
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,620
They're good at delivery, sis.

1235
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,440
Don't have a toy.

1236
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,560
Have we had this conversation before, or did I get an operation?

1237
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,300
No, I had that conversation before.

1238
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,260
I think these...

1239
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:35,800
Oh, okay.

1240
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,180
That's what I'm...

1241
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:36,620
...whisper in your ear.

1242
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,340
...when you had it.

1243
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:37,760
Yeah.

1244
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:41,140
Hey, well, we got a cruise from this...

1245
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:43,160
Speaking of rockets and missiles...

1246
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,240
We've got a cruise.

1247
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:46,660
We've got a cruise, man.

1248
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,420
Well, we're...

1249
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,680
Well, while we're all being silly tonight, I'll have you know the Soviet...

1250
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,700
Or the Russia has become a place again.

1251
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,240
Oh, yeah?

1252
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:54,600
A communist place.

1253
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,560
Well, the communists are gonna take it over again.

1254
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:56,560


1255
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,180
An evil empire.

1256
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:58,820
Cool.

1257
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,300
So much for the end of the Cold War, kid.

1258
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,400
The Cold War is gonna heat up again, because they're wacky.

1259
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:07,660
They're wacky.

1260
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,200
We're wacky.

1261
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,040
We're all wacky.

1262
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,860
So let's get guns and go do it.

1263
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:16,360
You'll pray for the return of the Cold War when you experience the Boiling War.

1264
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:16,960
I'm not gonna do that.

1265
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:16,960


1266
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,020
I'm not gonna do that.

1267
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:17,020


1268
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:17,020


1269
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:17,020


1270
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:17,040
I'm not gonna do that.

1271
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,980
The all-new Sloviet Union.

1272
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,720
You'll wish it was the Cuban Missile Crisis all over again when...

1273
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,120
Harriet, Bob, and Harriet...

1274
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,860
That's not just one crazed faction in the Kremlin, that's five different crazed factions in the Kremlin

1275
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:34,900
all armed to the teeth, competing with the two major factions in Washington.

1276
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,300
But thanks to Bob, you can be teethed to the arm.

1277
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:43,420
You'll wish you were climbing Hamburger Hill and Pork Chop Hill at the same time.

1278
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:46,640
You wish your buddy's face was being blown into your face.

1279
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,100
And July 5th, next year...

1280
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,920
How many times do you have to say Pork Chop Hill?

1281
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:52,920
Eating pork chops.

1282
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:54,080
Too many pork chops.

1283
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:54,940
Too many pork chops.

1284
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:54,940


1285
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:55,960
Oh, to sleep.

1286
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,900
Eating pork chops all year.

1287
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,640
I'll never wake up again...

1288
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:05,000
...on lullabies and dreams that Bob has found.

1289
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,760
Statue of Enter, only $14.95.

1290
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,780
This sounds like heaven.
