There's no doubt about it. If you live within a few miles of Bob, you'll die.
You'll die unless you have the self-genius power of Swag.
Friends, there's been a crisis, such a crisis, that we had to depend on help from WREK in Atlanta with the Lymph Node Institute
and from Radio Synesthesia with WCSB in Cleveland, because, well, you'll see.
Yetis and simpletons, we have a lot of fun here at the Institute.
But unfortunately, the fish has hit the fan.
Tonight on Bob's Slack Time Funhouse, we deal with a subject that we usually,
if for no better reason than the fact that we don't wear anything under our lab coats.
The subject is children. Not sex, but the unfortunate byproduct of sex.
You see, we've spouted a lot of ish here at the Funhouse, a lot of lies and garbage.
But tonight, I'm telling you the truth when I say that it has finally come to pass
that the pink man has come for our Yeti children.
You think this is hyperbole? You think this is China taking over the world?
You think this is Kerry winning the election? It is not.
This is an actual court case.
A great matriarch of the church, Reverend Mary Magdalene, has had her child taken from her
by a real, honest-to-God court as part of a custody case.



In the state of New York.
That alone is not enough to upset me.
I've met enough of you subs to know that most of you should only reproduce by recruitment
or through radio waves like the Institute does.
However, that does not mean that the ones who can and do reproduce should be stopped
from doing so.
Now, most of the subs that I do know have no business making children.
Buying children or being anywhere around children.
But this one has chosen to grow her own and from all reports has grown it exceptionally
well.
Hell, if most of you had a kid, I would steal it and give it to the state to save it.
However, this case is different.
Her child has been seized for no greater crime than her membership in the Church of the Subgenius
and her participation in X-Day Drone.
Think about it.
If they can use her church membership to take away her child, well, then what can they do
to you?
What can they do to our hobos at the Institute?
If they can take her own homegrown child away from her, then what can they do to the hobos
which are literally the bread and butter of this Institute?
I ask you.
So tonight, we'll be talking about children and childhood.
I'm going to be talking about the world.

You'll hear some old favorites and some new favorites.
And Bill Burroughs' son.
Yak, yak, yak.
And while you're listening, why don't you head to your favorite web browser and type
in rbevilacqua.blogspot.com.
That's rbevilacqua.blogspot.com.

On behalf of Dr. Timothy Leary, in association with the legions of illuminated social rejects,
and as an influential administrator and creator of useful chaos in these so-called United
States, I stand as a messenger of strangeness this evening.
In order to impress upon, or at least to instruct the honorable musicians, as to the
methods and motives of a truly bizarre reality, the weird revolution.
Thomas Jefferson, co-founder and president of this normally corrupt nation, said,
If God is truly just, I tremble for the fate of my country.
Secondly, there are some dynamics at play which I must familiarize you with.
I am a man of the law.






And I'm just afraid you don't realize it yet.
The so-called weirdos in this country stand as completely freaked out by the normal man,
as the normal man is completely freaked out by the Weird Mash's reaction to him.
Which came first you may ask, chicken or an egg you may ask?
Well, the chicken of course!
And it's time to Wednesday morning at seven o'clock.
The lockdown has been further eased.
White employee toward the roof, the handgear's off, the ataque is not expertise .

Ele Méカンタ, insure systems, Mach G disgusted.
Supreme supporter of this...

We made the news this week.
The Church of the Subgenius did.
Not the TV news, and it might not get that far,
but there was a child custody case involving subgeniuses
that suddenly, starting on, I mean, really,
just three or four days ago, it hit the Internet news
and was suddenly, well, I made a lot of money last week, actually.
Our website traffic doubled,
and all these things like boingboing and wired.com
and disinfo.com,
a whole bunch of those kind of fairly large news,
anti-authoritarian news sort of outlets started carrying this story,
and I'm going to tell you this sad story as quickly as I can.
Some of you here may know Steve Bevilacqua.
He used to help out at Starwood,
and he was my business partner on Subgenius after a while.
Well, on February 3rd,
of this year, this Judge Punch is his name,
took this child away from Rachel Bevilacqua.
She's also known as Reverend Magdalene in Church of the Subgenius,
and her husband Steve is known as Jesus.
And when they got married, she already had this child, Cole.
The child was the son of a previous boyfriend named Jeff,
and there's been a custody case.
There's been a custody thing going on for 10 years now.
The little boy's 10 years old.
Up until just recently, the mom and the dad were trying to get off.
The mom moved to Texas with Jesus to help run Subgenius.
I know that sounds a little funny.
And so at their expense, they had to send the child back to New York
or take him to New York to see the dad several times a year.
It was really expensive.
In fact, that's why he's not working for Subgenius anymore.
We don't pay enough.
Anyway, suddenly that whole situation changed earlier this month.
This Judge Punch called an emergency hearing,
and Jeff, the father, entered into evidence 16 exhibits taken from the Internet,
12 of which are photographs of the Subgenius event X-Day.
Cole, the child, had never attended X-Day and is not in any of the pictures.
Rachel, the mom, is depicted in many of these photos,
often wearing a skimpy collar,
and a black costume while participating in X-Day and DeVival events.
The judge, a very strict Catholic,
became outraged at the photos of the X-Day parody of Mel Gibson's movie The Passion of Christ,
especially the photo where Jesus, Steve Bevilacqua,
is wearing clown makeup and carrying a crucifix with a pool noodle dollar sign on it
while being beaten by a crowd.
The judge, a very strict Catholic,
was also very proud of Subgeni,
including a topless woman with a dildo.
And dildos were close.
His Honor also strongly disapproved of the photos of her in a bondage dress
and a paper mache goat's head.
Seen here in evidence,
this goat head was worn by the mother
in photographs seen on the Internet.
A goat head.
The judge repeatedly answered,
why a goat?
What's so significant about a goat's head?
When Rachel replied,
I just thought the word goat was funny,
the judge lost his temper completely
and began to shout abuse at Rachel,
calling her a pervert, mentally ill, lying, and a participant in sex orgies.
I wish.
The judge ordered that Rachel is to have absolutely no contact with her son,
not even in writing,
because he felt the pictures of X Day performance
were enough to suspect,
quote,
severe mental illness.
And the mom has not been able to have any contact with the kids since February 3rd.
This case has the potential to set a precedent that could affect all moms who have ever attended X Day,
among other things.
The stuff we do at X Day is tame.
Anyway.
You know, and if they can do that,
then nobody's children are safe.
And there's a mom's for Bob.
Judge Punch.
He should be dating Judge Judy.
He can take out some of his frustrations with her.
So, uh, Magdalene, how you doing?
Uh, well, uh, pretty good, I guess.
Tell us your story.
Okay, uh, well, basically, I sent my son for his Christmas break,
um, with his father in New York State.
Uh, I sent him away on December 18th,
and since then I've seen him once for one overnight visit,
because the, um, the judge actually called me a pervert in open court
after seeing, uh, some pictures of X Day
and the Detroit revival
and Modemax's explanation of the church from his Wikipedia entry.
And, um, yeah, they, um, the judge just sort of, um, flipped out.
Was there, uh, any particular legal, uh, argument behind, uh, taking away the truth?
Did they say that, uh, that you had endangered the child somehow?
He said that any child who stumbled across pictures of his mother
at an event like this on the internet, uh, would be scarred for life
because the pictures were so disturbing.
Kind of makes you wonder what the judge's mother has been up to.
Well, um...
You know, how is he so sure about this, you know?
Yeah, he's, he's really Catholic,
and some of the pictures that really bother him, uh,
So he thinks his mom was a virgin then?
I, well, he saw the pictures of, of my husband Jesus, uh, in clown makeup,
and he's, he's being crucified on a, on a crucifix that has a giant dollar sign on it
while wearing this clown makeup, and, and he's being beaten with a dildo.
And, and this was all a very high-level artistic parody
of Mel Gibson's crass and, and obvious attempt to make money off of people's deep religious feelings.
You know, the passion of the Christ.
You know, the story of how we satirized that is all on the web.
It's perfectly legitimate art.
But the judge felt that a child seeing that, um,
and knowing that his parents had participated in something like that,
um, that it would be damaging to a child.
So the, uh, wow, um, who has the child now?
Um, my ex.
Your ex?
Yeah.
The father of the child?
Yeah, his name's Jeff.
Hmm.
How does, uh, how does he feel about all this?
Um, he, he's the one that brought it up.
He's the one that, uh, surprised everyone by popping these pictures out in the middle of court.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Sounds like, uh, sounds like quite a dispute.
So I assume that the, uh, you probably don't want to comment too much on the facts of the case
other than what you have stated...
Right.
...uh, so far because it is a pending, I assume that this is pending in court, correct?
Right, yes.
Well, um...
I just, um, basically wanted to raise awareness about it because it is very expensive.
Hmm.
And I don't know how, if I can ask for money on your show or not, but I do.
Well, I don't know if you can ask for money either, but, uh, I can ask you if there is an address to which one might send support if one were interested.
Yeah, um, you can PayPal money to magdaleneatsubgenius.com.
Spelled, uh, just like in the Bible.
Uh, M-A-G.
Mm-hmm.
D-A-L-E-N.
Mm-hmm.
At subgenius.com and there is no O in the word subgenius.
But I'm sure all of your listeners know.
You know, uh, most of my listeners are, uh, kind of brain damaged actually, so I don't think they would know.
But, uh, thank you for clearing that up.
So that's, uh, that's one way that somebody could, uh, send support, uh, to help Magdalene and Jesus get the baby back.
Yeah.
And, um...
Well, um, just, um...
Just tell people to check out the website.
What?
Uh, what is the, uh, the specific address for the page with your, uh, story on it?
Uh, well, actually there, there is a page.
Um, I don't remember the address right now, but the story is on the alt-flag.
Okay.
So if people go to Google Group and Google, um, the group alt-dot-flag...
Uh-huh.
The story is up there.
Uh, is there a link to it from the main page of the sub-site?
There probably could be pretty soon, but there isn't one right now.

Okay.
So, uh, more information would be available at, uh, subgenius.com then.
Yes.
Wow.
That's, uh, quite a world we live in.
Yeah.
Let me tell ya.
Uh, yeah.
Uh, yeah, actually, I mean, personally, I think this kind of raises some questions about, you know, what kind of society, uh, you know, we want to have.
Uh, if, uh, I mean, basically children are taken away from their parents because of their exercise of, uh, you know, freedom.

Freedom of religion.
Uh, I mean, that's just a few, uh, steps away from, you know, taking children away for any reason.
Uh, you know, pretty soon the government will say that you have to, uh...
Yeah, um, and some people...
Well, here in Ohio, there's an interesting law that's been, uh, brought up in the state legislature.
I don't know if it's, uh, I don't know if it's been brought to the floor yet, but it does have several co-sponsors.
It would, uh, make it, uh, a crime.
It would make it illegal for, uh, the state to place a child, or for any child to place a child.


Uh, and, uh, it would make it illegal for a child to live in a home with anyone who is gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered.
Oh my God.
So that means, that means if you have a, a gay teenager as your child, in the closet even, uh, you know, and you also have a young child...
Yeah.
Then you're a criminal.
Whoa.
Even if you, I mean, basically that's the, uh, nature of the law.
God.
And, uh, I haven't heard too much about, uh...
Do you want to stay on the line and talk to some other people here, or, uh, would you just like to...
Um, I think...
I just wanted to say that I did, um, someone told me the, um, link for the, uh, actual page on SubSight...
Okay.
...that you can check out.
It's http, uh...
Colon slash slash.
Yeah, colon slash slash.
www.genius.com...
Mm-hmm.
...slash update...
Okay.
...slash m-eg help dot html.

And that's all one word.
Uh, html.

Uh, m-a-g...
Mm-hmm.

Yeah.
That's, uh, that's, uh, very useful information, and, uh, you know, I do wish the best of luck to you...
Oh, thanks.
...and your quest to, uh, you know, to reclaim...
Yeah, thank you so much.
...what is rightfully yours.
Yeah, thank you.
...and, uh, and I hope that, uh, hope that we'll, like, get to see you again at X Day this year.
Yeah, I hope so too.
And, um, yeah, here I am wishing all the best to you and, uh, and, uh, I hope that, uh,
and to your husband.
Yeah.
And, um, I don't know what else to say.
Okay, well, bye.
All right, keep it surreal.
It is easy to stay wrapped up in one's own little world, isn't it?
It's easy to say she should have kept her knees together, isn't it?
But if every Yeti woman who did the Wyrm with some pink retard was disqualified from the
gene pool, we would have died out 15,000 years ago.
What you are forgetting, dear listener, is that your mother is a zizh-swilling slut.
That's right.
Your mother is a load-absorbing baby machine, and that is the only reason you are here now.
If you have issues, if this situation makes you unaccountably agitated, then perhaps you're
not the only one who needs to be worked out.
Perhaps it is your mother issues which you need to work out.
For information on working out your mother issues, visit rbevilacqua, r-b-e-v-i-l-a-c-q-u-a

Oh, yeah, there, uh, also might be a couple pictures of her bare butt.
And now, more about your mother.
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child.
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child.
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child.
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child.
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child.
Sometimes I feel like I'm all alone.
The weird masses don't want to be normalized.
Weirdos want to be abnormal.
The freaks can't be formally normalized, nor can we be normally formalized.
What we want is complete weirdification.
Basically, we don't want weirdness from the normal man.
We don't want to be freaked out by the normal man.
We want to out-freak the normal man.
I think everybody out there who's ever been to an X-Day or considered going to an X-Day should keep this story in mind.
Because you never know when people are going to try and say that you're wrong, that you're sick, that you're a danger to a child.
Because of your hobbies.
When you don't advocate harming.
Yes.
It had nothing to do with a child. It was a clown.
Most kids hate clowns.
They figured it was funny, and they don't know what the rest of the crap in the picture is.
They don't understand that it's called innocence.
Keep those things.
Everybody's got some souvenirs.
A lot of people have souvenirs of days when they were a little more wild and crazy that they deliberately keep away from their children.
My dad had a big collection of dirty comic books from the 70s.
He kept them away from me until I was old enough to understand them.
That's how you do it.
Everybody does stuff that they don't want their kids to know about.
Always.
It's just a matter of whether there were pictures taken or not.
It's no different from keeping the booze away from your child's reach, you know?
I mean, how do you think it's going to be for, like, Jenna?
I mean, if Jenna Jameson ever had kids, do you think they would take her kids away?
You know what?
That's a good argument.
Maybe that's, by that judge's argument, you know, then that means every porn star in the country should have their children taken away.
Exactly.
In fact, why not the children of all movie stars?
Exactly.
Because when you think about it, movies are all about children.
Movie stars have been, you know, prostituting themselves in front of cameras in various different ways.
As Joe Cosby said, Jesus is the cure for a disease which you wouldn't have if you hadn't found him.
It's awful, though.
You know, they threaten.
Have you ever had one of them threaten to pray for you?
You know, they hold that over your head.
I'm going to pray for you.
That's their whole problem, though, praying.
They're all talking to God.
As if he didn't already know what they had to say and hadn't heard it 10 billion times before.
And they sure as hell aren't listening to what he might have to say.
So, you know, it's sad.
They believe in a God so weak that illiterate human po-buckers feel compelled to do his dirty work for him because he can't do it himself.
As Joe Cosby said, Bob saved me from people trying to save me from myself.
And it is.
Friends, obviously, insane Muslim fundamentalists aren't the only ones who destroy lives over silly cartoons.
Because that's what this is really all about.
On the other hand, it has caused subgeniuses all over the internet to start into these debates and arguments.
We're trying to figure out now whether we really are a religion or what.
You know, if they're taking your kid away because you're a Muslim.
Because of a goat costume.
The other people around were dressed as aliens.
Jesus!
By the way, she made this herself.
This is handmade.
The mom made it.
And the real reason it's a goat was because when little Colburn used to say,
Mom, why does the moon get smaller and bigger?
And she said, well, she didn't want to go into the eclipse of sun and earth things.
And she said, well, at some nights the sky goes.
And the goat comes and he eats away part of the moon.
And so she was going to dress, we were having a deity contest, and she was dressed as the sky goat.
But even if she had been dressed as a devil goat, even if she had been a devil, that's no reason to take your kid away.
However, another subgenius who is, well, she was saying, people may justify the judge's decision.
But nothing can excuse his demeanor.
Every litigant in New York State has the right to be treated with dignity every time they appear before any judge.
Hurling insults at people at the top of your voice after making a snap decision based on tawdry photographs is pretty much exactly what the people of Orleans County hired a judge not to do.
I mean, any mob with pitchforks could do that.
You also need torches.
But here's the response to her.
And this is kind of pertinent.
From a viewer.
A very good writer of subgenius, Nenslow.
Nenslow said,
Dude, I mean chick, you fucked with his head and blew his mind.
He, the judge, is a normal, probably an uptight dumbass, and he definitely lost it there.
It is my opinion that you screwed up, and I'll tell you why.
You went in thinking that an old coot who spent most of his life whacking gavel was capable of responding to wit and imagination.
The chances of that are slim at best.
When you go into that environment and place yourself in the hands of normals, you have to do your best to think like a normal.
Just as Stang has described in every one of his stories about cops and FBI men.
The phrase is,
Officer, have you ever heard of Mad Magazine?
Anyway, he said, you have to try to come up with ways, and this is pertinent to every one of us here, potentially.
You have to come up with ways.
You have to come up with ways of explaining things which they can understand, which won't make them feel stupid and insulted and angry.
If they ask you why you were wearing a goat head and you have to make up some lie,
you have to make up some lie that they will understand and which will make them feel intelligent.
Like how it symbolized the biblical scapegoat and was a reference to pre-classical culture of the Middle East.
Not that you thought the word goat was funny.
That doesn't make any sense at all.
And it was obviously too much for the guy.
What the judge means is simple, rational explanations, not incomprehensible non sequiturs.
A real good liar would sit down and find ways of explaining how those crucifixion pictures were a criticism of modern liberalism
and its destruction of conventional moral standards.
How those pictures of you naked were a tribute to the beauty of God's creation.
One thing's sure is that when you walk into a courtroom,
you've got no rights at all.
It's great to have ideals, but when it comes to reality,
you, you scrawny little wretch,
are nine times out of ten dealing with people who are not only more ignorant,
but just plain dumber than you.
And the thing that pisses them off the most is realizing that fact.
So, in other words, I guess she should have had a better set of lies ready.
And I don't know.
I've had to worry about, you know,
anybody who has kids and is a pagan has to, at some point, that's crossed their mind.
You know, how much does a kid tell the other kids at school?
You know, how secretive do you have to be?
Anyway, another subgenius preacher weighed in because there were Christian websites and blogs picked up this news thing,
and they were arguing really vehemently about it.
And a lot of them could not understand why are they mockers?
Why would we mock other people's beliefs?
And that's a perfectly good question from a dumbass.
Our friend, our friend Reverend Carter LeBlanc wrote a really nice short thing full of great quotes,
which you may want to use.
He said,
The Church of the Subgenius is an extremely decentralized religion.
Although its founders produced a good deal of the core mythos,
in many ways it can be considered akin to Lennox, its open source religion.
This is reminiscent of William Blake's postulate,
I must create my own system or be enslaved by another man.
Because of this, many people bring many strange things to the table
when they go about generating their own style and variation of what it means to be a subgenius.
Much of this is offensive in nature, particularly due to a consistent penchant for overdoing things.
As J.R. Bob Dobbs said,
Don't just eat that hamburger, eat the hell out of it.
Or you might say,
Whatsoever you set your hand to do, do so with all your might.
It may be unsettling to Christians in particular, primarily because it seems to target Christianity to an inordinate degree.
This is primarily due to the fact that Church of the Subgenius was founded in the early 20th century.
It was founded in America by people who came from primarily Christian backgrounds,
and we mock what we know best.
Spend time around a subgenius and you'll eventually hear them mock Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Paganism,
that's my specialty,
Atheism, Hinduism, Mormonism, Hippieism, just about any other ism you can think of.
Why do we mock? Because humor is the most potent weapon of the marginalized.
Some mock out of anger, yes, but most of us mock simply because we have a keen eye for absurdity.
Hypocrisy and irony.
It is our job to draw attention to these things.
Plus, it's fun.
In conclusion, I would like to remind you of Revelations 3.16.
Because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I am about to spit you out of my mouth.
Subgeni are anything but lukewarm, and as such, tend to be favored with a
swallow rather than a spit.
And you can't help, actually.
Did I mention the gay Bigfoot website?
There is one.
There is a gay Bigfoot website.
It's called mightyfudge.com.
If you don't believe me, check it out.
It's really funny.
The normal man who choices impostertunus can perform surgery on our weird women.
Yes, even your brother could be a victim of his plastic fantasies.
And if you weird out his daughter, he'll blast your ass.
What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
Are you freaky with me?
What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
So you can pluck out his feathers and smile.
Because you are defending our weird women from the freaky gander.
And you are the freaky ass thoughts of the bug-eyed, bow-legged, normal man.
If you believe that the circumstances described at rbevilacqua.blogspot.com, that's r-b-e-v-i-l-a-c-q-u-a.blogspot.com,
If you believe that those circumstances make someone a bad parent,
then you are a scruff in the head.
And I humbly submit the following as evidence of far, far worse parenting than most of us have ever known.
The rooftops are by custom the woman's province in Tangier.
And I made the mistake once of going up there during the day, and the Arabs threw little pieces of mud at my door for a week.
But Bill would go up there every night and watch the colors of the sky changing.
I would go up there sometimes stoned out of my squash to watch him.
He would stand perfectly still, right hand always holding a cigarette,
and only until it was finally absolutely night would he make the mad rush to the typewriter.
There was also an organ box in the upstairs hall in which Bill would sit, smoking kiffs,
and then again a sudden mad rush to the typewriter.
From that time on, Laura's mind began to go, and after I graduated,
I'd play guitar for her in the sunniest room of our house.
They tried to lich me and burn me and starve me,
so I had to come back as Bob Marley and Marcus Garvey.
I used to be Malcolm X, they thought they had me putting holes in my chest.
Now I'm on the planet as a one J.R.S.
Now I'm on the planet as a one J.R.S.
Ugliness continues, summer after summer,
cause the older generation teaches it to the younger.
The trick is to outlive the older generation,
let the old ideas die with the old education.
This is not the first time that I came to the planet, each time I do.
Only if you can understand it, I came as Isis.
My words they tried to ban, I came as Moses.
To the people that was lost, I came as Jesus and they nailed me to a cross.
They tried to lich me and burn me and starve me,

Billy Burroughs drank himself to death twice
and died decades before his father did.
Isn't that funny?
That's why I let him go on like that.
Anyway, let that be a lesson to you about your child rearing.
If you do it incorrectly, your child may wind up in front of a microphone, telling stories
about you.
And incidentally, if it's so good, why do they call it rearing?
To each their own, I guess.
And speaking of that, if you take nothing else from this, if you have no compassion,
no empathy, if you don't give a sh-
Hey, shh!
even about your fellow subgenie, then perhaps you can look up from your malaise long enough
to take this to heart.
Perhaps you can take comfort in the knowledge that there are people, yetis, with real problems.
Real court problems.
Real Catholic judge screaming at you from the bench problems.
And as always, we shall leave it to Devo to share his story.
to remind us of what is really at stake in all of this.

Think I'm only a smart boy,
looking for a real tomato.

The alien people suffering from space, which is the vessel of all that is nerd.
And even now I shall lead signs in the heaven and suns and the earth, blood energies from the earth.
My lights in the sky rebuke thee, the children of heaven, and the angels from heaven are heard thee spreading lies and deception.

The mothy marbles rest on the lips that he had
pressed in their bloom.
And the names he loved to hear
have been carved for many
a year on the tomb.
Oh, this guy sure did talk
purdy.
I got a purdy mouth
too.
Chapter
3, verse 4.
I see that our slacker
is available.
Number 984 is available
on eBay.
What? Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
It is from the
subgenius store on eBay.
That was a
sort of best of
using old,
old, old pieces
from the olden days
of ancient
mutantes.
It has Michael Papayata
and Gary Gabrogfran
and Puzzling
Evidence.
It's a rare doctor now.
Now, wait a minute.
You guys weren't supposed to see that.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the
climax of a remarkable
series of programs.
Now you and your family,
your loved ones and next of kin
can enjoy
thousands of hours of the world's
longest playing music.
The world's
greatest music.
The world's greatest
collection of musical
moth.
Where it is said.
In 78 RBM
phonograph records.
Oh, that was for
the used beat-up
tattered Revelation X.
Okay.
Out of print.
Okay.
Luckily, the negatives
for Revelation X
are located under
a secret bed
of mine.
Don't be too negative, man.
You're harsh and
slacker, man.
Like a flower bed,
Reverend Stank?
And so soon,
soon,
we will
some lucky publisher
will get to repent
the second testament
of the Church of the Subgenius.
It's in our fortress
of solitude
in Dobstown,
Malaysia.
But it's under the flower bed.
The Church of the Subgenius
is a special Church of the Subgenius
super underground flower bed
in Dobstown, Malaysia.
There, the Church of the Subgenius
is more the Church of the Subgenius
than ever.
You say it.
Saint.
Stupid.
The Church of the Subgenius,
for a limited time only,
will honor these torts.
You should have your
Book of the Subgenius
and a copy of Revelation X
on your extra meditation chamber.
Yes, so in the wee,
small hours of the night,
you can commune
through extra meditation
with your God.
On the porcelain God.
Which is the primary means
of distribution
of the Church's Word.
The paper is also very soft
and can be used after
reading for other
excrementational purposes.
It's particularly good to be used
after X-Day in case,
for whatever reason,
you don't make it to the saucers,
then you can use your book
as you will.
It's very, very nice paper.
It's a soft paper.
It's a pleasant feeling paper
and it's scented.
Yes, three-ply and it's nicely scented
so that after reading each page,
you can get a little bit of a

But you know,
some subgeniuses,
they skim through it,
they read page 50 first
and they rip out page one
and use it and that way
they miss a crucial,
the crucial instructions
about for instance,
depaking a prairie squid.
Some necessary thing.
Also right.
No, but the most important stuff.
It's all constructed as I see it.
Out of construction paper.
Here we come.
Now this to get the funniest.
Everyone we meet.

Yeah.
Okay, man.

You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
