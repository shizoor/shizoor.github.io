1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Stir it up!

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,220
At last I have control of your radio tubes!

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,760
And I do too!

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,300
Good! This is Ren Huak.

5
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,360
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,980
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,580
Happy, happy, joy, joy, happy, happy, joy, joy.

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:40,040
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, joy, joy, joy.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,740
And keep listening, you idiots!

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,120
Else I shall kill you!

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,680
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,240
Tonight we add another name to the long list of those we have honored.

14
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,700
The truth that I'm about to give you has exploded...

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,600
Mm-hmm.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,160
...in power!

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,140
Woo!

18
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,300
Woo!

19
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,160
Woo!

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,600
Thank you, though. I'm enjoying this.

21
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:12,180
Buried within the uncharted depths of waters surrounding a group of islands off the 50th parallel lies man's most formidable challenge.

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,480
The awesome awakening of prehistoric monsters long thought extinct.

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,340
Savage and deadly, their one hope is to rule our planet.

24
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,240
To rule the planet as they once had thousands of years back.

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,380
...and that ain't all...

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,520
...since...

27
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,520
Science was baffled and powerless.

28
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,320
This is confusing!

29
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,920
A terror-stricken humanity knew that it was on the brink of total destruction.

30
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:45,980
Ha, ha, ha.

31
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,580
Well, things are looking up.

32
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

33
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,720
A once proud civilization now had to place its trust and hope in Godzilla and his powerful

34
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,900
ally, Bob.

35
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,320
We must end this, Bob.

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,320


37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,320


38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,320


39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,320


40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,320


41
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,320


42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,320


43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,320


44
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,320


45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,320


46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,340
titan against titan giant against giant in the most spectacular battle yet but things weren't

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:13,160
normal there were changes mother bit me i never saw him by my fan it's a beautiful sight

48
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,200
strange frightful changes that night it all started

49
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:26,700
this was the nights of the crawling terror american international presents

50
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,400

have the technology have the tapes bob told me to make this not gonna resist and if during the

57
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,320
proceedings a small chlorine oxypropylene bag should drop down open the receiving flap and

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,500
inhale deeply don't ask questions prepare to have your mind scanned for possible bozosaurin traces

59
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,540
scanning now

60
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,880
Uma

61
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:30,880


62
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,260
Conductor

63
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,560
living room

64
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,300
Short

65
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,800
ister

66
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,640
A

67
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,680
R

68
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,780
From 1997, I calculate.

69
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,660
This cassette master here says,

70
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:12,900
Hour of Slack 356, Joe Riley Barrage and KPFA with Stang,

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,360
which means I must have been in California and done a show at KPFA in Berkeley

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,200
with Puzzling Evidence and all them.

73
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,580
And I know that Joe Riley did this incredible,

74
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:30,960
incredible sort of a collage, media barrage tape.

75
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,260
In fact, it says here some sort of note that I believe this is a rerun of a rerun

76
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,440
because it was run as Hour of Slack 681,

77
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,440
now being Hour of Slack number 918.

78
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,060
Only this is really number 1,608 and we're rerunning it yet again

79
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,560
because...

80
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:02,680
The great St. Joe Riley of Dallas died very unexpectedly of a heart attack back in 2007.

81
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:11,220
You can Google Joe Riley subgenius and there he'll be on Wikipedia and subgenius.com.

82
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:16,840
Riley is spelled R-I-L-E-Y, not the usual way.

83
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,240
You can see Joe's amazing video barrage TV show, The Hypnotic Eye,

84
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,420
on...

85
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,280
The subgenius TV channel on Roku.

86
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,040
OSI 74 is the name of that channel.

87
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,180
And on YouTube.

88
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,860
Joe's Hypnotic Eye is also on YouTube.

89
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,120
It's well worth it.

90
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:42,240
As you can hear by the audio barrage editing he performed way back in the 90s used in this episode.

91
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:52,000
And the other reason for a rerun right now is that I had an unexpected heart attack this weekend in 2017.

92
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,560
But I was helicoptered to Fort Worth.

93
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Implanted with a stent.

94
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,220
And sent home to face a low-salt, low-fat diet and very, very high medical bills.

95
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,540
So, I'm a little behind, but otherwise I'm fine as you can hear.

96
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,860
Thanks to new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

97
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,740
Take it away, Reverend Bleepo Abernethy.

98
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,380
It's Candy Frappy.

99
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,640
It's Frappy Candy.

100
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,420
Stop.

101
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:24,420


102
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:24,840
Eh?

103
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,120
You're both right.

104
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,080
Introducing new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

105
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,580
Stripes and stripes and stripes of colors, colors, colors, colors and colors.

106
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,480
Colors that go below infrared and way above ultraviolet.

107
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,420
And the taste?

108
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,780
Yeah, you're Frappy Candy.

109
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,620
Candy Frappy.

110
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,900
Well, I can see these two won't need any words or worms.

111
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,760
For several days now, I should say, I think.

112
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,740
So don't forget.

113
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,800
That's new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,240
Now with extra dimension Love Hamster 16.

115
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,000
Habitrail not included.

116
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,780
Tell Jeff and all your Acer friends, this one's the beans.

117
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,500
For maximum best fun.

118
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,360
Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

119
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,400
From Squidco.

120
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,680
The Gobi Bar people.

121
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,480
The preceding tape will cause brain damage.

122
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,840
Nothing to fear.

123
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,120
Buy something and inhale its fumes.

124
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,700
Or drink from its

125
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,740
Position yourself between the chair and the wall.

126
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,680
And exhale rapidly causing barking noises throughout the day.

127
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,980
Wiping the area with a lint free cloth can cause extreme visions.

128
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,300
Such as these.

129
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,340
May we think of the Lord and not of pain.

130
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,140
Authority is great.

131
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,520
Ignorance is bliss.

132
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,260
Peace is war with the devil.

133
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,900
This is the word of the Lord.

134
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,000
Amen.

135
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,060
Welcome to yet another Bulldada Audio Barrage tape.

136
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,960
Volume 1 couldn't possibly hold all the eclectic.

137
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:57,440
Eclectic propaganda needed to become a complete raving lunatic for Bob.

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,100
On this tape, you'll hear rantings from every two-bit.

139
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,800
The movie.

140
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,680
Actor ever born.

141
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,180
Cold precision auto monster boys.

142
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,700
And from hundreds of dysfunctional infortunates across our globe.

143
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,540
Oh.

144
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,220
Hi there.

145
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,700
How do you do?

146
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,740
I'm your new neighbor, Herman Munster.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,500
Thank you.

148
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,480
Welcome to Mission Control, space travelers.

149
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,420
Ah!

150
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,760
Come on.

151
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,200
This is a new episode of the Vietnamese radio show.

152
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,800
But I'd like to inform you, audience, or give a few minutes for Bob's radio.

153
00:09:59,560 --> 00:09:59,960
Subgenius's reporter.

154
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,020
What the hell are you doing, Lee?

155
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,840
I'm watching Bob.

156
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,000
You know, he's a lot less patronizing than Crusty used to be.

157
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,300
You backstabber.

158
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:07,800
You traitor.

159
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,260
You...

160
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,540
Snap out of it, Bart.

161
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,860
Um, I lost my job.

162
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,680
I had a job.

163
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,220
Now I don't...

164
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,160
Ah!

165
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,260
I want you to be like me.

166
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,500
I want you to worship me.

167
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,120
I want you to be like who I am.

168
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,060
I want you to be like me.

169
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:20,960
I want you to be like me.

170
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:29,780
I want you to enjoy the fearlessness that I have, the courage that I have, the compassion that I have, the love that I have, the all-encompassing mercy that I have.

171
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,980
I want you to be what I am and something greater.

172
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,380
I want you to give you more than I have.

173
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,260
I want you to be greater than I am.

174
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,960
And if you don't want to go this route, then go to hell where you want to.

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,760
But don't bother me.

176
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,320
I really didn't broken, you know?

177
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,180
Heal my toe, honey.

178
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
Heal my back.

179
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,240
Heal my bottom.

180
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,200
But don't you heal my mind because my mind is too sick.

181
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,640
Christianity was never based on the idea of an unknown God.

182
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,440
I'm going to cause you to know that you are what Jesus was.

183
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,940
Jesus said that every human being was a God.

184
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,300
It is written that you are God.

185
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,540
I'm a God and you're a God.

186
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,660
And I'm a God and I'm going to stay a God until you recognize that you're a God.

187
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,040
And when you recognize you're a God, I shall go back into principle and will not appear as a personality.

188
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,500
You are a God.

189
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,980
But until I see all of you know who you are, I'm going to be very much what I am.

190
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,100
God Almighty!

191
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,260
God Almighty!

192
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,060
God Almighty!

193
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,080
Call the next defendant.

194
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,940
Kay Bridges to the bar.

195
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,000
Silence, Kay.

196
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,260
Yes.

197
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,600
Your hands are covered with the blood of the thousands of souls that you have murdered.

198
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,440
Murdered?

199
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,060
But I never murdered anyone.

200
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,960
Not with a sword.

201
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,700
But you have sentenced a thousand souls to hell with your malicious tongue.

202
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,060
It would have been a thousand times better had you murdered them with a sword.

203
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,680
Oh, no.

204
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,740
But I never said anything about anyone except what was true.

205
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,720
I only spoke the truth.

206
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,160
No, Kay.

207
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,080
You spoke that which was true.

208
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,000
You said that you wanted to be true.

209
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:28,320
But granting that you did only speak the truth, who gave you license to defame and destroy the character of others?

210
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,080
The serpent with his venom and his ire, with his slimy, slithery foes and his noiseless crawl,

211
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:44,940
with his deadly call and fatal fang is the only fit emblem of the man or woman who stabs and kills the character of another.

212
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,780
Let your own words condemn you.

213
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,780
May 10th, 1973.

214
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,360
Linda's been such a good friend in spiritual health.

215
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,180
Well, when you've known her as long as I have, you'll really get to know her.

216
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,720
What do you mean?

217
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,840
She's not as concerned about your spiritual life as you think.

218
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,780
But I'm not one to say anything.

219
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,340
You just call me when you need advice.

220
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,000
Well, I've got a lot to do. I have to go.

221
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,240
Goodbye.

222
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,240
Goodbye.

223
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,160
Oh, no.

224
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,640
Well, I didn't think being a Christian was going to be like that.

225
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,400
I don't believe I want any part of it.

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,920
Oh, no.

227
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,680
Oh, my God. My God, have mercy on me.

228
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,480
I never realized. Have mercy on me.

229
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,360
You, Kay, with your gossipy tongue, have driven the babes away from my church.

230
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,940
You have in your lifetime destroyed the weak among my flock.

231
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,740
You never knew what it meant to show mercy.

232
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,320
Would you dare ask this court of mercy?

233
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,560
There is no mercy for you.

234
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,900
You are sentenced to hell where you will want be haunted forever by the souls you sent there.

235
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,380
Oh, no. I don't want to go to hell.

236
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,940
You can't send me to hell for something I didn't know.

237
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,160
I didn't know. I only repeated what I heard.

238
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,920
You didn't know that the most frivolous of all crimes is the crime of gossip.

239
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,320
Your record will speak for itself.

240
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:26,900
Oh, no.

241
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:40,080
But, yes, friends, send in that love offering, that check addressed to Tammy Faye Dobbs, daughter of Connie.

242
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,280
Oh, that felt so good.

243
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:43,940
I forgot.

244
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,460
Oh, look out!

245
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,540
Cleveland Donut Dunkin'.

246
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,680
Call her!

247
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,060
Call her right outside the building. Come on.

248
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,060
I hope you all enjoyed that brief moment of silence you had there.

249
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,820
It was almost a half second.

250
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,440
Oh, my goodness!

251
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,840
Come on!

252
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,100
That'll last forever in my memory. First time ever.

253
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,900
Okay.

254
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,620
Okay.

255
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,460
Oh, nice and clear.

256
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,920
Oh, we got some more.

257
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,520
Why do I feel that they're...

258
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,420
Bergman knew how to use silence.

259
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,160
The silence of the soul.

260
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,420
Sure is nice out here. I hope the boat comes, though.

261
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,780
Fellini knew how to use silence.

262
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,380
Gary said he was silent.

263
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,720
But that horrible boatman with his grizzly hands...

264
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,840
Yeah, I know. Don't touch him.

265
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,360
...a giant flaming orc...

266
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,680
Oh, yes, Mr. Boatman.

267
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,640
Please, Mr. Boatman.

268
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,940
And look, you have to put a coin on his tongue and it's all black and icky.

269
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,300
Climb aboard, Dr. Howell Robbins.

270
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,580
No, no.

271
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,280
And be prepared to go past my dog.

272
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,140
My three-headed dog's cerebrus.

273
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,960
Oh, he looks rather cerebral.

274
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:56,180
The triple-brained monster which guards the gates, the gateway.

275
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,680
Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.

276
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,060
What's he reading from?

277
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,060
It's a B-movie script.

278
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,320
I don't know. What's about this three-headed son of a dog?

279
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,800
I don't know. It's some kind of a...

280
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,340
Gee, you're right, Virgil, said Dobbs.

281
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,960
It is getting hot in here.

282
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,960
Yeah, I've seen that movie.

283
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,740
It's gonna be the Virgil movie.

284
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,880
Mmm, yeah.

285
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,480
It sure is nice out here in the ocean.

286
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,840
I think you forget all about the ocean.

287
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,320
Oh, look out.

288
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,720
Oh, look out.

289
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,440
Oh, look out.

290
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,460
Oh, look out.

291
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:40,820
Oh, look out.

292
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:40,960


293
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:40,960


294
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,060
Oh, look out.

295
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,880
Oh, look out.

296
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,620
All right, all right, all right.

297
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:43,620


298
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,360
What was that?

299
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,360


300
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,360


301
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,680
Give him a footbridge!

302
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,820
Site-sh şimdi.

303
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,000
An expertoritiz.

304
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,500
He has been brought to the reactor

305
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:54,520
by the

306
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,080
and everyone,

307
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:10,880
Joe Komperster and Maureen Gre pickled on Be Seo,

308
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,120
he scraped his hindquarters across the floor,

309
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,280
howling and dribbling from all three heads simultaneously.

310
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,540
Huge kicks the size of small land crabs

311
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,820
leaped from his fur-sparse epidermis.

312
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,400
Suddenly the dog leaped across the vast expanse of hell

313
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,240
and saddled up to Ivan's leg.

314
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,580
He was forced to be on the show hour after hour.

315
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,520
Pino, why did you make me do that horrible thing?

316
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,000
Yes, the bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling

317
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,300
for you and not for me.

318
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,840
Take my glands away, King P-Dog.

319
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,440
Bang-a-ling-a-ling and ring eternally.

320
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,760
Yeah, they don't ever stop.

321
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,300
That's from Cerebus the P-Dog.

322
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,820
They all go for Ivan's leg.

323
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,920
Ow! Get those horrible little poodles off of me!

324
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,360
I hate poodles!

325
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,660
That was Madame Lusonga and her dancing chihuahuas

326
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,340
performing once again on the subgenius hour of mystery and dark.

327
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,320
That was really a beautiful little dance number, Dr. Howell.

328
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,120
What a nice service.

329
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,600
Yeah, you wouldn't think they were capable of that.

330
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:11,820
Oh, yeah.

331
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,680
And when's Michael Jackson gonna be on?

332
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,380
I heard��

333
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,300
I heard, uh, there is a certain song that I have to play

334
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,740
between every other song that we play.

335
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,680
It's called the 2-N-UP song, you know.

336
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,720
Whoops!

337
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,620
All that kind of arrested by Elvis Presley and stuff.

338
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,160
Yeah, man, everyone down there can sit down.

339
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,260
That's like a real record there, yeah.

340
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,280
Maimus and Wideth

341
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,440
They're playing P Satan and the Öなら

342
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:36,660
jogamolley

343
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,940
as shagging continues...

344
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,740
Thank you very much.

345
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:40,860
We're in Iceland. That's what we're doing today.

346
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,920
Thank you very much.

347
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,920
We sold a million records on that one right there.

348
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,900
And all that bull.

349
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,060
Slack!

350
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,620
You Slack yourself!

351
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,320
Slack beyond your wildest dreams.

352
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,620
Right now it's Slack!

353
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:06,960
Slack!

354
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,780
You have the power to find Slack!

355
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,340
Good something for nothing!

356
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,740
Credit cards are taken!

357
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,680
Slack!

358
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,900
Send cash!

359
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,480
I want more Slack!

360
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,100
Send your money now!

361
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,540
Conspiracy denied me again!

362
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,040
Send your money!

363
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,040
I will have my Slack!

364
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,760
Your Slack channel's been adhered!

365
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,580
Slack!

366
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,620
Now you're Slack!

367
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,240
You Slack!

368
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,860
You Slack!

369
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,260
You're very old!

370
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,140
All sorts of Slack!

371
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,420
You Slack!

372
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,500
Every kind of Slack imaginable!

373
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,680
Slack!

374
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,400
Slack from the other side of the world!

375
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,780
Slack from right next door!

376
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,800
Here you go!

377
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,460
Slack shows!

378
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,800
Slack shows, my ladies and gentlemen!

379
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,120
You Slack!

380
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,600
My Slack!

381
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:06,800
Right here!

382
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,420
Right now!

383
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,840
You Slack!

384
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,340
We have you Slack!

385
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,780
Just remember,

386
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,840
the food is in the ghetto.

387
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,200
Nothing worse than putting somebody in the corner

388
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,540
when they've tried over and over and over to do righteousness

389
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,400
and no one received it.

390
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,120
You get them in a corner, they're extremely dangerous.

391
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,120
I want my Slack!

392
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:35,720
Slack!

393
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,020
Who's Slack will find definition?

394
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,300
It's defundable!

395
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,760
This?

396
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,280
You can't prove anything.

397
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,680
Extremely dangerous, aren't they?

398
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,980
I think you can sense the hands of these people

399
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,660
that we are nonviolent people, but we are extremely dangerous.

400
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,560
You know what you are?

401
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:50,560


402
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,020
Slack!

403
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:51,660
Slack!

404
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,040
Slack!

405
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,600
Slack!

406
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:52,980
Slack!

407
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,320
Slack!

408
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,540
Slack!

409
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,740
If you have the chance, you can have your Slack.

410
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,840
Money is Slack!

411
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,780
Something for nothing.

412
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,580
Slack is green.

413
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,780
Slack!

414
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,700
Slack is government control for your protection.

415
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,900
I want more Slack.

416
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,040
Slack is not for everyone.

417
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,300
You cannot take my Slack away.

418
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,860
Slack can be taken by prescription.

419
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,280
I want more Slack!

420
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,280
I want more Slack!

421
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:33,640
I want more Slack!

422
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,180
I want more Slack!

423
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,760
I want more Slack!

424
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,100
Slack is great.

425
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,320
Slack!

426
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:36,660


427
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:36,660


428
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,960
Slack is great.

429
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,600
Slack is free.

430
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,200
Just remember...

431
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,260
You don't have anything on me that I care about,

432
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,200
because everything that you have on me,

433
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,560
I've let it all hang right out for everybody to see.

434
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,260
Now you forget to worry about yourself.

435
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,700
I don't mind losing my life.

436
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,380
What about you?

437
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,660
I don't mind losing my reputation.

438
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:12,380
What about you? I don't mind being tortured. What about you? I'm just no longer afraid,

439
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:19,600
and I've lost interest in this old world of capitalist sin. Racism, I've lost interest in it.

440
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:25,340
So if somebody wants to make me stay in it by compromising with filthy-minded people

441
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,560
that cannot even have respect for somebody that would die for even his enemies,

442
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:36,500
and they want to cause anarchy in our midst, I would just as soon bring it all to a gallant,

443
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,980
a glorious screaming in.

444
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,580
Ah!

445
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,420
Your ultimate goal on this adventure through inner space

446
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:06,180
will be the very hub of this microcosmic solar system, the atomic nucleus.

447
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,820
Its capabilities are almost unimaginable.

448
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:17,040
It is a million times smaller than the atom, and yet it contains 99% of the atom's weight.

449
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:24,560
The density of the nucleus is such that if we had one cubic centimeter, half a teaspoon,

450
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,700
it would weigh 100 million tons.

451
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,400
And at the same time...

452
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:36,080
With 250 units of tetanus-immune globulin human, administered in the contralateral gluteal muscles.

453
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,920
An educational service of the Longines-Whipnor watch company.

454
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,560
I have a wonderful free gift waiting for you now.

455
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,640
Introducing new candy frappy frappy candy.

456
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,620
Attaboy, Luther!

457
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,100
Uh, when I was asked to be guest speaker at this luncheon,

458
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,220
I asked myself this.

459
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:11,160
Who are you, Luther Higgs, to be the guest speaker at this luncheon?

460
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:19,360
I thought about my answer about being guest speaker for a long time.

461
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,820
What is a guest speaker?

462
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,560
Let me clarify this.

463
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,280
I have been called brave.

464
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,800
What is brave?

465
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,400
Let me clarify this.

466
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,300
Of course we all know that it is short for bravery.

467
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,620
That goes without even being said.

468
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,540
But it is also a symbol of another thing.

469
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,840
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

470
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,540
Thank you, sir.

471
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:56,540


472
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:56,540


473
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:56,540


474
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:56,540


475
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:56,540


476
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:56,540


477
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,440
Thank you for having me.

478
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,800
It's real quiet there.

479
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,900
I'll let you, I'll leave it.

480
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,060
I won't say anything, I'll let you listen to it now.

481
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,440
Ah!

482
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,560
Ah!

483
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,560
Ah!

484
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,100


485
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:11,660
Ah!

486
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:11,960


487
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,180
Ah!

488
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:12,300


489
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:12,500
Ah!

490
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:12,820
Ah!

491
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:12,820


492
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,720
Ah!

493
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,140
Ah!

494
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,680
Ah!

495
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:16,640
Ah!

496
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,520
Ah!

497
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,280
Ah!

498
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,800
For your own listening pleasure,

499
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:34,220
please be sure that your balance control is now in the center position.

500
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,460
Thank you.

501
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,340
I am in aluminum foil now.

502
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,080
I think it's got to be done. I don't think it can be helped.

503
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,560
Oh, all right!

504
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,300
Dirt!

505
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,600
Oh, all right!

506
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,700
Dirt!

507
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,060
Oh, all right!

508
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,640
Well, he thought he was rolling.

509
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,920
Your flesh will speak, your heart will bump, your nerves will paralyze,

510
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,900
as you shall hear the strangest things that never met your eyes.

511
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,720
They're not that strange, Al.

512
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:05,680
Yes, you'll travel into the chilling, thrilling, slimy, haunted radio station.

513
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,240
Just sign on the dotted line, little boys and girls.

514
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,720
And now you've bought an interest in the Captain B. Park PC.

515
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,700
There's a beautiful vein of pure linguine running through these rocks,

516
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,260
and I want you boys to have every opportunity to become shareholders in this money-making project.

517
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,780
Now, don't bother to read it.

518
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,500
Just sign your name on the dotted line, and why, soon you'll be a beefsteak tycoon.

519
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,820
I promise you that.

520
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,400
There's dirt above in it.

521
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,440
Tote no grain in it, and it's sad.

522
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,440
Dirt!

523
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,580
Oh, all right!

524
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,060
Still there.

525
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:36,880
Dora.

526
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,440
What?

527
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,100
Dora?

528
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,880
Is he laughing at us?

529
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,360
Dirt!

530
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,920
Oh, he's laughing at us.

531
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,340
Hey, that's my job!

532
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,420
That's my job.

533
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,600
I just try to help, folks.

534
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,420
That's all I do, is try to come on and help.

535
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,520
Not that the job pays well.

536
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,940
Never has on this planet.

537
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,080
Did you ever notice anybody ever tries to help, we shoot them?

538
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,620
Did you ever notice that?

539
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,220
Ah!

540
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,720
If the risk is little, the reward is little.

541
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,500
Hey, I'm a cop.

542
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,340
I'm a cop.

543
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,340


544
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,340


545
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,340


546
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,340


547
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,340


548
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,340


549
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,340


550
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,340


551
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,340


552
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,340


553
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,340


554
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,340


555
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,340


556
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,220
What the hell are you?

557
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,000
You're welcome.

558
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:17,560
Tweet.

559
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,400
Tweet.

560
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,880
the tweet.

561
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,140
There ain't no tweet.

562
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,580
Here it comes, here it comes, look out, look out.

563
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,300
Cleve told me

564
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,760
of an incident

565
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,440
that happened to him the other day.

566
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,480
He was standing in a nearly deserted

567
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,520
Boston subway station.

568
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,340
Tell it, brother, tell it.

569
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,980
There was a drunk standing on the other side

570
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,020
across from him.

571
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,820
And he said, what's your name?

572
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,440
And Cleve, not wanting to tell his real name,

573
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,060
said Bob.

574
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,900
That's right, he said Bob.

575
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,720
And the drunk said, all the best

576
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,600
drunks are named Bob.

577
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,820
In fact, the greatest

578
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,820
drunk on earth is named

579
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,500
Bob.

580
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,780
And then that man got down on his hands

581
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,860
and knees and he licked that third

582
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,220
rail. How many of you

583
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,900
listening by radio can lick that third

584
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,680
rail? How many of you have been

585
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,900
sitting the way Bob wanted you to?

586
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,220
Huh?

587
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,900
You've just been sitting on your little fannies,

588
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,560
your tokuses.

589
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,440
Sitting there

590
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,480
praising Bob,

591
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,720
singing hymns to Bob,

592
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,380
but you're afraid to get out there

593
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,740
and whoop, pee dog for Bob, huh?

594
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,340
Aren't you being a little harsh

595
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,240
with these people?

596
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,380
Oh, you Californians

597
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,260
are so laid back.

598
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
We're into violence and hate in Texas.

599
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,500
I mean, we thought Bob was a nice

600
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:34,860
guru.

601
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,360
We thought he was a good guy.

602
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,560
We thought he was on our side.

603
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,540
Look, we didn't give you all that ammo

604
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,920
just to praise him.

605
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,580
Just to praise his sweet name.

606
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,920
I didn't get any ammo.

607
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,400
I got some PCP.

608
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,560
And he was in recognition for his efforts

609
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,780
in the land of our people.

610
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,600
Well, at least that.

611
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,800
There's little kids in China

612
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,840
who don't even get any PCP.

613
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,280
None of the sacred PCP of the church.

614
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:01,980
Ah, yes.

615
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,900
Many people meet here on the beach

616
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,060
to call Sternow.

617
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,380
There's the little Sternow at the bottom of the hall.

618
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,300
Oh, look, I see him now.

619
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,020
He's been poked and prodded awake now

620
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,940
by the bad show.

621
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,340
Let's hurt him now.

622
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,260
Oh, no.

623
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,100
Subgenius Corruption.

624
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,820
Uh, Energon crystals.

625
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,160
Our muscles flexing.

626
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,540
Stop snorting those Energon crystals.

627
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,220
Okay, here it comes.

628
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:23,580
Here it comes.

629
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,660
Look out, look out.

630
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,740
Sternow's love muscle is flexing.

631
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,880
Oh, watch out, man.

632
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,580
Everybody stand back.

633
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:28,640
I'm listening.

634
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,080
Stand back.

635
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,920
Oh, no!

636
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:30,540
Oh, no!

637
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,180
Excuse me.

638
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,840
It bumped into me.

639
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,940
And you thought P-Dawg was ugly.

640
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,500
Yeah.

641
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,560
Don't get any on you.

642
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,140
Don't get any on you.

643
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,560
You hadn't seen nothing until Sternow

644
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,860
whipped out of bed.

645
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,180
Whoa, he knocked a hole in the wall.

646
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,960
That damn thing's got three heads.

647
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,420
I haven't seen anything.

648
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,720
Oh, big day!

649
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,440
They grow big in Arkansas, don't they?

650
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,720
Only one foreskin's infected, though.

651
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,920
Something unwholesome about that critter.

652
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,060
Don't look at it too close up, little show.

653
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,340
There's kind of a capacity there for isolation.

654
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,160
Yeah, we thought we'd get as far away as we could

655
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,500
and then give you a call so it's the bad show again.

656
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,240
Well, good.

657
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,040
We're gonna take those chromosomes and DNA fragments

658
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,760
from the subgenius Rue and somehow mediate a recombination

659
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,020
between those two types.

660
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,420
That's what we're gonna do.

661
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,220
Just plop them into the protoplasm and let them realign on the wall.

662
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,760
Why not?

663
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,260
Why not?

664
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,060
Well, it's all right.

665
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,740
We're gonna take the resultant strain and inject it right into that golfer head.

666
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,680
That's the way it goes.

667
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,160
No!

668
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:27,920
No!

669
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,460
Don't inject the head!

670
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,060
You'll bring it back to unholy life!

671
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,440
It started to float, nimbus-like, over the golf course,

672
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,340
leaving a trail of sizzling blood.

673
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,720
It's like a little snail trail.

674
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,700
It's decomposing tissues to interact with the microorganisms of the soil.

675
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:49,480
As the head floated and levitated along, it kept uttering the word,

676
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:49,820
Why?

677
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:56,480
And it realized its tragic loss and the tragedy that it had invented for itself

678
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,160
and sunk into a depression.

679
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,680
Mumbling and muttering, mindlessly champing with its jaws in a peephole.

680
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,140
But listen.

681
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,000
Please listen.

682
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:11,400
Once upon a time, long, long ago, a lovely queen sat by her window sewing.

683
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,940
Dreaming, she pricked her finger with her needle.

684
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,540
Some time later, a little daughter was born to the queen.

685
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,260
And she was just as beautiful as the queen had hoped she might be.

686
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,580
Is that a boy or a girl?

687
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,840
Is it a faggot?

688
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,880
It's a dyke.

689
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,220
No, it's a hippie.

690
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,900
A communist?

691
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,680
Perhaps it's a drag queen or a woman.

692
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:43,680


693
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:43,680


694
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,740
A washrag queen.

695
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,600
Probably a speed freak.

696
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,940
Or a pothead.

697
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,880
Or a muffin queen.

698
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,080
Look at her, it's just a whore.

699
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,880
Or maybe a gold digger.

700
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
Or she's a hustler.

701
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,960
Or some sort of intellectual.

702
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,840
The happy mother decided to call her baby Snow White.

703
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,380
It could be a bag tag.

704
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,860
Or maybe it's a bee girl.

705
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,180
Snow White dreamed beautiful daydreams about a handsome prince.

706
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,660
Some day she knew he would come home and she would be the queen of the world.

707
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:13,660


708
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:13,660


709
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:13,660


710
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:13,660


711
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:13,660


712
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:13,660


713
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:13,660


714
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:13,660


715
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:13,660


716
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:13,660


717
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:13,660


718
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:13,660


719
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,140
And she would come and carry her off to his castle in the clouds.

720
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,280
And I often imagine that a girl is actually a boy and use her accordingly.

721
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,620
Mirror, mirror on the wall.

722
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,740
Who is the fairest of us all?

723
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,680
She said.

724
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,960
And the mirror replied.

725
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,360
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

726
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,220
Interesting.

727
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,860
Thanks, Dad.

728
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:50,080
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

729
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,400
What do they do in Texas on the weekend?

730
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,040
Oh, drink the bloody blood of Christian babies.

731
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:05,000
For more information you may write Bob at post office box 1-81417 Cleveland Heights,

735
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,480
Coming up next.

736
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:15,480


737
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,160
Like a lot of women, I've discovered recently one of my breasts is larger than the other.

738
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:31,220
And by saying that phrase to you, it will now go out and be stuck in your heads, thousands

739
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:36,180
of other people's heads, and I'll be free of the curse, I hope.

740
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,760
It, it, it all, it all comes at me, there's too much of it, I can't take it.

741
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,880
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't do one thing at a time.

742
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,500
You just have time to wash.

743
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,740
Mirror, mirror on the wall.

744
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,940
Who is the fairest of us all?

745
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,840
You sure as hell.

746
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,120
Take the princess into the forest and bring me back her heart in this jewel box.

747
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,740
A box?

748
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,080
Alone in the forest, Snow White wept with fright.

749
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,240
But she was not really alone, she found.

750
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,820
All the little woodland animals were her friends.

751
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,900
You're all right.

752
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,240
And chirping and chattering happily,

753
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,380
they led her to a new home.

754
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,260
Hey, what kind of place is this?

755
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:40,300
It was a sweet little, tiny little house in the woods the animals showed Snow White.

756
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,800
Looks like a rogues gallery.

757
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:48,600
The sink was piled with unwashed dishes and everything was thickly blanketed with dust.

758
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,400
Shut up, shut up!

759
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,660
You're dopey.

760
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,860
They had almost forgotten what the word meant.

761
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:59,000
She took one bite and sank lifeless to the floor.

762
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,120
And that ain't all.

763
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,400
Now you drop dead, you nitwit.

764
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,440
God bless you.

765
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,980
It's a beautiful thing.

766
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,240
Praise Bob.

767
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,320
Why not?

768
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,140
The man with the plan.

769
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,340
Focusing up now on the future of America.

770
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,520
The world domination.

771
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,480
The whole superior mutant.

772
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,840
Marching across history or the face of it.

773
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,920
Well, if you go over here on page 45 of the Bay Guardian,

774
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,940
you do find there is a whole section of...

775
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,140
of WADADS, mutants seeking other mutants and stuff like that.

776
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,700
It's a wonderful theatrical world.

777
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,020
It used to be cool and lonely to be a mutant, but now everybody's doing it.

778
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,500
Well, I mean, there used to be a time when it was sort of like, you know, a mule ride.

779
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,040
You cross the mutant with the normal and you get some sort of mutation,

780
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,720
but now the mutants are doing it with other mutants.

781
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,980
It's almost become, I don't know, mainstream.

782
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:56,700
It's...

783
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,140
I know, it's really sad to see the best minds of our generation,

784
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,540
doing all that 50's stuff over again the same way they did it back then.

785
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:12,920
And now, you know, now it's almost like uncool to be anything but mutant, you know?

786
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,400
I mean, it's sort of like...

787
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,920
It...

788
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,940
Well, you know what I'm saying?

789
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,760
I mean, it's...

790
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,660
Yeah, you're saying it...

791
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,520
Yeah, exactly.

792
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,060
And on top of that, it's a mutant and...

793
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:26,740
It is.

794
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,160
It's like, be different.

795
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,620
For the sake of being the same.

796
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,600
Yes, that's right.

797
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,100
We're all different here for the sake of being the same on the air.

798
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,700
And I...

799
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,200
That's really no better than the normals.

800
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,040
I mean, when you get right down to it.

801
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,920
Here on show.

802
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,680
Yeah.

803
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:49,660
Well, that's why the Church of the Subgenius is no longer a viable instrument in any of our lives.

804
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,460
Then we may have to just revert to normality as an alternative to mutations.

805
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,860
Well, I think the ultimate thing to be is just to be me.

806
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,860
I just wanna be me.

807
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,160
Not the me.

808
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,120
Well, me, for ye, is the.

809
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,100
Yeah, but that's the wrong me for you.

810
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,460
You gotta be the you me.

811
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,500
I gotta be the I me.

812
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,500
Well, this is no longer the me generation.

813
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,740
That was last generation.

814
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,160
So perhaps it's the...

815
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,280
Yeah, but I'm sterile.

816
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,980
So, you know, I'm kinda stuck with it.

817
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,820
Well, uh...

818
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,640
If I could reproduce, then I might have a ye generation.

819
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,320
I think it's the same thing.

820
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:29,380


821
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:29,380


822
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:29,420
Well, I'm not gonna be the me generation.

823
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:29,420


824
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:29,420


825
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:29,420


826
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:29,420


827
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:29,420


828
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:29,420


829
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,240
I'm gonna be the ye generation.

830
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,240


831
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,240


832
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,240


833
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,360
Ye, that's true.

834
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,280
No, no, ye.

835
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,260
Ye, that's true.

836
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,640
Right.

837
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,340
These get confusing after a while.

838
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,160
Why not?

839
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,900
Reverend Stanley, let me ask you.

840
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,220
If Bob's number is 999, whose number is 911?

841
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,780
So I know who you are.

842
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,800
God bless you.

843
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,500
Hello.

844
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,400
Yeah, how would you like to be mutilated, and if you were to die, how would you like

845
00:37:59,400 --> 00:37:59,400


846
00:37:59,400 --> 00:37:59,400


847
00:37:59,400 --> 00:37:59,400


848
00:37:59,400 --> 00:37:59,400


849
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,580
Come on, that's a pretty unprofessional obsession right there.

850
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,400
Well, it's true, but it's all we got.

851
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,340
Well, we'll just have to be cartographers of the head.

852
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,420
And it's our duty to explore the wilderness.

853
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,600
Artillery-like art.

854
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,480
This new gray matter preserve.

855
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,380
Just don't look up its neck stump.

856
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,840
You might see something you wish you'd never seen.

857
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,480
It was an ugly sight.

858
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,060
That's pretty romantic, Reverend Stang.

859
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:33,300
Yeah, I know what you do with that neck stump, Pope Sternodoc's kick-haver.

860
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,200
I know exactly what you've been doing with that neck stump.

861
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,640
I've detected the potential many times in the past

862
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,940
and have been dazzled by the ill-matched, intimidating circumstances

863
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,740
that this relationship has provided for me.

864
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:52,020
It's a breath of abnormalcy amidst a normal atmosphere of, you know,

865
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,300
inhaling deeply of the church air.

866
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,320
Of the air.

867
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,160
Reverend Sternodoc, would you hang on just a second?

868
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:57,700
What?

869
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,940
We're going to go to the caller.

870
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,260
Hold on.

871
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,320
Okay.

872
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,880
Sir, I know who you are.

873
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,920
God bless you.

874
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,860
Why did that nasty caller divert it before we could even get our hooks into him?

875
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,020
Well, he's probably trapped in a gas-filled tunnel

876
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,560
when he's lifting his head at the scent of that golfer head.

877
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:26,780
And we're more and more interested to learn how far this mighty affair might have progressed tonight.

878
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,360
Might have.

879
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,860
Yeah, that's the key, I think, for you listeners who are collecting clues,

880
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,280
as I'm often doing in the show.

881
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,580
Yes, all you gas-fans trapped out there.

882
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,560
The grass-fanned caller that would have found the other side to be a possibility.

883
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,740
The clues are buried in the show.

884
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,660
But that board stood up like a Christmas tree, Commander.

885
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:51,200
Well, the character and climate of the show no doubt have exerted a slight influence on his actions.

886
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,160
A tidal influence, we would say.

887
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,540
Yeah, that's true.

888
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,560
At the moment, they've dragged him right out of the room.

889
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,200
Yeah.

890
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:57,340


891
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:57,460
That's right.

892
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,640
They're taking him off to the land of the sky-blue waters.

893
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,460
Well, we'll...

894
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,560
The water's best for brewing.

895
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:07,760
We'll delve deeper and deeper into the more compelling mysteries,

896
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:15,600
which yet lay beyond those that we had deduced had to the security of the poop-dog hat.

897
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,680
A monster, eight feet tall, half-man, half-beast.

898
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,320
Perhaps the elusive missing link between humans and apes.

899
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:28,820
Oh, it's a little bit of a mystery.

900
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,660
In the Himalayas, it's called Yeti.

901
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,300
Yeti.

902
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,120
Yeti.

903
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:32,940
Yeti.

904
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:44,540
I was cursed by being fitted with the hair of a monkey.

905
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,380
The big question in all this, of course, is are these animals real?

906
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,620
Why don't we catch them?

907
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,780
You must decide.

908
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,760
For you are the jury.

909
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,240
It's not my...

910
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:57,320
It's not my...

911
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:03,280
intention to delay this court. God bless you. Wouldn't that be weird?

912
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,180
There's a lot of folks say, well, what do you believe in, Brother Dave? I say,

913
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:16,020
I believe in everything. You don't mean that. Yes. Even that? Yes. Yes, I, yes, yes, I do.

914
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,900
I believe in everything that exists in this whole planet Earth. I believe in every philosophy,

915
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:26,040
every religion, every ideology, everything that exists. And that don't give me no room for no

916
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:34,340
argument. If the world is wrong, then right your own self. That's something to think about, sure.

917
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:40,080
Frankly, I believe in love and charity and goodness and kindness. And I believe if a man's

918
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:47,260
down, kick him. That's right. If he survives it, he has an opportunity to rise above. God bless you.

919
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:53,880
We were afraid there would be too many people on Main Street. So we walked on down and stood in

920
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,940
the grassy slope just this side of the triple.

921
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:02,720
Underpass. The president's car turned the corner and started toward us on Elm Street.

922
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,500
There were a lot of motorcycle police in front of the president's car.

923
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,220
My friend was afraid I didn't see the president. So she said,

924
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:22,380
look, there's the president's car. Get a picture of him. He turned to us and waved.

925
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,580
He faced forward again.

926
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:33,260
I lifted my Polaroid. Just as I snapped the picture, I heard a shot.

927
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,000
Ow!

928
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,380
That's a pile of horse manure, son.

929
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,660
God bless you.

930
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,720
I don't know.

931
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,880
You must try, Comrade Zilkov, to cultivate a sense of humor.

932
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:13,980
Just because you're not the same, it doesn't mean you're weird or strange. You're just different

933
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,960
and being different is being great.

934
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,320
You too. Isn't that a risk?

935
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:24,000
Just because you're a different one, there's no telling what you might become.

936
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,160
Thinking different.

937
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,000
Being different is being great.

938
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,640
God bless you.

939
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,180
It's not who you aren't. It's who you are. And being yourself is being great.

940
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,600
From the church of the subgenius women.

941
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,000
Ah!

942
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,780
Let's get into trouble, baby.

943
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,200
I'm, uh, I think it's time to play some music because we're shi-

944
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,020
nothing better.

945
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


946
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


947
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


948
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


949
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


950
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


951
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


952
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


953
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


954
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


955
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


956
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


957
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


958
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


959
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


960
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


961
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,020


962
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:34,360
juggernock that can't be stopped. But Mike, let's be serious. And squabble. Well, all right,

963
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,620
what's a four-letter word for, oh wait, hold on. What's a four-letter word for pronate? Food.

964
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:50,000
How about prolapse? Just prolapsed on me. Oh, you're terribly sorry. Bear with me a moment.

965
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:59,160
There's a fond analog that, oh wait, I'm gazing into the mirror now. Okay, I'll eat it. I'll eat it.

966
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:05,660
Okay, we're going to go with the menu. Let's see, punch up 3D food. Okay, well,

967
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:15,180
how about the spooky strips of light and the, I'll take the dead moth, the dead moth shining pie.

968
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:19,480
At dead moth drive-thru plaza, the pie is our profession.

969
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:19,980
I'll take the dead moth.

970
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:19,980


971
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,500
The wall, the fluttered wall soup.

972
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,540
Now available at Wall Drugs.

973
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,220
Yeah, and the dipping French woman.

974
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,320
Okay, thanks, here.

975
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,140
From Noble Slaveway.

976
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:33,220
I'll take a real loony Cajun prune whip, too.

977
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,180
Wait a minute, Ivan's about to squeeze again.

978
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,260
Oh, man.

979
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:44,100
A memo to Attorney General Edwin Meese III about a $1 billion Iraqi fight.

980
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,340
Yeah, it makes me think of Meese, too.

981
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:45,660
I don't know.

982
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,640
Jake mentions a possible payment or a contribution.

983
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,820
I don't know if it's visual or maybe it's a sense of smell.

984
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,880
You know, basically, ancient sense of smell just kind of makes you think of Meese

985
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,660
when, well, when the whole building squeezes like that together.

986
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:04,600
And suddenly it dawned on a cooker friend that things had changed a bit.

987
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,620
Rappaport hired a long-time Meese friend E. Robert Wallach to get him a piece of that.

988
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:16,060
Well, I just went to the bathroom there and almost finished the stark fifth.

989
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,260
But then I forgot.

990
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,200
I turned around.

991
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,660
I flushed it before I even thought about it.

992
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,640
And so more shows are probably going to be backing up the pipes.

993
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,080
Oh, God.

994
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,880
I need a gift.

995
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,720
More shows.

996
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,720
And I really, I just have no idea what to get him.

997
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,160
More you.

998
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:33,240
I know just what you mean, and I have just the gift you need.

999
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,520
But I can't sell it.

1000
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,060
No cameras of any kind will be allowed.

1001
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,720
I will not tolerate any outbursts.

1002
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,360
Donations.

1003
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,100
Any talking among yourselves.

1004
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,240
Any laughter.

1005
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:57,680
Nor anything that would interfere with the normal, orderly presentation of testimony.

1006
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:58,500
Ah!

1007
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,140
Oh, a radio!

1008
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,440
With your mid-afternoon news.

1009
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:12,860
Well, all of Southern California seems to have sighted another UFO in today's sunny, smogless skies.

1010
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,520
The official...

1011
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,100
...punished every 300 days.

1012
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:17,240
Oh, they put a mic there?

1013
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:17,620
Ah!

1014
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:17,620


1015
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:17,620


1016
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:17,620


1017
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,760
That's a good one.

1018
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,520
Oh, it's coming alive.

1019
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,260
Oh, no, it's crawling out of the toilet.

1020
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,300
That's Mobius.

1021
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,640
Mobius, hey, hey.

1022
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,320
Look out, Mike.

1023
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,120
Look out, look out.

1024
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,000
Don't pull me in there.

1025
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:27,500
Oh, God.

1026
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,000
Ow!

1027
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,440
And children, this is what you get when you eat at Cafe Neutron.

1028
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,000
Is the new...

1029
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,920
...inradiated food...

1030
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,400
...is the new Starfish out yet?

1031
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,380
Yeah, it's out.

1032
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,240
A little listener asking a real question.

1033
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,480
Yeah.

1034
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,360
Get out of here.

1035
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:41,880
Stop it.

1036
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,620
Yeah, it's out.

1037
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,360
It's $40.

1038
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,080
But let's go over that again.

1039
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,080


1040
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,560
I don't, I don't, I don't...

1041
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,620
You can use all...

1042
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,100
...start fist.

1043
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,680
...monster?

1044
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:54,980
The long, long, long-awaited start fist of removal is indeed almost finished, just as

1045
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,640
we've been saying for the last two years.

1046
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,800
And this time, we really do mean it.

1047
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,500
And, uh...

1048
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,400
Whoop, there went that...

1049
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,300
Shoot, we flushed it away again.

1050
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,280
Now I've got to start all over again.

1051
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,460
Yeah, you see, he back-flushed these things, and there's a little collar.

1052
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,100
He's floating up.

1053
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,220
He'll be floating face up.

1054
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:11,600
There he is.

1055
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,640
It'll be out soon, but we can tell you what the theme of the next issue is.

1056
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:14,740
Get the plunger.

1057
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,000
Get the show plunger.

1058
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,520
Get that little collar up out of there.

1059
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,660
The theme of the, uh, new start fist is not you hearing.

1060
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:21,620
Oh, I'm afraid he's drowned.

1061
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,980
Yeah, well...

1062
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,500
Put it down as slowly as you can.

1063
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,320
Oh, it's only an overshot.

1064
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,740
Like Patty said.

1065
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,380
On the floor.

1066
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,120
Put it on the floor.

1067
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,200
Gently.

1068
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:43,780
Now, just what could have happened to get such a piece of tripe?

1069
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,420
You have no idea.

1070
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,580
What I've gone through in the last three months.

1071
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,760
Sometimes I'm perfect and all.

1072
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:54,720
Mentally.

1073
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,780
I sit for hours and hours looking in the mirror.

1074
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:08,380
Hoping and praying for the slightest sign of my physical change.

1075
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,080
And then it comes.

1076
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,460
Then I feel myself going back.

1077
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,180
Like, the animal instinct.

1078
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,620
I try to fight it.

1079
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,660
I try to fight it with all my willpower.

1080
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,300
And I fail.

1081
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,420
William.

1082
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,600
William, what am I going to do?

1083
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,220
What am I going to do?

1084
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:33,820
Fight.

1085
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,120
That's all you can do.

1086
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:37,660
Oh.

1087
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,200
Oh.

1088
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:43,580
Oh.

1089
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:44,840
Oh.

1090
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:45,360
Oh.

1091
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:45,940
Oh.

1092
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:46,700
Oh.

1093
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:46,820
Oh.

1094
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:46,820


1095
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:46,980


1096
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:47,540
Oh.

1097
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1098
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1099
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1100
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1101
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1102
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1103
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1104
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1105
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1106
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1107
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1108
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1109
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1110
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1111
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1112
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1113
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:47,600


1114
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,040
We better get back

1115
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,760
because it will be dark soon

1116
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,240
and they mostly come at night.

1117
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:11,320
Mostly.

1118
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,580
On O.B.O.D.

1119
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,740
Translate.

1120
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,800
Sure is preferred, it is.

1121
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:30,520
I like that.

1122
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,100
What is the truth

1123
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,140
about rock music?

1124
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,280
I think it's an octopus.

1125
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:37,980
Yes.

1126
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,120
Plato said

1127
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,100
when the music of a society

1128
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:43,640
changes,

1129
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,760
the whole society will change.

1130
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,040
Certainly.

1131
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,520
I got married so I could retire.

1132
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,340
Lennon said

1133
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,920
the best and the quickest way

1134
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,340
to undermine any society

1135
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,840
is through

1136
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,400
its music.

1137
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,640
Can you think of anything else?

1138
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,220
No, you've covered it all.

1139
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,600
Satan has taken music

1140
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,540
and he has counterfeited it.

1141
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:09,740
See that?

1142
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,080
Convoluted.

1143
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:13,380
Convoluted it.

1144
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,060
Twisted it.

1145
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:20,700
Exploited it.

1146
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,060
And now he's using

1147
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:26,480
the hammer, hammer, hammer,

1148
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,040
hammer, hammer.

1149
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,480
Hammer, hammer, hammer,

1150
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,960
hammer, hammer.

1151
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,060
A message into the minds

1152
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,300
and the lifestyles

1153
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,760
of this generation.

1154
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,580
And that ain't all.

1155
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,140
All sins.

1156
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,360
What kind of ungodly being was that?

1157
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,580
Don't you believe in reincarnation?

1158
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,780
A wise guy, huh?

1159
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,140
Quick, kill him.

1160
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,160
Subdenies in space.

1161
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,680
They took me up to the top

1162
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,860
of that space needle

1163
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,660
and they showered me

1164
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,680
with beautiful gifts

1165
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,280
and beautiful girls.

1166
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,140
Moon babes.

1167
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,500
Wow, what moon babes?

1168
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,320
Yeah, look at those satellites.

1169
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,480
Look at them spiked heels.

1170
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,920
Oh, that one's looting me now.

1171
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,780
I can't tell whether those are convexities

1172
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,740
or concavities, but that looting

1173
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:17,740


1174
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,340
Are they some kind of moon babes?

1175
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,300
I say, do that again.

1176
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,740
Boy, can you dig those potatoes

1177
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,680
out of the craters.

1178
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,140
Hey.

1179
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,320
Oh, I love it.

1180
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:29,720
Oh.

1181
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,900
Tiny flatulence move through

1182
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,440
this microscopic stool

1183
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,020
as if they owned the place.

1184
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,200
What happened?

1185
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,480
What, did something die in here?

1186
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,280
Meanwhile, Nancy Reagan raised the pocket.

1187
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,320
Just more shit.

1188
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,020
It's that dinosaur ink

1189
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,220
that Hal's been sitting on

1190
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,500
for the last 20 days.

1191
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,040
Look, it's cracking.

1192
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,480
I hear a scratching, a scratching noise.

1193
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,260
He's not even aware

1194
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,580
that his own child is being born now.

1195
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,420
It's got the head of a boy

1196
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,720
and the body of a Tyrannosaurus.

1197
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,660
Yes, but it smokes Shermans.

1198
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,860
Do you think that it could be?

1199
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,340
And it's still talking.

1200
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:08,860
The PLO chief rates full pardon for safe sex.

1201
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,680
Oh, I just don't know about this guy.

1202
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,060
Meanwhile, Mikhail Gorbachev bought

1203
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,360
a covert aid for erosion.

1204
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,840
Yes, Hal had his own dinosaur baby child

1205
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,480
on the show and didn't even notice.

1206
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,980
And so we're going to cook this little rare creature

1207
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,540
up for breakfast.

1208
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,700
Yes, this single living example

1209
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,720
of a homosaurus sapiens.

1210
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,440
It's Jack and Amy.

1211
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,860
Just what do you mean?

1212
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,540
The show fought its way to the front of the castle.

1213
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:39,660
I'm killing this creature.

1214
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,200
Or maybe I am.

1215
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:41,820
You.

1216
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:41,900
You.

1217
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,080
The show thought to itself,

1218
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,980
should I swim across the moat

1219
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,680
or should I crawl through the mud?

1220
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,100
Or should you crawl six miles over the broken glass

1221
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,040
and radioactive mine tears

1222
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,020
just to hear our program?

1223
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,200
How many callers?

1224
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,620
How many records?

1225
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,980
How many eardrums?

1226
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,220
We're going to talk about some of the subtle racism

1227
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,740
and sexism in the bibles.

1228
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,080
The sexism's pretty well accepted,

1229
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,060
but we will talk about the racism

1230
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,600
because it's so much more hidden

1231
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,080
and it's so much more dangerous,

1232
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,140
What genocide the wretched can justify with the racism in it?

1233
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,780
Through devious ways, Satan has tainted the Bible,

1234
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:23,720
and they justify their racism on the fact that Cain, the son of Adam and Eve, went off to a great city.

1235
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:27,300
How is there a city if Cain was the only first son of man?

1236
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,300
Well, this city was not occupied by man, but the beast of the field.

1237
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:36,140
And Mormons and many other religions still teach at Blacks

1238
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,620
that the descendants of Cain and the beast of the field.

1239
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:43,840
We single out these tainted Bibles, even St. John and St. Luke versions,

1240
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,640
so you will know that ours is the only Bible that should be read.

1241
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:54,440
Versions of the Bible which have racism in them is going to be exposed,

1242
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,460
and then we will announce how we will edit the Bible.

1243
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:07,680
Well, the quick cut barrage that you've been listening to,

1244
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:08,600
the edits of the Bible,

1245
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,780
the edits of wonderful little sound bits,

1246
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:16,360
holy messages from the collection of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself,

1247
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:20,460
that was all edited by St. Joe Riley.

1248
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,180
Oh, praise St. Joe Riley.

1249
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,220
Saves us so much work and lets us get away with murder.

1250
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,520
Oh, other little bits and pieces that were done by others.

1251
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,900
There's a song called Used Slack,

1252
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,600
buried in that.

1253
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:42,460
That was by Out of Band Experience, OBE.

1254
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,160
You heard some Church of the New Faith there down at the end.

1255
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,780
They'll, of course, finish their explanations next week.

1256
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:55,560
On the commercial for our new product,

1257
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,500
Candy Frappy Frappy Candy,

1258
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,960
was produced by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

1259
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,620
Oh, yes, up there in New York land.

1260
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,040
The background music that's on right now,

1261
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,380
of course,

1262
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,000
Jay Condom from his album,

1263
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,980
Zombo Frockland.

1264
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,780
And now, this.

1265
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,980
Well, no, how about this?

1266
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,400
How about the post office box of the Church of the Subgenius?

1267
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,900
I know that so many of you have been sitting there

1268
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,120
with your pens in your hands,

1269
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:33,060
just aching to write down that address

1270
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,020
where you can write for free information

1271
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,600
about all the other...

1272
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,860
all the other services of our...

1273
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,320
our beloved Church.

1274
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,720
Ah, yes.

1275
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:48,840
And, uh, that post office box number,

1276
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,080
we'll just write to Bob.

1277
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,600
That's all you need to do.

1278
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,580
Write to Bob at post office box one...

1279
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,140
eight one four one seven

1280
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:01,720
in beautiful Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1281
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,720
That zip is four four one one eight.

1282
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,700
Once again, that's box...

1283
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,600
one eight four one seven.

1284
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,360
One eight four one seven.

1285
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,620
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1286
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,660
Four four one one eight.

1287
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,120
And now this.

1288
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,040
The dead hours of the morning

1289
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,080
between 4.30 and 6 o'clock.

1290
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,220
This is the time when women

1291
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,580
who have been many hours in labor finally deliver.

1292
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,820
And when the idea of the supernatural

1293
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,900
seems the least implausible.

1294
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,900
Mobius Rex is clambering around on top of the...

1295
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,380
Rectum in propere se se rectus in curiae.

1296
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,460
Amazing camera.

1297
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,660
For those of you interested,

1298
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,620
monitor number four will show Mobius.

1299
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,580
At this time,

1300
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,500
ancient superstitions and night fears

1301
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,720
have the greatest hold on human thoughts.

1302
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:51,800
The time when those who sleep are deep in their pains.

1303
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,420
And this is the hour when the callers call.

1304
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,860
The Church of the Subgenius radio show.

1305
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:57,820
Hello?

1306
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,440
Hello, you're on the air.

1307
00:57:59,520 --> 00:57:59,760
Cookie.

1308
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:02,680
This is the show trying to bother Philo.

1309
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,680
State short question, please.

1310
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,140
What's for breakfast?

1311
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:07,700
Cook fist cookie.

1312
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,840
Cookie, this is Ivan.

1313
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,360
You have to wake up Dr. Drumwatt.

1314
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,280
Hey, hey, hey, I got him.

1315
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,440
So we can hurt him.

1316
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,560
How many presidents does it take to screw in a light bulb?

1317
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:17,240
No, no, wait, wait.

1318
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,340
What's the most beautiful sight in the world?

1319
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,100
A busload of presidents going off a cliff.

1320
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:21,960
I get it?

1321
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,240
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

1322
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,240
Spooky bad show.

1323
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:26,280
Cookie.

1324
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:28,200
Oh, no.

1325
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,520
Can we talk to little dude?

1326
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,960
Don't listen to these men.

1327
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,600
Not unless you have a connection to dog heaven.

1328
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:36,500
Oh, no.

1329
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,320
Friends, this is dog heaven.

1330
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,580
And this is Philo Drumhead.

1331
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:41,260
Hey, dog heaven.

1332
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,360
Philo Drumhead.

1333
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:47,220
He's woken up just to be here entertaining you in all of northern and central California.

1334
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,340
No, I'm still asleep.

1335
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,580
You are going to save the universe this time.

1336
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,340
Yeah, that's right, Philo.

1337
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,000
You have a link up to the sleep.

1338
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,460
Be of good cheer.

1339
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,120
Yeah.

1340
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:03,280
Well, just tell us what you're dreaming about and we'll let you go eventually.

1341
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,180
I'm dreaming about little dude.

1342
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:06,220
What?

1343
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,820
Your dog?

1344
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:10,760
Your dog that you had five years ago?

1345
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:11,300
Yes.

1346
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,260
I've never forgotten the little chap who was so dear to us.

1347
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,820
Still running out there in the fields of toxic substance.

1348
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,780
That's what it is.

1349
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:26,600
He's prancing and dancing through fields of clover and dioxin.

1350
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,160
In that land where no cars are.

1351
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,760
And the smell of good clean earth under his nails.

1352
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:35,060
The only cars that are there are those that are run over by dogs.

1353
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:36,020
Oh, those.

1354
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:36,280
Yeah.

1355
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:37,740
Little dogs.

1356
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:45,260
That's Salvation and Infotation at www.subgenius.com.

1357
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,380
Oh yes, I almost forgot.

1358
00:59:55,860 --> 01:00:02,780
Uh, friends, are you a subgenius minister yet?

1359
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,000
Have you joined the Church of the Lord?

1360
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,000


1361
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,000


1362
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,180
Probably my surety.

1363
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:06,180


1364
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:06,180


1365
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:06,180


1366
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:06,180


1367
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:06,560
And I'm your friend and I am a subgenius.

1368
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:16,960
And by that, I mean actually send in your $35 payable by PayPal or credit card on subgenius.com

1369
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:21,480
where it says become an ordained minister or where it says stores.

1370
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:28,780
And even if you have, do you have your well made Bob t-shirt from anticonformity.com?

1371
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,800
Do you have your ARISE DVD?

1372
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,680
Sure, you could watch it on the internet.

1373
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:35,980
I'll do it.

1374
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:35,980


1375
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,520
But it's not the same.

1376
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,920
And it isn't the same.

1377
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,380
It hasn't been kissed by the lips of Princess Wee,

1378
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:48,000
who kisses every copy of Arise that goes out.

1379
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,640
And I sign every copy of Book of the Subgenius.

1380
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:51,660
How about that?

1381
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,400
You can still get those from us.

1382
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:56,600
But yes, the $35 for the Minister's Pack,

1383
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,520
you really ought to think about it, folks.

1384
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:05,020
You don't have to meet any subgeniuses ever.

1385
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,180
But you will have that option.

1386
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,600
You can't come to X Day unless you're a member.

1387
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:18,320
You can't go to the members-only kind of smarty-pants internet forum

1388
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,300
called Scrub Genius.

1389
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,720
I do a lot more there than on Facebook.

1390
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,220
Because Facebook's just a bunch of gimme bobs,

1391
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,840
people who can't even spell Bob's name right.

1392
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,040
Do you know that, Princess Wee?

1393
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,940
They can't even spell Bob's name right, half of them.

1394
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:33,800
They leave off the quotes.

1395
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:35,980
Oh, yeah.

1396
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,380
Yeah, gimme bobs.

1397
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:37,940
You can tell.

1398
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,880
It's so easy to tell.

1399
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:45,740
Anyway, friends, we'll be back next week with more X Day recordings,

1400
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,740
and hopefully with the lonesome cowboy.

1401
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,780
Hopefully he won't be lonesome next week.

1402
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,680
Rotten house old dammit.

1403
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,740
Do it over there, dammit.

1404
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:54,860
The hound dog's doing fine.

1405
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:56,760
Well, thank you.

1406
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:57,780
Good night.

1407
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,180
And praise Bob.

1408
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,300
Yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai.
