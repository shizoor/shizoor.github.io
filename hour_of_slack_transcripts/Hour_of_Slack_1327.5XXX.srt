1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,800
Yes, this is the last show, folks.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,120
The last show.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,440
Oh, thank God.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,240
The very last show.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,800
It's about damn time.

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,280
Can you believe it's lasted this long and they hadn't killed us yet?

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:13,840
Really?

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,740
That's the thing that amazes me.

9
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,140
I can't believe it.

10
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,900
You want me to do this, Bobby?

11
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,120
You want me to do this?

12
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:19,900
Huh?

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,640
You want me to do this?

14
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,020
Huh?

15
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,940
You want me to do this, Bobby?

16
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,820
I will do this!

17
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:24,620
Huh?

18
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,240
Bobby, you want me to do this?

19
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,580
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

20
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,520
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

21
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,520
You gotta do it, Bobby.

22
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,760
You got no choice, man.

23
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,680
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

24
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,040
Take this worth of piece of shit down right now, Bobby.

25
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,100
We're running out of time.

26
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,240
When that chopper light goes out, you do it!

27
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,640
Do it, Bobby!

28
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,060
Do it!

29
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,800
Ace of Genius.

30
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,620
Power of Swag.

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,520
Hey, Bobby, breathe.

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,200
Bobby, come on.

33
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,360
Come on, man.

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,080
Take a deep breath.

35
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,340
Take a deep breath.

36
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:18,700
That's all right.

37
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,160
Stay down there.

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,680
Breathe.

39
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,380
Breathe.

40
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:20,760
Hang on.

41
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,900
You'll be all right.

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,780
Here, give me your gun.

43
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:24,520
That's it.

44
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,520
All right, come on.

45
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:25,980
Breathe deep.

46
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,020
What did I recognize?

47
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,720
I've seen him before somewhere sometime.

48
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,620
You know, Bobby, he's strutting around like a little Bantam rooster.

49
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,260
You're just jealous of him because he's cute.

50
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,200
Cute?

51
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,340
You are so lost in space.

52
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,800
You have no idea what the fuck's going on.

53
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,520
Jealous of Bobby?

54
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,200
Bobby's a fucking coward.

55
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,100
Bobby's not a coward.

56
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,140
Oh, he's not, huh?

57
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,720
Okay.

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,580
Let me tell you how that Robertson case really went down.

59
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,000
My gun's got a cool case.

60
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,740
Because I blasted that freak in Pacoima last month, right?

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,840
It's due time.

62
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,640
Bobby gets tested.

63
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,200
So we're out there.

64
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,700
We're in his alley.

65
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,100
We're waiting.

66
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,160
Robertson comes running out.

67
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,020
All while smacks into Bobby.

68
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,320
So there they are, eyeballing each other with their shit hanging out.

69
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,260
Robertson says, boo, Bobby drops his gun and Mandingo goes track star.

70
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,260
Sally, Bobby dropped his fucking gun, okay?

71
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,200
I don't want to hear this.

72
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,440
Oh, listen, listen, because this is good.

73
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,340
So I reach down.

74
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,200
I pick up Bobby's gun.

75
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,420
I go, hey, yo, G-Dog or GQ, whatever the fuck his name is.

76
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,400
He turns around and boom, split this guy's eyeballs.

77
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,980
Lucky shot, I admit it.

78
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,120
Point is, I let Bobby take the trigger man slot to save his ass some big-time embarrassment, okay?

79
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,720
How do you like that for cute?

80
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:36,700
Fuck.

81
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,100
Where is Bob?

82
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,700
He's gone.

83
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,280
But where?

84
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,540
Slack your spring!

85
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,500
God damn.

86
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,700
Ah, good morning, ladies.

87
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,380
Hey, Bob, how do you feel?

88
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,520
Feeling good.

89
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,520
Feeling good.

90
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,780
Good shirt from there.

91
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,260
Everything in Wayne's from Taker.

92
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,380
I like a guy that can get it.

93
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:56,820
I like a guy in pink.

94
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,200
Yeah?

95
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,960
Yeah, totally.

96
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,580
Okay.

97
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,500
Good to know.

98
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,660
You are really pretty.

99
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,420
I mean, look, we've got the same color hair.

100
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,160
It suits you.

101
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,400
It's like, it makes you so soft.

102
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,880
You're like, it's like feminine, but that's okay.

103
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,760
I think you're like total genius.

104
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,080
No way, man.

105
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,480
Let me tell you something.

106
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,880
You are a genius.

107
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,100
Don't think just because your old man's a chief, I'm going to be cutting any slack.

108
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,760
You're going to have to earn it.

109
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,860
Just don't think just because your old man's a chief, I'm going to be cutting any slack.

110
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,520
You're going to have to earn it.

Just don't think just because your old man's a chief.

112
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,640
I'm going to be cutting any slack.

You're going to have to earn it.

Just don't think just because your old man's a chief, I'm going to be cutting any slack.

You're going to have to earn it.

Just to earn it.

117
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,300
Just to earn it.

118
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,880
Just to earn it.

119
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,640
What's your name?

120
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,160
Bobo.

121
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,600
Okay, Bobo.

122
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,820
Here is 400 bucks.

123
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,600

Let's see what you can do.

128
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,080
Bobo.

129
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,880
Go on.

130
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,040
Good evening, Bill.

131
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:04,720
Bob.

132
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:04,980
Bob.

133
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,600
Now then, what can I get you, Bill?

134
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,420
It's Bob.

135
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,520
Right then, you go me a tenner, Bill.

136
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,020
No, it's Bob.

137
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:27,400
No.

138
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,800
Well, you don't.

139
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,500
Well, that's all we've got.

140
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:44,740

Buzzards come to rest upon this fragrant summer stench,

150
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,280
pecking through the rotting hides and bones.

151
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:24,720
Rotting organs burst as they are pierced by stabbing beaks,

152
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:37,280
and they squirt out fluids with the flavor and viscosity of

00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,100
welfare

191
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,640
Al

192
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,040
След

193
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,620
On their way to unemployment, life so long and slow

194
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,940
Pudgy sad Americans morph into piggy skeletons

195
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,740
Pumping little piggy fists of misdirected anger

196
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,860
As the banks foreclose their piggy pens

197
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,500
Feasting on their Christmas bonus

198
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,240
Happy swollen buzzard bellies

199
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,680
Raise your stupid fucking flag way up into the sky

200
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,780
Choke back tears and cling to all the bullshit you've been fed

201
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,220
Raise your stupid fucking flag way up into the sky

202
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,480
Pass the blame to Mexicans while corporations thrust their cocks

203
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,020
Deep inside your piggy buttocks

204
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,660
Moist and puffy piggy buttocks

205
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,180
Trickling out sweet rivulets of

206
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,000
Cinerona, red-beaked rivers rushing through a tuna sluice

207
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,980
Bone rivers wake the kids for therapy and choosy juice

208
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,080
Gliding through a rugged tundra going for a luskin mousse

209
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,900
Waste the steaming profit

210
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,920
Sarah Palin pussy juice

211
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,420
Sarah Palin pussy juice

212
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,580
Sarah Palin pussy juice

213
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,600
Sarah Palin pussy juice

214
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,660
Sarah Palin pussy juice

215
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,980
Sarah Palin pussy juice

216
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,600
Sarah Palin pussy juice

217
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,440
Sarah Palin pussy juice

218
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:19,300
That was my favorite song from the new CD from the Rudy Schwartz Project,

219
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,580
The Year They Switched to Cornmeal,

220
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:29,160
from the great Reverend Joe Newman, who moved to Canada for obvious reasons.

221
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:36,020
Our opening was by Reverend Slander Bob, followed by the collage by The Large.

222
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:45,580
This is our Slack number 1327.5, one of our internet-only X-rated specials,

223
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,080
and there's more of those coming up.

224
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,140
Only home subscribers get the full CD of this one.

225
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,280
Almost all the rest of which was recorded at X-Day Drill number 14,

226
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,860
including the upcoming Dr. Legumes story time.

227
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,340
Speaking of...

228
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,860
Those who do not buy...

229
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,000
No.

230
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,940
...to give, we always have Reverend Legumes to beat it out of them.

231
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:11,780
Legumes...

232
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,240
Hi, everybody.

233
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,520
...is here.

234
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,620
Hi, doctors.

235
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,760
Howdy-ho.

236
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,140
Hail Legumes.

237
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,660
The preacher from the Black Legumes.

238
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,520
I was going to actually use this on stage later,

239
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,000
but I wanted Stang to have a good recording of it,

240
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,060
and it seemed like a really good afternoon for a Dr. Legumes story time.

241
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:32,760
All right.

242
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,240
Oh, b-b-b-boy.

243
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,700
Terrence.

244
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,320
This is a story.

245
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,600
Yeah, get closer to the mic.

246
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,600
Okay.

247
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,980
It's Dr. Legumes story time, and today's story is...

248
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,880
It's about choices and the choices that you make.

249
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,400
Once upon a time, many years ago, last Wednesday,

250
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,520
there was a town known as Pinkstown.

251
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,120
Pinkstown was a very nice town with a lake and a park

252
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,320
and the cleanest streets you've ever seen.

253
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,920
Every lawn was perfectly trimmed.

254
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,600
Every garden filled.

255
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,760
Every garden filled with lovely flowers,

256
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,200
and every person was happy and satisfied.

257
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,860
There was no crime or pollution in Pinkstown,

258
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,340
and every Sunday, the houses were empty and the churches were full.

259
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,680
At night, families would walk in the park

260
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,700
or engage in the many wholesome family activities

261
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,900
available to the Pinktown's people.

262
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,040
At night...

263
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,040
Oh, wait.

264
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,780
At every night, the only eatery in town,

265
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,200
McDonald's Hamburger Heaven,

266
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,280
was filled to capacity with hungry Pinks.

267
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,040
Old Man McDonald worked every day and night,

268
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,840
making his hamburgers and happily feeding the hungry bellies of the townsfolk,

269
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,040
and had done so for as long as anyone could remember.

270
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,300
He was beloved by all.

271
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,660
One day, a great noise was heard throughout the town.

272
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
It was a jarring calliope,

273
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,000
the music emanating from a curious wagon that rolled into town

274
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,180
covered with flashlights,

275
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,640
flashing lights.

276
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,300
The wagon rolled down every street in Pinkstown,

277
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,740
with a great booming voice calling out,

278
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,200
Follow me to total satisfaction.

279
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,920
Startled by this amazing machine,

280
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,780
the people came out of their homes in droves,

281
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,460
following the outrageous machine until it stopped in a vacant lot

282
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,660
across from McDonald's Hamburger Heaven.

283
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,220
The great wagon wheels retracted,

284
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,640
and it settled to the ground.

285
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,180
Hatches opened,

286
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,180


287
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,180


288
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,180


289
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,180


290
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,740
and mechanical limbs flailed the air

291
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,920
as the machine transformed from a strange garish wagon

292
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,460
to the most amazing futuristic structure the townsfolk had ever seen.

293
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,360
Roof-mounted loudspeakers proclaimed for all to hear,

294
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,180
Friends, my name is J.R. Bob Dobbs,

295
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,400
and I welcome you to the grand opening of my new,

296
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,300
fully automated restaurant,

297
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,460
Burger God Hunger Fucker.

298
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,360
Fireworks shot from the roof

299
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,000
as a giant flashing neon sign lit up

300
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,880
and bathed the entire street

301
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,460
in the glare of glowing, garish profanity.

302
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,980
The people were outraged.

303
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,020
Oh my God, hide the children's eyes, cried a mother.

304
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,800
We will not tolerate this in Pinkstown,

305
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,020
cried the town's preacher.

306
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,520
Anger and frustration filled the air

307
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,800
as people wielding torches and pitchforks

308
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,480
tried in vain to burn down the structure.

309
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,700
Even as the seductive scent

310
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,100
of the most savory burgers you've ever smelled

311
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,020
wafted over the crowd

312
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,600
like a mouth-watering fog.

313
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,080
Despite themselves,

314
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,940
the people suddenly found themselves ravenously hungry.

315
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,260
They could not resist.

316
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,440
They must have a hamburger now.

317
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,120
As the townspeople began to surge

318
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,480
towards the door of Burger God Hunger Fucker,

319
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,340
the preachers cried out,

320
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,300
Wait! Do not give in to temptation.

321
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,060
We cannot succumb to the,

322
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,560
the lure of this horrific affront to our decency.

323
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,320
We will go to McDonald's

324
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,420
and enjoy his hamburgers instead,

325
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,060
as we always have.

326
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,180
When nobody buys any hamburgers

327
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,940
from this obscene mechanical monster,

328
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,140
it will no doubt go away.

329
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,400
So the citizens packed themselves into McDonald's

330
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,420
and ate more hamburgers than they had eaten

331
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,680
in one night in the history of McDonald's.

332
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,240
The lines were around the block

333
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,560
and halfway through town

334
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,920
as drooling Pinkstownians fought the urge

335
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,180
to give their best.

336
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,980
They were a business to the Burger God Hunger Fucker.

337
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,540
Rolling eastward on US-1

338
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,000
was a dented green Buick

339
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,120
driven by a hungry young subgenius

340
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,320
named Reverend Funny Name.

341
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,620
Reverend Funny Name had been driving for days,

342
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,360
looking forward to his first ex-day vacation

343
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,320
and to enjoy the fellowship

344
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,300
of his many subgenius friends.

345
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,780
He'd made very few stops during his pilgrimage,

346
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,960
but as he neared the Pinkstown exit,

347
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,160
he was overwhelmed.

348
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,340
He was overcome by the alluring smell of hamburgers.

349
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,720
He could not remember ever smelling a hamburger this savory

350
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,520
and he could not resist the hunger that seized him.

351
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,740
And he saw the line for the hamburgers

352
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,720
and he smelled the hamburgers

353
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,960
and he drove to the center of town

354
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,280
and he looked at McDonald's and he's like,

355
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,840
man, there is absolutely no way I'm waiting in that line.

356
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,980
And then looking over his shoulder,

357
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,940
he saw the garish glow of the sign and said,

358
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,360
oh snap!

359
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
Burger God, hunger fucker!

360
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,060
He pulled into the drive-thru

361
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,920
and after perusing the menu,

362
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,080
told the order bot,

363
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,780
I'd like the number 13 happy fucker fun meal

364
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,080
with a double hunger fucker burger, please,

365
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,660
with a big ass mega fuckload of chili cheese fries

366
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,240
and a small motherfucking diet coke.

367
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,320
For his health.

368
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,340
As he pulled away from the lot

369
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,460
with his huge meal on the seat beside him,

370
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,340
the townspeople were all in awe of him.

371
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:03,340


372
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,140
People shook their fists at him and gave him dirty looks.

373
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,580
Reverend Funny Name pulled back onto the highway

374
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,100
and continued east toward his destination.

375
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,120
It was the greatest meal of his life.

376
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,180
He not only ate that hunger fucker burger,

377
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,880
he ate the hunger fucking hell out of it.

378
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,780
It was so good, he never wanted to shit it out.

379
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,380
He reached into the bag

380
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,720
and retrieved the toy surprise

381
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,940
from his happy fucker fun meal.

382
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,320
It was a shiny plastic box with a red button on top.

383
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,540
He pressed the red button and waited.

384
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,240
He pressed it again.

385
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,460
What a pile of junk, Reverend Funny Name said,

386
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,100
as the Burger God hunger fucker detonated,

387
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,640
leaving nothing left of Pinksville but a smoking crater.

388
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,020
The end.

389
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,020
Reeeeee!

390
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,380
A beautiful tale, Dr. LeGue,

391
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,540
not just a...

392
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,480
It makes me hungry just thinking about it.

393
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,220
Ready to get your hunger fucked.

394
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:13,980
Yeah.

395
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:20,320
Bob also tried to market a type of beer

396
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,180
called Beer God the Thirst Fucker.

397
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,840
And these ad agencies he hired

398
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,760
would always try to talk him out of it.

399
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,400
But he actually opened a chain

400
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,640
of both Beer God and Burger God in Louisiana.

401
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,540
Yeah, I remember you told me about it years ago, obviously,

402
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,740
which is why I remembered.

403
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,700
Well, that will be on the, uh,

404
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,020
one of those X-rated internet-only hours of Slack.

405
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,500
Well, you know, last year I was able to put together

406
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,980
an hour of Slack real easily.

407
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,760
I just used all the stuff that was too filthy

408
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,220
to use at all, if you were gonna bleep it.

409
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,440
So it was, uh, it was your, your tale

410
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,760
of the seven years of rape

411
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,220
that went on and on and on seven times.

412
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,700
Probably the most ripped-off meme of the year.

413
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,060
There was that entire New York DeVival

414
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,440
was centered around your story

415
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,240
of the, of the subgenius raping bears and, uh...

416
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,100
It was definitely a night of all rape.

417
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,200
Yeah, it wasn't all, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

418
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,620
an all-rape.

419
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,300
Well, it was one of those rape-X days, you know?

420
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,520
You don't, we don't, we don't get those all the time.

421
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,600
I'm sorry, ladies, uh...

422
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,560
Hey, the weekend's...

423
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:40,940
...and boys.

424
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,140
You know, it can still happen

425
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,440
the 4th, you know.

426
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,220
If you need rape and stuff,

427
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,720
I'm sure there are subgeniuses around

428
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,820
who'll lead you in the right direction.

429
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,880
The very reason that they, uh,

430
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,040
make it, uh, illegal to broadcast, uh,

431
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,920
those dirty words is, uh,

432
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,720
because they don't want people to be reminded

433
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,660
of the fun things in life that are free.

434
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,640
When you stop and think about it, uh,

435
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,680
nearly every word that's on that list

436
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,400
is something that everyone does on a regular basis

437
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,580
or had to have done somewhere along their life

438
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,340
in order to, to exist.

439
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,020
I mean, no one would...

440
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,880
Or, or wishes to hell they could.

441
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,620
And yet, so we're going to take that action

442
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,800
and we're going to say,

443
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,600
that's the word you can't use,

444
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,200
that's the word you can't speak,

445
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,880
that's the word you can't think.

446
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,660
Uh, if you ever needed proof of the conspiracy,

447
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,180
what greater proof is there?

448
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,240
So, not only should you use those dirty words,

449
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,900
you should think those dirty words

450
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,580
and act on those dirty words

451
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,000
whenever you can

452
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,220
and whenever you are supposed to not.

453
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,580
Just do it. Think it. Say it.

454
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,860
In spite of the con.

455
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,220
You know, you should be the new Captain Kangaroo

456
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,740
or romper room teacher, Papa Joe.

457
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,760
There will be pancakes in the morning at the main stage.

458
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,160
And, well, first of all,

459
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,140
we'll have two more ranters

460
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,940
and then after this, zero defects

461
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,600
will be after the next two ranters.

462
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,400
Our two ranters are going to include

463
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,520
Suds Pacha and Susie the Floozy,

464
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,660
who is over here adjusting her beautiful flooziness.

465
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,380
She's working the ramp.

466
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,720
The tramp on the ramp will be after,

467
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,820
but first we'll have Suds Pacha.

468
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,100
We did fix the technical difficulties, I believe.

469
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,100
I'm about to tell you folks a story

470
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,160
I don't even tell the closest circle of my friends.

471
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,760
This is part two, my friends.

472
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,980
See, y'all,

473
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,440
don't know how close you can come.

474
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,920
Someone up on stage was talking about

475
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,420
the towers falling in 9-11 and all that.

476
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,360
Friends, I had my own personal 9-11

477
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,020
when I was in high school.

478
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:56,020
I experienced shit that most people couldn't even dream about.

479
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,540
What most people have to be paid to deal with,

480
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,780
I got to see firsthand.

481
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,420
See, I had a plane crash next to my house.

482
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,740
Bodies and fire and all that good stuff.

483
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,940
You ever seen what a human body actually looks like

484
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,500
when all the skin has been burned off of it?

485
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,340
You know the color of yellow on a Happy Meal?

486
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,980
Yeah, everybody knows the Happy Meal.

487
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,020
This was one Happy Meal you didn't want to dig into, folks.

488
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,280
Oh, and the smell.

489
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:22,820
Whew.

490
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,000
I tell you, that is one smell you will never forget.

491
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,000


492
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,040
But the one thing that's really amazing

493
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,200
is looking into those eyes and looking right back at you

494
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,060
with those crystal clear blue eyes.

495
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,920
He's just trying to stay awake.

496
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,520
He's got no feeling anymore.

497
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,200
He's in shock.

498
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,180
What do you tell the guy?

499
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,760
You think the Colts have a chance this year?

500
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,040
I don't know.

501
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,720
What do you do in a situation like that?

502
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,260
Oh, here come the paramedics.

503
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,140
You pick the guy up to move him out of the way

504
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,840
so they can put the fire out that's threatening

505
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,860
to burn down your whole neighborhood.

506
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:55,980
Guys, I'm telling you,

507
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,060
you're going to see the guy's leg falls out in your hand.

508
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,080
Oh, hell, that's just going to ruin your day.

509
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,100
So you get all bummed out about it,

510
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,080
and you just can't really deal with that kind of thing.

511
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,700
You feel yourself falling down that rabbit hole,

512
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,860
just taking you down.

513
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,900
See, and I had big plans that day.

514
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,560
I was going to go hang out with a young lady.

515
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,300
We were going to have some fun somehow, some way.

516
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,040
We were going to have fun.

517
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,460
Yeah, you can see how much fun I had that day.

518
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,040
But you know,

519
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,400
sitting at her house later that night,

520
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,520
drowning in my own misery,

521
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,820
I had a moment.

522
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,560
As I was falling down that rabbit hole of despair,

523
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,980
I had a vision.

524
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,240
Now, I told you last night about my first experiences with Bob

525
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,600
and how my teacher had a picture of him up on the wall.

526
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,600
And this was when I was a little kid.

527
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,420
Now I'm talking almost to the end of my high school years.

528
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,900
It's been a long time since I've seen Bob.

529
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,080
And that night I was in a hell of a state.

530
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,800
Bad, real bad.

531
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,700
Falling down that rabbit hole of despair.

532
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,060
Someone had the TV on in the background

533
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,580
and I was totally oblivious to it.

534
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,580
Until this happened.

535
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,500
What the hell do you think you're doing?

536
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,380
Dragging your butt through the day,

537
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,780
selling body and soul to a bunch of bland normals?

538
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,180
Acting stupid so they'll think you're one of them?

539
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,540
Tired of getting all of the guilt?

540
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,980
But none of the sex?

541
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,040
There is a simple answer, dear friend.

542
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,780
A glowing beacon of slack amidst the turmoil and darkness.

543
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,360
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living slack master

544
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,960
in his church of the subgenius.

545
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,980
Bob brings a new destiny for the abnormal.

546
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,140
For Bob comes to justify our sins,

547
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,940
to unmask the conspiracy,

548
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,480
and to get us back the slack they stole away.

549
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,280
It's us versus them.

550
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,420
Are you gonna fry in hell on earth alongside the pink boys?

551
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,100
Or will you pull the wool over your own eyes

552
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,300
and accept Bob into your mind?

553
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,260
Repent, quit your job, slack off,

554
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,120
and praise Bob!

555
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,540
Church of the Subgenius, eternal salvation,

556
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,620
or triple your money back.

557
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,860
Friends, it was that commercial, that moment,

558
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,700
that face that appeared on that screen

559
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,380
that drugged me testicles first

560
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,280
straight out of that rabbit hole of misery.

561
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,660
And my friends, that night,

562
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,780
I got laid!

563
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,100
Friends, that's what the power of Bob can do for you.

564
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,120
And if you'll stick around for another night,

565
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,280
I'll tell you the third part of this story.

566
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,640
Bless you, Brother Suds, for that testimony.

567
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,720
And right now, I think this is a good time

568
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,720
to put in a word for bag bomb.

569
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,720
If you have never heard of bag bomb,

570
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,580
bag bomb, this shit landed in the middle

571
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,320
of an Amish cornfield on a meteorite.

572
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,960
They put it in a green can,

573
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,220
and it's gotta be in a tin to keep the radiation in.

574
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,240
Because you know, that was a mighty inspiring story

575
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,840
that Brother Frodesh Pasha just shared with us.

576
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,340
In fact, it's got my lips all fucked up.

577
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,940
Oh, at that time, that benevolent,

578
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,500
supposedly benevolent God tried to kill him

579
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,600
with an airplane and just barely missed.

580
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,460
Why, if back then, Brother Pasha had had a 55-gallon drum,

581
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,300
a bag bomb, his life could have been dramatically different.

582
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,620
Because he could have smeared that on the most de-gloved specimen

583
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,900
that he had to haul out of that wreckage,

584
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,980
and instantly, something the size of a stang

585
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,780
would have been looking like one of those naked Richard Corbin guys

586
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,940
from Heavy Metal with a big ol' wang.

587
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,020
That's bag bomb.

588
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,580
Yes, the only thing bag bomb does not want,

589
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,440
and does not work on, is butt hurt.

590
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,400
But nothing helps butt hurt.

591
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,320
Oh, but yes, if he had had bag bomb,

592
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,600
his life might have been incredibly different.

593
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,560
Brother Pasha could have been Dr. Frodesh Pasha.

594
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,000
He could have been a respected medical expert,

595
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,800
sleeping on bags of money and banging unconscious patients,

596
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,220
and he would not have the slack that he has today.

597
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,000
Because that man,

598
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,980
who has come through hell to be swimming in slack,

599
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,700
is a beautiful testament of what happens

600
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,780
when you turn your life and your glands and your wallet over to Bob.

601
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,980
It's like that old crotch Robert Frost.

602
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,740
Back when he once wrote, back when he'd sobered up a bit,

603
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,240
I took a path through the wood,

604
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,340
and shit hell, there's a goddamn fucking fork in the road.

605
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,200
And you know, that Bob was right too,

606
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,280
because it's the fucking forks that stab you

607
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,860
in your collective ass every fucking time.

608
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,280
But it's the path not taken.

609
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,860
How do we not take the right path?

610
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,920
How do we fork the forks before they fork us up the butt?

611
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,040
Oh, but that's where the Dobbs comes in.

612
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:17,040
At Princess We recommends the eightfold path to slack.

613
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,980
I'm an old bitch.

614
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,600
And I'm getting kind of dotty.

615
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,160
And I can't remember eight anything.

616
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,060
I was eight before I was seven.

617
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,040
But that sure doesn't help me none of this.

618
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,680
I ain't no spring jism no more.

619
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,020
And at my age, all I can remember is one path.

620
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,300
One grimy back alley.

621
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,180
One condom-littered lover's lane.

622
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,960
One direction.

623
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,840
And right now, I'm feeling that goddamn gravitational pull

624
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,000
worse than ever,

625
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,820
because this planet sucks.

626
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,420
And it's gonna suck the life out of me

627
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,000
unless I work it to my advantage.

628
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,340
Yes, it's always right.

629
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,300
It's a choice that's left.

630
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,580
It's not as vague as north-southwest.

631
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,960
You can get your ass there by going around.

632
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,880
If you haven't guessed yet, my direction is down.

633
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,820
I am going down for Dobbs because it's a sure bet.

634
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,840
In this gravity well of toil and sweat.

635
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,260
And I know in my soul there's no better direction

636
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:28,800
than the one that leads you down to Bob's erection.

637
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,500
Oh, because Bob is the man there's no better to thank.

638
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,380
And while you're down there, give him a wank.

639
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,100
Praise Bob!

640
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,720
Praise Brother Suds for sharing that visceral, visceral,

641
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,680
story with us.

642
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,140
Praise Fruzy!

643
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,760
Praise fucking Hextate for keeping us all alive

644
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,020
for another fucking year.

645
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,660
Sticking it to the con.

646
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,700
I dig the mic right away. I'm sorry.

647
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,660
I'm sorry.

648
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,280
It works.

649
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,460
It works.

650
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,960
Everybody give Susie the Fluzy a round of applause.

651
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,840
Good evening, my fellow reverend doctors

652
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,620
of the Church of the Subgenius.

653
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:24,040
We are Boron Nuzzle from Kalamazoo, Michigan.

654
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,700
We are here this evening in anticipation of receiving

655
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,680
our pleasure saucers.

656
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:39,260
We want the fuck off this godforsaken ball of dirt

657
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,880
full of fucking pinks.

658
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,060
Praise Bob for striking the deal.

659
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,940
With the exists.

660
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:58,440
Which will allow us to say goodbye to all of these lily-livered pink bitches and bastards.

661
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,140
All of our fucking bosses.

662
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,640
All of our ex-wives and ex-husbands.

663
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,880
All of the judges and lawyers who have made our lives hell.

664
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,340
All of the politicians who pass legislation who make us want to slit our own fucking throats.

665
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:22,960
I'm looking forward to killing a certain English teacher from my high school when I get my saucer.

666
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,720
There are a couple of national landmarks I might take with me.

667
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:34,060
I have a feeling that I may actually go pick up one or two people that I happen to enjoy

668
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,000
and keep them as pets.

669
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:41,700
But goddamn is it going to be good to escape from planet dirt.

670
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,700
That was Boron Nuzzle live at X-Day as is our background music heard right now.

671
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:02,240
Next, and this may require some imagination on your part and may be a vomit bucket,

672
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:09,560
the sideshow marvel Saint Andrew the Impaled with his human blockhead self-torture

673
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,100
and a great song and a great rant.

674
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,500
Roommates.

675
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,980
Fellow janitors.

676
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,400
I've seen him almost set a number of things on fire.

677
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,660
Like my cello.

678
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,800
Definitely my heart.

679
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:31,360
Without any further ado, please give it up for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's premier and pain-proof clown,

680
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:39,620
Andrew the Impaled!

681
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,320
Thank you very much, Mandy.

682
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,840
I was wondering who she was going to introduce right there.

683
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:55,940
All right.

684
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
It turned out it was me.

685
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,520
Ladies and gentlemen.

686
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

687
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,280
Race fans and, and, and, and.

688
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,240
What you.

689
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,180
What you.

690
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,280
Are about to see.

691
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,200
Is real!

692
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,180
This is reality!

693
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,940
Oh, trust me.

694
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,880
Trust me, my friend.

695
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,620
This is reality.

696
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,420
Indisputable.

697
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,560
Obvious.

698
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,580
And right before your eyes.

699
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,120
You are not watching MTV.

700
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,740
Real TV.

701
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,540
Nobody watches MTV, in fact, anymore.

702
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,820
Fox TV or the Jerry Springer Show.

703
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,600
This is not World Wide Wrestling, nor is this the World Wide Web.

704
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,020
What you are about to see is shocking.

705
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,840
What you are about to see is amazing, amusing, and a miracle if I pull it all off.

706
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,220
Leaders and jewels.

707
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,940
Those are units of measurement.

708
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:03,520
What you are about to see is real.

709
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,580
Yes, everyone.

710
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,780
I am Andrew the Impaled, Pittsburgh's premier pain-proof clown.

711
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,140
And, uh.

712
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,100
I can't see much of you right now because this light is here.

713
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:15,780
Uh.

714
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,360
This.

715
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,820
This is an up-close-and-personal show.

716
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,360
So, if you kids kindly would, please.

717
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,240
Move a little closer!

718
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,220
Blood washes out and pain goes away.

719
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,000
Move a little closer!

720
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,360
This is an up-close-and-personal show.

721
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,680
You kids acting like you're the cool kids in the back of the bus.

722
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,560
Boy, you ain't gonna see shit from back there.

723
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,200
And if you don't see shit, you won't believe it.

724
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,920
And if you don't believe it, what's the sense in me doing it?

725
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,520
Hell, by the time we're done here, you're gonna ask each other,

726
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,140
what's the sense in that guy doing any of this?

727
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:51,500
So move a little closer and experience the karma of pain.

728
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,260
All right, all right.

729
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,900
First things first.

730
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,840
First things fucking first.

731
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,740
I must introduce.

732
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,260
I must introduce the star of my show.

733
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,760
I mean, you might think it's me.

734
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,340
I'm the guy up here.

735
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,860
You might think it's me.

736
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,820
I'm the guy with the microphone.

737
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,740
You might think it's me.

738
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,940
Because I make all the money and most of the decisions.

739
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,820
But alas, I am not the star of my own show.

740
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:25,720
No, in fact, the star of my show is none other than the toolbox of death!

741
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,660
Come on, give it up for the stupid toolbox of death!

742
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,780
Yeah, all right, yeah.

743
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:38,040
People who can at least act like you've had some culture for once in your godforsaken lives.

744
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,720
Now I'm gonna need a...

745
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,240
a volunteer and you, you do fine.

746
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,020
You come here with the beers.

747
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,720
Come on, hurry up.

748
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,220
Yeah, you.

749
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,540
Yeah, I don't know what the word volunteer means.

750
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,180
Get over there.

751
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,120
There's a ramp.

752
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,820
Hey, move out of her way so this lady can come up here and help me out here.

753
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,700
All right, very good.

754
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,440
That was very fast.

755
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:52,980
That was excellent.

756
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,560
All right, good.

757
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,680
I need, okay, I need your help.

758
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,100
What's your name?

759
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,380
Cat Feather.

760
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:57,740
Cat Feather.

761
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:58,800
Cat Feather.

762
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,520
Very nice to...

763
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,880
Very nice to see you.

764
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:01,980
I've seen...

765
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,800
I've seen your tweets on the Facebook.

766
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,040
Yeah, it's true.

767
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:06,860
It's true.

768
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,480
It's true.

769
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,320
But, uh...

770
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:09,720
I'm not a...

771
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,820
This has nothing to do with sitting on anybody's Facebook.

772
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,720
You, Cat Feather, kindly reach into the toolbox of death and grab me a nail.

773
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,300
You know a nail sharpened to one end and dulled on the other like this guy here?

774
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,620
Yeah, okay, very good.

775
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,580
All right, examine that nail carefully.

776
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,680
Make sure it's indeed a real nail.

777
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,500
Make sure it does not bend, doesn't fold, doesn't retract, doesn't telescope inside of itself.

778
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,380
Is that a real nail?

779
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,000
Yes.

780
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,240
That's a real nail.

781
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,240


782
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,700
Wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

783
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,760
Do you have any reason to question your perception of reality at this time?

784
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,360
Yes.

785
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,420
You see, I was gonna say, I mean, your pupils are like fucking saucers over here.

786
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,640
Hey, we'll make new human blockheads after the show, okay?

787
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,760
For right now, you're gonna have to wait a second.

788
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,480
Now, if you would kindly hand the nail back to me.

789
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,560
All right, no offense to you, but sterilization is very important.

790
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,820
If you thought the aughts were bad, you know, trust me, the teens are gonna be even worse.

791
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:31,140
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I tell you, examine carefully as I, Andrew the Impaled, attempt to take this very real 20 penny spike and hammer it directly into my fucking face!

792
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,280
You know.

793
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:36,940
You know.

794
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,580
You know.

795
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,720
Alright, hold on.

796
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,220
I did say, I did say all the into my fucking face.

797
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:53,760
And all the way, is a promise that I, unlike these guys over here, can actually deliver upon!

798
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:59,980
Alright, alright, here we go, so, so, here we go, here we go, here we go, inadequates.

799
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,820
Here is all the way into my fucking face.

800
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,560
all the way into my fucking face!

801
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,220
Yes, you can applaud, people.

802
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,100
This is highbrow entertainment.

803
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,520
This is genuine culture here.

804
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,060
I mean, you might never have seen culture before in your lives,

805
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,080
but trust me, there is some culture here in Wisteria,

806
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,700
and unfortunately, this is it.

807
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,180
All right, you guys in the front,

808
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,600
you might want to watch out during the extraction.

809
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,200
I sometimes tend to spew,

810
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,560
and you're wearing nice clothes there.

811
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,240
No, I'm joking, I'm joking, I'm joking.

812
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,900
You're right, those are terrible fucking clothes.

813
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,540
Okay, who's ever token you're burning a seed,

814
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,200
and it's fucking sticking up the stage here?

815
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,340
So pop that shit out of there.

816
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,680
You're going to go sterile, all right?

817
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,560
Here you go.

818
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,200
And to the impaled souvenirs, everyone!

819
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,140
All right, they don't come this often,

820
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,200
and they're never that cheap.

821
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,100
But wait, there's more.

822
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,560
You, reach into the toolbox of death

823
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,880
and grab me a screwdriver.

824
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,780
Reach into the toolbox, there we go, okay.

825
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,400
Examine that screwdriver carefully.

826
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,180
Make sure it's real.

827
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,960
Make sure it does not bend, doesn't fold,

828
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,460
doesn't retract.

829
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,300
You might not want to touch that end.

830
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,280
You could just stab it into the stage

831
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,900
if you want to check its validity any further.

832
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,040
Holy shit, Lorraine above it.

833
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,000
All right.

834
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,000
Don't litter, kids.

835
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Here, give that back to me.

836
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,120
No, that actually counts as community service right there.

837
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,080
I say don't litter, kids, like six times a year,

838
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,760
and I'm off the hook.

839
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,380
It's fucking cool.

840
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,220
All right, there we go.

841
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,360
Once again, sterilization's very important.

842
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,380
I see the types of people

843
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,180
with whom you associate.

844
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,480
By that, I mean all of you.

845
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,780
And now, blah, blah, blah,

846
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,080
the fucking screwdriver, blah, blah, blah,

847
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,940
my fucking face, all right?

848
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,240
All the way into my fucking face!

849
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,920
Yes, this is the part where you join the pain

850
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,640
by beating one hand against another

851
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,640
in a show of appreciation

852
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,740
for what you're seeing on the stage here.

853
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,220
All right, now shut up for a second

854
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:05,880
because here's the thing.

855
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,320
Here's the thing.

856
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,060
Here's the thing.

857
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,280
This is the thing.

858
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,120
This is the thing.

859
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,540
Here's the thing.

860
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,240
The thing is this.

861
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,940
Here's the thing.

862
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,880
See, at this point in time,

863
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,400
the tip of the screwdriver is four inches

864
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,060
all the way back into my fucking face,

865
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,200
brushing against the medulla oblongata

866
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,740
at the base of my brain,

867
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,260
at the top of my spine,

868
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,440
in the front of the back of my head,

869
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,780
and when I push that very small

870
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,520
but very important part of the brain in and out

871
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,000
and in and out and in and twist it just so,

872
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,360
I can adjust the radio stations that I pick up on my phone,

873
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,360


874
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,860
my fillings.

875
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,700
Let's see if we can try it here.

876
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,200
Here.

877
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,300
Viva Los Angeli!

878
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,040
No sleep till the morning light, my father.

879
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,720
Yeah, he cried more than a feel into my carpet ride.

880
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,260
Well, you shook me.

881
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,740
All I need is just a little red Corvette.

882
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,340
Baby, come back, blame it all on me

883
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,320
and the boys don't cry.

884
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,120
All right, I'm gonna bring this guy

885
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,080
to my head before I lose it.

886
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,700
I should have rolled it.

887
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:06,460
Yeah!

888
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,020
Now!

889
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,620
Two, three, ah!

890
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,240
Ah!

891
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:11,240


892
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:11,240


893
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,220
Ah!

894
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,920
Now that's completely beyond the limits of good taste.

895
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,540
I apologize for that, but you know what?

896
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,440
You know what?

897
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,440
Brain goo tastes like chicken brain goo.

898
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,420
Anyway, you've been a great help,

899
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,040
and what's your name again?

900
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,080
Cat Feather.

901
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,920
Hey, everybody give a warm round of applause

902
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,540
for the toolbox of death!

903
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,060
Yeah, get off my stage, Cat Feather.

904
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,140
You've been great and lovely and wonderful

905
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,080
and helpful and all that.

906
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,460
All right.

907
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,140
Now, I've been doing the sideshow bullshit

908
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:43,360
for a long ass time, and I fucking tell you it hurts.

909
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,220
So, instead of just sideshow bullshit,

910
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,860
I think it's only appropriate that you folks

911
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,860
get to suffer too.

912
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:55,900
Yeah!

913
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:57,600
Shh!

914
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,540
Be very, very quiet.

915
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,460
Ah!

916
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,440
Ah!

917
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,020
Uh!

918
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,120
Uh!

919
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,260
Just like a car crash

920
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,100
Just like a knife

921
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,320
My favorite weapon

922
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,180
Is the look in your eye

923
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,640
Just like a car crash

924
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,480
Just like a knife

925
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,380
The only truth I know

926
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,660
Is the look in your eye

927
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,480
Chewing on glass

928
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,660
And tainting my fingers

929
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,700
I'm not the one

930
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,700

You're one out of wise

934

You're one out of wise

935
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,440
You're one out of wise

936
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,780
You're one out of wise

Thanks for watching

968
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:36,440
Your

969
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,040
So

970
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,560
Sons

971
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,040
You

972
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,340
And, like, that guy had a rough fucking weekend.

973
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,640
That's not fucking suffering.

974
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,400
That's the pansiest fucking martyr I've ever seen in my entire life.

975
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,000
But, no, I digress.

976
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:52,600
The thing is, if he did go to all that trouble, supposedly, for some, you know, important purpose,

977
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:59,600
wouldn't he feel like a dick if I wasn't out there sinning, like, all over the place?

978
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,940
I mean, you know, you go to a lot of work, you know, you prepare a meal for somebody,

979
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,560
and they're like, ugh, and they don't even fucking eat it, all right?

980
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:10,740
You know, or you go to all this trouble to make somebody's big special birthday party happen,

981
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:11,960
and they don't give a shit.

982
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:12,820
They don't care, you know?

983
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,020
You feel like you're a dick.

984
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:22,420
Yeah, so I'm only doing my part for Jesus or whoever martyred by sinning.

985
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:24,560
Yes.

986
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,240
Yes, praise Andrew, the truly impaled.

987
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,180
And now from X Day at Wisteria,

00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,100
Now it's time to answer to America.

And we're on the last show. This is the last, last show.

1057
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,620
What'd you do? Did you get up early?

1058
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,180
Oh, you wish it was the last show.

1059
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,560
It's the last show.

1060
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,620
What? We don't have any more to do.

1061
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,720
When I ask for ranters, which I do occasionally,

1062
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,140
it always comes back to the same realization.

1063
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,660
We talk about different types of people in this church, these categories we apply.

1064
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:37,260
I always hear about the Evangelicals and the Holocaustals.

1065
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,800
The Bobbies and the Conyites.

1066
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:53,660
But there's one sort of duality, one split of types of people that drives me mad.

1067
00:49:54,660 --> 00:50:02,100
That is the Rewardians versus the Emergentists.

1068
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,740
Emergentiles.

1069
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,900
Now, now, now, don't get me wrong.

1070
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:11,580
I understand some people's slack is sitting on your ass and drinking beer and watching other people do stuff.

1071
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,400
And that's fine.

1072
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,180
Good for you.

1073
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,000
I'm going to let you in on a little secret, my Rewardian friend.

1074
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:24,920
Something that Stang and I know and people like Susie the Floozy and Popus Pantyara,

1075
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,680
things that us Emergentiles happen to know.

1076
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,860
You see, the Rewardian gets slack.

1077
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:33,320
Every single day.

1078
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,860
I won't deny it.

1079
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:39,760
You guys are sitting in slack every minute that you can.

1080
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,820
And that's cool.

1081
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,360
You've got this nice trickle of slack running down your back.

1082
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:51,580
Going right up down your ass, cracking into your ass, and you're just happy as a pig in shit.

1083
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:56,160
And that's good for you Rewardians, but I've got to tell you a secret.

1084
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,100
Doesn't work that way for the Emergentiles.

1085
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,520
And you Rewardians say,

1086
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,320
Pisces, why don't you just sit down and chill out?

1087
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:12,680
Or Stang, Stang, why don't you just sit down and have a beer and chill out and just relax and slack off, Stang?

1088
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,720
And Susie, you don't have to do all of that stuff.

1089
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,400
And Pantyara, why are you doing all these great things?

1090
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:25,180
You should be just hanging around and smoking pot and drinking beer and slacking off.

1091
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,300
Because we know the secret, friends.

1092
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:33,540
And yes, you Rewardians get that slow trickle of slack every day.

1093
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:40,180
But the Emergentile, when the project is done, when we have finished the work,

1094
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:48,420
we get an Amazonian flow of slack that blows your trickle out of the water.

1095
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,580
It's the difference between just getting a hard-on

1096
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:58,240
and busting the biggest load of your life.

1097
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,040
You Rewardians get that stiffy every day from that slack.

1098
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:10,600
But us Emergentiles, we're sopping wet from the spunk of our slack orgasms.

1099
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,340
A slack tsunami, yes.

1100
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,240
Now it's okay, I'm not telling you Rewardians you should just get up and get off your ass.

1101
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,680
Because first of all, I know you won't.

1102
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,260
I see you.

1103
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,260
You're like, fuck that shit.

1104
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,060
I've got my campsite.

1105
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,000
I'm going to sit here.

1106
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,820
I'm going to drink until I pass out.

1107
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,700
And that's okay because you know what?

1108
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:44,640
If they were all Emergentiles, then we wouldn't get that tsunami of slack.

1109
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,720
We wouldn't get that wet between our legs feeling when it goes just right.

1110
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:52,400
And people ask me, Pisces, why do you put all this fucking effort into it?

1111
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,080
Pisces, why do you do this?

1112
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:01,240
Because when it goes just fucking right, when you guys have the best X day ever,

1113
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:07,740
when everything runs perfectly and shit happens on this stage that is absolutely amazing and mind blowing,

1114
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,460
I fucking cum.

1115
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,260
Alright?

1116
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,980
I fucking get the hell off.

1117
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,640
It is like, that's the only thing.

1118
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,300
We've had some trials and tribulations and I won't go into that.

1119
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:24,060
But what really, really brought me back is the fact that,

1120
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,640
that I love the completed process.

1121
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,580
I love how it ends.

1122
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,540
And I love watching you guys get off.

1123
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,780
And knowing in my heart of hearts as an Emergentile,

1124
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:38,580
you're not getting off nearly as fucking good as I am.

1125
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:46,380
I know I said a bunch of shit already, but I'm here to say something else and you're all going to fucking listen to it.

1126
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:51,820
This is my first X day and god damn it, I waited to come to X day until I had something to bring.

1127
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:52,800
Something to represent.

1128
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,780
Because I'm one of those Emergentiles she was just talking about.

1129
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:01,720
And I just want to tell all you fucking Rewardians that I worked my ass off so you guys can all get your yucks.

1130
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,220
And you're welcome.

1131
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,740
This is the last show of the millennium folks.

1132
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,260
On the last show of the millennium.

1133
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:13,740
It is the last show.

1134
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:20,940
Thank you to my fellow Emergentiles, Priestess Pisces, who really keeps X days going.

1135
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,640
And Reverend,

1136
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,180
Reverend Sid Redlin of Boron Nuzzle, the band also heard in the background.

1137
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:31,920
This is the Hour of Slack from subgenius.com

1138
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:39,520
and many radio stations that normally play these shows won't be playing this one or several that are coming up.

1139
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:48,640
And to take us out, we have a hardcore song called Squeal by a close personal friend of the large,

1140
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,280
Shranz Ferdinand of I...

1141
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,940
I believe Finland.

1142
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,180
Praise Shranz. Praise Bob.

1143
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:00,300
Whoa!

1144
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,580
Last minute change of long range plans, friends.

1145
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:08,960
I'll play Shranz in a minute.

1146
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,340
But first,

1147
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:17,220
I'm forced by necessity to finally tell you,

1148
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,740
the individual listener,

1149
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:20,880
that if you,

1150
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,100
you personally,

1151
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:27,680
don't do this one little thing to help me out,

1152
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:36,860
this song by Shranz will in fact be the last thing you will ever hear on Hour of Slack.

1153
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,800
And this will be the last episode of Hour of Slack.

1154
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:41,960
Yeah, I know.

1155
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:42,980
Haha, very funny.

1156
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:43,900
But in fact,

1157
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,140
I'm dead broke.

1158
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:52,820
And though I may not sound it in announcer mode,

1159
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,580
reading from the script,

1160
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:01,140
I'm almost suicidally depressed by recent events.

1161
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,440
Or non-events, as the case may be.

1162
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,840
Bob is rich, of course.

1163
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,840
But his church of the subgenius, however,

1164
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,480
is dead broke.

1165
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:18,120
And the Hour of Slack is more broke than both the church and me, put you in.

1166
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,920
I hope you're all in there.

1167
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:22,740
And I'm sorry to let you all go to sleep.

1168
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,200
Because this show is,

1169
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,420
or I should say was,

1170
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,040
played on a number of college and public stations.

1171
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:35,280
It's against their rules for me to try to raise money for myself.

1172
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,860
And that's why we've never harped on the membership,

1173
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,520
the 30 bucks thing,

1174
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,720
or now 35 bucks,

1175
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,240
or asked for donations,

1176
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,160
or even give prices,

1177
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,860
because on these kind of stations,

1178
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:54,960
it's illegal. But this episode isn't for broadcast, just the internet, and so in this one case,

1179
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:03,900
for this one final and first time, I can tell you the truth. I recently came out of the haze of

1180
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:13,340
dobsful slack that I've been in for the last 1,327 weeks and admitted to myself that although

1181
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:23,640
roughly like 1,300 to 2,000 people download this show every week and it's mailed to nine stations,

1182
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:30,400
only three of those stations have actually bothered to pay the requested $5 an episode

1183
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:39,420
for the last three years, and maybe three of the 1,300 downloaders have ever sent us a donation.

1184
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,320
Then, last week,

1185
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:50,940
I very foolishly looked at the general feedback I was getting from listeners,

1186
00:57:53,440 --> 00:58:00,180
which is essentially none at all or maybe a four-letter, a four-word non sequitur every

1187
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:07,660
few weeks or else death threats. Now, I've dealt with poverty for 35 years now, and that's fine.

1188
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:13,320
To me, poverty is normal. What I've never faced before is absolutely

1189
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:24,800
pennilessness and having my morale beaten down by cruel people. I made the mistake of asking on a

1190
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:30,780
couple of internet subgenius forums how many people listen to the show, and I made the even

1191
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:36,060
bigger mistake of saying I was so depressed that I didn't feel like I could keep doing the show

1192
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:43,320
anymore. And here's the response I got. About a dozen people posted very, very, very, very, very,

1193
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:48,520
heartfelt thank yous and sincere descriptions about how the show has helped them,

1194
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:56,460
from cheering them up to saving their very lives. About 30 people had enough energy to give it a

1195
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:04,840
like, you know, a thumbs up. Three people who, gee, oddly enough, happened to do other

1196
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:09,300
subgenius shows or podcasts, and I don't mean the puzzling evidence guys,

1197
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,180
practically jumped for joy that I might,

1198
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:19,540
be leaving the airwaves just to them. I can't even begin to describe what it felt like,

1199
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:25,460
and I'm pretty good with words. But here's how much all of those people think the hour

1200
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:35,260
of slack is worth in terms of money. Not one penny. It took about two days of people laughing

1201
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:41,020
at my agony or damning me with faint praise or even praising me to high heaven in that handful

1202
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,320
of cases before I could even get to the point where I could even get to the point where I could

1203
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,020
get to the point where I could even get to the point where I could even get to the point where

1204
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:50,320
I finally broke down in tears, literally, in a graveyard by coincidence,

1205
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:58,480
and right in front of a big tombstone with the name Smith on it, just by happenstance.

1206
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:05,900
I was on my way to WCSB at the time to drop off some old reruns so that I

1207
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:13,060
wouldn't have to try to be funny anymore. I really was truly at the end of my

1208
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:13,320
journey. I was at the end of my journey. I was at the end of my journey. I was at the end of my

1209
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:16,500
journey. I was at the end of my journey. I was at the end of my journey. I was at

1210
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:16,500


1211
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,720
was crying too because she saw the results of my public confession as well,

1212
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:27,200
which was many, many good intentions and three death-dealing insults from

1213
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:37,760
but not one penny. The only reason I didn't quit then and am now doing this possibly

1214
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:43,280
last show is because that same day, the day I was about to basically kill the show,

1215
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:53,820
the website, the whole thing. I got in the mail from Reverend Louie Louie a box of four cans of

1216
01:00:53,820 --> 01:01:00,300
ranch-style beans, which I can't get here in Cleveland, and a check for 150 bucks.

1217
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:06,800
He had sent that before my nervous breakdown and public cries for help, so it wasn't pity.

1218
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:15,040
He actually meant it. He actually likes me. I also remembered, or we reminded me, that Dr. Dark

1219
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:20,180
had come by a week earlier just to purchase a hundred bucks worth of subgenius collectibles

1220
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:27,220
that he didn't already have, and I also remembered that three stations still actually go to the

1221
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:36,000
trouble of paying for the postage and CD costs of this show. WEFT in Champaign, Illinois,

1222
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:45,720
WQFS in Greensboro, North Carolina, and Rob Zarka of WCNI in Connecticut.

1223
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:55,800
So basically, this is this last chance to keep our enemies from killing the show,

1224
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,460
just as they practically killed my spirit last Friday online. This episode of Hour of Slack

1225
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:06,360
is dedicated to those three stations, although they can't play it.

1226
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:13,920
And Dr. Dark and Reverend Louie Louie. It's also dedicated to Priestess Pisces and her lucky

1227
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:20,600
fiancé, Reverend Frodo Suds Shaw, who've done more to keep me from killing myself than anyone

1228
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:28,080
except maybe Princess Wee and Dr. Legume. I will also admit that I'm motivated by sheer spite

1229
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,020
regarding the so- Gaming

1230
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:31,400
of a

1231
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,880
bakery and the series of videos I see文化

1232
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,440
still

1233
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,280
on a

1234
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,180
floof

1235
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:37,400
networkị

1236
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:40,400
which pretty much

1237
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:57,440
only commands the

1238
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:07,000
one person to prove to me that this show is worth at least one penny to them.

1239
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:15,340
There's a donation button on the radio page and also the front page of subgenius.com.

1240
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:24,860
So far, this show, Hour of Slack, has proved itself to be worth kind words from a few people.

1241
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:31,880
But I want one person to prove to me that it's worth even more than words, at least

1242
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:38,240
one cent, by going to that donate button or mailing a check to our P.O. box or whatever,

1243
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:47,480
anything to reassure me that my last 26 years of making and copying and uploading and mailing

1244
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:54,640
and linking the Hour of Slack is worth some monetary value and hasn't been a

1245
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:54,840
consequence.

1246
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:59,800
It's a complete and utter waste of my very life.

1247
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:03,520
Any monetary value.

1248
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:09,600
I'd love for it to be worth 50 bucks to you, but if you're like me, one dollar is a lot

1249
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,040
to give.

1250
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:16,060
Actually, I spend about 20 bucks per show myself just on CDs, postage, and envelope,

1251
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:20,480
and let's not even talk about the time involved.

1252
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:23,740
But seriously.

1253
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:24,220
Seriously.

1254
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:24,680
Seriously.

1255
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:24,680


1256
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:24,840


1257
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:24,840


1258
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:24,840


1259
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:24,840


1260
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:24,840


1261
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:24,840


1262
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:32,040
One person, one, can prove that they found this show to have been worth one single penny.

1263
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,600
A dime would be even better, but I don't want to get my hopes up only to have them crushed

1264
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,140
again.

1265
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:47,900
If I can get one, one cent donation from one person, that will be more than almost anyone

1266
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:54,840
else has done for me during these darkest, well, next darkest days of my entire life.

1267
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:05,320
Yes, you could save the show and my mind, such as it is, for one penny.

1268
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:12,880
Now, I understand that the effort of saying something nice might be too much for 99% of

1269
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,080
you.

1270
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:19,600
I know that pushing a like button on Facebook is too much like work, but I'm asking for

1271
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,120
even more than that.

1272
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,820
I asked online several places.

1273
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,700
I got nothing.

1274
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:29,500
Not even the one penny.

1275
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,160
I begged.

1276
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:37,520
I tore my heart out in front of everybody and got kicked in the teeth, or the tooth,

1277
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:42,720
I should say, by a person that I thought was one of my best friends.

1278
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:48,300
I got many, many kind words from a dozen people and a sentence or two from a few more.

1279
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:53,340
But now I'm asking for something much harder to give than a thank you.

1280
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,820
I'm asking for a thank you.

1281
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:55,100
I'm asking for a penny.

1282
01:05:56,140 --> 01:06:02,260
I need to know if anybody out there, any single one listener, has ever gotten enough slack

1283
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:07,960
from these years and years of toil, mostly by me, to feel that it was worth that penny.

1284
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:12,000
Because so far, apparently, that's not what it's worth.

1285
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:18,440
It's worth lots of very supportive sentences, but not worth a penny, much less a dime.

1286
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:24,200
Can you, brother, just you, just one listener?

1287
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:26,780
Make me feel a little better about this?

1288
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:34,460
Can you help the church by hitting that donation button or addressing an envelope to Cleveland

1289
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:35,180
Heights, Ohio?

1290
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:43,520
Can you be the one person rich enough to spend that one cent and keep this show on the internet?

1291
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:45,360
Fuck the stations.

1292
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:49,860
They've taken us for granted long enough, aside from the three that pay.

1293
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,700
Fuck their listeners who can't be bothered to pledge $5.

1294
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:58,440
During a pledge drive, aside from the 10 or so that might have.

1295
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:06,820
I'm talking to you, the one subgenius who is rich enough and merciful enough to send me

1296
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:15,120
an amount of actual money to help me psychologically, even if it's only one cent's worth of help,

1297
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:21,100
to help me not have to sell my equipment, erase the download servers and the website

1298
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,220
and the archives, and move to my pappy's basement.

1299
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:25,560
In Texas.

1300
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,700
At least help me kid myself for a few months more that that's not going to be necessary.

1301
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:36,300
If you aren't that person, maybe you'd feel better about buying something fair and square.

1302
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:43,080
We have two huge catalogs of stuff online, mostly just sitting there.

1303
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:51,780
A tiny minority of subgeniuses, the special few who can and actually have read our three main books,

1304
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,020
call them life-changing.

1305
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:59,580
Heck, you might even want a $2 Bob pin or a Bob t-shirt.

1306
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:08,080
Golly, maybe even to finally become a minister or possibly own one of our many DVDs.

1307
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,200
See, I was a video editor before I was an hour of slack editor.

1308
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:18,560
Or maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree and you are not that particular subgenius.

1309
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:21,760
You're not the one who thinks this show is worth a penny.

1310
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,640
In that case, goodbye forever.

1311
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:32,440
And the song by, well, whatever you'd call it, Hardcore, by Shanz Ferdinand,

1312
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:39,160
will indeed be the last new thing you'll ever hear on the show once called The Hour of Slack.

1313
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:46,900
That's subgenius.com if you're that one penny-rich person

1314
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:52,580
who gives that one slightest fucking shit

1315
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:54,720
about what happens to me.

1316
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:59,440
And this show and the church of the subgenius.

1317
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:27,300
Because I'm a began.

1318
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,640
And it's probably just a

1319
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:28,640


1320
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:28,640


1321
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:28,640


1322
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:28,640


1323
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:28,640


1324
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:32,660
that's

1325
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,660
well,
