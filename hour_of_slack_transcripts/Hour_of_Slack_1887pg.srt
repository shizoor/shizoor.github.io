00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
From NPR News in Washington, I'm under direction of an independent administrator.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,600
The Justice Department says it has pee.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,700
Senior Obama administration officials want to keep the pee.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,500
Tom Pirelli says the department finished pee remains this weekend.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,900
The Justice Department continues to investigate whether pee broke the disaster.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,200
Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen has resumed drilling a pee well that's slated to intercept the end of this week.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,620
Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen says...

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,320
President Obama says people can rest along the Gulf Coast.

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,400
We're excited that fish can go back to work. In fact, we had some yesterday.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,020
President speaking as he welcomed taking a break.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,420
But House Republican Leader John Boehner says...

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,640
Demanding and asking the question, where are the American people?

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,460
Boehner told NBC the way to stimulate the economy is by cutting hiring this morning.

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,420
Oscar-winning actress Patricia Neal is aimed at preventing...

15
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:02,020
tens of thousands of public school teachers and state and local government workers from NPR News in Washington.

16
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,300
Is this thing on? It is, huh?

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,920
It is on, and so are you.

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,060
You can scoot it over closer to your face if you want.

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,520
Oh, how many times have I fallen for that one?

20
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,600
How many times have you fallen for that one?

21
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,240
Too many. I'm starting to wear a pillow on my ass.

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,120
Helps on the landings.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,660
Well, we have a great deal of material to go over today.

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,980
Some of the old tried and truisms need to be tried out once more.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,620
Hashed out and beaten against the rocks and left out to dry.

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,160
Are you leaving too, Susie?

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,300
No, no, I'm not fleeing. I'm redistributing my wealth.

28
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,180
All right, well, let's have an even distribution of that.

29
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,560
I brought enough for the whole class.

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,460
Bounteous booty and begin our introductory religious lesson of instruction.

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,460
Welcome to the third 13X Day live hour of slack.

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,620
Which will sound really different the next time you hear it.

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,280
Well, yes, it will be specially augmented, but what about the background?

34
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,780
Do we have that today? Background?

35
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,820
Oh, background music?

36
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,680
Yeah, the background music track. There it is.

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,160
All right, now you see it.

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,700
It's a wonderful party.

39
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,540
It's wacky.

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
Yeah, we're all having a great time.

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,300
It's the unending cocktail hour here at X Day 2010,

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,620
the 13th X Day of beautiful summer weather here at the Brushwood Campground

43
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,940
where things are getting out of control.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
Whoa, it's wacky, wild, goofy, wiggly.

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,340
I've never been in control in Brushwood.

46
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,040
That's what's so wonderful about it.

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,260
Let us not disabuse the unenlightened of their long-cherished, if pathetic, beliefs.

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,300
Mmm.

49
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:03,120
Of course, control, unillusioned, superimposed over the hideous, indifferent face of the universe.

50
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,060
But we live by such illusions.

51
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,240
At least I know I do.

52
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:08,980
Mmm.

53
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,760
That's how you pull the wool over your own eyes.

54
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,260
Yes, with the realization that although you can never truly know unless all the factors are considered,

55
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,880
you also can never know all the factors.

56
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,200
So you just have to guess at it.

57
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,540
Mmm.

58
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,720
Make a good guess.

59
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,640
And right then, and I tell you...

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,780
That's them again.

61
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,000
I wish there was someone to help me get out of this.

62
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,360
Yeah.

63
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,680
And I said, choo.

64
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,860
He goes, uh, I'm still eating it.

65
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,680
Uh, huh.

66
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,540
Give us a little bit of, give us, give us some, some, a little bit more about this.

67
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,100
Bob, Bob, Bob.

68
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,820
Bob's Slack.

69
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,280
Um, uh, um, sounds simple.

70
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,760
Bob, you there?

71
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,060
He can, he can barely walk.

72
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,280
In other words, the show has been canceled.

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,540
Yeah, and we have a...

74
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,520
Have you no sympathy for the blind audience?

75
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,380
Well, it's traditional that we have no sympathy for the blind audience.

76
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,500
Well, I'm not sure.

77
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:25,940
I don't know if that's true.

78
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,780
They don't expect us to.

79
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,460
That's what I'm doing.

80
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,900
That's why they're listening.

81
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,000
I can barely stand to listen to your show.

82
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,200
You have so little sympathy.

83
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,540
Sorry.

84
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,360
Yeah, I mean...

85
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,780
It takes me, it takes me like three days to edit one of those two hour shows.

86
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,740
I can't listen to it when I'm listening to it.

87
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,320
Just for that one minute that's good.

88
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,280
I have to turn, I have to take the headphones off while I'm doing it.

89
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,920
Your shows are really hard to masturbate to, Stang.

90
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,840
It's really rude.

91
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,300
So you...

92
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,340
Oh, you mean, Stang's show is hard to masturbate to.

93
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,540
I'm glad you made that clear.

94
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,220
Well, we're hoping to change that with the...

95
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,220
I always choke the chicken to Dr. Hall and Philo, though.

96
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:57,860
Yeah.

97
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,260
They always make me get my nut and pull my toes.

98
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,460
We have had testimonials that people do get off listening to our show.

99
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,440
Well, I told you about masturbating Sean.

100
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,200
Long known.

101
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,840
We got masturbated himself to death listening to our show.

102
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,780
The thing is, I don't intend to...

103
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,860
My show has more masturbators than yours does.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,780
I can't help it.

105
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,200
I don't know.

106
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,340
I don't know how many...

107
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,720
We have higher quality masturbators, though.

108
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, I'll bring you that.

109
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,000
Yours are still alive.

110
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:20,600
The highest quality.

111
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,120
The most lovely.

112
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,200
We've tested our masturbators.

113
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,200


114
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,200


115
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,020
Our masturbators, through opinion research firms, have found that...

116
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,700
Firms.

117
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,240
Their knowledge is in-depth.

118
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,260
They know exactly what they like, what they want.

119
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,200
Now, do you know which person they masturbate to the most?

120
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:41,700
I know.

121
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,480
I'm sure each of you guys knows exactly which is the most popular.

122
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,920
Yes?

123
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,940
They only masturbate to me in prison.

124
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,100
Nothing?

125
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,120
It's a moot point.

126
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,840
No point in arguing with such geniuses.

127
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,020
We're just talking in a historical fashion.

128
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,440
I will not eat that bomb.

129
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,240
Hallelujah.

130
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,220
Here's the secret.

131
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,460
I no longer live.

132
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,640
Metamorphosis.

133
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,780
Hi.

134
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,900
All right.

135
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,900
Come on.

136
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,900
And so, you know, I...

137
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,400
Messing around with the girls.

138
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,600
Getting our girls pregnant.

139
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,080
Yeah.

140
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


141
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


142
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


143
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


144
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


145
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


146
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


147
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


148
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


149
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


150
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


151
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


152
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


153
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


154
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


155
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,280
Oh, I'm...

156
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,400
Oh, you know, I am...

157
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:23,900
I'm going to go.

158
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:23,900


159
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:23,900


160
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:23,900


161
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:23,920
Yeah.

162
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,200
Uh...

163
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,380
Amen?

164
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,660
Amen.

165
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,140
Amen.

166
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,940
And thanks, Reverend Heart Ignition.

167
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,660
Friends, aside from the lemur cuts at the beginning, all of the collages in this 1,270th

168
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,440
hour of Slack r Bi, Heart Ignition, so glad to have him back in the saddle.

169
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,600
Now, you know, friends, I like to edit these shows down so that nothing lasts longer than

170
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,360
three or four minutes tops.

171
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,900
Well, except for the live blabber shows where we're in the studio because we need to whip one out fast and get caught up.

172
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,360
Well, this one is sort of like that.

173
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:10,280
At 13X Day, we did a couple of hours a day of rambling live shows on stage as well as hours and hours of preaching and live music.

174
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,540
But I'm finding myself hard-pressed to edit it.

175
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,580
And one reason is that some of it is insipid drivel.

176
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,100
And it's hard work making that sound like a silk purse.

177
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:29,720
But I came upon one stretch of recordings that I feel should, despite its sow's ear nature, be left more or less uncut.

178
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:41,000
One morning at 13X Day, July 3rd, Dr. Howell, Reverend Susie the Fluesy, Dr. Philo Drummond, and I started doing show in front of many patient individuals.

179
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,040
And, well, most of it was insipid drivel too.

180
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,040
Maybe we needed more coffee.

181
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,960
In fact, you'll hear us get more coffee.

182
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,840
But after a little while, lonesome cowboy Dave showed up.

183
00:07:52,860 --> 00:08:01,580
And that's where it turned into an old-timer, subgenius, fundamentalist, back-to-the-pamphlet, classic-inspired insipid drivel.

184
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:11,940
Because suddenly here you had almost all the key subgenius radio show blabbermouths of our 30-year history all in one place at one picnic table.

185
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,660
Well, puzzling evidence and Phineas Narco were missing.

186
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,720
And lies and your broke friend are big sissies.

187
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,900
But here at one picnic table on a little rascals-looking stage, you had Reverend Susie the Fluesy,

188
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,700
veteran of hundreds of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse shows on WREK in Atlanta,

189
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,260
who incidentally did not wear her shirt for some of this presentation.

190
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,640
You had me and lonesome cowboy Dave from Hour of Slack in WCSB Cleveland.

191
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:47,980
And you had Dr. Howell from the Puzzling Evidence Show and the Ask Dr. Howell Shows in Berkeley and San Francisco with his co-star.

192
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,260
And you had the actual first and only overman and co-sub-founder of the Church of the Subgenius,

193
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,120
lead singer of the Swingin' Love Corpses,

194
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,700
webmaster of QuiveringBrain.com,

195
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,460
director of the Subgenius Film Festivals,

196
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,840
and close personal friend of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself, Dr. Philo Drummond.

197
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,640
All those people in one place.

198
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,920
Now we'll also hear some music and sermons by Reverend Skull and Reverend D. Lister.

199
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,940
But first, let us now to the uncut and unfettered skit.

200
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,880
Skinner-breaking master recording itself from 13X Day.

201
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,860
I was going to point out a theory that I have.

202
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,400
Really, it's just an observation.

203
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,220
And friends, this is not a value judgment.

204
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,540
About monster fans versus comics fans.

205
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,640
Sometimes it's the same thing, but I'm more of a monster fan.

206
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:48,140
Now I've noticed the primary image that goes with monster movies and books is a great big ugly guy.

207
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,940
Caterpillar.

208
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,580
Carrying a pretty girl wearing very little clothing.

209
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,540
Carry-on monster.

210
00:09:53,780 --> 00:10:00,660
Whereas the primary image for comic book fans is two men in tights grappling with each other.

211
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,480
Hitting each other.

212
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,860
Like I say, I'm not making a value judgment, but I'm a monster fan.

213
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,740
Did anybody watch Octoman the other night?

214
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,940
Sure enough, he picks up the girl and starts plodding along with her for a long, long time.

215
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,920
You know, you've got to have that.

216
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,400
The carry.

217
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,460
It was so dark.

218
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:18,840
The creature.

219
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Very dark movie.

220
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,360
Not even the same species.

221
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,400
But when he sees Julie Adams, he has to pick her up and just carry her.

222
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:25,980
Who wouldn't?

223
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,520
Yeah.

224
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,440
Well, I would.

225
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,700
Well, I think your observation about men grappling.

226
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,780
Didn't you say you met Julie Adams?

227
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,660
Is that turning you on, Dr. Drummond?

228
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,660
Well, I have to.

229
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,620
I have to.

230
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,100
It just seems so odd that you would make that observation.

231
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,340
Men grappling versus monsters.

232
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,340
I never noticed it before.

233
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,860
Do you know how I was talked into meeting you for the first time, Dr. Drummond?

234
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,080
This is historic.

235
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,020
My sister-in-law said,

236
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,960
You mean you had to be talked into it?

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,240
These people that I knew in Austin have moved to Dallas, Stang,

238
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,960
and you should go see these folks because you'd really hit it off with this guy.

239
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,880
And I said, I hate everybody.

240
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,920
I don't want friends.

241
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,160
And she said, well, this guy's different.

242
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,640
Now, she goes, he's into comic books.

243
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,680
He's into comic books and Captain Beefheart.

244
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,260
Now, that describes every subgenius.

245
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,140
But at the time, I didn't know anybody else.

246
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,940
I knew lots of people who liked comic books and lots of people who liked Captain Beefheart.

247
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,240
But not both.

248
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,780
It was the crossover that made that.

249
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:47,200
It was that foreign index key that made it easily retrievable by that one odd character.

250
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,540
And I think that's what made it so interesting.

251
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:48,540


252
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,560
In the crowd that there's a whole bunch of here.

253
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,440
I went over to your house in Dallas,

254
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,480
and then he showed me what was even better than the comic books,

255
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,780
his collection of kook pamphlets.

256
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,220
And that was when I knew that Philo and I were true Yeti mates.

257
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,980
Because, you know, Captain Beefheart and comic books

258
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,640
and a big collection of Jack Chick comics.

259
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,140
Yeah.

260
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,760
Now you're talking.

261
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,920
Oh, Chick tracts attract chicks.

262
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,500
So it wasn't long before we were cranking out kook pamphlets and horrible music.

263
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,660
And bad comics.

264
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,120
Yeah.

265
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,720
Yeah.

266
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,380
That's great.

267
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,480
Which is the church.

268
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,240
We learned from the great.

269
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:30,920
The great.

270
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,880
And of course, Philo introduced me to Bob.

271
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,460
I did not know anything about it.

272
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,000
But he had been recruited before anybody else.

273
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,900
Isn't that incredible, ladies and gentlemen?

274
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,160
Can't avoid that guy.

275
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Captain Beefheart helped bring us together.

276
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,620
Yeah.

277
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,680
Now, I heard that Bob kidnapped.

278
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,760
He kidnapped Philo when he was a young boy from a W.T.

279
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,380
Grant's restroom and kept him in Tucson and raped him for 20 years.

280
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,040
It's amazing the stories you hear about people's childhoods.

281
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,700
I heard it was a Woolworth's restroom.

282
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,320
And that's why he walks that way.

283
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,360
I heard that it was a wolf.

284
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,560
He was a wolf cub in those days.

285
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,020
Hey, look.

286
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:13,580
There's Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

287
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,740
Yeah.

288
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


289
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


290
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


291
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


292
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


293
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


294
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


295
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


296
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


297
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


298
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


299
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


300
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


301
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


302
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


303
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


304
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


305
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


306
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


307
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


308
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


309
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


310
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,740


311
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,660
So here he is.

312
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,680
He's not so lonesome after all.

313
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,260
We thought we were going to have to get ragtime Cowboy Joe.

314
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,880
Hey, I can tell he's been wrestling.

315
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:31,080
He's got that band-aid across his forehead where he bladed himself so he'd bleed, you know, for the show.

316
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,940
You're going to peel that band-aid off later and bleed for everybody, right?

317
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,120
Boy, there's a bunch of old people up here now.

318
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,780
That's right.

319
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,000
Hey, now I got this little half-erect mic again.

320
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,040
How'd this happen?

321
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,740
It's old.

322
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,640
Only half-erect.

323
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,060
Yeah.

324
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,960
What's BFC stand for?

325
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,060
What's that banging against the table?

326
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,860
Susie will show you how to work that thing.

327
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,920
I can't believe it says I never made that connection before.

328
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,060
There are no connections here now.

329
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,200
BFC.

330
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,400
Dave, can I get your cup of coffee?

331
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,000
Surely.

332
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:06,560
Okay.

333
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,940
We got it.

334
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,560
And the lard to put in it.

335
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,480
Oh.

336
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,000
Ah.

337
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,240
Oh.

338
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,200
Ah.

339
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,600
Ah.

340
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,100
Ah.

341
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,280
I'm not used to that.

342
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,280
Amazing.

343
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,840
Did everyone have their beans and lard this morning?

344
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,080
Did you?

345
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,460
So we've been waiting for you.

346
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,800
You had your beans and lard this morning?

347
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,280
I love you so much.

348
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,040
Did you have your beans and lard this morning?

349
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,400
Mrs. Mammy Whistle, you there with the unguntine hair.

350
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,580
Did you have too much this morning?

351
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,360
Too much.

352
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,080
Oh, fella.

353
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,660
Thanks, Pappy.

354
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,920
All right.

355
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,480
So just the new guys get coffee?

356
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,840
What about those of us that have been here before?

357
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,680
Do we get coffee?

358
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,000
Do we get any coffee?

359
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,600
You can get it.

360
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,940
Yeah, you can go over there and get that.

361
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,920
I'll get you coffee.

362
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,840
From the coffee service.

363
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,700
It's right back there.

364
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,540
I'm going to squat down here.

365
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,020
That's in keeping.

366
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,200
Let's have the woman serve the coffee.

367
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,740
Nothing to do with Joe DiMaggio.

368
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,000
No, don't.

369
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,260
I don't know.

370
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,520
I don't need any cream in my coffee this time.

371
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,940
Don't want no sugar in your pudding.

372
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,820
Hey, guess what?

373
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,760
There's no coffee.

374
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,240
It was all a sham, a mockery.

375
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,320
This is filled with dark-colored mucus, man.

376
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,800
Just drink it.

377
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,160
Drink up.

378
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,980
You look like a professional wrestler, Dave.

379
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,440
You look like a professional wrestler.

380
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,560
You've got cups.

381
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,000
You can pretend like you're drinking coffee.

382
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,680
You've got the Band-Aid on your forehead, you know?

383
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,440
Like you're getting ready to take it off.

384
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,980
And during the match, you know, when somebody gives you a chair shot.

385
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,080
Well, we're going to have coffee, and we're going to have a lot of things.

386
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,540
I don't think we need to quarrel over coffee.

387
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,800
And we certainly don't need to talk about the trevination scar here, which was a poor

388
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:01,840
attempt.

389
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,200
No, thanks.

390
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,860
I won't use the cream.

391
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,260
I won't need the cream right now.

392
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,260
You know, lonesome cowboy Dave, I appreciate your scar.

393
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:07,540
No, no.

394
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,180
It's perfectly fine.

395
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:15,260
But I have to say, it must pale besides the great scar of legume, which has been on the

396
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,420
side.

397
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:15,420


398
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:15,420


399
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:15,420


400
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:15,420


401
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,700
I've been showing this to you on the display for the past couple of days.

402
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,200
But it's a fine, righteous scar.

403
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,340
Where is legume?

404
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:19,600
You see here?

405
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,340
He's back there, that scarred bastard.

406
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:21,380
Saw him earlier.

407
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,100
There he is.

408
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,540
Yeah.

409
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,540
Man.

410
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,820
Has he shown his scar yet?

411
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,260
He has shown it.

412
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,940
He's been showing that scar.

413
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,640
I'll show it to you, by appointment only.

414
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,060
His butt crack goes all the way up the back of his spine, up over his head, down the nose,

415
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,140
across the lips, and down the front again.

416
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,940
And he's got a camel toe.

417
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,620
That was one hell of a surgery.

418
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,560
You've got a zipper.

419
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,440
You need a camel toe.

420
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,320
He's got two camel toes now.

421
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,320
I think they just chainsawed him down.

422
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:45,400
He's got a camel toe.

423
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,900
He's got a camel toe and frozen furs that kind of .

424
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,160
I see him back there, looking up here.

425
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,960
Look, he's nodding his head.

426
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,900
He's not happy.

427
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,740
He died five times and they didn't bring him back.

428
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:02,080
He doesn't like this particular conjecture, this angle, this tangent.

429
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,220
Not while he's drooling like that.

430
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,740
Cowards die many times before their deaths.

431
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,060
Although I saw his eyebrows go up that time.

432
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,940
The valiant never tasted death but once.

433
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,980
So you're saying that Dr. Legume had his operation, he was cut in half vertically?

434
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,880
Yeah.

435
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,720
He was cut.

436
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,780
He was bifurcated.

437
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,960
That was the only way to get that deep down inside.

438
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:20,880
Yeah.

439
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,820
That reminds me of that old Justin Wilson joke, remember?

440
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:32,080
He said they had a car wreck and he asked his wife after the wreck, he said, honey,

441
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,880
is you hurt?

442
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:39,380
She said, oh, I'm cut from all the way up here to all the way back here.

443
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,200
And he said, I know, but is you hurt?

444
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,860
Anyway, he had to get up.

445
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,680
He had to get up.

446
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,180
Justin Wilson.

447
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,860
You had to pee there.

448
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,020
Yeah, you had to pee there.

449
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,100
He was no Bill Hicks.

450
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,320
You had to have been him.

451
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,980
You're supposed to finish it with I guarantee.

452
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,160
I guarantee.

453
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,880
That's apparently where everybody knew they were supposed to be.

454
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,880
They had to laugh up to that point.

455
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,540
That's pink humor, nothing funny, but as soon as the catchphrase comes up, they know they're

456
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,940
supposed to robotically laugh.

457
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,460
That was during that time of double entendre.

458
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,860
You couldn't really say that stuff.

459
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,140
Oh, I remember those days.

460
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,840
You had to layer up.

461
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:14,840


462
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:14,840


463
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:14,840


464
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:14,840


465
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:14,840


466
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:14,840


467
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:14,840


468
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,800
You had to layer it on real heavy.

469
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,420
The days of sociopaths and double dildos.

470
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,220
Man, that was.

471
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:24,180
You get like Jeb and Cousin Easy doing the golf game where it's like, okay, you grabbed

472
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,040
your putter.

473
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,420
Yeah, that guy that painted the pictures, but they were totally, but it was for women

474
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,740
that were painting in the nude.

475
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,420
Or men.

476
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,660
Painting men and women in the nude.

477
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,120
I painted in the nude a lot.

478
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,120
All those rocks I did.

479
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,780
Oh, yeah, I got one of those rocks.

480
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,720
I painted those rocks naked.

481
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,300
I got a rock with a pipe on it.

482
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,820
And you used to leave the studio for a while.

483
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:44,820


484
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:44,820


485
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,560
I left the doors wide open so everyone could see.

486
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,000
It's a place of veneration.

487
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,160
Well, you painted those rocks?

488
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,460
I thought those were the angel turds.

489
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,760
Well, I them out first, and then I painted them.

490
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,420
Don't worry.

491
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,260
I thought that angels them out already painted.

492
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,460
It's stagecraft.

493
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,980
The artwork was stagecraft.

494
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,760
I'm sorry to disabuse you.

495
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,100
I wanted to abuse you.

496
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,960
It was an angle, not an angel.

497
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,180
Well, you did.

498
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,760
It was misplaced.

499
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:08,920
Yeah.

500
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,600
I'm going to find out what's supposed to be going on right now.

501
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,740
Well, we already have.

502
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,940
We've had Biceys read the schedule.

503
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,480
You'll have to catch up.

504
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,100
Pay more attention.

505
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,320
You missed the naked stuff.

506
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,260
I got here late.

507
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,620
I didn't mean to get here late.

508
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,460
There was a lot of naked stuff.

509
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,280
It was great naked stuff.

510
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,500
Could it be replayed in front of us right now?

511
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,280
No, it could not, because we do not photograph it.

512
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,140
That's part of the law there.

513
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,580
The girls won't take their clothes off if they know their grandmas

514
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,080
are going to be able to see it on the Internet tomorrow.

515
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,840
We have to take mental pictures.

516
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,380
Back before grandma was on the Internet,

517
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,520
oh, they'd show off their tits, every boy with the camera.

518
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,120
But then granny got on America Online and immediately looked up subgenius.com.

519
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,240
I'm going to see what my little granddaughter,

520
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,940
See, the show's gotten better already.

521
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,580
Televangela's been up to.

522
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,420
Grandma's not a natural blonde.

523
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,700
See, that's all it takes to improve the show.

524
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,380
Oh, my God, there's my little granddaughter, Televangela,

525
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,840
wrestling naked on a giant American flag.

526
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:11,960
With Jane-er.

527
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,380
With all you boys.

528
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,460
With Jane-er.

529
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,580
Jane-er wishes.

530
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,700
Sex on the American flag.

531
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,800
Sex through the window pane.

532
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,840
Jane-er was given his chance.

533
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,780
I know what y'all are seeing here.

534
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,360
Oh, what was this about not snapping pictures?

535
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,040
Well, you know.

536
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,160
Yesterday, yesterday we lied and told the radio audience we were all naked,

537
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,440
but this time we're not lying.

538
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,460
Is there a neo-Nazi rally for peace tonight, my brotherhood?

539
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,620
A rally?

540
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,360
A neo-Nazi rally for peace?

541
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:42,360


542
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,940
A political demonstration here at Brushwood?

543
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,700
I think we're beyond petty human politics.

544
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,380
That's correct.

545
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,860
No one here is a Whig or anything like that, eh?

546
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,360
That's correct.

547
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,640
We've left it all behind.

548
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,280
We've flipped the Whigs.

549
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,480
We've left the Federalist tissue paper in the toilet where it belongs.

550
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,200
It's time to join the ex-humanite party.

551
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,940
The ex-humanites shall rise from the ashes.

552
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,360
And believe me, you're all a bunch of ashes from what I can see right now.

553
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:12,360


554
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,880
If we're even thinking of it.

555
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,700
Yeah, well, I'm like a phoenix rising from the asses.

556
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,000
It ends a physical body.

557
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,800
It has raised a spiritual body.

558
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,160
And there is no such thing.

559
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,920
And staying reached for his nuts.

560
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,620
In sure and certain hope of resurrection.

561
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,320
The day after tomorrow.

562
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,320
I wanted for us more nuts.

563
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:35,960
The love.

564
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,020
It's one more.

565
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,340
Would you think of it, Dr. Howell, it's always propounded as to be the day after tomorrow.

566
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,140
When will the world end?

567
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,200
When will this new thing come about?

568
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,700
When will we all be lifted up into some sort of potty chair?

569
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,560
Some giant fuzzy potty chair made out of strange musicians?

570
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,920
We have a date and a time.

571
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,760
A date and a time.

572
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,620
Here comes the candy.

573
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,120
A specific date and time.

574
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,580
Candy.

575
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,780
Candy for Mandy.

576
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,540
Candy for Mandy.

577
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,320
Lovely, sugary, candy.

578
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,780
There's peanuts on the microphone.

579
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,080
There's butterscotch.

580
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,340
There's candy.

581
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,680
And there's chewy nougat.

582
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,660
There's blisters on the bare butt.

583
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,540
What's the point of this?

584
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,800
Oh well, it's X-Day.

585
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,220
There's a weird cackling sound coming from the bushes.

586
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,200
What illegal piece of candy shall I consume?

587
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,080
I've worn out the getses by putting them between my boobs first.

588
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,380
What the hell is this?

589
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,780
Even on Halloween I never saw.

590
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,600
It's got a creamy center which is disgusting.

591
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,300
It does.

592
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,040
I generally steer clear of those.

593
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,640
You can poke your tongue right through the creamy center.

594
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,660
But I just gotta try it.

595
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,020
Getses.

596
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,060
Go on and give it your best try right now.

597
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,480
I always have to tongue pork these.

598
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,400
I think, I think, therefore I stink.

599
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,680
How obvious.

600
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,780
You're drinking coffee.

601
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,660
You could have candy and coffee like they have in Amsterdam.

602
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,740
Here's Smarties.

603
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,480
These will make you smarter.

604
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,600
Brain candy.

605
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,780
Those are rabbit pellets.

606
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,780
Then you line it with the lemon head in there.

607
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,860
It's sort of like a Tootsie Roll that ran into a boreal at high speed.

608
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,740
I'm gonna save this bit of honey for later.

609
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,000
The good thing about this is that it's not a candy.

610
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,060
It's a candy.

611
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,980
But is there an antidote?

612
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,200
Mary Jane.

613
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,100
Wow.

614
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,260
That's another thing I hated when you radio DJs get on and start talking about how yummy

615
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,780
the food is that you're eating, and the poor radio listeners.

616
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,120
All they have to eat is that sound coming out.

617
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,160
You know, what's the part of our show that you like, Reverend Smith?

618
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,280
Yeah, tell us something good that we do.

619
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,920
Tell us something that you like about it.

620
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,340
All right?

621
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,000
Why all this bitching about other radio shows?

622
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,300
The silent parts, right?

623
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,420
I'm the main one.

624
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,800
I have to talk that way.

625
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,100
There's gotta be something.

626
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,740
I mean, if you were recommending our show to somebody...

627
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:40,940
Where we're going.

628
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,400
We're taking a breath, right?

629
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,240
I would say that listening to the puzzling evidence show is like walking through a dream.

630
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:56,140
A world in which you were at the party of the most clever, spontaneous surrealists.

631
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,180
To compete, it's like...

632
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,100
You could ever imagine.

633
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:02,420
It's like all of them talking at once with the sound effects turned up way too loud.

634
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,160
It's like attacking an evil monster with a tiny little sausage.

635
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
It just can't be done, but you valiantly try.

636
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,960
You hold that sausage aloft and you...

637
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,920
And then you're like, oh, I'm gonna eat it.

638
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:10,980
And then you're like, oh, I'm gonna eat it.

639
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:10,980


640
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:10,980


641
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:10,980


642
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,260
And then later on some unlistenable pop music.

643
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,200
Japanese pop.

644
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,300
I'm sorry.

645
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,060
Thank y'all.

646
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,780
You certainly are.

647
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,100
What do you think?

648
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,920
There's a phone call coming in?

649
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,340
Is it...

650
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,760
Is Washington calling?

651
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,200
Has Washington called yet?

652
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,840
Background pictures.

653
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,820
When are we gonna have to start getting entertaining?

654
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,300
Have we warmed up enough yet?

655
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,440
It's been the last three hours, hasn't it?

656
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,960
Well, we've got the background pictures.

657
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:40,960


658
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:40,960


659
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:40,960


660
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:40,960


661
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:40,960


662
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:40,960


663
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:40,960


664
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:40,960


665
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:40,960


666
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:40,960


667
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:40,960


668
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,000
background picture and we got the background music.

669
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,060
The band wants

670
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,320
their microphones back.

671
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,140
I'll put my shirt back on and we can

672
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,260
begin. The band wants their microphones back.

673
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,120
It wants to fumigate them

674
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,960
this time. Has anyone

675
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,680
in the listless audience

676
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,920
spouted one of these unusual tumors

677
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,040
lately? I mean just out of the clear blue it just

678
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,380
pops out real hard and

679
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,040
it like points at different

680
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,680
radio frequencies. Does anybody

681
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,560
know? I got one. I had that once.

682
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,760
It's more like a three more. I had that once.

683
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,800
I can cut it out with a

684
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,240
big knife. I can

685
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,880
help you out with that if you need some help.

686
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,800
Can't you just bite the head off it and

687
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,020
sploot it? We do a biopsy.

688
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,700
You look like you've got the shames for it.

689
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,640
Could you give it a try? We do it just like a

690
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,860
biopsy but we

691
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,880
forego all the scientific part of it.

692
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,900
How did

693
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,820
you stumble over that?

694
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,600
I had no idea.

695
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,820
We'll be right back.

696
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,560
Boggles.

697
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,800
Well thank you.

698
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,780
Boggles my mind.

699
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:42,820
Dave

700
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,800
I noticed that you're wearing a

701
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,160
bandage over your third nostril.

702
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,560
I told you that

703
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,100
and I told the listless audience that that was

704
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,480
a kind of a poor

705
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,920
attempt. He's got

706
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,800
a scar. He was lancing a boil.

707
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,920
To trepanate my third eye.

708
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,820
Oh I thought that had already

709
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,140
been done. How valiant.

710
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,240
A do it yourself third eye trepanation?

711
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,260
Well after the miscalculations

712
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,820
on the first 14 tries

713
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,860
I suppose something had to be done.

714
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,820
I mean people say I fidget

715
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,740
with it too much. But how can you

716
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,700
fidget with it too much?

717
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,880
It's not a fun thing to

718
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,780
fidget with. Fidget is like

719
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,320
a tool tool.

720
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,720
They're often hard to reach.

721
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,400
Yeah that's what it is. It's a horn stub.

722
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,980
Yes it's a horn.

723
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,140
An antler root.

724
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,600
It is crowing and crowing daily.

725
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,320
And by the time

726
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,060
5 a.m. in the morning

727
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,320
on the 5th

728
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,920
it's 4 a.m.

729
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,820
and then sometimes

730
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,060
5 a.m. in the morning

731
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,380
this antler will bloom

732
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,460
like a giant rose bush.

733
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,600
I think it would be cool to have

734
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,700
an antler sprouting from your head.

735
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,460
I wanted a giant penis

736
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,960
to sprout from my head

737
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,900
because I knew it would be a symbol of masculine power.

738
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,180
People don't

739
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,280
don't

740
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,500
don't ever. It could make you very

741
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,420
popular too.

742
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,700
It could pop you right up there.

743
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,700
Yeah you'd be like on the top level

744
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,820
of popularity with a huge

745
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,300
penis.

746
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,980
If it was a small one you'd have to join the many

747
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,360
millions of underachievers.

748
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,780
If it was a small one you'd just be apologizing

749
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,640
for it all the time.

750
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,900
I thought you were just going to say you'd be a politician.

751
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,980
Well you don't need that

752
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,920
to be a politician.

753
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,540
They've proven that you don't really need anything.

754
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,180
Actually these special glasses

755
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,520
Bob sells you can see the penises

756
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,500
sprouting out of the politician's head.

757
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,600
It's like they live

758
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,540
but not too badly.

759
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,820
I've actually been

760
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,800
to the halls of the

761
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,900
of Congress

762
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,080
and they have a water fountain there that says

763
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,200
power on it.

764
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,440
And you just sip on it and it just makes you

765
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,180
really powerful.

766
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,140
That's the one of the cherry whites only.

767
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,740
And it makes you know everything and know a lot better.

768
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,920
Is that the one of the cherubim

769
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,600
urinating on everyone's head?

770
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,740
They will at your request

771
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,340
after you sip off of this

772
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,740
water fountain.

773
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,020
No I'm not allowed. I'm not an elected

774
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,980
official so I don't get a chance to.

775
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,960
I'm just one of the pleads.

776
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,580
He's an elected unofficial.

777
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,380
And that was behind Rocknar's campaign.

778
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,860
He hoped if elected to taste that

779
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,120
Perian Spring.

780
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,560
I told him he wouldn't be able to resist it.

781
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,000
Well he wouldn't be able to resist the money anyway.

782
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,900
One sip and you have to go back.

783
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,960
It's like the most addictive.

784
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:26,940
Liquid crack?

785
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,380
Liquid.

786
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,280
It's more than liquid crack.

787
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,680
A real Ponce de Leon.

788
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,180
It's like liquid crack heroin.

789
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,360
It is a fountain of juice.

790
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,180
It tastes good and smells good too.

791
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Well you're making me thirsty as you describe this.

792
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,800
Well it's one sip.

793
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,300
And you become twice as thirsty as you were when you first drank it.

794
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,640
Political waters.

795
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,240
So deep.

796
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,180
So murky.

797
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,460
The water of Bob.

798
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,820
The water of Bob.

799
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,620
But it's worth it because you're so much smarter after that.

800
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,540
The yellow water of Bob.

801
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,440
And you know so much more than everyone and so much better than everyone.

802
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,380
Say for instance you had to perform an instant...

803
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,560
And you know then that it's true.

804
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,400
You are better than everyone.

805
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,460
And this trickles down?

806
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,380
Onto your feet.

807
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,580
It only trickles down into the one individual.

808
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,160
Who's actually sipping of the special sauce.

809
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,980
Bob's pee. I mean water can trickle up.

810
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,340
It's more like blood dripping from an abused...

811
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,240
It's a special water fountain.

812
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,160
You can only get it in this few areas.

813
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,120
You know you have to go.

814
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,540
There's a bunch of old guys standing in line waiting to drink on it.

815
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,160
Yes. Step right up, senor.

816
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,020
This is the water of youth.

817
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,780
The fountain you have dreamed of for so long.

818
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,020
There's vendors that service the line while you're in it.

819
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,180
Only one cup per passenger.

820
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,040
You know there's guys selling hot dogs and drinks and stuff.

821
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,800
While you're waiting in line to sip on that.

822
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,240
Yeah but those aren't real...

823
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,140
Those aren't real people.

824
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,560
Or not people.

825
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,800
Those aren't real hot dogs.

826
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,960
They're vendors.

827
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,500
Yeah.

828
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,700
They're psycho-cyborgic vendors.

829
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,740
Who look like people and have all the irritating...

830
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,040
Psycho-cyborgic?

831
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,280
And have all the irritating qualities...

832
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,060
Of a normal vendor.

833
00:29:59,440 --> 00:29:59,920
Cybornation.

834
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,020
Too much onions.

835
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:01,880
Not enough.

836
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:02,700
Unlicensed vendors.

837
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,340
Get away from me.

838
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,420
Screw off.

839
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:04,980
Die, die, die, die.

840
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,360
That's the way it was back in the year 1395.

841
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,120
When Grandpappy fell out of this hole right here.

842
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,700
And when he did, he brought back many secrets.

843
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,540
One of which is...

844
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,960
I don't know what it's called.

845
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,760
It's bad, bad, bad.

846
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,960
That's easy for you to say, sure.

847
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,040
But in today's modern world, it's all tied up with a bureaucratic...

848
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:27,860
So simple.

849
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,240
Tangle of regulatory structure.

850
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:38,460
Making it impossible to put up a taco stand without trespassing on somebody's copyright or legal liability.

851
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,020
I don't think so.

852
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,420
You can't do it.

853
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:40,960
I own a taco.

854
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,660
And one half.

855
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:46,600
No hot dogs beyond the wiener wagon fringed around the pail.

856
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,840
What is going to cut through all the red tape?

857
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:58,160
What Alexandrian sword will cleave the Gordian tangle caused by busybodies, goo-goos, and...

858
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,860
Nosey...

859
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,800
Well, I think that the key word in your statement would be...

860
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,440
Sword.

861
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,600
It takes a sword to cut through that knot.

862
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,360
That was Alexander's solution.

863
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,320
Hey, Reverend Suds, how's the coverage on the CD recordings?

864
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,800
That was...

865
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:27,500
Okay, so in a few minutes, we'll need to shut up long enough to flip the CD.

866
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,500
I love that new quick-moving technology.

867
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,720
Subgenius is 72, humans 16.

868
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,480
That was the score last night, but when you take a look again at what happened,

869
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,200
there have been a lot of discrepancies in the film and the footage.

870
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:47,600
Number one here, the first thing, it was a bad call as J.R. Bob Dobbs emerged from the bushes

871
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,740
and ripped one of the very, very hapless, unlikely first-time submitters to the cause.

872
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:58,400
Tore his head neatly off his shoulders and then ate the neck juice.

873
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,080
But you said that was J.Nor Bob Dobbs, not J.R. Bob Dobbs.

874
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,320
J.Nor B.W.O.B.

875
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,780
J.Nor Bob Dobbs.

876
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,080
May.

877
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,040
I never heard one.

878
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,100
Where was that one?

879
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,980
He's going a little bit far with that one.

880
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,440
That one is implied by the Church of the Sub-Jaynor, if you'll think about it for a moment.

881
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,820
Because according to the doctrine of the Church of the Sub-Jaynor, everyone is a member,

882
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,380
and that would include Bob Dobbs. He would be Sergeant Jaynor Dobbs.

883
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,580
Even members of the Church of Don?

884
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:33,240
Yes. The only one who can't be a member of the Church of the Sub-Jaynor is, of course, Jaynor.

885
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,700
According to the rules created by Nenslow,

886
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,100
Right.

887
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,600
assassinated Nen Master, or as some call him, Sergeant Jaynor Nenslow.

888
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,660
Assassinated Nen Master Nenslow.

889
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:52,800
All members of the Church of the Sub-Jaynor are allowed to address each other as Sarge Sarge,

890
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,100
and take the name Sergeant Jaynor, followed by your actual name.

891
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,100
Can they say ma'am, captain?

892
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,580
Sarge Hal.

893
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,180
I mean, they're telling us Sarge Jaynor.

894
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,320
Sarge Jaynor.

895
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,740
Sarge Jaynor.

896
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,020
I'm sorry, ma'am.

897
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,040
I'm sorry.

898
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,980
I drink some of this brackish water that comes in.

899
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,540
I drink a thousand times a thousand twangling instruments about my hair.

900
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,980
He's the most non-Jaynor of non-Jaynor's.

901
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,740
Hey, but if we're talking about Jaynor, that means I can't use it on my show.

902
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,880
That has hurt me.

903
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,280
We're talking about Nenslow.

904
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:21,080
How come there's been so much talk about Jaynor this time, which is all unusable?

905
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,500
I'm talking about Nenslow.

906
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,860
Well, we can dig it.

907
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,280
Because it makes us feel free to say the unusable.

908
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,340
Well, you say the unspeakable.

909
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,560
What we're not usually allowed to talk about, or even mention.

910
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,540
The unbroadcastable.

911
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,240
We're talking about Shaft.

912
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,180
But it's X-Day.

913
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,320
The uneditable.

914
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:36,900
We need Shaft.

915
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:43,420
And you can always, should we survive X-Day in some way, you could always put pork slap.

916
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,080
Who has an instrumental version of Shaft?

917
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,280
I should have one taped to my leg.

918
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:54,800
We could also use the oblique channel, and we could just refer to it as, in her it is, non-Jermainer.

919
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,420
You can bleep it out.

920
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,600
Weep?

921
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,800
Bleep it out.

922
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,560
Weep.

923
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,600
Weep and bleep.

924
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,140
That's the cry of the unused radio.

925
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,460
Can you do me?

926
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,960
Bleep that ye may not weep.

927
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,080
Can you do me?

928
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,520
Can you see with those eyes crossed that bleep?

929
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,860
What the bleep do we know?

930
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,400
God, was that the most horrible movie.

931
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,180
The movie irritated me.

932
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,480
I just wanted to stab the screen with a big knife.

933
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:31,040
Four minutes until we have to shut up long enough for Potter Nostril to change the high-speed duplicator.

934
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,060
Yes, four minutes.

935
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,040
Jane or Jane or Jane or Jane.

936
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,900
Two minutes of, uh, that's when everybody gets really, really funny.

937
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,620
As soon as I know the recorder's off.

938
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,300
As sure as nothing is happening.

939
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,320
Yes, we haven't been saying much.

940
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:49,160
The little Laff-O-Meter has been down to below zero for quite a while now.

941
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,100
I think we ought to just get very, very quiet and pretend.

942
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,380
D. Lister.

943
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:01,900
I don't know about the rest of you, but I have been out there in the world of the pinks and the normals preaching the word of Bob.

944
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,980
Praise Bob!

945
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,200
Praise Bob!

946
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,980
And the most frequent question that I am asked is, how can I get slack?

947
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,540
How can you?

948
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,600
If you have to ask, then you cannot get slack.

949
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,820
Because slack is not something that you can strive to attain.

950
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,520
Am I right?

951
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,540
Yeah!

952
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,860
Slack is something that comes to you when you least expect it.

953
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,620
Woo!

954
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,260
Woo!

955
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,020
And if you are asking for it, then you will never get it.

956
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,020


957
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,160
It's kind of like sex in that way, isn't it?

958
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:36,980
Yes!

959
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:43,880
Well, those of you who have not experienced sex yet, I guess can't really answer that question.

960
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,060
Sorry.

961
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:56,040
But anyways, the slack that I have been experiencing here has been the best slack that I have had.

962
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,220
But yet, I'm sure there's better slack out there.

963
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,740
Am I right?

964
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,820
Yes!

965
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:02,980
Yes!

966
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,320
Yes!

967
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,720
Yes!

968
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,420
There can be!

969
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,340
I can't tell!

970
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,660
Because there's always better slack than what you have had.

971
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,340
Yeah!

972
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:17,080
Because there's no limit to the quality of the slack that you can experience.

973
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,460
No limits!

974
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,280
No limits!

975
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:19,900
No limits!

976
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:28,820
Because if there was a cap on the slack quality, then once you achieve the limit of slack,

977
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,900
then what else would there be to live for?

978
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,480
There wouldn't be nothing!

979
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,980
Exactly, brother!

980
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:43,800
Until the sexes get here, which we hope they will do in less than 36 hours, then we must

981
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:50,940
strive to not care about our slack, and that's how we will get our slack.

982
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:00,380
But also, the people that are out there, that are here, that are just wandering around,

983
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,540
milling around, just...

984
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,940
Just doing whatever they want.

985
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,640
That is slackful!

986
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,320
I will admit that is slackful.

987
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,460
However, there should also be some helping out with everything.

988
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,380
Right?

989
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,100
Volunteering.

990
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,160
Is volunteering a good thing, Pisces?

991
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,960
It certainly is.

992
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,680
Is that good slack from volunteering?

993
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,920
There is a definite slack reward for volunteering, yes.

994
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,140
If you give away that slack, you'll get it back!

995
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,800
Thank you!

996
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,520
If you didn't hear that, if you give the slack, you get it back!

997
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:31,520


998
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,320
You can help out in many ways.

999
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,660
Pick up trash that you see.

1000
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,200
That will give you slack.

1001
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,820
Help out the reg desk, or the slack shack.

1002
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,640
Swag shack, whatever.

1003
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,080
That gives you slack.

1004
00:37:53,980 --> 00:38:01,500
But, as Reverend Sex Mortis said, the most important thing is to not f*** your own business.

1005
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,480
With anyone else's slack!

1006
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:11,100
Because f***ing with someone else's slack is the anti-slack!

1007
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,960
And nobody wants the anti-slack.

1008
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,520
Ladies and gentlemen,

1009
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,400
for the past ten years, we've heard nothing about, on TV, except about, we're Americans.

1010
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,360
Right?

1011
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,060
And we're the biggest, we're the toughest nation in the world, man!

1012
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,220
We're a bunch of pussies!

1013
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,860
You go to some place and you get lousy service.

1014
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,200
And you say, I'll show them.

1015
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,060
I'll fill up this little 4x8 car that goes to somebody in the corporate office.

1016
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,260
We need to take a clue from some other country.

1017
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:56,500
Just look at the people in the corporate office.

1018
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:56,500


1019
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:56,500


1020
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,340
You know, I was reading the paper about five years ago.

1021
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,680
In Argentina, a bunch of passengers were stranded at the airport.

1022
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,220
You know how they have to do it to you?

1023
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,380
Know what they do to you?

1024
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,260
You know how they do it to you?

1025
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,780
You leave at the airport, no plane.

1026
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,820
They burn down the f***ing airport!

1027
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,840
That's how they do it!

1028
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,120
F*** that 5x8 car!

1029
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,140
You burn down the f***ing restaurant!

1030
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,300
You don't like that steak?

1031
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,420
You gotta go to the airport!

1032
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,340
You don't like that steak?

1033
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,340


1034
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,180
How many Americans does it take to change a lightbulb?

1035
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:32,600
Sixteen!

1036
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:34,920
That's right.

1037
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,580
You need two of them to complain because the lightbulb burned out.

1038
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,260
You need two of them to blame the government.

1039
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,240
You need three of them to hire illegal aliens to change the lightbulb

1040
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,980
because they're too fat and lazy to do it themselves.

1041
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,700
You need none of the two of them to go on Fox News

1042
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,480
and blame Obama.

1043
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,320
How many is that?

1044
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:57,800
All of us count.

1045
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,120
Well, you need the rest of them.

1046
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,020
The rest of them gotta complain because the illegal aliens done took the job

1047
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:07,380
even though they would never stoop as low to change a lightbulb.

1048
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,560
They need the rest of them.

1049
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:15,320
They said they'd change a lightbulb unless they get like a secret no big contract

1050
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,540
and a tax break.

1051
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,620
But they'll change the lightbulb after that.

1052
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,420
That's why we're pussies.

1053
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,040
Yeah, we're all pussies!

1054
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,660
Yeah, we're all pussies!

1055
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
I'm sick of it.

1056
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,600
You know what?

1057
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,800
The conspiracy has been bullshitting us since I was a little kid.

1058
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,900
Because when I was a kid in first grade, used to show all these movies what the future's

1059
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,620
gonna be like.

1060
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,680
Yeah, the future's gonna be perfect.

1061
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,780
We're gonna have flying cars.

1062
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,320
We're gonna have talking dogs that go,

1063
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,200
what, old wretch?

1064
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,040
We're gonna have houses on the moon.

1065
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,700
Well, I'll tell you what.

1066
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,880
I'm looking around.

1067
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,280
I ain't got no flying car yet!

1068
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,100
I want my flying car!

1069
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,440
I want my flying car!

1070
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,360
F*** the conspiracy!

1071
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,340
I want my flying car!

1072
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,960
I want it now!

1073
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:12,080
Last night I heard a prominent subgenius angry because he hadn't received his flying car.

1074
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,000
His flying car?

1075
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,080
His flying car.

1076
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,160
Yeah, it was Reverend Scull.

1077
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,920
Reverend Scull was complaining about not getting his flying car.

1078
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,080
I must say, that was an unusual rant for you.

1079
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,040
That was not your normal sermon.

1080
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,260
There were a lot more vocabulary words in it.

1081
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,020
I can see your...

1082
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,840
More than one.

1083
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,180
In English.

1084
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,200
I kind of feel the same way about the whole flying car thing, though.

1085
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,320
I wish I had one.

1086
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,140
I was really impressed by the ranting last night.

1087
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:43,300
But I did hear that they're kind of like clearing the way through the FCC on that issue.

1088
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,680
Not the FCC, the FAA.

1089
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,280
FAA.

1090
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,360
They did build flying cars, but they had to stop manufacturing them because no one can use them.

1091
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:59,300
Because the moment your flying car takes off, it becomes an aircraft and you have to file a flight plan and you're in another level of...

1092
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,520
But now we have the internet.

1093
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,040
FAA.

1094
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:07,500
So you instantly file a templatized flight plan on the internet and that takes care of the government paperwork.

1095
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,120
And also there are plenty of sebaceous cysts and lots of crowns in the hallway.

1096
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,980
So you need to get the invisibility thing worked out and then it all becomes a moot point.

1097
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,580
The flying cars they came up with were good, too.

1098
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,800
Hugh Hefner bought one.

1099
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,860
They have a cruising range of 300 miles.

1100
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:23,580
They fly.

1101
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,380
They do everything you think, except they're totally illegal to use.

1102
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,120
But that's what I was saying.

1103
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:36,700
The FAA has just recently come up with some standards to help ease the...

1104
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,780
We're going to have to wrap it up for two minutes here.

1105
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:44,280
Okay, we have to wrap it up while the radio runabout turns over.

1106
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,780
And so we leave you with the beautiful sounds of recorded music.

1107
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,440
We'll be back in two seconds.

1108
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:50,780
It's my turn.

1109
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,360
See you then.

1110
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,840
Next week with a new episode of the Leviathan's Tale.

1111
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,760
We'll have a lot of dates, just about anything we've ever known.

1112
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,060


1113
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,060


1114
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:09,360


1115
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:09,380
Bye.

1116
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:09,380


1117
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:09,380


1118
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:09,380


1119
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:09,380


1120
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:09,380


1121
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:09,380


1122
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:09,380


1123
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:09,380


1124
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:09,440
Bye.

1125
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:09,440


1126
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:09,440


1127
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:09,440


1128
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:09,440


1129
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:09,440


1130
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:09,500
Bye.

1131
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:09,500


1132
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:09,500


1133
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:09,500


1134
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:09,500


1135
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:09,500


1136
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:09,640
Bye.

1137
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:09,640


1138
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,160
We're gonna night just like this.

1139
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:39,260
Several years ago, I think, and I'd gotten up in the middle of the night to sing, because

1140
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:49,860
well, I had a bit too much to drink, but I swear I saw a figure walking across that field

1141
00:43:49,860 --> 00:44:00,200
and with a glowing fish instead of, I just fell to my knees and I kneeled and there he

1142
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:00,540
was.

1143
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:07,220
I knew that smiling grin and there he was.

1144
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,340
Bob's come back home to us again, I said.

1145
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,440
Bob's come back home to us again.

1146
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,400
But something sinister was afoot.

1147
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,800
There was this coldness in my soul taking root.

1148
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:46,640
And I wasn't 100% sure of what was to happen or be.

1149
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,100
But that wasn't Bob.

1150
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,760
And he was coming right for me!

1151
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:56,400


1152
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,700
Yeah!

1153
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,340
Yeah!

1154
00:44:59,800 --> 00:44:59,800


1155
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:00,280
Yeah!

1156
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:00,820
Yeah!

1157
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,020
Yeah!

1158
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:01,340


1159
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:01,460
Yeah!

1160
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:01,820


1161
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,300
Yeah!

1162
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,240
Yeah!

1163
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:04,900
Yeah!

1164
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:09,340
Yeah!

1165
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,620
Yeah!

1166
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:12,680


1167
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:15,160


1168
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:25,700
Oh, I'm glad that Bob's coming back.

1169
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,740
Oh, I'm glad.

1170
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:27,740


1171
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,720
I bet you're happy!

1172
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:30,720


1173
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:30,720


1174
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,340
I do too.

1175
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:32,900


1176
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,200
Oh, God.

1177
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:38,740
Oh, no!

1178
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:38,780
You're such a legend.

1179
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:38,780


1180
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:38,780


1181
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,200
It is!

1182
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,240
It is!

1183
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,780
I'll tell you one of my favorite stories.

1184
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,680
I don't put jeans on.

1185
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,800
Come on, look at me.

1186
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:47,500
Radical.

1187
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,960
If you want to do that, that's fine, but I don't.

1188
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,320
We're going to stop you, Bob.

1189
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:53,800
All right.

1190
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:54,380
Woo!

1191
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,140
Okay.

1192
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,220
Bob, come on.

1193
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:58,920
Kill Bob.

1194
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,580
You're looking at me like you didn't get it.

1195
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,460
We get that a lot, friends, and we got that cut from Heart Ignition.

1196
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:13,960
Before that was Priestess Pisces and Six-Fisted Tales of Connie at 13X Day Thursday night,

1197
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:18,740
making it all up as they went along, as is this music in the background.

1198
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:25,340
Six-Fisted Tales that night included Reverend Angry Larry, Reverend Suds Peshaw, Reverend Phil,

1199
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:30,120
Senator Speck, Dr. Philo Drummond, and Reverend Bunny Day.

1200
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,620
Stang just drained a gallon out of that thing.

1201
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,120
That's because he's going to turn that useless water.

1202
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:37,440
He's got it.

1203
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,740
That stuff floating around in the water.

1204
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,820
All those coins, but damn.

1205
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,000
Powerful coffee will be produced out of that water.

1206
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,780
Stuff just floating in the water.

1207
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:45,720
Yeah.

1208
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,040
Animalcules.

1209
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,160
Animalcules?

1210
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,400
Foraminifera.

1211
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,660
Foraminifera.

1212
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,340
Gyroscopa.

1213
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:59,280
Tiny diatoms, spider squids, ding futzers, and whirligigs.

1214
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,560
Gynecoli.

1215
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,620
Only microns in diameter.

1216
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,820
Frostbitten fleas.

1217
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,520
Hard-bitten fleas.

1218
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,940
Arguments with hard-bitten floozies.

1219
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,340
This is X-Day Radio.

1220
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:17,840
That's right.

1221
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:24,960
The legend burned across the land, blazing like a burning brand or whatever, for X-Day.

1222
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,620
Doctor, how long has the legend gone on?

1223
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:36,680
Well, as long as there were brave, hardy sons of the soil hacking and chopping their way westward.

1224
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,440
Through the grave.

1225
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,560
Through the great American landscape.

1226
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,860
Chopping Indians and eating fires.

1227
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,680
This was a wonderful time in our country.

1228
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,860
And they just, they've landed here again for your listless pleasures.

1229
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,320
Yes, they built general stores and sutleries.

1230
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,540
Laid railroads down across the prairies.

1231
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:56,780
Conestoga.

1232
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,320
Hewed down Indians.

1233
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:03,920
And hacked open waterfalls and built the great American slag heaps.

1234
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,800
Dug up the gold.

1235
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,300
Argued with the acoustics of the sound.

1236
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,400
And brought the

1237
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:26,440
The source of all life.

1238
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:30,900
Of strange little one-celled organisms and

1239
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,400
Everybody knows what is real.

1240
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,220
Flagellates.

1241
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,360
I have dogs.

1242
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,220
Grotophers.

1243
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,960
I have dogs.

1244
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,280
I have a family.

1245
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:44,180
So those, uh, grotophers were washed out of the coffee urn.

1246
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,760
In any case, it's going to get warm for them in a few minutes.

1247
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,700
And then they'll be ready to drink.

1248
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,880
You see, uh, sterilization, pasteurization, that does work.

1249
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:59,240
You can scour the little buggers out of there.

1250
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,120
Ask me, Lois Pasteur.

1251
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,420
I was the one who invented this .

1252
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,480
Really, I was.

1253
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,980
And they sneered at Louis Pasteur.

1254
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,540
Just like Symantec invented the virus.

1255
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,080
They snickered at the snicker bar.

1256
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,260
They sneered and snickered.

1257
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,100
If there are these little bugs, why can we not see them?

1258
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,880
Why cannot we argue with them, on for say?

1259
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,020
We have special software to detect them now.

1260
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,240
I think the little bugs are in your mind, monsieur, between your eyes.

1261
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:25,700
Look!

1262
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,740
One of them is wearing a punching bag and a blow horn.

1263
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,540
And a tiny derby hat.

1264
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,340
They don't bother a body anymore.

1265
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:31,900
A tiny derby hat.

1266
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:32,260
With a little umbrella.

1267
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,860
And he's waving it at us.

1268
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,540
Can't you see?

1269
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,500
Wave back, quickly!

1270
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,100
Quickly!

1271
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:37,440
He...

1272
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,720
Too late, he died.

1273
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,640
His life cycle was too short.

1274
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:47,140
The only way to prolong the life cycle would be to pump more rotif... rotif... rotif...

1275
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,180
back into the water.

1276
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,460
Pack him in amber.

1277
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:49,980
It's...

1278
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,320
Look!

1279
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,180
This tiny vial of urine.

1280
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,860
Of Dobbs's urine.

1281
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,840
It's all the rotif... rotif... rotif... we need.

1282
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:03,020
So, Herr Van Leeuwenhoek was startled to see, looking through his experimental microscope,

1283
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,540
the tiny waving dog.

1284
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,480
The tiny waving Dobbs inside each sperm.

1285
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:13,680
Now we have to change to the Dutch accent and wonder why this is moving on the Petri

1286
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,540
Gase so finely.

1287
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,160
Ahh!

1288
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,820
It kept pumping that sample out.

1289
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:22,080
Yeah, you've seen those little, those old ingredients.

1290
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,140
I can do this all day.

1291
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,740
Especially when there's no connective tissue in your brain.

1292
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,320
That's the most important part.

1293
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,160
Just let it slide slickly around from hemisphere to hemisphere.

1294
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,100
.

1295
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:33,200
.

1296
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:33,500
Shhhwk.

1297
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:34,500
Shhhwk.

1298
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,000
Shhhwk.

1299
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,160
Shhhwk.

1300
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:35,460
Shhhwk.

1301
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:45,880
Yes, your brain is like a washing machine and the agitator inside disturbing its contents

1302
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,800
is Bob.

1303
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,640
It used to be...

1304
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:48,740
It's that pipe.

1305
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,700
It's going around and around....

1306
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,460
Making that chugging noise.

1307
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:52,660
Up and down.

1308
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,980
No one else can hear that.

1309
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,720
That is you.

1310
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,020
.

1311
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,780
Well, now I can hear it, but...

1312
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:58,900
.

1313
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,420
.

1314
00:50:59,420 --> 00:50:59,420


1315
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,280
That's like an illustration of what it's like.

1316
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,020
Makes it hard to sit on it.

1317
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:03,080
That's why.

1318
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:03,080


1319
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:03,080


1320
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,180
During the spin cycle.

1321
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,800
Oh, the spin cycle.

1322
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,540
You vibrate.

1323
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,260
You go to pieces all over.

1324
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:09,800
I don't know.

1325
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,020
I did it.

1326
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,620
I evened the slate.

1327
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,040
How I didn't bust myself all to hell is beyond me.

1328
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,060
On Saturday mornings, I'd stand on our front porch,

1329
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,920
and as the kids came by, I'd beat up and cuss.

1330
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,100
I pulled a grenade out and threw it.

1331
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,420
Bodies.

1332
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,060
More than a dozen horses had been killed.

1333
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:31,720
God.

1334
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:31,980
God.

1335
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Dead horses.

1336
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,300
Chunks of beef.

1337
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,520
At least it wasn't me.

1338
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,800
Incontinental drift.

1339
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,660
Do you have that?

1340
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,800
Incontinental drift, yeah.

1341
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,660
Yeah, but that's right.

1342
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,700
It's a chronic problem.

1343
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,820
That's why we have this event outdoors.

1344
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,840
Some planets.

1345
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,500
So much of us have these leakage issues.

1346
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,160
We got it.

1347
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:57,920
Is anybody here?

1348
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,460
Dispersal.

1349
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,000
Dispersal.

1350
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,240
Arguments with wigs.

1351
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,940
These are all things we have to watch for.

1352
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,680
We have to stay on the steadfast.

1353
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,740
And on the standfast.

1354
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,940
We have to stand fast against these things,

1355
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,540
and for them, too, if they're necessary.

1356
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,520
It says stand fast for what you believe in,

1357
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,460
and sit down on your own stool.

1358
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,900
Now, the world is scheduled to end

1359
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,700
the day after tomorrow, right?

1360
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:26,460
But I've read some end-of-the-world paranoid stuff

1361
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,880
about that oil zit,

1362
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,620
Mother Earth zit, the oil volcano.

1363
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,700
But what's that?

1364
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:36,200
It's so paranoid that to read this guy's rants,

1365
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,820
you'd think that it's going to be a close tie

1366
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,560
between the exes getting here in a day and a half,

1367
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,700
or whether the waves of oil will be splashing

1368
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,580
over this far inland and submerge Brushwood.

1369
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,180
Wow.

1370
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,840
You know, the concept of,

1371
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,300
well, we do know how much oil is in there.

1372
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,500
Well, what if there's more oil down there than there is?

1373
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,680
It could be that the whole...

1374
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,220
For all we know, the whole Earth is filled with oil,

1375
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,740
and that's just where it's squirting out now.

1376
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,000
Maybe we could work out a deal with blood for oil.

1377
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,300
I heard that was a thing.

1378
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,660
But there's no blood.

1379
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,140
I'd rather see waves of blood.

1380
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,160
Now, that would be really cool.

1381
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,620
It's just a big bucket, a big barrel of oil.

1382
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,240
That would be really cool.

1383
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,740
We could work out a deal of buns for oil.

1384
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,220
Or, no, wait, I'm sorry.

1385
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,180
It could possibly mean the end of the world

1386
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,480
in a very, very short period of time.

1387
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,520
Somebody said they had stuffed up that leak.

1388
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,500
That was Legume.

1389
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,940
Legume said they got a wedding band over it or something, right?

1390
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,420
No, some cork and some Kraft cheese.

1391
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,940
He did say they put a wedding band over it.

1392
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,500
So they were married.

1393
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:53,960
In a short time, moved to Binghamton Springs.

1394
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,020
There they lived for approximately 23 seconds

1395
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,340
before the insecticide.

1396
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,340
Actually, speaking of,

1397
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,620
that's a catastrophe du jour.

1398
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,760
It's not just like one hole that needs to be plugged up anyway.

1399
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,640
The entire bottom there is porous,

1400
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,660
and it's under mud.

1401
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,020
It's under loose mud.

1402
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,760
It's hard to tell what the bottom is.

1403
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,420
It could be coming up in many different ways.

1404
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,840
And messing it, shaking it around

1405
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,640
may open it up more

1406
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,220
so that more oil rises up.

1407
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,920
I lost track of things.

1408
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,140
You're not talking about me, are you?

1409
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,160
Don't forget, you know,

1410
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,320
where the plate tectonics,

1411
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,700
where the plates are separating,

1412
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:36,260
there's actual magma coming out of the earth.

1413
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,340
We've got to plug that stuff up, too.

1414
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,300
Because magma's not good for anybody.

1415
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,300
You've got to clean your plates.

1416
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,920
Everybody I know who's ever gotten magma on them

1417
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,980
has died from it.

1418
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:45,660
I know.

1419
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,940
Forget all those stupid Hollywood movies

1420
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,540
where they almost fall into the volcano.

1421
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,660
There's magma coming out.

1422
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:56,460
Oh, I almost got the lava that's right there on me.

1423
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,100
He'd be cooked.

1424
00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:59,540
He'd be flash-cooked

1425
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,300
before he could get out.

1426
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:00,300


1427
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:00,300


1428
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:00,300


1429
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:00,300


1430
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,220
Say that sentence.

1431
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,660
From rock that's heated to glowing heat,

1432
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,580
it's right there.

1433
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:08,280
It doesn't matter if you don't get any on you.

1434
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,240
You can drink crude oil and live for a few hours,

1435
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,640
but if you drink magma,

1436
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,760
you're going to die almost instantly.

1437
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,560
The earth is just going to kill you anyway.

1438
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,380
Somehow or another, you're going to die.

1439
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,460
We live by sufferance on the thin skin

1440
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:26,680
around the dangerous, toxic, molten interior of the earth.

1441
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,780
Yeah, we're worrying about all this microscopic stuff.

1442
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:30,300


1443
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,980
One might worry about it in some degree.

1444
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,900
What about that asteroid that's supposed to hit here in like...

1445
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,360
That's loose pieces of the solar system

1446
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,820
that haven't been sorted out yet.

1447
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,480
That's the day after tomorrow, after we leave.

1448
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:40,940
See?

1449
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,520
There's an asteroid that's going to be hitting the earth.

1450
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,400
That's the large, insulting sock from an asteroid.

1451
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,340
We'll be gone, and we'll be looking back thinking,

1452
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,840
ah, we made it just in time.

1453
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,360
Boy, how ironic that the world ended

1454
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,920
when that asteroid was going to take care of it all anyway.

1455
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,240
I think the delay was for that reason,

1456
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,280
so that we could have more glass,

1457
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,060
lethal satisfaction of knowing

1458
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:05,460
that everything we were leaving behind is being destroyed.

1459
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:09,420
It's not as if there was only a fixed amount of glee to go around.

1460
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,080
Right, and you can engender so much more glee

1461
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,520
by imagining each and every catastrophe.

1462
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,280
Start and give them like numbers,

1463
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,200
and then put little letters like A, how it expands,

1464
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,020
like there's the Gulf oil spill,

1465
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,380
there's the potential comet,

1466
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,380
there's 2012,

1467
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,340
there's X-Day,

1468
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,160
and there's so many of them.

1469
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:29,720
Yeah.

1470
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,120
If there's enough numbers there,

1471
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,160
it becomes meaningless anyway.

1472
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,560
Well, there are many possible instant deaths

1473
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,300
that we could all suffer.

1474
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,940
For example, gamma ray bursts could occur.

1475
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,320
Gamma ray is very bad.

1476
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,040
That would be it for everyone.

1477
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,140
Don't forget radon gas in your basement.

1478
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,660
It's just leaking out.

1479
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,580
You don't even know it.

1480
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,240
You're sleeping down there in front of the football game.

1481
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:50,920
Leaky basements.

1482
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,580
You think you're having a good time.

1483
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,340
You're sniffing up radon gas.

1484
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,680
Your own self-inflicted flatulence?

1485
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,800
Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya.

1486
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,540
Lunch meat.

1487
00:56:58,780 --> 00:56:59,240
Flatulence.

1488
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:00,840
Hot.

1489
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:01,580
Bad.

1490
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:02,660
Barbecue.

1491
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,380
Et cetera, et cetera.

1492
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,080
Barbecue.

1493
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,080
Rashes, particularly around the butt.

1494
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,300
That's just wrong.

1495
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:08,360
Thank you for your program.

1496
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:08,980
Yucks.

1497
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,600
Your own self-inflicted flatulence?

1498
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:14,940
So many people are dying from their own self-inflicted flatulence.

1499
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:17,780
I heard about a guy who fell asleep inside his sleeping bag

1500
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,800
and his farts killed him.

1501
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,680
He had a...

1502
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:21,300
Suffered from...

1503
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,160
The lighter was leaking as well.

1504
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,560
All those garlic and jalapeno sandwiches.

1505
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,160
It's not the flatulence itself.

1506
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,680
It's that it displaces all the air.

1507
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,100
He died of a fatal self-dutch ovening?

1508
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,440
Yeah, a dutch ovening.

1509
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,720
It sounds more like a burrito, doesn't it?

1510
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:37,400
A double dutch oven.

1511
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,280
Rolled up in the...

1512
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:39,440
The pig in the blanket.

1513
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,140
That's another reason you should not smoke in bed.

1514
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,760
You have a cigarette lit.

1515
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,800
I can't help that.

1516
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,800
Well, Philo, you're just handing me your rules, man.

1517
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,900
I don't like all your rules.

1518
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,280
I want to smoke in bed if I want to.

1519
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,220
I want to smoke in bed, yeah.

1520
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,480
That's all smoke in bed.

1521
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,700
So do you smoke before sex?

1522
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,900
Or during sex?

1523
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,000
Or after sex?

1524
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:56,780
I don't know.

1525
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:57,620
I never looked.

1526
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:58,280
Ah.

1527
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,000
Weep, weep.

1528
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,900
Drink up and tip your waitress.

1529
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,240
Our next show's at two.

1530
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,600
Actually, Susie, our next show is next week.

1531
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:16,160
Of course, our last thousand shows are archived at subgenius.com,

1532
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:19,300
where you can learn everything about the Church of the Subgenius

1533
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:22,100
and our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1534
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,860
That's subgenius.com.

1535
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,760
Our award-winning books and old CDs

1536
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,260
and vinyls.

1537
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,520
Videos are all still in print.

1538
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,360
Can you believe it?

1539
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,540
You can also find links to lots of freebies of all kinds.

1540
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,460
That's subgenius.com.

1541
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,200
This has been the Hour of Slack.

1542
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,840
Praise Bob.
