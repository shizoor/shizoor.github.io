1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
I'll switch on the system.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,120
Can you hear me?

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,000
Here comes Bob.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,280
He's smuggling a girl up the seong on one of his flower boats.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,860
Along with a cargo of opium.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,560
Smuggling a girl?

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,820
He's a shortwave enthusiast, too.

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,060
Of course, that's only natural.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,640
A white girl?

10
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,380
Yeah, I'd trust that guy any day of the week.

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,460
Speed's taken a great liking for Bob.

12
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,160
I'm going to do something with him that I never do with strangers.

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,060
Take it easy, fella. Don't get your feathers ruffled.

14
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,120
Well, I know, I know.

15
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,420
It doesn't do any good, but I've got to get action.

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,280
What on earth can he be doing?

17
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,000
He's Bob.

18
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,960
Sometimes he's overconfident.

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,280
He started shadowing me.

20
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,860
There is the shortwave set there.

21
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,220
Here.

22
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,940
Give me that old Thai religion.

23
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,580
Give me that old Thai religion.

24
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,080
Don't give me...

25
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,160
That's a penis.

26
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,000
I rate a slap.

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,360
Right? That sounds very charming.

28
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,180
Very charming.

29
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:58,980
Uh-huh.

30
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,240
And of course, it's cracked to be really elegant.

31
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:02,960
No, man.

32
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,800
Then I suggest you get your money back and go home.

33
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,560
Okay.

34
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,140
Okay?

35
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,060
Bye-bye.

36
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:07,560
Bye-bye.

37
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,560
He said, Bob said, I won't tell you what to do.

38
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,080
I will only tell you how to think.

39
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,680
And you will pay to know what you really think.

40
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,740
It's so true, friends.

41
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,800
Bob sold it.

42
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,440
I smoked it.

43
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,120
That settles it.

44
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,580
It's as simple as that.

45
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,140
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,100
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

47
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,220
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

48
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,020
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

49
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,520
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

50
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:33,640
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

51
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,180
Bob's mouth.

52
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,500
The centaur is very ugly.

53
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,720
No, he won't just do any of it.

54
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,460
He doesn't talk, he just gallops around.

55
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay, round two.

56
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,640
Stinking old Thai.

57
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,760
Round two of the show.

58
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,460
We're beginning the really funny parts of the show now.

59
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,820
Yes, dear friends.

60
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,000
Welcome to our little carnival.

61
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,740
In this first show of the new year.

62
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,020
It's nice.

63
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,940
It will be.

64
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,880
It's all fresh and clean and slick and spam here at the show.

65
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,780
We got all that bra do from last year swept out.

66
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,660
Big pile of it by the street out there.

67
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,080
I noticed when I came in, there was all these dirty, messed up old coffee cups.

68
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,880
We got those?

69
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,420
Yeah.

70
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,280
They're all clean now?

71
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,000
They're all clean.

72
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,320
Our coffee cups are clean.

73
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,660
Can you believe we do this for you, the listeners?

74
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,960
All of our big stacks of coffee are stacked up nice and tall again.

75
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,720
And our special sauce is back in its package.

76
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:46,000
And our pens and pencils are neatly arranged in their little utensil, pencil tray bin.

77
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,600
Yep.

78
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,360
It's the birthday of the new year.

79
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,560
Oh, how sweet.

80
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,720
Oh, it's wonderful, too.

81
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,700
Hey, look, it's...

82
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,780
Look!

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,640
Beautiful little cutie new year.

84
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,680
Oh, yeah.

85
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,300
It's Cardhouse Robot.

86
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,120
Cardhouse Robot, that is.

87
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:16,260
And of course, your other ever popular hosts and co-hosts and pre-hosts and co-hosts.

88
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,460
And it's the birthday of the new year.

89
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:18,840
It's the birthday of the new year.

90
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,240
On the Puzzling Evidence Show, it's the beautiful little...

91
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,200
The beautiful little shiny new year.

92
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,280
We have to go see Slumdog Millionaire and you have to go see, like, a bunch of other movies.

93
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,720
If there's any evidence on this show that's not puzzling, we'd like to get rid of it real quick.

94
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,640
Well, what nobody realizes...

95
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,260
You put it in a box.

96
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,100
It's already gone by the time you hear this show.

97
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,780
All you hear is raw puzzling evidence here.

98
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,460
Yeah.

99
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,680
In little plastic jars.

100
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,100
Let's empty ourselves.

101
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,300
Have your way with us.

102
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,980
Have your way with us.

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,620
Have your way with us.

104
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,280
Have your way with us.

105
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,020
Anti-religion.

106
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:52,780
Atheism.

107
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:53,620
Atheism.

108
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,240
Uh, um, uh, uh, um, atheism.

109
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,100
Have your way with us.

110
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:05,660
After, uh, uh, um, I want to say atheism is, okay, logical atheism.

111
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,280
You see, and the point is, uh, uh, anti-religion, logical atheism.

112
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,480
We're coming up with a plan to help save the economy.

113
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,140
We are?

114
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,320


115
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,100
Yeah.

116
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,660
I'm almost finished with it.

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,300
I was going to try to run it up the ladder and see if I could get you.

118
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:21,640
I'm just going to wait until we get approval.

119
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,400
Get the, uh, to float a balloon?

120
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,380
We could get Hal to, like, salute it when we run it up a ladder.

121
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,200
You're talking about that print more money scam?

122
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:32,780
Yeah.

123
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,420
All right.

124
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,960
We'll have a flagpole at the top of the ladder so that once we move it on up the ladder,

125
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,400
we'll get it to the flagpole.

126
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Then we'll run it up the flagpole and we'll see who salutes it.

127
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,780
Then we're going to, after we get through with that, we'll throw it up against the wall and see what sticks.

128
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,200
But those aren't patriots.

129
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,900
Those are sheep being controlled by advertising and propaganda.

130
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:07,140
Puppets jerked around on strings by instinct, not using their rational souls or the divine spark of intellection.

131
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,960
Well, that's true, but it was, it's, they were more thought up by, by robot marketing programs.

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,340
Another renegade radar-operated robot now in the marketing department.

133
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:19,740
Yeah.

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,320
Yeah.

135
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,140
Yeah.

136
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,360
Yeah.

137
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,400
Yeah.

138
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


139
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


140
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


141
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


142
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


143
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


144
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


145
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


146
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


147
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


148
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


149
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


150
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


151
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


152
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


153
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


154
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


155
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


156
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


157
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


158
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


159
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,400


160
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,200
Brand new, beautiful, shiny, bombastic.

161
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,460
Now we have programs that dream up new products.

162
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,620
Program files.

163
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,700
That are products designed to dream up other new products.

164
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,200
And then they reinvent themselves every 10 years when a new crop of consumers comes out.

165
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,860
Well, now what do you think, when do you think the singularity will occur?

166
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,740
Will it be in, in 2050 or will it be earlier?

167
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,840
You mean where all marketing programs collide with one another?

168
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,160
I think it's a one giant product to one giant customer.

169
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,520
To itself.

170
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah.

171
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,000
And it's itself.

172
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,740
It's just a sneaky itself.

173
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,520
The predicted algorithmic point where the.

174
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,340
And the customer buys it himself.

175
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,020
Computers overtake us and artificial intelligence.

176
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,780
The customer is a product.

177
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,900
Surpasses human intelligence.

178
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,560
This is a real deal.

179
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,640
From that point robots are on their own.

180
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:12,980
Yeah.

181
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,620
Okay.

182
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,580
Robot number two.

183
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,960
And we'll have one hair product.

184
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,560
I'll take robot number two.

185
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,020
Okay.

186
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,340
It's a little Roomba.

187
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,820
It's now cleaning up the.

188
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,080
Now let them go.

189
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,400
It's a robot.

190
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,400


191
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,400


192
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,400


193
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,400


194
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,400


195
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,320
That's what Dr. Hal said.

196
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:22,580
Oh my God.

197
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,920
Did we ever need this?

198
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,560
That was a.

199
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,160
I think this thing eats hippies too.

200
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,240
Oh, what happened to them?

201
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,000
A little Roomba.

202
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,120
Oh no.

203
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,380
It's jamming on the hillbillies.

204
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:30,960
It's losing power.

205
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,740
Those hillbillies.

206
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,600
They're jamming up on us.

207
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,340
They're wrecking everything.

208
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,220
Those are those new batteries.

209
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,360
They only last long enough to fire up the unit one time and then it goes away forever.

210
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,680
A case of battery if I've ever seen it.

211
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,400
And so the hillbillies had to move on.

212
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:46,940
Yeah.

213
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,140
Well.

214
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,120
I know they moved on because they had no.

215
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,180
They were free.

216
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:51,400
They were free.

217
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,120
They were not there last week.

218
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,300
They were not there last week.

219
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:52,300


220
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,880
So the hillbilly problem apparently has been solved.

221
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:58,860
They.

222
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,520
It was?

223
00:06:59,780 --> 00:06:59,960
Well.

224
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,680
Well, I didn't see them there last week.

225
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:01,820
Nobody told me.

226
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,260
They were lying low.

227
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:03,840
Yeah.

228
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,260
They had.

229
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,640
They were hiding from revenuers and so forth and so on.

230
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,740
They'll be back.

231
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,920
The minutes passed slowly for the.

232
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,960
Maybe they went out on a coon hunt.

233
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,300
Minutes went away from the coon hunters.

234
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,180
They somehow got held down underwater by a rack of coon, John.

235
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,120
Oh, I see.

236
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,580
There they are.

237
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,740
They're breathing heavily underwater.

238
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,660
The sailor home from sea and the hunter home from the hill.

239
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,820
Yes, old Festus is back, but he doesn't realize that he's already passed on and is walking

240
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:38,520
to the happy hunting grounds with his faithful coon, Tickhound, on the twilight tour.

241
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:02,180
The robot Bob in that short transition was by the large.

242
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,800
Long transitions are by the small.

243
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:14,960
And among the collagiastes, such as Limor and noralpref.com, we're also enjoying new

244
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,720
collages by Reverend Sweetness McGee, who is associated with yet a fifth Swedish coon

245
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:20,900
hunter.

246
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:20,900


247
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,520
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry.

248
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:29,380
The Ministry of Slack, which you can Google and which like all the other shows is listed

249
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,820
on the radio page of subgenius.com.

250
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:43,780
This is hour of slack number 1187 and is otherwise almost entirely robbed from Dr. Sinister's

251
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:50,380
Radio Synesthesia on WCESB Cleveland, with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and others calling in

252
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,700
and mostly from Puzzling Evidence Show at KPFA in Berkeley

253
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,880
with host Puzzling Evidence, cool guy Dr. Philo Drummond,

254
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,640
and the great Dr. Howell of AskDrHowell.com,

255
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,660
who is never at a loss for words.

256
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,800
Oh, well, okay.

257
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,720
So welcome to the show. Here we go.

258
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh, did not you have any New Year's resolutions for this year?

259
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,220
So far, did you declare any on New Year's Day?

260
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,200
I had nothing to declare at the customs office.

261
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,080
I actually had a negative bank balance.

262
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,700
And the crowd goes crazy, because they do too.

263
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,140
Everybody in America has a negative balance.

264
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,700
So you haven't declared to somebody why you were, like, in the hole.

265
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,260
That's right.

266
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,780
Yes, the gross liquid product of Halco in this quarter

267
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,540
has been just showing a slide into the deepest red.

268
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,500
You were so far down in the red.

269
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,300
Investors and shareholders of Halco have expressed

270
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,980
that they are not going to be able to get out of this.

271
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,720
So, I'm going to give you a resignation.

272
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,120
Pink.

273
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,620
And some impatience with the failure of their favored sanctuary.

274
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,400
So, did you look for a bailout out of that hole,

275
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,680
out of that red tape and red hole they were in there?

276
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,680
Fortunately, at this time, we were able to purchase

277
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,340
even bearer sterns.

278
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,360
You started a carbon offset company while you were down there.

279
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,980
A carbon offset.

280
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,100
Every time we make a carbon footprint, as you might put it,

281
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,560
we will donate one sheet.

282
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,280
We will donate one sheet of carbon paper to the National Register.

283
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,400
The show that we two can be green.

284
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,780
Green.

285
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,160
And I guess, you know, listening, I don't know,

286
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,280
what would this show sound like when you're in,

287
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,480
out there near East Ontario Avenue?

288
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,640
Pepper Corner.

289
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,900
I know I've been to Pepper Corner.

290
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,300
And now, Philo's pants are being inflated.

291
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,560
What good is bail?

292
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,840
Help me!

293
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,460
No, it feels, it's all right, man.

294
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,260
It'll feel better.

295
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,280
It's me, ma'am.

296
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,420
Oh, it tickles!

297
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:51,820
Oh!

298
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,700
What the?

299
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,840
On him!

300
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,620
That's a little kangaroo-shaped object.

301
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,520
Don't stop with, don't stick my pants with that.

302
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,840
You old witch!

303
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,140
What's the matter, you old bag?

304
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,560
Get your hands off my pants pockets!

305
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,560
It's the return of Aunt Bertha.

306
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,920
Pickpocket.

307
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,760
Hello, Timmy.

308
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,460
What on earth?

309
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,980
Get Aunt Bertha away from my pants!

310
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,460
We were just...

311
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,520
experimenting.

312
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,780
Experimenting again.

313
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,960
Aunt Bertha, the air is starting to freak out.

314
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,720
Thank goodness!

315
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,420
Every evil thing that ever happened...

316
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:29,840
Oh, no, thank you, thank you!

317
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,960
...was a result of experimenting.

318
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,920
Oh!

319
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,880
Experimenting again.

320
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,080
Oh!

321
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,000
Aunt Bertha disapproves of experiments.

322
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,460
And Bertha is back.

323
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,220
She's up all the way, Tina.

324
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,860
Back always here with us.

325
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,620
She's warming up down beside me on the floor.

326
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,780
Aunt Bertha's getting ready for the show.

327
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,900
She likes to go out there.

328
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,820
She's got a glass of lemonade.

329
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,080
She tosses a few one-liners out.

330
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,980
You know, when I was in the crowd...

331
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,300
She tosses a few glasses back.

332
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,520
Everybody worships Jesus.

333
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,900
She tosses a few glasses back,

334
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,200
and then tosses out a few one-liners.

335
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,960
But now I only...

336
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,920
And the crowd tosses a few tomatoes.

337
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,020
...while we were going or retreating to the...

338
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,980
I'm loading Aunt Bertha now.

339
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,940
The Aunt Bertha device is powered with these hydraulic lifters.

340
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,920
And we were able to move her to the other side of the stage here while Hal does this...

341
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,120
She looks like Robocop in that outfit.

342
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,780
I do not understand.

343
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:18,980
I know, I know.

344
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,880
We're trying to work on that.

345
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,420
It's a little bit crude, but...

346
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,480
Into my head.

347
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,720
Why does she make those faces?

348
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,680
What happened to her face?

349
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,580
I command my spirit!

350
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,600
She really can try to finish all that, though.

351
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,340
Tina, you can do this!

352
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,700
Wow, she shrunk down to mouse size.

353
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,220
That's an incredible special effect.

354
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,240
Yeah, pretty neat, huh?

355
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,000
We'll be able to really wow them with that.

356
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,120
And now you're going to make her big again, right?

357
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,380
Yeah, well, I think...

358
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,320
I'm not sure how much of her reaction...

359
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,100
You know how to do it.

360
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,100


361
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,100


362
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,560
I don't know how to do it.

363
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,420
I don't know how to do that.

364
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,260
You say you don't know how to do it?

365
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:53,280
I don't know.

366
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
We haven't hooked that up yet.

367
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,080
Yeah, yeah, you do know how to do it.

368
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,220
Yeah.

369
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,760
The only thing that ever bothers me is their gibberish.

370
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,340
When they start raving...

371
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,420
Do you feel brain?

372
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,920
Are you mad?

373
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,040
Do you feel like...

374
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,800
We ain't gonna stand with no grudges out here.

375
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,000
I'd like permission to study the new...

376
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,740
I don't know what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is.

377
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,580
Don't just pull someone's skull apart without a little lower arm strength.

378
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,500
No one sees you.

379
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,180
No one sees you.

380
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,580
No one sees you.

381
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,500
They think I'm insane.

382
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,400
No one sees you.

383
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,440
They're the ones who are insane.

384
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,580
What's the boogeyman?

385
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,960
As a matter of fact, I'd want...

386
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,360
Bob said,

387
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,680
Too much is always better than not enough!

388
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,220
He said,

389
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,060
It's a lie, but it sounds good.

390
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,300
Don't just eat that hamburger!

391
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,360
Eat the hell out of it!

392
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,660
Yes, friends, and every hamburger is the ultimate hamburger of slack.

393
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,340
That's the secret I'm revealing today.

394
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,460
The stupider it looks, the more important it probably is.

395
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,020
I guess we're really important, if that's the case.

396
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,320
Hello, you're on the air.

397
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,380
Shoo fly, shoo fly, shoo fly don't bother me.

398
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,240
Oh.

399
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,100
That's all they say, but I know you're on to more extreme topics now.

400
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:30,940
Well, you know, there's no topic too extreme, be it extreme in its, you know, in its controversiality,

401
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,640
or extreme in its, you know...

402
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,220
It's topical flavoring.

403
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,040
It is at extreme times, so I would say that...

404
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,160
We could be extremely boring.

405
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,540
I'm pretty good at that.

406
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,840
I doubt it, but, you know, it could be like being in an oven, and it's just...

407
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,920
We think we're frogs or something.

408
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,820
Being cooked, and the next thing you know, we're all cooked.

409
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,180
At least that's how I feel about it.

410
00:14:54,340 --> 00:15:02,440
I think the economy crashing, and most of your friends out there crashing, I think it's all part of one big liquid asset that needs to be eliminated.

411
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,620
So what do you think about that?

412
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,000
I think it's time to...

413
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,160
I think...

414
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,160
I think it's time to...

415
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,760
I think it's time to...

416
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,320
I don't know.

417
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,280
You haven't been downsized, have you?

418
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,220
I have not, no.

419
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,820
I'm fortunately hanging in there, doing all right.

420
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,540
Things are looking all right on that front for me.

421
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,640
So, but, do you see any horizon, or is it just, you know, one day to the next?

422
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,860
I don't...

423
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,600
Looking at...

424
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,180
You know, without going into too much detail...

425
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,500
Without going into too much detail, it looks like I have job security for now.

426
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,100
If I can just keep showing up every day and doing what I do.

427
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,020
The way I do it.

428
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,540
I think I'm probably going to have some job security.

429
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,820
Because, you know, I...

430
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,020
Just...

431
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,940
I don't know.

432
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,700
My employers are doing all right.

433
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,720
No arch collapse or anything like that?

434
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,100
No possible...

435
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,940
Well, they took a little bit of a hit this year.

436
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,200
They did have some, you know, investment holdings that didn't turn out so well.

437
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,680
But it was really a small...

438
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,140
Really just a small amount compared to their other holdings.

439
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,280
So they're hanging in there.

440
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,940
So are you holding anything right now besides your glands?

441
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,440
Yeah.

442
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,080
Yeah.

443
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,520
No, I don't...

444
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:35,040
Well, honestly, I'm young enough that I'm not terribly concerned about the state of any retirement savings I have right now.

445
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,340
You know, it'll come back.

446
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:42,480
If I live long enough to retire, then it's probably going to make a comeback.

447
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,100
If...

448
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,660
Unless civilization collapses completely, which is what some of us are crossing our fingers for.

449
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,740
Actually, I kind of am too.

450
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,460
That's a terrible thing to say.

451
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,920
I know I'd probably be screwed without civilization as we know it.

452
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,820
But I just kind of like to see the disasters unfold.

453
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,740
And what can I say?

454
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,360
This program is like...

455
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,800
This program is like a little black box recorder on an airplane.

456
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,280
You know, we're just documenting...

457
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,780
The descent.

458
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,600
The descent.

459
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:11,980
The rapid descent.

460
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,240
Yeah.

461
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,380
That's the way it is.

462
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,740
Things are getting much, much worse and we're just chronicling right now.

463
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:29,540
And rather than capitalizing, which we should be doing, we should actually be making our own fortunes off the misfortunes of others.

464
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,400
But since that's not our nature, we'll just chronicle the crash.

465
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,540
Hmm.

466
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,100
I think.

467
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,040
I'm not sure.

468
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,200
I guess Reverend Stumpy is trying to call also.

469
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,860
Ah, yes.

470
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,520
I figured.

471
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,180
Let me get him on here.

472
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,880
He believes in many of the same things we don't believe in.

473
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,120
But he...

474
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,720
He's alive too.

475
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,540
Hey, buddy.

476
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:56,380
Listen, if society did crash, how do you think you would stand if that happened?

477
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,660
I mean, would you be able to go out there and fight?

478
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,000
Like I was saying, I don't really...

479
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,880
I don't think...

480
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,900
Like I said, I don't think I'd really survive very well compared to some other people out

481
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,920
there who've been stockpiling, you know, supplies waiting for the apocalypse for the last 20 years.

482
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,340
Oh, yeah.

483
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:11,840
I'm not sure.

484
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:11,840


485
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:11,840


486
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:11,840


487
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:11,840


488
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:11,840


489
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:11,840


490
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:11,840


491
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:11,840


492
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,720
I mean, there's other ways to get around that, though.

493
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,480
You know what I'm saying?

494
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,160
That's right.

495
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,580
I mean, you know.

496
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,920
No, I personally don't know what you're saying.

497
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,660
What are the other ways?

498
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,480
You know, when you're wet, I mean, come on, dude.

499
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,600
You know, first thing, if you see it happening, I mean, you don't have to stockpile everything

500
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,300
for 20 years.

501
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,600
You can stockpile a little bit of water, buy some booze.

502
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,700
You can trade booze for guns or, you know, women or whatever is what's going to be worth

503
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,080
money in those days, you know?

504
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,600
You never know what's going to be worth money.

505
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,500
I'm guessing.

506
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,980
You're talking about a pirate's life, huh?

507
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,080
Yeah, well, I mean, if society crashed, what else do we have?

508
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,820
A pirate's life.

509
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,120
A pirate's life.

510
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:42,980
You're exactly right.

511
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,420
You got to have stuff that'll work.

512
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,520
That's the number one.

513
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:46,680
Can't lean.

514
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,940
Stuff that won't work.

515
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,600
I think we're like the little chattering monkeys on the beach that the pirates are going to

516
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,440
open fire on very quickly, though, just to get them out of the way.

517
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,600
I don't think we're-

518
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,500
You sound like a butt pirate.

519
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,700
A butt pirate?

520
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,240
Hello?

521
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:02,940
Ah.

522
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,720
What is that?

523
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,860
If you don't already know, I'm not going to tell you.

524
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,740
Is it like a secret initiative?

525
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,980
Is it like a secret initiation that I'm not allowed to tell if I would-

526
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:16,840
No.

527
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,540
Do you blame the Illuminati or any other secret groups for the financial collapse like

528
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,280
so many other radio hosts do?

529
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,240
I don't know.

530
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,940
I just-

531
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,780
I just, yeah.

532
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,760
Who are the Illuminati exactly?

533
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,540
That's what nobody seems to be able to answer definitively.

534
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:41,720
I am ... Actually, I read a little interesting ... Honestly, I will not chalk up to an organization

535
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:41,720


536
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:48,660
that is organized, tightly controlled, well-oiled conspiracy machine, things that could be

537
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,960
so easily explained.

538
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,800
Because one thing I have learned about humanity over the years is that we're ... Nobody's

539
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,300
as in control as he thinks he is.

540
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,680
Nobody is really in control.

541
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,500
The people who think they are in control are not.

542
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,500
They have managed to ... A few of them have managed to hold on to their money, but they

543
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,700
have ... I don't know.

544
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,360
They have pretty much been thoroughly discredited.

545
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,760
And if they were really in control, they would not have discredited themselves the

546
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,480
way they have.

547
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:28,840
If they were really in control, things would probably ... Because they want the illusion

548
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,100
that everyone's doing well.

549
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:37,400
The illusion that everyone's doing just fine is really good for you if you are oppressing

550
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,300
the masses in one way or another.

551
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,680
Or if you are cheating the masses.

552
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,260
You want the masses to believe that everything's hunky-dory.

553
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:52,520
And now the peasants are in open revolt, and that is not a sign that the conspiracy is

554
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,600
really in control of things.

555
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,920
Well, a sign that they're still trying to be in control is that nobody knows who

556
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,800
to revolt against.

557
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:05,280
Everybody's angry about something, but they're not really sure who's ... You heard on your

558
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,960
show someone was talking about Rob.

559
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,780
I think it was Rocknar was mentioning Rob Blugovic.

560
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,520
Yeah.

561
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,000
Rob Blugovic.

562
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:20,820
Rob Blugovic, as if that current news story were of any import into the actual what's

563
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,740
going on right now.

564
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,480
It's just another sidewalk, another side cake, as they call it.

565
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,240
Or no, a sidebar.

566
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,280
That's it, a sidebar.

567
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:28,940
Side show.

568
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,820
And tonight's show is a sidebar.

569
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:39,060
From PR News in Washington, I'm down 250 billion percent from a year ago.

570
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,660
That's the largest drop since 1921.

571
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,440
1868.

572
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,900
Most economists expect to go rock.

573
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,500
Not because it'll help stabilize the financial system.

574
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,780
Jimmy Carter is far worse than initially thought.

575
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,920
The former US president has already been floating outside the International Space Station today.

576
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,200
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank says to pump struggling homos.

577
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,700
Frank said, quote, there is no good reason for further delay.

578
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,760
Residents of Gaza shot up today as they sought gas for cooking in staples like flour.

579
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,360
President-elect Barack Obama says this is PR News in Washington.

580
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:24,100
In other news, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky represents a state that is home to Toyota's

581
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,000
biggest plant outside of Japan.

582
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:32,660
Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama represents a state that is home to Mercedes-Benz, Honda,

583
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,280
Hyundai, and Toyota.

584
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,620
Just to keep in mind, yeah, Mercedes-Benz.

585
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,020
I'd like to have a home state for Mercedes-Benz.

586
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,740
Bob Corker of Tennessee represents a state that is home to Nissan's 9-cylinder engine.

587
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:40,740


588
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,300
Yeah, where's my Nissan?

589
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,900
Come on, where's my bailout?

590
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,760
I'm ready for my bailout.

591
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,780
Can I have my bailout?

592
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,820
Would you put my bailout in the back of my Mercedes Nissan?

593
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,520
Now, who lives in Germany that would listen to us?

594
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,940
A German person, the Mercedes owner that he's talking about quoting.

595
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,760
Really? Okay.

596
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,600
Trying to find out once and for all what is the actual date.

597
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,360
What's Bob's date?

598
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,820
What is Bob's real, ineffable name?

599
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,040
What is Bob's name?

600
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,160
What is the name of Bob?

601
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,840
And he's out in the middle of nowhere here.

602
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,680
Really? I don't know.

603
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,680
It's their show.

604
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,480
Answer these questions tonight.

605
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,120
Okay, we're going to drop below the 50-foot level here and see what we've got.

606
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,520
Slack can come when you throw good money after bad and bad money after Bob!

607
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,400
And you can do that at our lovely sales table down there.

608
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,260
Hello, you're on the air.

609
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,820
Oh, hey, Dr. Sinister.

610
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,980
Ah, finally. Good to hear from you.

611
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,460
The original parrot.

612
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,560
Not the original parrot.

613
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,060
The parrot after the original parrot.

614
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,380
I've been sitting here stewing in my own bills.

615
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,480
Up to your eyeballs in them?

616
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,020
Yeah, yeah, paying bills.

617
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,740
Now I just had to downsize myself.

618
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,680
I can't fire myself completely.

619
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,340
I can't really lay off my own.

620
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,840
I'm a lonely employee because he's also my boss.

621
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,180
But I did have to give him kind of a cut in pay and shrink him a little bit.

622
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:23,580
Well, did you give yourself a boost in pay, a bonus for cutting your...

623
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,420
No, in fact, I got just the opposite of a bonus.

624
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,000
My bonus shrank down when I saw what my balance was.

625
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,860
Parts of my body actually shriveled up in terror.

626
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,340
Well, I just...

627
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,580
A downsizer is in the business to make money.

628
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,280
Huh?

629
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,240
A downsizer is in that business to make money.

630
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,180
The more heads he rolls, the more he rolls in dough.

631
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,880
Yeah, but I've only got one head to roll, see.

632
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,940
And I never was a very good bowler.

633
00:24:54,020 --> 00:25:01,200
And I owe half of my soul to G. Gordon Gordon in Dobbs Town.

634
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,440
It's looking rough, you know.

635
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,180
It's like Santa and the elves.

636
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:13,600
I think are hard-pressed this time to produce all those such good toys for nothing.

637
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,720
That nothing doesn't stretch as far as it used to.

638
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,980
You know what I'm saying?

639
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,480
Well, Chinese elves use different, what do they call them, standards.

640
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,520
Like when they build toys, Chinese elves use the metric system.

641
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,040
And that's thrown things off.

642
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:36,240
Santa's elves, rumor has it they've been, you know, putting melamine in the candy canes.

643
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,420
To make them appear more nutritious than they really are.

644
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:47,560
Well, I just have a feeling this year the kids are going to be getting fewer Skeletor's castle

645
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:53,940
with the operating guillotine and more little wooden hand-carved toy trucks.

646
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,860
Think about the children out there that are actually going to be, literally,

647
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,700
going to be getting lumps of excrement in a stocking that's holy.

648
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,680
I mean, I don't mean as, you know, holy.

649
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,100
Well, I'm giving my kids toilet paper.

650
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:12,160
You know, this day and age, if Santa actually leaves you a lump of coal, that's actually useful.

651
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:12,840
Yeah.

652
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,320
You know, you can actually burn that, you know.

653
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,880
We'll be warm for another two hours this Christmas.

654
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,540
God bless us, everyone.

655
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,540
Ah, the biopic.

656
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,620
Yeah.

657
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,000
The biopic.

658
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,580
That's what this show is. I think this show's limping along now.

659
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,200
Yeah.

660
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,740
It's on its final book. We've got it on live support.

661
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,080
Here.

662
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,320
It's on its last radio trip.

663
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,720
It's got kind of an erratic beat there.

664
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,460
Yeah.

665
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,600
I think it may not last the evening.

666
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,060
I think that the show may be on its last legs.

667
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,500
Already, the newest new show of the whole new year.

668
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,800
And here it is. It's dying before our very hearts and eyes.

669
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,540
And why? It's because you, the listener, did not call when you should have

670
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,320
to give us the very live support that we need.

671
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,140
Oh, so desperately needed.

672
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,120
Then we should shut away the air.

673
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,460
Then we should shut away the air.

674
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,380
Then we should help the X-Man by explaining his purpose on this Earth.

675
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,880
You would help the X-Man by explaining his purpose on this Earth.

676
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,680
No, I don't know about that.

677
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,040
No, I don't know about that.

678
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:32,240
And mention, Slack is what you need on the show.

679
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,200
Miller of Eternity.

680
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,180
More of.

681
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,780
I don't want any Miller of Eternity.

682
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,340
Before the show dies.

683
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,560
And it's your fault.

684
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,020
Your fault.

685
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,900
You could have saved it.

686
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,900
You could have saved it.

687
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,180
And it's sold in the brand newest new show of the new year.

688
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,760
You could blame it all on Hitler and his ambitions.

689
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,620
It's just a new show.

690
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,740
It doesn't know how to live yet.

691
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,660
It's just so new.

692
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,140
Oh, brace up.

693
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,160
It's not that bad.

694
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:02,280
It's like a tiny infant.

695
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,220
You have to tickle it on its body.

696
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,820
Give it a little talcum powder.

697
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,900
A little baby show.

698
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,120
Pat its little tissue and say, come on, little show.

699
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,720
Come on, little show.

700
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,840
Have another bite, little show.

701
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,900
It's just Bob is what it is.

702
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,740
It's just, it's literally Bob.

703
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:30,420
Someone actually stole an aluminum ladder worth about 10 bucks out of my yard and brought daylight so that they could get a rock and probably couldn't sell the darn thing.

704
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,880
Can you imagine that?

705
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,340
A hard workman like Dave.

706
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,360
Just goes to lay down on the job for a few minutes.

707
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:45,620
And while he's got his back turned, somebody runs up and steals his entire inventory.

708
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,500
That's why you got to use steel ladders.

709
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,660
They're harder to run away with.

710
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,160
This was a steel ladder.

711
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,360
It was aluminum.

712
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,100
Aluminum.

713
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,060
Aluminum.

714
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,460
And the price of aluminum went down that very same day.

715
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:56,980
So these.

716
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,460
Jokes on them.

717
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,940
Probably couldn't tell it wasn't copper or something.

718
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,320
But, you know, it's spawning a whole new breed.

719
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,320


720
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,060
Of thieves who don't even know how to steal right.

721
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,240
It's.

722
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,180
Now this is just a coincidence.

723
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:16,780
I happen to have come into possession of an aluminum ladder.

724
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,960
How much can you get?

725
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,140
Where do you take one of those?

726
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,200
Where can you get for one of those?

727
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,020
I'm just wondering.

728
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,020
Just, just.

729
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,500
I'm sure it's coincidence.

730
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,940
I just happened to come upon a aluminum ladder.

731
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:34,220
Well, just so long as you know which way is up, take the slap, Humphie, salvage or anything.

732
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,580
Any of these places around here, they'll, they'll take your money.

733
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,540
They'll give you a small amount of money.

734
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,720
They'll take your aluminum ladder.

735
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,940
And also take your advice.

736
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,700
All I need is money for cigarettes.

737
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,080
You know, I got swore off eating because I just really couldn't afford it.

738
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:55,200
But, you know, so I'm down to just the real necessities of life.

739
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,160
Have you tried pantyhose tea?

740
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,740
No, I don't have to have the pantyhose.

741
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,040
I spent enough on that over the years.

742
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,200
Well, the first thing I did was I got a little bit of a hangover.

743
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,200


744
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,200


745
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,200


746
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,200


747
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,120
A lot of the brewers that's coming by, even hard to I mean, it's hard to come by the

748
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,380
brew.

749
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,600
Never mind.

750
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,140
So.

751
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,320
But still, you know, the bills come in.

752
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,580
Bill's for Dobbs Heads.

753
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,160
You know, we got through a lot of Dobbs Heads here and they cost.

754
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,320
It adds up.

755
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,600
Yeah, I always wanted to ask you where those heads are made.

756
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,840
Are those made in China?

757
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,200
Actually, they're made in Taiwan.

758
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,180
So that's why the mouths are where the heads, where the eyes come in.

759
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,180


760
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,180


761
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,180


762
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,180


763
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,620
It should be in the nose is where the ears are.

764
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,400
Yeah, well, they're cute.

765
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,520
Some of the kids pay more for that with the big friendly eyes.

766
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,540
The dog sits with the big anime look to them.

767
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,000
I don't think that's the problem.

768
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,500
I think some of them are just defective.

769
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,220
Just from the quality of the workmanship there.

770
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,660
And you pay for it, meaning you pay little.

771
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,420
You pay less than you pay a good, decent, union American worker.

772
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,240
Dave, it's a moot point.

773
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,700
Nobody's paying anything for anything right now.

774
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,300
They're all just sitting on their...

775
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,740
They got their money in the mattress and they're sitting on it.

776
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,180
With squinty eyes.

777
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,100
If we get caught into a deflationary thing,

778
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,380
that might actually yield pretty promising returns.

779
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,880
Is that like if the wheelbarrows...

780
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,140
If you have to take a wheelbarrow full of money to buy bread or something?

781
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:25,960
That's inflation.

782
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,080
Deflation happens when the price of everything just starts falling.

783
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,660
And if...

784
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,460
And if that happens too much, too fast,

785
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:42,060
that can be really harsh on a lot of industries and a lot of workers,

786
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,100
a lot of owners of things as well.

787
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,660
Usually what'll happen to get that rolling is nobody's buying anything,

788
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,180
so they lower the price to try and entice people to buy it.

789
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,520
They're saying, okay, well, we can make a little less profit on this.

790
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,140
And then eventually they're trying to...

791
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,140
They'll sell something at a loss just to have some revenue.

792
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,560
And as...

793
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:08,020
So that kind of pressure on a market is what can cause prices to fall precipitously.

794
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,300
And that, you know, can be a disaster.

795
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,980
Well, that's what they're predicting for right now because of the Christmas season.

796
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:22,580
Because some of the toys are so, you know, like a matchbox set of trucks and stuff like that for $5

797
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,220
and everything, they're just like trying to head them up and move them out, so to speak.

798
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,140
Well, the price for sex has fallen quite a bit, but the demand hasn't.

799
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,680
It hasn't.

800
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:37,240
And Bob Prophecy said that this econocataclysm was coming.

801
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:43,460
And when I still had a few dollars, I invested it in a big, sturdy barrel

802
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,860
that I have almost ready to set out on the street corner.

803
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:54,960
I need to drill a hole in it at waist level and put a big bow on it,

804
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,500
put lipstick around the hole.

805
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,120
And I was going to put a little...

806
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,980
I don't know if I put a bell on it, but my neighbor, the other subgenius on the block,

807
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,820
Mr. Sister, kind of beat me to it.

808
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,420
He's already got his barrel out there with a little jingling bell.

809
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,020
There's a Salvation Army guy right down the street.

810
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,920
It's kind of funny, you know, you see the church people go to the Salvation Army guy

811
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,620
and give him money.

812
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,200
And then after they felt forgiven, they'll go down to the barrel.

813
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,340
The problem is everybody's over a barrel already.

814
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,400
You know, nobody wants to be over a barrel yet one more way.

815
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,740
What we have to worry about is what happens when everybody's in a barrel

816
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,100
and there's no more customers for the barrel.

817
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,780
Then we're like the fish in the barrel that they shoot at.

818
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,380
Oh, no, I didn't want to think that.

819
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,060
But you look at, you go down, up and down Mayfield Road now,

820
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:54,360
there's on almost every street corner, there's a barrel with little Christmas decorations on it.

821
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,940
And they're having a price war.

822
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,200
It's like 50, 75 cents will be marked down to 70 cents

823
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,000
and then marked down.

824
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,360
It's 65 and they're all.

825
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,400
Well, what kind of sex can you get for 75 cents at a barrel stop?

826
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,640
Only only one kind, really.

827
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,700
Like the quick handshake or something.

828
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,060
And you certainly.

829
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,440
Yeah, that's pretty quick, I guess.

830
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,320
In fact, it's too quick.

831
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,240
I wouldn't even call that sex when it gets down to 25 cents.

832
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,900
That's when I know that we could truly call it a recession.

833
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,940
And there's no sex involved.

834
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,420
There's just having thought of it.

835
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,840
You pay 25 cents to somebody to think about having sex with a barrel.

836
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,700
By the way, this would be a great time to let everyone know that the views and opinions expressed on this program are not those of WCSB or Cleveland State University.

837
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,980
Now, continue on with the whole sex with a barrel thing.

838
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,460
This is a.

839
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,600
You were talking earlier.

840
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,380
Never heard of this before.

841
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,220
Never heard of this before.

842
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,780
Well, there was an article in the PD, wasn't there, about stopping barrel stops?

843
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,360
These, there are these ignominious barrel stops.

844
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,220
Are there hookers hiding inside the barrels?

845
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,160
What? I don't get it.

846
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:05,980
I don't get this.

847
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,580
I've never heard of this.

848
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:12,600
Hooker. Hooker is rather a rude way if we prefer to think of ourselves as sex industry workers.

849
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,660
Of course.

850
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,040
But at a barrel stop.

851
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,940
You could be a hooker as well as a hooker.

852
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,260
Well, you kind of end up doing both.

853
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,460
Keeping abreast of the market on Wall Street.

854
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:38,820
The Dutch Gilder surged upward again to a new and higher high.

855
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,260
The biggest extension since June.

856
00:35:48,800 --> 00:36:00,320
And the breakup of IBM and the SEC caused Rockwood Computers to jerk to life again.

857
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:06,580
Texas Instruments pulled out of a sinking spell and spurted 12.2%.

858
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:24,660
The bullion boom is sweet and penetrating a whole new consumer market as private gold ownership rises to an all-time high.

859
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:29,080
And topless interest rates jumped 2%.

860
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,320
In a bottomless market.

861
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,900
And Detroit took a new beating today.

862
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:50,640
When General Motors plunged at the news of stiffer emission controls.

863
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,100
A full five points to a new low.

864
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,740
As sugar futures floated.

865
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,280
Up and down.

866
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:11,120
Superior oil's chances flowed freely at 1,168.

867
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:27,540
To stimulate the aviation field, Rolls-Royce is in for a big, thick, fat government contract to sell jet engines to the Arabs.

868
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,800
Oh.

869
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:40,220
And Lockheed is moving up a stiff, well-positioned nine points and reinserting its dividend.

870
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:40,960
Oh.

871
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:46,520
To wipe out a very bad year.

872
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,880
It's an uphill battle of big versus little.

873
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,920
And on Wall Street today, everyone is buzzing with the unconfirmed rumor.

874
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,040
That.

875
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,340
That.

876
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:00,340


877
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,460
Little...

878
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:01,980
Gary.

879
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,420
Oil.

880
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,440
Is being absorbed.

881
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,800
By the giant G.R. Conrad organization...

882
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,440
to corner a full 10% of the world market.

883
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,420
Could one of you guys like to scoop up the table.

884
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,040
What's the actual value of a consultants cap?

885
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,920
I called me wife to tell her I'd be late.

886
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,320
A full 70 patrimonial statues of oil.

887
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,320


888
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,320


889
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:39,860
Yeah, mine too. That was from the movie The Happy Hooker with Lynn Redgrave playing our friend Reverend Xavier Hollander.

890
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:46,520
See Xavier.com or XavierHollander.com about her new memoir.

891
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:55,020
But now let us return to Puzzling Evidence, or rather let us let in into your mind via the doors of reception.

892
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,780
I just came in the back door and I'm walking forward between the two lobes.

893
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,840
You didn't sign anything.

894
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,820
No, no, I don't touch anything. Because if I touch anything, your whole mind changes.

895
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,420
And we don't want to change minds, that's for sure.

896
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:14,080
Yeah, we don't want to change minds, not at this hour, because 4.16, four minutes away.

897
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:22,360
We want you to stay in your life the way you are, because if you change now, who knows how that could change the future.

898
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:26,960
The whole universe could change, and we're into saving the universe and saving the planet.

899
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,760
And if you're going to save it.

900
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,800
What are you going to save it from except change?

901
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,200
Look out, here comes change.

902
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:34,840
You've got to keep it from changing.

903
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,040
Look at all that change.

904
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,180
Move up the future and the planet.

905
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,320
Blinking in the sun.

906
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,540
To be like we love it.

907
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,620
Like a cool Brookside chat with our friends.

908
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,020
Did you bring the tabbouleh?

909
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,140
Nay, I left it behind.

910
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,760
Oh, well here, have some cool.

911
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,040
Cooling.

912
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,740
Tastes great.

913
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,000
I'm getting so sleepy.

914
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,160
Refreshing too.

915
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:06,780
In the sand.

916
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,820
Someone left the cake out in the rain.

917
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,920
What's changed?

918
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,080
What's changed?

919
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,340
What's changed?

920
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,380
What's changed?

921
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,440
What's changed?

922
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,440
What's changed?

923
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,860
Help, help, help, help.

924
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,360
Put up, put up.

925
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,520
Organized religion.

926
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,000
Bad, bad, bad.

927
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:25,660
Whatever.

928
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,320
I'm.

929
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,760
Bad.

930
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,340
I'm.

931
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,020
The whole.

932
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:28,460
Whatever.

933
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,200
Put them up.

934
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:29,760
Put them up.

935
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,180
Do it.

936
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,620
Whatever.

937
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,360
Do it.

938
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:31,740
Whatever.

939
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,860
Just don't.

940
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,220
I'm.

941
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:33,560
Don't.

942
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,160
I'm.

943
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:35,340
I'm.

944
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:35,520
I'm.

945
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:35,540
All.

946
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,340
Do it.

947
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:36,880
Do it.

948
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,640
Really got.

949
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,360
Really got me.

950
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:38,740
Don't.

951
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,840
I'm gonna put up Charles Darwin.

952
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,040
Celebrate.

953
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,560
The United States of America.

954
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,380
Give.

955
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:43,920
Me.

956
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,360
Secular progressive society.

957
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,080
Our secular progressive society.

958
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,220
We don't like religion.

959
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,800
Put up, put up, put them up.

960
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,300
Put up.

961
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:51,740
Then.

962
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,320
Really got me.

963
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,260
Got me.

964
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:54,860
Celebrate.

965
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,080
Society.

966
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,980
Secular progressive society.

967
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:57,940
Correct.

968
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,660
I'm the whole.

969
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:58,900
Whole.

970
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,100
RICHARD CHER 디明

971
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,580
We're secular progressive society.

972
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,920
Organized religion.

973
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:03,380
Bad.

974
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:03,980
Bad.

975
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,500
Bad.

976
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,020
Whatever.

977
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:05,600
I'm.

978
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,020
Bad.

979
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:06,640
I'm.

980
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,340
The whole.

981
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:07,740
Whatever.

982
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,540
Put them up.

983
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,040
Put them up.

984
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:09,540
Do it.

985
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:09,980
Whatever.

986
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:10,660
Do it!

987
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,680
Secular progressive.

988
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,540
Secular progressive society.

989
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,500
I'll turn it back on.

990
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,440
Some day...

991
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,140
Right now.

992
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:28,780
Slow down, man.

993
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,700
It's not worth it.

994
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,820
Easy, easy.

995
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,300
Happy New Year.

996
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,820
I'm at a loss for words.

997
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,920
Happy New Year.

998
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,480
Happy New Year.

999
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,360
Thanks for saving the show like you did.

1000
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,120
You know it was yours, it was up.

1001
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:52,660
You saw that there was a job to be done and you rose to the occasion.

1002
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,480
You called the show and you saved it.

1003
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,140
Thanks for roasting the occasion.

1004
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,740
Thank you.

1005
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,620
I love the show.

1006
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,980
I wanted to support the show.

1007
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,360
And you've done a good job over the year.

1008
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:11,120
It's a small short year, I know, but the job you've done so far this year has been exemplary.

1009
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,360
Now the caller is laying the show back in its little cradle.

1010
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,580
I feel better already.

1011
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,800
Good, me too.

1012
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,700
You're having another glass of wine.

1013
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,540
The power of the show.

1014
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,780
I'm having another glass of wine.

1015
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,660
This is sort of like art for one person.

1016
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,660
Why don't we share that bottle?

1017
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,520
This entire...

1018
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,040
You can.

1019
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,120
This entire show is just for that...

1020
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,200
The guy who just hung up.

1021
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,120
We could have a big swig on that bottle of wine.

1022
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,040
Look, that's why this horrible music's playing.

1023
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,300
I'm like, I'm too wimpy.

1024
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,120
I can't even get the thing in.

1025
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,340
BYU do ya wee.

1026
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,560
BYU do ya wee.

1027
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,840
11,008.

1028
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,780
I'm a seeker.

1029
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,440
67.

1030
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,140
B-A-U-B-Y.

1031
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,280
And a P-H-S-S-S-U-U-U member.

1032
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:52,460
2001.

1033
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,960
Bonds that make us f- coming to ourselves.

1034
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,300
Y-U-Y-U-S-10-30-34.

1035
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,700
With one great grand trial.

1036
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,740
Three years ago.

1037
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,060
200 stink stink.

1038
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:01,800
Excuse me.

1039
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,600
R stink.

1040
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,520
Excuse me.

1041
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,260
S-upthr-s-upthr-76.

1042
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,220
Job.

1043
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,100
Sex.

1044
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:07,420
Sex.

1045
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,120
Three missions.

1046
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:08,880
Second.

1047
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,020
The t-the t-the t-the...

1048
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,000
Three days.

1049
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:11,600
Nothing.

1050
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:12,640
Subgenius.

1051
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,940
Do nothing.

1052
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,000
And second.

1053
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,420
He knew how to touch a boy like no one else I've ever known.

1054
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,120
A very uncooperative repeat offender.

1055
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,200
Be the man.

1056
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:25,540
Second.

1057
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,260
Excuse me.

1058
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:29,920
Subgenius.

1059
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,540
Increasingly atheistic.

1060
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,040
This way.

1061
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,160
21.

1062
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:34,840
Burning.

1063
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:35,680
Also.

1064
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,740
Contempt for simple religious faith.

1065
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,660
Religious faith.

1066
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,660
Wasted time.

1067
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,040
It's sickening vulgarity.

1068
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,520
And much more.

1069
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,700
We subtly but surely lend ourselves to the devil's project.

1070
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,260
Make it very hard.

1071
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,660
Carnal and violent good.

1072
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,080
I think of...

1073
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,140
Singing mothers.

1074
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:55,980
LSBS.

1075
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,580
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes.

1076
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:57,980
Shaken.

1077
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,240
S-speculations.

1078
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,220
Deep deep plan of happiness.

1079
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,640
We be like.

1080
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,600
Stop teaching the gospel.

1081
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,980
So little thought.

1082
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,020
We like.

1083
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:08,760
And we be.

1084
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,780
Subgenius meet.

1085
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,080
Living together.

1086
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,740
An alternative.

1087
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,340
Cull.

1088
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,140
Cull desire.

1089
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,080
Hi.

1090
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:15,840
Ahem.

1091
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,180
Ahem.

1092
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:16,500
Ahem.

1093
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:16,700
Ahem.

1094
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,580
Visit our website.

1095
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,600
Visit our website.

1096
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,320
And that would be subgenius.com.

1097
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,920
Or norellpref.com.

1098
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,980
Who also did the previous collage as well.

1099
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:34,120
Friends here at Tarzan's radio studio in the throne office of the slacker mansion.

1100
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,740
While listening to background music done by yours truly.

1101
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,560
We're getting ready for Winterstar this February.

1102
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:46,100
By preparing new subgenius cerebral reformatting programs and videos.

1103
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:55,120
And if you want to you can see roseandcomet.com for info on the Winterstar Simulator.

1104
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:55,120


1105
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,800
Which also features other alternative religions and thought forms.

1106
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,140
Or there's always the events page at subgenius.com.

1107
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,320
And here's Dr. Howell to tell you about our new cruise ship.

1108
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,800
Here on the cruise ship known as the Lovecraft.

1109
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,820
Only top flight subgeniuses get to use these facilities.

1110
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,900
And I'd like to.

1111
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,880
Welcome you to the special Bob Dobbs lounge.

1112
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:33,720
Where only the top swells of the church are allowed to participate.

1113
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,880
This is the well stocked larder.

1114
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,420
Fully equipped with every kind of computer game.

1115
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,940
Here the hot tub.

1116
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,900
Hot and cold.

1117
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:43,660
This is X-Tate.

1118
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:51,580
Oh this is everything in the subgenius suite that only the hierarchy are permitted to use.

1119
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,160
And across the way.

1120
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,700
The special rustic wooden retreat.

1121
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,900
With the door that you can actually lock from the inside.

1122
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,100
Yes.

1123
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,900
All has been prepared.

1124
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,960
And all is in readiness for your sacrifice.

1125
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:14,660
For you shall have the honor of being the sacrifice to the great God.

1126
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,720
And you know if it wasn't for the honor and uh.

1127
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,140
That's a record.

1128
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,140
Oh I see.

1129
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,020
Hark the storm is coming up.

1130
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,760
Such an electrical storm as we have not had for twenty years.

1131
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,420
Philo is scanning.

1132
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:42,740
Accessing.

1133
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:43,800
Accessing.

1134
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,480
I see.

1135
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:49,520
It's a Bucky Beaver for Ipaner toothpaste.

1136
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,400
Going over that railroad trestle once again.

1137
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,440
We'll have to hide in the storm cellar Mabel.

1138
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,440
Down with the roots.

1139
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,900
On the root vegetables.

1140
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,980
The cans.

1141
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,760
The persimmons and parsnips that she's put away.

1142
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,080
Ought to last us through the winter.

1143
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,840
Pork snouts there.

1144
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,720
And the ham jelly.

1145
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,580
The hawks.

1146
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,740
We've got it all.

1147
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,000
But uh.

1148
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,960
It's just a dirt floor but it's home.

1149
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,200
Might be a hard winter in this stony soil.

1150
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,140
Hard for a man to put down roots.

1151
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,880
Something there is that doesn't love a wall.

1152
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,940
Old man winter is coming in.

1153
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,900
I can feel it in my bones.

1154
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,380
Temperature will drop down to.

1155
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,480
Sub zero.

1156
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,380
Lakes will freeze.

1157
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,600
Pipes will burst.

1158
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:52,960
Okay you're right.

1159
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,380
Hide.

1160
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,540
Bones will crack.

1161
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,460
Get into the couch quick.

1162
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,960
Old Jack Frost leering at the windows.

1163
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,060
Don't let him in.

1164
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:00,660
Jack Frost.

1165
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,880
Nibbling at your fingertips.

1166
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:03,660
Nipping at your nose.

1167
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,280
Nipping at your nose.

1168
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,900
What's with the nose thing that Jack Frost has?

1169
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:09,480
Is this like.

1170
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,760
He's a mean old man.

1171
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,860
And I've got a baguette of trouble for you.

1172
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,360
I'm sorry.

1173
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,360


1174
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,360


1175
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,360


1176
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,360


1177
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,360


1178
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,360


1179
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,360


1180
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,360


1181
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,360


1182
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,360


1183
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,360


1184
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,160
A baguette?

1185
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,120
Oh lucky.

1186
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,580
It's just not a bag.

1187
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,620
It's not a real bag.

1188
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:24,720
It's a baguette.

1189
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,580
So what's your bag man?

1190
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:34,240
Well my bag is the things that I have grown accustomed to over time and become adept at.

1191
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,160
At which I have become adept.

1192
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:39,100


1193
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,500
Like Johnny Adept.

1194
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,620
Oh I see.

1195
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,500
Now.

1196
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,180
Oh.

1197
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,360
It is.

1198
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,040
It's easy for you to say.

1199
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:48,340
I'm a man.

1200
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:48,340


1201
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:48,340


1202
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:48,340


1203
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:48,340


1204
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:48,340


1205
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:48,340


1206
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:48,340


1207
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:48,340


1208
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:48,340


1209
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:48,340


1210
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:48,340


1211
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:48,340


1212
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:48,340


1213
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:48,920
I'm a man.

1214
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:49,880
I'm humble before this level of scientific development.

1215
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:55,560
But do you actually see with your eyes or do you see with your mind?

1216
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,720
Who is this guy?

1217
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:02,940
Can you comprehend what the weather has to tell you?

1218
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,560
To our people it is a special goddess.

1219
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,740
A spirit who sits on the highest of the mountain peaks.

1220
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:16,240
She weaves the webs of night in which the stars are spread.

1221
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:22,340
And the moon is carried through the heavens by her scuttling imps.

1222
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,740
Look at them scuttle away.

1223
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,160
That's a scuttlebutt of his.

1224
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,100
Leaving their serious spore behind them.

1225
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:33,620
When angered she would brew up clouds as black as ink.

1226
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,340
You're talking of Aunt Bertha?

1227
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,560
No.

1228
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,480
The old spirit of the mountains.

1229
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,040
Of the Catskill Mountains.

1230
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:44,820
Oh.

1231
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,840
Oh.

1232
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:52,380
At the radio station, music and speech are picked up by a microphone

1233
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:56,500
which turns these sounds into electrical impulses

1234
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,600
that correspond exactly to the pattern of the original sound.

1235
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,760
At the radio station's transmitter,

1236
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,340
another electric current is being produced by a device called an oscillator.

1237
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:14,920
This current, known as AC, or alternative current,

1238
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,300
continually changes its direction of flow.

1239
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,840
It flows in alternate directions about a million times a second.

1240
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:27,620
It could be said to have a frequency of about a million hertz.

1241
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:28,660
A million.

1242
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:34,700
That is better expressed as a megahertz.

1243
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,280
Or in ouches, I think.

1244
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,500
Are we going station to station?

1245
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,580
We are going station to station.

1246
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:40,600
Satellite to satellite?

1247
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,640
Station to station, you mean person to person?

1248
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,920
You know, a trunk call.

1249
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,160
Yep, on the radio.

1250
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,940
That's what we do here on the show.

1251
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,900
We go satellite to satellite.

1252
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,900
Who will be my love tonight?

1253
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,180
Literally, folks, because we get in on your mind.

1254
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,440
Get out of my mind.

1255
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,880
But your mind is not my mind.

1256
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,180
My mind to your mind.

1257
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:11,220
So put on your plexi leather pants and dance around in your orange wig.

1258
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,720
But I'm tired.

1259
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,380
And I'm moving.

1260
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,720
My orange...

1261
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,860
Hey, someone got my orange wig.

1262
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,840
I gave it the Orpheus.

1263
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,480
Oh, man.

1264
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,300
Bob.

1265
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,100
Bob.

1266
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,560
Praise God.

1267
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,860
Praise God.

1268
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:57,180
Well, if you can't see that clue why on earth am I even using this cardboard box.

1269
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,180
There's yellow trash in it.

1270
00:51:59,180 --> 00:51:59,480
Oh, the pink one is even alright.

1271
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,420
That's the hitğıенить.

1272
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,300
Or there are other ones out there.

1273
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,120
Oh, yeah, those are the River misters.

1274
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:13,520
Yeah, those are good.

1275
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:13,900


1276
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,900
here at the radio station now.

1277
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,960
We had to cut back a little bit.

1278
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,540
All the colons on our digital clocks

1279
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,140
had been replaced with semicolons.

1280
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:21,460
Oh, wow.

1281
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,400
Had to cut back a little.

1282
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,160
Well, that's a sure sign, man.

1283
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:24,920
Things are sliding.

1284
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,440
I had to have a colon replacement

1285
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,880
after my colonoscopy, yeah.

1286
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:30,880
That's so good.

1287
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,320
They gave me the two little dots.

1288
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,500
And that probably cost you...

1289
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,700
Because I was down to like a semicolon,

1290
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,520
which it's...

1291
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,760
I don't want to go into too much detail,

1292
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,560
you know, with bathroom stuff,

1293
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,480
but it becomes tricky.

1294
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,780
Yeah, I can imagine.

1295
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,100
People with hyphenated names are...

1296
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:49,860
You know, you would assume

1297
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:50,980
that they would be making money

1298
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:53,420
because they were the richer classes to begin with.

1299
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,100
But they just dropped the hyphen now

1300
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:01,020
and maybe it's the middle part of the name even, I guess.

1301
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,680
Hyphenated names strike me

1302
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,180
as a little more contemporary,

1303
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,080
a little more modern.

1304
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,220
I don't think those were...

1305
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:08,940
You know, like historically,

1306
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,760
people of the aristocracy

1307
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,400
would have multiple last names.

1308
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,040
You know, four or five of them.

1309
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,000
But they were not hyphenated, I don't think.

1310
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:17,360
Right.

1311
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:20,700
They'd carry around the originators of the family

1312
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,240
like an orangutan.

1313
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,920
Well, now, Princess Wee and I,

1314
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,580
if we wanted to be trendy,

1315
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,560
we could be...

1316
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,440
I could be Ivan Stango.

1317
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,820
And she would be Princess...

1318
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,700
But see, she just really didn't want to end up

1319
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,540
being Princess Wee R. Stang.

1320
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,660
She just...

1321
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,000
That was not going to work for her.

1322
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:41,920
It just doesn't quite work.

1323
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,220
So she's...

1324
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,180
She kept her maiden name of Doe.

1325
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,840
She was never a maiden.

1326
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,480
I thought that that meant she had money.

1327
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,040
Boy.

1328
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,280
Oh, well.

1329
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,500
We're making do.

1330
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,240
If we knew what planet...

1331
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,100
What her home planet was,

1332
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,020
she's probably rich.

1333
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,540
You know, if we could just...

1334
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,460
If we could only find her a way back.

1335
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,860
I think if we got rid of all the planets

1336
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,020
and started from the very beginning

1337
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,860
a new start for mankind,

1338
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,360
a new April for the apes of Japan,

1339
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,020
a new beginning.

1340
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,340
Dave, I've got news for you.

1341
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,260
The people of the future did that,

1342
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,920
and this is what happened.

1343
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,200
Well...

1344
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,900
Us right now is what happened.

1345
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,180
Because people tried to perfect...

1346
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,440
They went back to the beginning

1347
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,260
and tried to make everything work right.

1348
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,580
And this is the best they could do.

1349
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,080
And they keep doing it, though, right?

1350
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,460
So that's why the...

1351
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,880
kind of the third layer of confusion

1352
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,920
keeps on...

1353
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,720
Well, nobody knows for sure

1354
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,380
how many times it's been done.

1355
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,560
See, that could...

1356
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,420
You know, you want to be an existentialist

1357
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:51,780
or something,

1358
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,480
there's your lack of meaning right there.

1359
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,820
What if you've already tried everything

1360
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,660
about 5,000 times

1361
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,520
and you don't know it

1362
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,740
and you think you're doing something new?

1363
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,200
Some of the really bored science fiction writers,

1364
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,820
modern sci-fi writers,

1365
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,060
have tackled that subject.

1366
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,840
But they really...

1367
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,540
Those really are the dull ones, you know,

1368
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,360
because it's just the same story

1369
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:12,900
over and over again.

1370
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,000
With very minute changes each time.

1371
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,800
And it still ends up being depressing.

1372
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,100
No matter what.

1373
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,100
Well, these are the people

1374
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,620
who would trade an apostrophe

1375
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,880
for a decent snack,

1376
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,500
a day's work.

1377
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,140
Hey, you know,

1378
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,960
if you've got holes in your shoes,

1379
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,280
maybe you'll let go

1380
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,080
some of the letters in your name.

1381
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,380
I've got an extra S in my first name,

1382
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,200
my slave name,

1383
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,980
that I could probably drop.

1384
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,060
Nobody would know the difference.

1385
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,060
Save a little tiny bit here and there.

1386
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,300
We could even get past the initials,

1387
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,660
like there'd be no R or S,

1388
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,580
or, you know, you just...

1389
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,780
Why do you think Kentucky Fried Chicken

1390
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,160
changed their name to KFC?

1391
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,420
The signs were a lot cheaper to paint.

1392
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,580
Yeah, we're getting close to the end here

1393
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,560
of the Puzzling Evidence Show.

1394
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,200
More in the distance.

1395
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,460
Where you can go out to YouTube

1396
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,860
on Puzzling Evidence TV.

1397
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:12,700
Time is swinging night here.

1398
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,260
And you can see episodes of the show

1399
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,880
also on Philodrum.

1400
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,980
That's episode 8,

1401
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,900
Philo vs. the Giant Scorpion.

1402
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:24,580
We have some regular

1403
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,300
Puzzling Evidence shows set to

1404
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:27,680
never end.

1405
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,300
And don't forget, the last episode,

1406
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,660
the human of the paper.

1407
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,560
www.quiveringbrain.com

1408
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,680
If I were hung upside down,

1409
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,320
say a railroad bridge,

1410
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,120
and set in motion,

1411
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,880
then I would...

1412
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,240
Of course, you could go to your

1413
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,300
kpfa.org archives

1414
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,960
and retrieve your podcast

1415
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,000
at your leisure.

1416
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:51,440
Join us next week for more of

1417
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,580
The Human Pendulum.

1418
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,720
Send them to your friends and your enemies.

1419
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,260
It may work best for our show

1420
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,280
if it is your enemies.

1421
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,940
A swarm of Wall Street bankers,

1422
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,840
a war machine,

1423
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,980
13,000 corporate lobbyists,

1424
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,640
nay, saying Republican and Congress people,

1425
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,720
right wing yakety yakkers.

1426
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,220
They already think that, so...

1427
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,060
Weak-kneed Democrats.

1428
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,120
Oh, good night.

1429
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,780
Double-chinned...

1430
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,440
Oh, you have to go?

1431
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,440
Well, alright then.

1432
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,880
Hail and farewell.

1433
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,200
Uh...

1434
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,780
Could you say that again?

1435
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,260
Sure.

1436
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,300
Where do you want me to start?

1437
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,500
The beginning.

1438
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,120
Start at the beginning.

1439
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:46,880
AT&T was wiped out today.

1440
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:50,220
Polaroid dived.
