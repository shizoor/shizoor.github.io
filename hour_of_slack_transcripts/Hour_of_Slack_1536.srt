1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Well, right now, this minute, I'm going to do something that may overthrow the entire radio business.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:12,720
I'm going to read you a commercial, but I'm not going to say a word about laboratory tests or quote you statistics or make medical claims.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,360
All I'm going to say simply and honestly is this.

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,040
Ladies and gentlemen, try, just try, the finest money can buy.

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,120
Every advanced technique and control is concentrated on the subgenius.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,420
Power of the sun.

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,980
Amazing face, how sweet the smile.

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,900
That saved the slack of me.

9
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,420
I once was lost.

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,580
But up I found no conspiracy.

11
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,380
Okay, so share.

12
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,460
Thank you.

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,900
I know I've been a sinner in my life.

14
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,220
That evil twist got us there.

15
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,520
Ain't no Christians.

16
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,180
I'm as I'm.

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,180
The new truth is the last.

18
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,260
When I hear that truth evolving.

19
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, I never saw.

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,140
The black man.

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:52,740
Never gladder than when I shout that name above.

22
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,080
Bob Dobbs.

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
Take a breath.

24
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,260
Just be unbroken.

25
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,380
By and by, by, by, and by.

26
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,640
There's a bottle.

27
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,740
Heaven waiting in the sky.

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,260
Bobby in the sky.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,620
Now though I ain't no young'un.

30
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,220
One day.

31
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,280
I'm going to be old.

32
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,900
Got that subtle, deep old feeling.

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,460
Now it can't be told.

34
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,760
But I got my high five.

35
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,660
Got my jukebox.

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,520
Got my albums.

37
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,160
My night.

38
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,200
Got my box.

39
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,200


40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,200


41
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,560
Got my

42
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,560


43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,040
Should I ever lose my way now?

44
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,660
Bob.

45
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,480
Well, I got a smooth new map.

46
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,340
Yeah.

47
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:27,880
And if I run out of the secret Pilgrims, you know I won't doubt it.

48
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:27,880


49
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:27,880


50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,220
Oh, oh, boy.

51
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,820
Rocket, I'm the king of the

52
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,800
during 18X Day last July.

53
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,600
You'll hear the whole song at the end of this show

54
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,580
because this is the first of the X Day cross-section shows

55
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,800
featuring many different performers on the X Day stages.

56
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,100
Praise Bob.

57
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,080
I'm by the window

58
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,780
Yeah

59
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,180
Hi everybody.

60
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,580
Do you guys remember how to do the call and response?

61
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,980
While we're testing your minds?

62
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,400
So if I say praise, what do you say?

63
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,860
Alright, let's try that.

64
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,760
While we're testing your minds.

65
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,920
I test the middle of my ears.

66
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,460
Can you hear?

67
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,580
I think I can hear you.

68
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,640
Praise.

69
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,940
Oh, that was weak.

70
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,680
Guys.

71
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,220
Right.

72
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,960
Let's try that one more time.

73
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,760
Are you guys ready?

74
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,080
Praise.

75
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,560
Yes.

76
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,260
Yes.

77
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,320
Much better.

78
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,660
That's much better.

79
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,160
And they spelled it right this time.

80
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,680
They spelled Bob right this time.

81
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,720
Attention, subgeniuses.

82
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,580
Attention, subgeniuses.

83
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,100
The show is about to begin.

84
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,140
You have never seen anything like this in your life before.

85
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:24,260
We have gathered freaks, curios and curiosities from across the globe.

86
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,480
Here for you to see.

87
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:26,760
Here for you to see.

88
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
For your enjoyment.

89
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,260
Just thank God that you were not born like them.

90
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,740
One look at them will tell you all you need to know.

91
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,920
Come one, come all.

92
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,680
Only fifty cents.

93
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:55,280
See the living, crawling human-like subgenius things as they crawl on their bellies like

94
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,200
a reptile.

95
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,360
Okay, I think we got almost everybody here.

96
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,620
Let go all your fears.

97
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,760
The end of the world is here.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,600
Welcome boys and girls to the end times.

99
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,280
The end times

100
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,520
The end times

101
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,020
Baby do not scream

102
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,460
Love he won't be mean

103
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,860
Cause you paid the fee

104
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,260
For the end times

105
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,940
The end times

106
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,400
Brothers and sisters let's give a big round of applause for

107
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,240
Finn Chooley who has felt the spirit of Bob and has been compelled

108
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,100
to come up here and say what he needs to say to you brothers and sisters.

109
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,380
Well well none of you wanted to come up so now

110
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,520
look what you gotta deal with. I got a hot mic

111
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,380
and I'm about to use it. As mentioned my name is the Reverend Finn

112
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,240
Chooley from the Clench of Our Lady of Perpetual Constipation and before I

113
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,140
begin I'd like to invite you all to participate in a

114
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,140
certain custom that we have here at my home Clench which is

115
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,280
instead of at any point you should choose to applaud the

116
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,320
ranter I want you instead to just boo the shit out of me

117
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,920
okay? In place of applause right? And if you want to boo

118
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,260
just boo anyway and that way I won't know if you're really booing me or not.

119
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,880
But anyway I'm going to reintroduce myself and if you'd please afford me the

120
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,200
custom of my home Clench I'd appreciate it.

121
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,140
And now everybody please make

122
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,180
and feel welcome the Reverend Finn Chooley

123
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,220
and the Reverend Finn Chooley.

124
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,280
You are not funny! You guys.

125
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,300
You're not the funny one! So unwelcoming.

126
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,420
Thank you very much. That was good. I feel right at home.

127
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,260
Then what I wanted to talk to you today about is why do we do that in the first

128
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,480
place at Our Lady of Perpetual Constipation?

129
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,940
Why do we have this custom of the audience booing the ranter?

130
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,840
It's because the audience is actually taking the role, playing the role

131
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,660
of the conspiracy in the rant.

132
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,460
While the one lone yeti stands up

133
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,240
proclaiming the word of Bob, the conspiracy all sits

134
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,720
down, facing the same direction, opposite the way

135
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,580
of the ranter. And in this way the audience

136
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,100
actually plays a very special role in making

137
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,580
the rant actually take the form

138
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,000
of that one subgenius standing up against the conspiracy. And of course

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,020
everybody takes their turns and it doesn't make you pink to play the conspiracy.

140
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,200
You know, not any more than a Christian playing the role

141
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,620
of Judas in a play, you know, for example, or anything like that.

142
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,100
But it helps! It helps to drive home the point.

143
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,840
Because when you're up there standing, facing

144
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,820
into the eyes, those pink eyes, and don't fly until you

145
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,800
see the pinks in their eyes, by the way, of the conspiracy. It helps you

146
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,560
to prepare you for that world in which you must encounter.

147
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,200
Because of course we couldn't be further behind any new lines.

148
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,280
This is their territory that we must all

149
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,060
negotiate. And as such,

150
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,980
ranting helps you do it. I'd invite

151
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,560
any of you to come up here, strengthen

152
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,820
those muscles, so that when you have to go out and face

153
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,900
the conspiracy, you can say, yeah, I did this before. I was at

154
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,500
X Day. I stood up. I ranted.

155
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,900
And if I can stand up and rant to a bunch of yetis booing

156
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,320
me, well I can stand up to any pink, certainly.

157
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,960
Shut up! You're such a wimp!

158
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,140
You're crappy!

159
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Louder and funnier! See, there you go!

160
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,740
You feel that? Does it also remind you that the conspiracy

161
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,700
is within you, as you play that role against the ranter?

162
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,080
Because of course it is. Go to hell!

163
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,780
If there's anybody going

164
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,660
to hell that would like to offer a ride, I'm looking.

165
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,580
Now, there is something else I want to bring up with you guys.

166
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,940
Just how little the conspiracy actually

167
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,020
has to get you to buy in, to get you to buy in

168
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,160
all the way. I saw a pack of these, uh,

169
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,980
Oreos, I believe they're called, and right there on the

170
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,980
label, it said cookie. Okay? I think we're all familiar

171
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,920
with what I'm talking about here. But since when

172
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,900
is two chocolate-flavored crackers

173
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,000
stuffed with icing constitute

174
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,720
a cookie? It's closer to a cake

175
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,760
than anything else, okay? The lie's gone on long enough.

176
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,720
The charade must end now.

177
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,040
Oreos are not cookies. They're

178
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,700
crackers. Frosting. They're more sugar than anything else,

179
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,840
really. But we still like them, right?

180
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,460
And we call them cookies because it says that right on the label. It says cookie. So it must

181
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,820
be. It has to be a cookie. They couldn't put it there if it wasn't true.

182
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,740
But if they can get you to call

183
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,500
two chocolate-flavored crackers stuffed with icing a cookie,

184
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,620
then they can get you to not call out the fact

185
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,420
that the Emperor isn't wearing clothes.

186
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,880
You're lying!

187
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,720
And when you don't say that the Emperor isn't wearing clothes, and

188
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,260
nobody else around you is mentioning that the Emperor isn't wearing clothes,

189
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,920
well, then you've bought in.

190
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,560
That's the conspiracy right there. Just the kind of

191
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,420
passive compliance is all it takes. You don't really have to

192
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,460
sign on the dotted line, but you can opt out

193
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,320
at any time. And isn't that why

194
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,520
we're all here? Enjoy the rest

195
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,600
of your ex-day. May Bob be with you.

196
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,780
May your slack overfloweth.

197
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,960
And praise Brad.

198
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,340
String him up!

199
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,240
Let's give him a round of appreciation.

200
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Hey Rachel!

201
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,700
Alright, so here, we're gonna try this.

202
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,200
I think you'll get a kick out of this.

203
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,540
Gonna build me a shelter made of concrete and steel.

204
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,480
I'll fill it up with water and ready to eat meals.

205
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,080
Rifles, bullets, kerosene, it's all part of my plan. You'll finally take a chance on me

206
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,280
when I am the last man.

207
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,880
Now we all know what's coming in some way, shape, or form. Maybe mutant zombie

208
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,880
hippies or a freaky solar storm that wipes out all the telecom, destroys the

209
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,260
power plants. You'll have no choice but to fall for me when I am the last man.

210
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,940
If you stay here in my fallout shelter, I'll

211
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,980
keep you safe from harm. Don't care if the world goes

212
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,380
out of your skelter if you're here in my arms.

213
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,060
Now I know your fella Jerry ain't quite right in the head.

214
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,940
And when the shit gets hairy, the first to wind up dead. But I'll be sitting pretty

215
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,920
and you'll finally understand I'll not have a bad catch after all when I am the

216
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,400
last man.

217
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,580
Now Desmond, he's a smart one and he's good at fixing cars.

218
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,780
But when there's no more gasoline, he won't be getting far. He'll stall it on an open field.

219
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,800
And then they'll eat his face. But you won't see such tragedies if you're here in my space.

220
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,880
If you stay here in my fallout shelter,

221
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,000
I'll keep you safe from harm. Don't care if the world

222
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,700
goes out of your skelter if you're here in my arms.

223
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,020
Now I got your favorite novels and a couple of good

224
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,560
guitars. Some games to play when it's a rainy day in a fully stocked wet bar.

225
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,680
And when all the world gets to...fucking A.

226
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:06,960
When all the world gets to...fucking A.

227
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,100
When all the world around becomes a dangerous wasteland.

228
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,660
We'll live it up in my little hut. They'll all be gone. We'll party on.

229
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,060
I'll have it all just by default. The world will shit

230
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,780
and I won't care a bit when I am the last man.

231
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,860
Alright.

232
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,860
That was Saint Andrew the Impaled

233
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,260
with a very new song recorded live at 18X Day on the Wisteria stage.

234
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,560
Up next, a short rant from the good or who knows possibly bad

235
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,460
Reverend Grill Ninja.

236
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,260
I am indeed a spatulatory expert.

237
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,940
So, how is everyone doing this X Day?

238
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,080
I mostly, to feed my own meticulous ego,

239
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,380
decided to come up on stage and say stuff. We're gonna see what I say though.

240
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,620
Actually, I wanted to talk to you a little bit about Slack and its nature

241
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,920
and how it works for all of us.

242
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,340
In my travels in my life, I have seen some pain and torment

243
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:19,940
and death and those three in the mornings where you break down and you lose your shit

244
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,520
and you're like, ahhhh, and buckled on the floor and crying tears of blood.

245
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,860
crying tears of blood. I've had that day.

246
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,000
You know, what really gets me through all that is the mad science laugh.

247
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,700
And I'm gonna explain to you the prodigious use of the mad science laugh.

248
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,320
Because no matter how hard life gets,

249
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
if you find yourself doing something, like say, I don't know, you're spanking a squirrel

250
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,920
while a midget's jerking you off. Let's say that happens and you go

251
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,520
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

252
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,300
Then you're probably doing it right. Anytime you ever make that noise, at least for me,

253
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,720
that's a pretty good sign I'm doing something right in my life.

254
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,860
It's like when you're playing a video game and you figure out some weird trick

255
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,560
and how to hack into the game and get the extra bonus stuff before you're supposed to

256
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,020
and nobody told you how. You sit there and you go, HAHAHA, YES!

257
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,540
And then as long as you're doing that within your heart, that's the sign of

258
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,200
achieving slack, to be perfectly honest.

259
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,660
Exactly, sir, exactly. And that is how it's done to one extent.

260
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,100
There are many ways of slack. It's like, um,

261
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,260
I don't know, watching a loved one die before your eyes and then just making sure

262
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,840
you were there with them. Mmm, slack for that. Then there's also

263
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,880
I don't know, hugging a tree, I suppose, for some people. It's not so much for me

264
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,520
because, you know, you rub yourself up on a bark, you get all braced and

265
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,000
you're bleeding and it's uncomfortable. But then again, you know, if you never did it,

266
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,060
it's still worth doing. So, um, I'm gonna

267
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,060
keep that short and sweet. That's what I wanted to say. What you should do, always within your

268
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,040
hearts and your souls, is, uh, cultivate the man's

269
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,440
science laugh. HAHAHAHAHA!

270
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,920
HAHAHAHAHA, yes! HAHAHAHAHA! As long as you are

271
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,660
able to do that within yourselves, you too will know the truth of slack. And

272
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,180
Bob, the gateway drug of the universe, that's what he is for me.

273
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,520
Thank you.

274
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,600
Thank you, River of Peace!

275
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,840
Round of applause for the

276
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,540
real Grill Ninja.

277
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,680
Woo! The original

278
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,260
Grill Ninja. The original, I guess that's, GM.

279
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,800
I find Grill Ninja interesting because, like, so many ranchers are angry and he's

280
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,880
like, he's like the peace and light in Bob's eye and it's

281
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,960
really, you know how, and I'm telling you this and I don't know if any of you know this, if you look at the

282
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,840
dots of Bob and you look at one of the eyes, there's a heart

283
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,680
in it. There's an actual heart in the Dob's head in the eye

284
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,580
and I think that everybody worships a section of the Dob's

285
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,340
head and our great guy here, Grill Ninja, is

286
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,980
focusing on the heart in Dob's eye. Aww!

287
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,480
Which is a good thing because, you know, I'm frickin' burning in his pipe because I'm so

288
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,400
angry all the time.

289
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Okay, I think it's 10 or 11 at night

290
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,420
and I can't even see my watch because it's dark on the road.

291
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,020
Walking between Caffeinas and the main

292
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,880
stage, as they call it, where apparently Reverend

293
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,120
St. Faltimus and somebody are jamming

294
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,240
with no audience that I can see.

295
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,220
Oh, here's Pisces. I was just narrating

296
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,220
the scene here. It's kind of a weird scene because there's this

297
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,060
band on stage jamming and there's no audience to be seen

298
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,900
anywhere, although you can hear it all over the camera. I don't even know if they're

299
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,680
jamming. I think it's something other than jamming.

300
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,980
I've heard

301
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,680
this tune before.

302
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,960
I spell that M. I said

303
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,520
A. D.

304
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,620
Apparently it's X Day's Stupid Show

305
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,240
for Morons. Oh, I didn't even notice that. Reverend

306
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,100
Fox is projecting a slide on the top of the stage

307
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,260
over, quite clear, it says, it does indeed

308
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,480
say, X Day's Stupid Show for Morons.

309
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,400
I love Reverend Fox's captions. He did that a couple of years ago.

310
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,680
He seems to know what's up. Well, he makes up the caption

311
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,100
on the fly and projects it.

312
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,520
You know, he changed it every ten minutes or so he'd come up with some new snarky

313
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,400
but accurate thing to say. X Day's Stupid Show

314
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,640
for Morons. Praise Bob! Yep.

315
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,780
Bob Dobbs gathered in their masses

316
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,560
Just like some

317
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,640
G's at X classes

318
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,380
Waiting for just for penis

319
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,220
With some power

320
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,400
We'll take her

321
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:13,720
Onward!

322
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:28,220
Baby, don't you cry

323
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,900
Just because they'll die

324
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,500
You know, at least we tried

325
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,960
For the end of time

326
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,000
We'll take her

327
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,200
Onward!

328
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,200


329
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,000
Just because they'll die

330
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:47,360
You know, at least we tried

331
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:47,920
For the end of time

332
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,380
We'll take her

333
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,680
Onward!

334
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,300
For the end of time

335
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,520
Lights are flashing

336
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,080
Cards are crashing

337
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,480
Fire and destruction

338
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,360
All the way

339
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,360


340
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,360


341
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,500
Because it's the end of time

342
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,460
End of time

343
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,520
End of time

344
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,040
End of time

345
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,840
It's the end of time

346
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,040
It's the end of time

347
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,860
Watch the king

348
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,840
So die

349
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,740
Watch the bosses

350
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,300
Cry

351
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,060
Watch the queen

352
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,740
Cry

353
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,780
Cry in the end times

354
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,700
Cry in the end times

355
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,260
Cry in the end times

356
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,860
Cry in the end times

357
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,920
Cry in the end times

358
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,820
Here are the times

359
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:58,920
Here are the times

360
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,060
Hello, my brothers and sisters.

361
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,600
It's Bishop Stick, the Reverend of the Diagonal Travel.

362
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:41,340
And I'm going to discuss those two words that we are against, the conspiracy and pinks.

363
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,420
Right now, I'm only going to discuss the pinks, the pinky.

364
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,780
We have a digit on our hands.

365
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,080
It's called the pinky.

366
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,240
Pinkies are the most essential things when we are trying to grasp things.

367
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,900
We cannot hold onto anything without our pinky.

368
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,520
They are the most useful things that are on our hands, are the pinky.

369
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,880
So I would like, instead of it being called a pinky, we need to come up with a better

370
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,480
plan of what we are going to call this digit.

371
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,940
Because pinks are worthless, but a pinky is not.

372
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,040
Call it a brownie!

373
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,500
Everyone loves brownies!

374
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,740
And you can put it in your butt.

375
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:28,900
Yeah.

376
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,360
It's a nose picker!

377
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,120
Wow, yeah, a brownie would be, but again.

378
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:45,540
It works really good, and you can use it as a spoon, and, uh, which I have not.

379
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,320
Oh, no, it's a good digger.

380
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,160
Yes, the pinky will be renamed by the end of this evening.

381
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,060
By the end of next day, we will rename the pinky.

382
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,280
It's the digger.

383
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:57,980
I like the digger.

384
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,900
The digger.

385
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,220
Yes.

386
00:24:59,540 --> 00:24:59,960
Yes.

387
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,080
Yes.

388
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,860
Yes.

389
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,100
Yes.

390
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,260
Yes.

391
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:02,260


392
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:02,260


393
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:02,260


394
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:02,700
Theings.

395
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:03,880
Theings.

396
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,480
Theings.

397
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:04,520
Theings.

398
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,140
Yes.

399
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,460
Theings.

400
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,240
Yes.

401
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,500
Theings.

402
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,160
Theings.

403
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,020


404
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,140


405
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:28,880
The

406
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,680
Let me tell you a story

407
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,300
A story about me

408
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,880
One day I was walking down the street

409
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,060
And I came across a guy

410
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,520
Smoking a pipe

411
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,500
Looking kind of nice

412
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,760
He comes up to me and said

413
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,260
Hey son

414
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,840
Would you like to have a job?

415
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,340
I said fuck no

416
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,040
Who are you?

417
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,300
He said my name is Bob

418
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,220
I'm B.O.B

419
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,100
Says D.O.B.B

420
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,580
I'm B.O.B

421
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,120
Says D.O.B.B

422
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,360
I said okay Bob

423
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,080
Who the fuck are you?

424
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,180
He said I'm your master son

425
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,460
Now do what I tell you

426
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,940
I said uh

427
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,480
I don't think so Bob

428
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,440
I'm not that kind of guy

429
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,040
He said well listen son

430
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,100
Smoke the top and let's get high

431
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,120
So I sat around

432
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,960
Played the funk with Bob

433
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,060
Sitting around

434
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,220
Shooting the shit

435
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,780
I see what Bob had to spit

436
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,200
He said hey son

437
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,380
Come and work for me

438
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,200
You gotta do nothing but just be

439
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,940
Be who you are

440
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,940
Be what you want

441
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,600
He said do it for Bob

442
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,840
That's all I asked

443
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,480
So Bob

444
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
Okay Bob

445
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,780
He said be who I want to be

446
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,600
B.O.B.

447
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,700
I'll be fucking gravity

448
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,880
I'll be the guy who controls the shit

449
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,680
I'll be the guy who spits some shit

450
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,820
I'll say I'll be gravity

451
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,080
I'll do it for the B.O.B.

452
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,080
D.O.D.D.

453
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,820
Yeah but Bob's not a nun

454
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,980
That's who I am

455
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,680
I'm gravity now

456
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,080
Okay

457
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,460
So I

458
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,480
I got a job for the B.O.B.

459
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,160
And I'm doing what he wants me

460
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,880
And then I take a chair

461
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,220
And I take it over here

462
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,960
Do what Bob wants

463
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,020
Put it in your ear

464
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,560
Do it what you think

465
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,780
For the B.O.B.

466
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,560
Do what he wants

467
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,580
He's a god

468
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,700
He's a witch

469
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,820
When you're down with B.O.B.

470
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,180
You will be down with gravity

471
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,100
You know what

472
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,180
Heavenly bodies roll to me

473
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,060
That's how I roll

474
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,700
I'm gravity

475
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,940
Now you're sold to B.O.B.

476
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,000
Thirty-five dollars

477
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,800
That's all he wants

478
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,340
To do for the B.O.B.

479
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,420
Sell your soul to B.O.B.

480
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,980
Thirty-five dollars

481
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,160
Is what it'll be

482
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,640
And then you got

483
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,620
E-Furnace T-Supply

484
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,640
High in the sky

485
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,840
With the B.O.B.

486
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,100
Never front with B.O.B.

487
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,720
Cause you'll

488
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,600
You'll sell your soul

489
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,240
For eternity

490
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,440
He'll own ya

491
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,360
He'll take your shit

492
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,840
And you'll never give it back

493
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,640
Never front with B.O.B.

494
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,540
That's the fact

495
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:00,920
Hey!

496
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,600
Don't front with B.O.B.

497
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,480
Don't front with B.O.B.

498
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,340
Don't front with B.O.B.

499
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,540
Don't front with B.O.B.

500
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,900
B.O.B. took all my weed

501
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,780
B.O.B. took it from his own greed

502
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,420
B.O.B. doesn't give a shit

503
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,460
B.O.B. will smoke all your shit

504
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:23,820
And

505
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:23,820


506
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,440
Don't front with B.O.B.

507
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,340
Don't front with B.O.B.

508
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,100
Don't ever front with B.O.B.

509
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,540
Cause he'll steal ya

510
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,800
He'll rob you

511
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,420
So

512
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,400
You're feeling a little bit funny

513
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,940
You're not sure why

514
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,720
You're in this

515
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,100
You're just leaking

516
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,540
And

517
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,060
You're not sure where those tears are coming from

518
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,600
Well I can tell you something's done

519
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,980
It's from B.O.B.

520
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,060
That's what he's done to you

521
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,900
B.O.B. will pull that shit all out of you

522
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,080
Here comes his B.O.B. band

523
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,060
Don't throat

524
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,540
Front with B.O.B.

525
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,820
Watch out never

526
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,340
Go and front with B.O.B.

527
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Don't go and throat

528
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,180
Front with B.O.B.

529
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:17,660
Cause he'll

00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,640
He'll take you

531
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,480
So you'll front

532
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,360
B.O.B.

533
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,520
Let's go

534
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,160
Right on

535
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,460
Aha

536
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,800
jourd'

537
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,800


538
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,800


539
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,800


540
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,800


541
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,800


542
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,800


543
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,800


544
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,800


545
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,800


546
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,800


547
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,800


548
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,800


549
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,800


550
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,800


551
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:53,800


552
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:52,940
Cap

553
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,660
Is that the people

554
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,500
So you think it's bad to scrub with Bob?

555
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,340
Let me tell you something that's not even at least a thing.

556
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,980
One time Bob came next to me.

557
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,660
He said, hey son, let's do some X's and Z's.

558
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,400
I said, okay Bob, what will happen if we do that?

559
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,100
He said, let's go son and check it out for a fact.

560
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,880
I said, next thing I know, Bob's all on my nuts.

561
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,620
He was getting like an uppercut.

562
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,720
Bob couldn't get his hands off of me.

563
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,300
He said, Bob, Bob's attracted to my gravity.

564
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,060
He said, never do X's with Bob.

565
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,020
He won't keep his hands off my knob.

566
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,000
I'll never do X's with Bob.

567
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,180
He won't keep his hands off my knob.

568
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,520
I'll never do X's with Bob.

569
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,340
He won't keep his hands off your knob.

570
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,380
Never do X's with Bob.

571
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,060
He won't keep his hands off your knob.

572
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,740
Then next thing I know, Bob's taking home girls that are from the show.

573
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,960
And then they got into his apartment.

574
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,320
They got dressed in, got into a miscellaneous X-Toy.

575
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,840
I don't know.

576
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,920
I don't know if they came from a water destroyer.

577
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,620
But Bob stole the batteries and took them away.

578
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,620
And now the second Bob took them away.

579
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,240
He said, don't do X's with Bob.

580
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,060
He won't keep his hands off your knob.

581
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,080
Don't do X's with Bob.

582
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,100
He won't keep his hands off your knob.

583
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:58,920
And now, and now that you got me drinking, don't go out with Bob drinking.

584
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,740
Because the last time I went and drank with Bob, I ended up in Tijuana.

585
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,120
Alright, fair warning.

586
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:15,980
That was DJ Graffiti, the rapping alongside Six Fisted Tales of Connie, the band that

587
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,340
exists only at X Day, but which almost always has Reverend Angry Larry.

588
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:20,960
Oh, is it?

589
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,260
Sorry.

590
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,820
Lord Angry Larry on guitar.

591
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,720
Other musicians may or may not include Bishop Stitt, Lord Ferg, Hazel of the Windmills,

592
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,520
Reverend Shover, Suds Bischoff, Fid Chewy, Reverend Rockguard, X-Smartist, Philodrum,

593
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,800
Trademark Gunderson, and Reverend Funnyman.

594
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,100
And now this.

595
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,960
Howdy, howdy.

596
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,100
I'm Reverend Ivan Stank.

597
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,960
We all know each other.

598
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:50,940
Oh, yeah.

599
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,260
Not everybody.

600
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,340
So, um.

601
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,820
Bob said, I have basically nothing to say.

602
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,000
And that's what I want to talk to you about.

603
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,020
And it's actually true.

604
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,740
I have nothing to rant about in anger.

605
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,680
And those are the best rants, of course.

606
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,300
You know.

607
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,940
I'm still recycling the 20 years of Terry's life.

608
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:20,940


609
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,060
I have a terrible anger that I thankfully recorded some of.

610
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,840
But all I can rant about is slack.

611
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,820
And because I actually got slack.

612
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,780
And it's, isn't it nice to know that it occasionally does happen.

613
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,300
Now it could be taken away from me.

614
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,620
From my pride.

615
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:45,300
From saying, oh, Bob, you gave me so much slack, I'm going to show off and brag about how much

616
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:45,860
slack I got.

617
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,200
Oh, good.

618
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,600
That's exactly when Bob just switches down and yanks you up in the neck.

619
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,160
And really, he does things to you I'd rather not talk about in front of polite company.

620
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,800
But my mother-in-law, oh, no, she's not here.

621
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,360
But he'll fuck you in the ass is what he'll do.

622
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,960
If you pretend to have slack.

623
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,520
You can't pretend to yourself because, well, then the conspiracy has you.

624
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,220
It's false slack.

625
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,100
You know.

626
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,300
False slack is better than no slack.

627
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,840
Dr. G Gordon Gordon used to say.

628
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:23,560
But Reverend Carter LeBite pointed out that false slack is no slack at all.

629
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,800
And the good news is sometimes you get slack.

630
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,800
And I have enjoyed an inordinate amount, well, well deserved, very well deserved.

631
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,700
God damn it.

632
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,560
I could probably even use some more slack.

633
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,060
Oh, no.

634
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,920
I better be careful there.

635
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,740
I'm going to piss Bob off.

636
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,280
Or Joe of the wines already pissed Bob off.

637
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,160
I'm going to be pissed off, obviously.

638
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,380
But, you know, somebody else's slack is boring.

639
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,880
Not all the time.

640
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,900
Sometimes you might have similar kind of slack as somebody else.

641
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:03,420
Reverend Adie and I have had just two conversations about Monster, this game, Japanese game called Monster Hunter.

642
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:08,180
We're both, well, words can't describe it.

643
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,740
It's a new world.

644
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,820
It's a, you know.

645
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,520
I could lead you on to a better, better plane beyond Bob.

646
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,160
But you'd have to have one of those new Nintendo 3DS things.

647
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,820
You know, it's just going to have to be between us monsters.

648
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,020
Reverend McFuckface is on the way.

649
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:34,100
And he also is a Monster Hunter as well as Lily Drummond, the most advanced of the Drummond Overman clan.

650
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:39,100
Well, since she's a union of an Overman and an Uber femme.

651
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,800
They should be rolling up.

652
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,420
The whole Drummond family.

653
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,480
Sounds awesome.

654
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,460
And Philo will probably just look like in his human form.

655
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,260
If something gets him excited or terribly worked up.

656
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,840
I'm just telling everybody in advance.

657
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,780
He's not a big deal exactly.

658
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,140
But you know that Overman head?

659
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,980
It looks pretty cool once he's in that condition.

660
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:11,580
But the transition between the Steve Wilcox on Facebook.

661
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,580
Philo.

662
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,600
And the real Overman.

663
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,740
You kind of.

664
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,920
It's like you need an air sickness bag.

665
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,460
So try not to get Philo too excited.

666
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,220
Don't talk about climate change or the Confederate flag.

667
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,880
And probably everything will be okay.

668
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,200
Just wanted to make sure everybody knew.

669
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,680
He's a little touchy that Philo is.

670
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,860
Mrs. Philo.

671
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,720
She's great.

672
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,820
No problem.

673
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,920
Lily will tell you what to do.

674
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,180
But you see again.

675
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,940
Here I am ranting about my slack.

676
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,060
These are my personal friends.

677
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,320
I'm looking forward to seeing them.

678
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,180
And I actually do have slack.

679
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,480
And that boring as hell.

680
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,300
If I could think of something horrible that was going on in my own life right now.

681
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,300
It'd probably be more entertaining.

682
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,380
So I'm going to get off stage.

683
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,640
But the nice thing is.

684
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,360
Because there isn't anything.

685
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,000
If there is anything horrible going on.

686
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,000
Please don't remind me.

687
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,840
Because I'm an ex-stay.

688
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,300
That's going to all be over with soon.

689
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,160
I have faith.

690
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,300
You know.

691
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,900
It could come too soon.

692
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,000
You.

693
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:19,920
We.

694
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,480
We got to where we think.

695
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:22,740
Hey.

696
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,620
He's got a fuck peas t-shirt.

697
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,340
Praise Bob.

698
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,680
And fuck peas.

699
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,880
Fuck peas.

700
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,400
That's pretty good.

701
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,620
Reverend Angry Larry's got a fuck peas t-shirt.

702
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,520
Oh I'm not Reverend Angry Larry anymore.

703
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,900
You're not Reverend Angry Larry anymore?

704
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:37,600
No.

705
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:37,900
What?

706
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,020
What?

707
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,140
What?

708
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,060
That's crazy.

709
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,520
Oh you self identify as.

710
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,640
I have become a lord.

711
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,860
You're Mrs. Angry Larry now right?

712
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,260
Lord Angry Larry.

713
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,340
Oh Lord Angry.

714
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,620
You self identify as with a deity.

715
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,260
I am Lord Angry Larry.

716
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,140
Lord Angry Larry.

717
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,380
Lord?

718
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:53,860
Yeah.

719
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,480
Yes.

720
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,360
No Reverend.

721
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:56,920
No.

722
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,280
I am now a lord.

723
00:38:59,280 --> 00:38:59,860
Lord.

724
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,760
Hail Lord Angry Larry.

725
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,900
That's the kind of thing that you get called after the econocataclysm.

726
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,340
And you're in a road warrior type world.

727
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,360
You'll be.

728
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,620
I see what you're doing.

729
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,380
You're thinking ahead.

730
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,820
You're working on old cars that won't be disabled by the alien rays.

731
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,100
And you've already got a title that puts you in warlord category.

732
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,900
He's got the hot rods.

733
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,120
He's got the title warlord.

734
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,160
He's got the goatee.

735
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,300
All real cult leaders got the goatee.

736
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,700
This is asking everyone for a dollar this year.

737
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,800
My beard requires a dollar.

738
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,340
You see that's the frock cult.

739
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,640
But we shan't talk about that now.

740
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,900
Wait I can't.

741
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,440
I keep thinking I'm in Dallas for some reason.

742
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,940
Anyway, yeah.

743
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,240
Who's what's happening next here?

744
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,520
Stang 2.

745
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:02,280
Who will be Stang, the hated Stang 3?

746
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,500
The despised, the persecuted.

747
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,760
Hunted like Frankenstein's monster.

748
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,740
I don't think anybody's stupid enough to do it but me.

749
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,720
Oh no, don't be so sure.

750
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,220
There's a whole world of dumbasses out there.

751
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:15,920
Well there's you.

752
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,420
There's at least two right here on this stage.

753
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,960
And think how many more there must be in that wide wide world.

754
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,620
And more dinosaur buns to be discovered.

755
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,540
Hello audience.

756
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,380
Say hi.

757
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,280
Hi audience.

758
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,300
Are you really?

759
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,160
Come on.

760
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,700
Can you leave it?

761
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,800
Hey you guys can phone in your applause if you want.

762
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,040
Or email it.

763
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,860
Professor Star 76?

764
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:41,780
Yes.

765
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,040
You're the big little picker hole.

766
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,940
Okay, yeah.

767
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,380
Hey, some of you may not have known but yesterday was Canada Day.

768
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,080
So, fuck off eh?

769
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,940
Dig up Hooser.

770
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,720
I'm not Bucky but I'm half Canadian.

771
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,580
So there you go.

772
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,820
So if you got a problem with that.

773
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,560
I'm a lord now fuck faces.

774
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,660
Um, let's pick a key.

775
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,640
And don't say garage key.

776
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,420
I already used that joke, Henny Youngman.

777
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,280
What?

778
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,840
Hey you over there with the face.

779
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,700
Shut the fuck up.

780
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,160
What?

781
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,360
D as in dick.

782
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,880
D as in dick.

783
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,340
Like Dick Dobbs.

784
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,300
Play our favorite song called Duck Babies.

785
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:30,800
Play our favorite song called Duck Babies.

786
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,700
Alright this next song is called Duck Babies and it goes out to whoever said dick.

787
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,800
Duck Babies, oh yeah.

788
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,720
Your dirty diapers spill, yeah.

789
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,860
Duck Babies.

790
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,280
If it wasn't for you.

791
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,520
My little duck baby.

792
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,940
Duck Babies.

793
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:21,440
I stole you from your.

794
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:27,620
Duck Babies.

795
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,220
Duck Babies.

796
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,140
I had a change of choice to see.

797
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,340
My little duck baby.

798
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:36,340


799
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:41,740
You died when I was only three.

800
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:48,300
My little duck baby.

801
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,760
My little duck baby.

802
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,180
Oh duck baby.

803
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,380
Dick Dobbs.

804
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,280
Your dirty diapers spill, yeah.

805
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:57,600
Duck Babies.

806
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:57,600


807
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:57,600


808
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:57,600


809
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,160
I'm a big shot

810
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,760
Watch out next day

811
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:20,560
I'm a big shot

812
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,140
Wow, don't try to be funny, man.

813
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,860
This sucks, man.

814
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,640
Oh, no, I'm not.

815
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,600
So, everybody give him one more round of applause.

816
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,980
Speaking of doctor music,

817
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,180
the next thing happening is something very special.

818
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,560
After, what, two decades?

819
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,080
After about...

820
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,100
After three score and whatever years ago,

821
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,580
we are privileged to experience

822
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,680
the reuniting of

823
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,560
Doctors for Woes,

824
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:56,920
and Dr. Music for Rotan.

825
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,000
If you will bear with us just a few moments,

826
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,200
because, obviously,

827
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,520
Dr. Music requires a certain setup

828
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,160
that does need to be set up.

829
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,400
It also has...

830
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,820
As Philo is reminding us,

831
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,280
it hasn't been set up in 31 years.

832
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,380
This is the concert.

833
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,520
It's already started.

834
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,980
You're now part of it.

835
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,940
Do I have to wear a mask?

836
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,520
So, according to Stang,

837
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,580
this is part of the concert.

838
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,960
The setup is part of the concert.

839
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,740
This is like the soundcheck song,

840
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,600
except it's the setup song.

841
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,620
Yeah, you're the only one

842
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,160
who hasn't rehearsed everything

843
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,560
that we're doing right now.

844
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,400
I have my...

845
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,560
Philo said,

846
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,480
how much gear do you have?

847
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,300
Do you have your gear?

848
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,000
It's like, yeah, I've got this...

849
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,760
This squeak toy.

850
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,840
Okay, I'm testing, testing.

851
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,300
And that,

852
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,620
the professional rehearsal,

853
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,320
radio thing,

854
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,780
and

855
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,940
the fart piano

856
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,640
temporarily donated.

857
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,060
Hey, that sounds like

858
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,180
Reverend Rock.

859
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,380
Yeah.

860
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,660
I was trying to play

861
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,620
Jocko,

862
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,940
but there's not quite enough keys.

863
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:30,940
Where are you playing?

864
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,880
I have eyes!

865
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,900
I'm right!

866
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,340
I know the man by Mr. Fletcher

867
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,760
in Dallas, Texas,

868
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,500
and he's a good man,

869
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,680
except that he don't buy me

870
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,760
two glasses of pitcher's beer.

871
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,100
And I said,

872
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,980
I love you, boy,

873
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,460
and I'm gonna date,

874
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,480
and if I can't whoop it,

875
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,200
I'll go down.

876
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,880
All right, man,

877
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,040
if you can't whoop it,

878
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,300
he's going down.

879
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,020
Ah!

880
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

881
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,580
Do you remember?

882
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,100
It's true.

883
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,860
If I can't whoop it,

884
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,420
I'll go down.

885
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,300
If I can't whoop it,

886
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,240
I'll go down.

887
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,020
If I can't whoop it,

888
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,800
I'll go down.

889
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,780
If I can't whoop it,

890
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,260
I will go down.

891
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,160
Ah!

892
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:25,920
Somewhere,

893
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,840
somewhere I've got the recording,

894
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,660
it bubbles up every now and then

895
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,040
of this old wino

896
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,520
at the very, very first

897
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,680
subgenius, the Bible,

898
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,620
who said,

899
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,040
I don't know Bob,

900
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,660
but if he won't buy me a drink,

901
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,100
I say,

902
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,780
if I can't whoop it,

903
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,720
I'll go down.

904
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,900
If I can't whoop it,

905
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,920
I'll go down.

906
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,680
Get on the mic.

907
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,580
If I can't whoop it,

908
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,200
I'll go down.

909
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,140
I'll go down.

910
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,160
If I can't whoop it,

911
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:05,420
I will go down.

912
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,560
If I can't whoop it,

913
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,600
I'll go down.

914
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,720
Why are you still playing this?

915
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,320
Are you missing here now?

916
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,360
I didn't do it,

917
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,520
I'm not getting down.

918
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,500
Move it,

919
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:24,620
move it,

920
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:24,640
move it,

921
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,800
move it,

922
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,300
If I'm wounded, I will come down!

923
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,760
If I'm fucking wounded, I will go down.

924
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:12,560
If I'm fucking busted, I will go down!

925
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:19,260
If I can't whiff it, I will go down.

926
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:26,140
If I don't whip it, I must go down.

927
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,540
You're a brother?

928
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,660
Yeah!

929
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,460
Or go down?

930
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,980
You must whip it!

931
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,400
Or I'll eat you!

932
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,520
Down, down, down.

933
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,840
Yes, whip it, brothers and sisters!

934
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,120
Don't go down!

935
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,040
You got it.

936
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,160
Whip it!

937
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,400
Oh, okay.

938
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,480
But don't go down.

939
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,880
Wait, I can't go.

940
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,580
You can whip it.

941
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,300
And go down!

942
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,360
You can't just whip it.

943
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,900
And go down!

944
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,840
Hey, let's whip it.

945
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,740
And then go down!

946
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,200
And then go down.

947
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,780
You're gonna do it!

948
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,020
And just whip it!

949
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:18,600
And whip it!

950
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,220
And go down!

951
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:19,800


952
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,360
You're whipping and going down!

953
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,240
Bob will find you a chest.

954
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,080
Bob will find you a chest.

955
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:28,640
And!

956
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,640
And jack off!

957
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,160
Stop it.

958
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,660
You guys have seen everything that happens.

959
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,120
That's when you get slapped!

960
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,780
Quit trying!

961
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,440
I can do it.

962
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,520
Yeah, you can get slapped.

963
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,640
Philo did it.

964
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,680
He repented.

965
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,600
You did a good job.

966
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,280
He quit his job.

967
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,880
He gave the man a first job.

968
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,660
He slacked off.

969
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:52,900
He gave the man a first job.

970
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,580
He went down.

971
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,740
He got me retired.

972
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:57,900
He actually retired.

973
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,480
And I whipped it out.

974
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,140
He repented.

975
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:01,820
He went down.

976
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,540
He got you fired.

977
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:04,940
He did you a part.

978
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,560
Oh, I love your second book.

979
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,400
Nobody wants to be the guy that has to deal with the law, especially me.

980
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,060
All right, all right.

981
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:15,540
Go on.

982
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:15,820
You're on duty.

983
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,120
That's your job now.

984
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,940
I gave you the walkie talkie.

985
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,940
It is pretty loud.

986
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,400
It is pretty loud.

987
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,720
If I can hear it, it's loud.

988
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,280
It is 1.30 at night.

989
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,540
And money?

990
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,940
It's 1.30, yeah.

991
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,280
And when we're talking about, once we get towards Friday, there's a lot more wiggling.

992
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,700
Some of these poor ass bastards actually have to work.

993
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,280
And we still have a lot to do too.

994
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,120
And sound care.

995
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,160
Yeah, so we've got plenty of time to do this.

996
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:41,480
It's great.

997
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,520
Dude, I don't know what you're worried about because come July 5th, 7 a.m., none of that

998
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:45,520


999
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:45,520


1000
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:45,520


1001
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,500
shit's going to matter anyway.

1002
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,060
What fucking complaints are you going to hear?

1003
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,940
I've heard that somewhere before.

1004
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:50,980
What's that thing?

1005
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:51,940
It involves a copy of that.

1006
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,380
Subsonic machine gun.

1007
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,200
We know we all hear it.

1008
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:55,740
Pisces.

1009
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,320
With anal probes on the end of every single one.

1010
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:02,080
Yeah, but if we get kicked out of here, we'll have to go to a motel.

1011
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:02,640
Oh.

1012
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,620
For people at parties.

1013
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,260
And that'd be terrible.

1014
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,500
Seriously, the guys are nasty.

1015
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,300
Yo.

1016
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,300
I liked it.

1017
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,340
I think it's 1.30 and it's Wednesday.

1018
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:10,780
Well, Thursday.

1019
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,340
Wednesdays are always the best.

1020
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,500
The craziest shit happens on Wednesday because it's the best.

1021
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:15,500


1022
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:15,500


1023
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:15,500


1024
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:15,500


1025
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:15,500


1026
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,180
It's the jam, the doctor jam.

1027
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:06,200
I think we'll get a good one.

1028
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:06,240


1029
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,300
It's the best.

1030
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,860
It's the best.

1031
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,540
It's the best.

1032
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,020
It's the best.

1033
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,620
It's the best.

1034
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,040
It's the best.

1035
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,140
Then two

1036
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:35,100
of you in the normal room, any one of you, I've already met.

1037
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,100
Now on the door楼

1038
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:42,480
Just a między달�iones- flipping hand abs!

1039
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,820
I don't know what we should name that song guys, what do you think?

1040
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,880
What should be the title of it?

1041
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,180
So please, we are high.

1042
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:13,300
We're going to do one, and this is a song that you all can sing along with.

1043
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:16,420
If you don't know it yet, you'll get it.

1044
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,120
You'll get the chorus, so please be part of it.

1045
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,380
We're going to praise Bob.

1046
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:26,040
We're going to praise the De-Evolutionary band who praises Bob.

1047
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,300
Devo, in this tune.

1048
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,560
May your records

1049
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,160
be a living record

1050
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:39,860
and broken

1051
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:45,780
by and by, by and by

1052
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:52,680
There's a vine of heaven waiting

1053
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:58,400
in the sky by winter's light

1054
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:06,460
Well I play the piece that we've played

1055
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,160
One Friday night

1056
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,980
and sunny days

1057
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:16,680
And I've been in this kitchen

1058
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,460
I've been awesome to it

1059
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:28,560
My turntable started jumping

1060
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:33,060
What it did I know not

1061
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:37,300
Oh, that Bob knows

1062
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,880
how I cried

1063
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,940
when it scrapped my good and loud

1064
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,140
And who made a record

1065
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,160
be unbroken

1066
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:56,280
by and by, by and by

1067
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:02,440
There's a vine of heaven waiting

1068
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,180
in the sky by winter's light

1069
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:13,500
Well I bought a second copy

1070
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:18,320
This is through Red-Eyes Express

1071
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:25,380
When my girlfriend came on to this

1072
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,240
We started taking off her dress

1073
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,680
Oh, we're getting to come in the

1074
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,480
ice and coldness

1075
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:40,380
And it's sweet as Sunday boys

1076
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,800
I just told her

1077
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,240
Gotta wait now girl

1078
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:51,180
I'm getting to freedom and joy

1079
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:54,560
You come on and take your records

1080
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,100
Be unbroken

1081
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:02,300
by and by, by and by

1082
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:08,260
There's a vine of heaven waiting

1083
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,120
in the sky, far in the sky

1084
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,280
Well you know I

1085
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,920
I've been a sinner

1086
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,700
in my life

1087
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,900
That evil twist

1088
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,520
I must say I

1089
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,960
Ain't no priest to chide

1090
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,880
Cause I'm new to this, none is

1091
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:40,740
When I hear that truth devouring

1092
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,540
Oh no, I never stop

1093
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,180
When my heart is

1094
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,600
never gathered

1095
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,120
When I shout that name above

1096
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,320
Bob Dawgs!

1097
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,720
May your records

1098
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,380
be unbroken

1099
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:07,360
By and by, by and by

1100
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:13,060
There's a vine of heaven waiting

1101
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,980
in the sky, far in the sky

1102
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,900
Now I know I

1103
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,500
Ain't no young'in

1104
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,700
One day I will be

1105
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,040
I'm gonna be young

1106
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,200
I got that total

1107
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,880
Devo feeling

1108
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,900
Now I can be told

1109
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:49,080
But I got my high five

1110
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,520
Got my divine

1111
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:56,500
Got my albums in my bag

1112
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,640
Should I have it?

1113
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,440
I'm into breaking

1114
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:01,440


1115
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,540
Who's my way now Bob?

1116
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,580
When I got smooth

1117
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:08,920
While I'm thick passing all

1118
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,760
Little records

1119
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,460
The unbroken

1120
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:16,640
Body by body

1121
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,120
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye.

1122
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:26,400
There's a light in the sky.

1123
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:46,620
There's a light in the sky.

1124
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,140
There's a light in the sky.

1125
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,560
There's a light in the sky.

1126
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,440
One more time.

1127
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:56,420
There are records being broken.

1128
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,720
By and by, by, by and by.

1129
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:07,940
But there's something for everybody.

1130
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:14,680
In the sky.

1131
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,680
By and by.

1132
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,460
There's a light in the sky.

1133
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,380
I'm Andrew Davis.

1134
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,820
All right, come in.

1135
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,700
I think you broke a record.

1136
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,880
You broke a record for Purdy Music at X-Day.

1137
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,620
It's so fulfilling.

1138
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,320
We're not used to that.

1139
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:01,980
We're taking it back.

1140
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:02,980
How did that happen?

1141
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,940
What a beautiful sound at X-Day.

1142
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,160
What did we do wrong?

1143
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,200
We'll pick up for it later.

1144
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,020
Believe me.

1145
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,760
You have a record.

1146
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:16,140
I don't know what you mean.

1147
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:16,140


1148
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:16,140


1149
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,200


1150
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,200


1151
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,200


1152
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,200


1153
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,200


1154
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,200


1155
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,200


1156
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,200


1157
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,200


1158
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,200


1159
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,200


1160
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:22,740
You've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1161
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:39,300
For free information, write to P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1162
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:45,500
or see www.subgenius.com

1163
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,600
Praise Bob!

1164
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,400
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1165
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:59,740
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1166
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:04,740
Not just this show, but Subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1167
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,260
But if you truly love Bob,

1168
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,280
and want somebody to help you,

1169
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,860
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1170
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:15,860
you should go to subgenius.com front page,

1171
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,340
or especially the radio page,

1172
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,340
or the catalog store pages,

1173
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,660
and help out financially as best you can.

1174
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:27,020
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1175
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,680
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1176
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,600
But some of you still have jobs.

1177
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,960
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1178
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,960
even if it's only once a month.

1179
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,500
And that's not from enough of you.

1180
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,940
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1181
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:51,700
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1182
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:57,240
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1183
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:08,280
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44117.

1184
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:09,260


1185
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:09,260


1186
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,580
We're not going to take any of that money.

1187
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:13,920
We're going to take the money.

1188
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,080
We're going to take the money.

1189
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,940
We're going to take the money.
