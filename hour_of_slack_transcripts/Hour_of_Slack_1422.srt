1
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,320
The Self Genius Power of Swag.

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,140
It's hard to believe they were attacked by an owl.

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:16,820
Praise Bob.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,180
Now you might not recognize me here out of my clown outfit,

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,540
but I said fuck it, I don't need the superpowers.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,600
I'm not doing the superpower thing right now.

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,420
So I can go along with my civilian clothes right here.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,700
I don't need the extra protection of my special hat.

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,600
But people ask me, they say, Andrew the Impaled,

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,400
what can you do about rape culture?

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,200
Andrew, what can we do about rape culture?

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,760
Well, no, it's already been asked, but thank you.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,060
I have an answer to that.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,560
Don't be that guy at a party that gets a girl hammered

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,720
hoping for some action.

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,340
If she has to be drunk, that just means you suck.

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,900
Don't be that guy at a party that sees someone sleeping in an empty bedroom

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,380
and thinks it might be fun to touch.

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,400
Get this in your mind.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:38,180
head that ain't cool man that ain't cool man no that ain't cool man and you know and you know

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,620
don't be that guy at the office that gotta make it clear the offer's always standing

22
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,900
these folks they're just here to work

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,180
don't be that guy at the office that takes a smile as a cue to get all touchy

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:03,420
that just makes you some kind of jerk cause that ain't cool man no that ain't cool man

25
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:12,080
hey that ain't cool man and you know and you know that self-control is a skill that's learned by

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,340
five-year-olds even my dog learned to stay

27
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,520
so if you get the chance to get away with something wrong

28
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,160
do us all a favor

29
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,360
and do the right thing anyway

30
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,580
don't be that guy on the subway that used the occasion to get a love on someone

31
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,980
come on at least act like you've evolved

32
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,220
don't be that guy on the street sees a fine woman and just gotta make some comment

33
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:55,500
that don't get you no points at all because that ain't cool man no that ain't cool man

34
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,160
man that ain't cool man and you know and you know that self-control is a skill that just makes you some kind of jerk

35
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,440
to take a lie on some dead man

36
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,200
and infection is a key

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,200


38
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,440
you know how your identity was

39
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:17,440


40
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,000
come i was born in sy educating all the people in ísterreich

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000


42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,300
and enables us to do Oralщее

43
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,300
right biggest values lasciating так

44
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,020
Don't be that guy in the world that just stands by and watches as the others behave in ways

45
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,040
you know are wrong.

46
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,120
Don't be that guy in the world that holds his tongue for whatever reason.

47
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,680
Go on, use words, your words are strong.

48
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,080
Somewhat simple like, that ain't cool, man.

49
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,300
Yeah, that ain't cool, man.

50
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,400
Hey, that ain't cool, man.

51
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,300
And you know, and you know that that ain't cool, man.

52
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,560
No, that ain't cool, man.

53
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,320
I said, that ain't cool, man.

54
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,920
Go, go.

55
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,700
And you know, and you know.

56
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,960
Thank you.

57
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,760
Thank you.

58
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,220
All right, for those of you who are idiots

59
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,140
and didn't understand that,

60
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,620
that song meant don't be such a rapey jagoff.

61
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,460
All right?

62
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,120
Thank you.

63
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,020
This public service message has been brought to you

64
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,900
by fucking thinking.

65
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,340
All right.

66
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,520
Welcome to 16X Day.

67
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:46,760
Hey!

68
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,220
Countless distant tales of Connie.

69
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,980
The greatest jam band in the world.

70
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,640
At least the efforts are like this.

71
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,240
The shuttle doors are opening.

72
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,180
You can hear the metal grinding.

73
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,820
They're loading up, folks.

74
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,860
They've gone by the armory.

75
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,460
The lasers are ready.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,700
We're well stocked.

77
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,620
Due to the one thing that we've been waiting to do.

78
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,200
And that is...

79
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,220
Destroy the Earth!

80
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,120
Tell me, uh...

81
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,460
Reverend, what will you miss most about this planet?

82
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,560
The blood.

83
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,640
The blood.

84
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,080
Tell me, Reverend, what will you miss most about this planet?

85
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,400
Worrying about money.

86
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,880
All right.

87
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,780
Tell me, Bishop.

88
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,220
Is there anything you'll miss about this shitty Earth?

89
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,020
Absolutely nothing.

90
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,680
An absolute...

91
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,920
Nothing is all that will be left.

92
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,680
Nothing is all that will be left.

93
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,600
We're mutants.

94
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,660
There's something wrong.

95
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,600
Something very, very wrong with us.

96
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,260
Something seriously wrong with us.

97
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,300
And, uh, yes, welcome back.

98
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,660
Welcome back to a special edition of Synesthesia.

99
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,520
I am your host, Dr. Sinister,

100
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,880
and we've got a little bit of our slack overtime to enjoy tonight.

101
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,120
Special report from, uh...

102
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,100
Well, from yet another botched attempt at, uh...

103
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,740
rescuing us from this godforsaken planet.

104
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,660
Uh, what happens next?

105
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,780
What happened to the saucers this year?

106
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,920
I've got, uh, Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr. Howland Owl in the studio with me.

107
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,120
We're going to discuss, uh, some of this thing, uh, you know, some of these questions and more.

108
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,080
Perhaps, perhaps we might get some answers to some of these persistent questions.

109
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,480
So, um, yeah, as of right now,

110
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,860
we're trying to, uh, figure out what, uh, what the heck happened.

111
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,020
Well, are we going to bring in those cadaver dogs and, and get an, get an, uh, an answer?

112
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,560
Or do we have to speculate?

113
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,020
Um, that's a good question.

114
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,500
Now, uh, do the Pleasure Saucers have black box recorders in them?

115
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,400
Well, I was talking to Jazzy DJ Tanning Booth,

116
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,600
and he swore he was in communication with the entire saucer fleet.

117
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,580
But, uh, actually, then it appeared that I had misunderstood him.

118
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,780
But since they never crash, I don't think they need black boxes like our primitive Earth devices.

119
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,640
Or, for that matter, like the primitive, uh, saucers that the Greys use.

120
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,560
Yeah, those things crash all the time.

121
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,240
Yeah, I mean, how, how advanced can these aliens be if they're crashing, you know?

122
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:21,820
Well, that's...

123
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,720
Of course, we only hear about the crashes in that...

124
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,220
That's right. It's, I, I hear that, uh, you know, the flying saucer is actually one of the safest modes of transportation there is

125
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,880
when you, you know, calculate how many casualties per miles traveled.

126
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,680
Much safer than a car.

127
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,420
Well, they travel so long that they're, the odds are very good.

128
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,940
Well, you know, you can, they control for that in those studies.

129
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,660
Hee!

130
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,480
Ooh!

131
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:43,980
So!

132
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,540
Ha!

133
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,580
Space travelers come halfway across the universe to this planet, and this is how we greet them, is it?

134
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,020
With rocks!

135
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,700
And with, with avocados!

136
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,460
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves!

137
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,960
These, these are, these aren't space monsters with TV aerials stuck on their heads!

138
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,080
They, they haven't come here to zap your planet with their ray guns!

139
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
These are fellow beings!

140
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,600
Come in peace!

141
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,480
You do a bit of shopping!

142
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,900
People of Earth, people of Earth!

143
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,480
We should count ourselves privileged!

144
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,960
Yeah, you're privileged!

145
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,340
To greet these intrepid pioneers!

146
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,900
Who come so far across the space!

147
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:29,860
Hey!

148
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,120
They took me off! They got my truck!

149
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,440
Oh, who would have believed it?

150
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,200
What happens is gonna happen to you, and all of you!

151
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
And it's gonna be worse.

152
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,140
A lot worse.

153
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,180
That's great.

154
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,540
Now, let's have no more curiosity about this bizarre cover-up.

155
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,340
The men from Planet X don't even have bodies.

156
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,780
Their spaceships are entirely, really just virtual.

157
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:05,460
It would appear to us to be magic, like gods coming from the sky, and just manifesting any kind of miracle they wanted.

158
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,120
They could appear as flying saucers.

159
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,760
But they're not to be confused with those, uh, the ones that the US government is dealing with.

160
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,200
Oh yeah, those are the worst.

161
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,540
And they're covering up.

162
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,100
Uh.

163
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,120
Those wimpy little, the little guys, the, the skeletons.

164
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,800
They were examined at Area 51.

165
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,680
Those things could barely make Alpha Centauri.

166
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,520
I beg your pardon?

167
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,300
So those things could barely make Alpha Centauri, I bet, on a single tank.

168
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,940
Yes, and we can't even see Alpha Centauri from this hemisphere.

169
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,420
You have to go below the equator.

170
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,020
Well, you know, that's, that goes to the, the northern, uh, northern-centric, uh, mindset that so many people on this planet have, you know.

171
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:43,640
Because the majority of the population's in the northern hemisphere, you know, we forget that aliens are just as likely to come from the direction of the southern hemisphere.

172
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,840
That's right, uh, in fact, uh.

173
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,780
Or the center of the Hollow Earth.

174
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:57,220
Yes, from whose hell creatures, uh, we derive the Nazi flying saucers and other creatures of the...

175
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,920
Supersonic Nazi hell creatures from beneath the Hollow Earth.

176
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,560
Now what about the beverages of X-Day?

177
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,240
Uh, there was such an incredible panoply of liquids served.

178
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,300
Uh, there were, uh, incredible cocktails.

179
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,760
Yeah, if you drank enough of that stuff, you're thinking, oh, an escape vessel.

180
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,160
That's right, your own vessels would wish an escape from the treatment that you were giving them.

181
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:24,760
But, uh, in addition, there were, uh, coconut, uh, flavors, there were beers of all kinds.

182
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,660
Some, uh, dissolute people drank, uh, hard cider, like, uh, Demanted Hillbillies.

183
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,540
Yee-haw!

184
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,840
And, uh...

185
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,360
It's my favorite.

186
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,960
Uh, of course, uh, then others of us brought, uh, soft drinks from Walgreens.

187
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,080
Uh, it's awful.

188
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,740
There was even some that finesse.

189
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,740
Fernet, Fernet Branca? Is that what you call it?

190
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,340
That's right, Fernet Branca, the Miracle Liquid.

191
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,960
Yes, indeed. It was, it was even there.

192
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,580
Miracle Liquid.

193
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,840
Yeah, it's a miracle. Anyone would drink it.

194
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,860
I see.

195
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,320
And, uh, there were subgenius entertainments of all kinds.

196
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,440
There was, of course, Dr. Dark's Movie-ola experience.

197
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,880
And The Grindhouse, which, uh, ran movies 24 hours a day.

198
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,940
They had one H.P. Lovecraft movie night going when I visited them.

199
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,540
Has anyone ever actually made a decent movie?

200
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,600
Based on the works of Lovecraft?

201
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:22,920
I believe one has, and that is The Resurrected, written and directed by Dan O'Bannon, which few people even know about.

202
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,060
And it was criticized by geeks who said,

203
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,160
The problem is it's too true to Lovecraft.

204
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,760
Well, you just can't, uh, uh, please some people.

205
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,400
Or they said, this is the movie that's closest to anything H.P. Lovecraft ever wrote.

206
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,860
And that's what's the matter with it.

207
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,140
You know, to hell with them.

208
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,580
I've actually never read Lovecraft at all.

209
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,220
Well, then, uh, it doesn't really matter, does it?

210
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,600
It's an unforgettable experience, and it will mark you forever.

211
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,980
You'll have a different attitude toward adjectives for the rest of your life.

212
00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:01,380
I was compelled by subgeniuses to quote some of Lovecraft's plummy poetry while I was performing my show at Caffeina's.

213
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:07,760
Because X-Day shows and auctions were also extensive and legendary at this particular X-Day.

214
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,480
The Bulldada auction is now beginning.

215
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:30,720
Now we have a bunch of electronically wanted plastic statues.

216
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,140
Like this, I believe, is Theodore from the Notorious Chipmunks.

217
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,580
Simon.

218
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,140
Simon? Really?

219
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:37,680
Yes.

220
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,340
He's got the glasses. Okay, I stand corrected. It's Simon.

221
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,120
Uh, when you press his top left,

222
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,820
after you trip the little switch on his thorax,

223
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,800
it sings infuriatingly.

224
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,280
Can you hear that?

225
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:53,880
Yeah.

226
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,560
Uh, so, it seems to sing out his butt. Look at where those holes are.

227
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,320
So, I don't know what dementia individual came up with this, but, uh...

228
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,900
The enchanted ear holes of the...

229
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,400
You know, I'm gonna throw the, uh, the Simon, uh, singing thing in with the

230
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,120
Lovecraft.

231
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,100
The lovable, allegedly, Eddie Murphy donkey from Shrek,

232
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,480
which also makes noise when you turn the switch on his stomach,

233
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,560
when you pull his tail.

234
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,720
So, I'm offering these two together for one dollar,

235
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,440
mainly just to get them off the table.

236
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,480
But they do sing. They're not only a shelf tchotchke for your slack altar,

237
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,900
but they can be made to perform.

238
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,120
Uh, if anyone is interested, the bidding is open at any time.

239
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,740
And you can bid at one dollar for these two cute little...

240
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,160
One dollar over here!

241
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,720
One dollar.

242
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,600
All right. These dust catchers have already gotten one dollar.

243
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,960
Is anyone interested in offering two dollars?

244
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,880
Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast in VHS.

245
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,260
This is one of the great enduring classics of fantasy.

246
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,760
You get to see, uh, the wonderful beast, uh,

247
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,740
who's actually better as a beast before he turns into a prince,

248
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,640
and his fantastic house with the hands coming out of the walls,

249
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,060
and the little faces in the stove.

250
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,800
And the little stones in the fireplace, and so on.

251
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,740
Created by the French poet Jean Cocteau,

252
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,000
author of The Blood of a Poet,

253
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,820
and who collaborated with Salvador Dali

254
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,480
to create the famous surrealist masterpiece Ancien Andalou.

255
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,540
This is in French with subtitles.

256
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,980
But then, uh, you'd expect that.

257
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,240
Uh, opening bid, one dollar?

258
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,300
We have a dollar from Mandy, who knows the value of this item.

259
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,820
Do we have a bid from anyone else?

260
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,680
Two dollars.

261
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,240
Do we have three dollars from anyone?

262
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,320
Two dollars.

263
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,380
Here is a bottle of Freak,

264
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,280
a weird, rare Indian soda pop.

265
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,680
Only available in Mother India.

266
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,760
And at X-Ray Day.

267
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,360
It's also called Jira Masala.

268
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,760
And a lot of things in a language I don't understand.

269
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,100
According to the nutritional information,

270
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,660
which U.S. law demands be put on every bottle of glop like this,

271
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,980
there is absolutely no nutritional value

272
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,700
in this stuff at all.

273
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,540
It is, by the very definition,

274
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,880
comfort food and fun food.

275
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,620
And if you're a soda head,

276
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,940
you can have the only bottle of this,

277
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,540
who knows, in the U.S.,

278
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,920
although I know another place you can probably get it,

279
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,380
which is Galco's Old World Grocery in Los Angeles,

280
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,580
which specializes in selling exotic soda pop.

281
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,000
Everybody should visit there.

282
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,880
But since we're not there but here,

283
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,500
who would like a bottle of Freak,

284
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,700
or possibly P. Freak,

285
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,280
I don't know why there's a period after the P.

286
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,540
We have a bid of one dollar.

287
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,740
Do we have two dollars from anyone?

288
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,560
I'd say make this really cold in the refrigerator.

289
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,020
We do have two dollars.

290
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,900
Do we have three dollars?

291
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Three for P. Freak.

292
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,060
And people knew from afar somehow

293
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,200
what wonderful fun we were having.

294
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,760
In fact, one irate boyfriend

295
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,240
of one prominent subgenius woman

296
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,680
came charging in and dragged her out of the campground

297
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,980
because he was afraid he was in danger

298
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,700
of losing his exclusivity.

299
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,160
You know, just before we came to the station,

300
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,920
I got online for just a second.

301
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,560
She had already gotten home

302
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,580
and written a two-page report

303
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,260
on that whole drama thing.

304
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,100
A blistering attack on us?

305
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,300
No, no, not at all.

306
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,300
She was disgusted with her boyfriend

307
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,320
and trying really hard to forgive him.

308
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,600
Well, I'm sure she cared.

309
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,720
He just got insecure and thought about

310
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,900
that lovely gal gallivanting around

311
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,820
with the likes of us

312
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,600
and drove five hours.

313
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,820
He was afraid that she was...

314
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,100
In the middle of the night to bird dog that stuff.

315
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,020
He was afraid she was walking around half naked.

316
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,660
But of course he was quite wrong about that.

317
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,620
He was?

318
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,540
Yes, she was completely naked.

319
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,060
In fact, I was given a T-shirt

320
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,620
with a photograph of her topless on it.

321
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,640
And she got one too.

322
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,140
Which, if she had cut holes on either side

323
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,600
of the photograph,

324
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,680
it would look like she had four breasts.

325
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,300
Well, that didn't happen.

326
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,140
Now, we're talking about stangs,

327
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,820
strange degenerate musings and so forth.

328
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,080
You know, I like girls with glasses.

329
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,760
But, you know, we're trying to describe

330
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,380
in a tactful and delicate way

331
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,160
just what did happen.

332
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,140
Oh yeah, girls with glass eyes are great,

333
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,860
especially when they pop them out

334
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,580
at inopportune moments.

335
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,840
Have you ever seen that happen?

336
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,600
Yes.

337
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,220
You have?

338
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:38,680
Yes.

339
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,580
Have you?

340
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,380
They come right out?

341
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,700
I've watched real close, kind of waiting

342
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,180
to see if it might happen.

343
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,200
Oh, I...

344
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,700
Hmm...

345
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,320
You know...

346
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,300
Anyway...

347
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,320
So we talked about the beverages of X-Day,

348
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,120
the X-Day shows and auctions,

349
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,420
the movies, the excitement,

350
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,500
the rain, the endless rain,

351
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,300
more rain, the mud, the water.

352
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,080
We need some goldfish.

353
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,340
We must get some goldfish.

354
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:08,440
And we need some saffron.

355
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,660
It's just like I heard...

356
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,920
This is like I always dreamed X-Day would be.

357
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,960
Whenever they talk about it,

358
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,080
this is just what I envisioned.

359
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,700
They always talk about the torrential downforce.

360
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,940
I thought that was just a cool fantasy,

361
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,720
but it's real, man, it's real.

362
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,260
It's raining water.

363
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,780
It's real.

364
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,000
Mama always told me to wear a tie to such events,

365
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,320
it just makes not having a shirt look ridiculous.

366
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,400
More of those who have the sense to come in out of it.

367
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,460
Reverend Anacron, good to see you.

368
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:44,680
Well, it's the 4th of July, 2013 at 16X Day.

369
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:51,720
And the prophesied torrential downpour is majorly in progress.

370
00:19:52,820 --> 00:20:02,060
Of course, it was timed to arrive exactly when the pig roast was scheduled to be finished and served up to the gathered,

371
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,540
it looks like about 100 subgeniuses.

372
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,120
Luckily, the bar did open up.

373
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,580
And despite the rain, there was enough covering for about 50 subgeniuses to all cram together.

374
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,160
Real tight in the rain.

375
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,400
Here's how it sounds outside.

376
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,460
We're in the car now.

377
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:30,800
It's a flood like in the days of Noah, which I predicted on Facebook yesterday.

378
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:37,380
And we always have a big rainstorm at X Day.

379
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,720
Legendary type of rainstorm.

380
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,700
Like Woodstock or something.

381
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,880
Cars in the mud and naked girls running through the rain.

382
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,780
There's Reverend Capfeather up.

383
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,180
He's still my heart.

384
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,760
And there's Reverend Soot in the rain.

385
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,500
Looking really good in the rain.

386
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,260
It's so wonderful to see all our old friends.

387
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,560
Yes, honey pie.

388
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,240
And the old zombies and bee zombies.

389
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,160
Yes.

390
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,240
That's the drink that eats your brain.

391
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,760
That wants to eat your brain.

392
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,200
We could just sit here and narrate the parade of weirdos and freakazoids that come by.

393
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,660
The parade of wet weirdos.

394
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,400
Most of whom we know.

395
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,940
Wobbling their way.

396
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,740
There's a whole lot of new people.

397
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,340
And wending their way.

398
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,300
So far, all the vibes have been wonderful.

399
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:26,940
Ah-ha.

400
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,040
Ah-ha.

401
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,960
Ah-ha.

402
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,360
Ah-ha.

403
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,040
Oh, ah-ha.

404
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,780
Oh, ah-ha.

405
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,680
Oh, ah-ha.

406
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,880
That's pretty good, huh?

407
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,620
The excitement.

408
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,340
The rain.

409
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,680
The endless rain.

410
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,080
More rain.

411
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,640
The mud.

412
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,460
The water.

413
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,440
There was a lot of sub-step dub genius shows late at night.

414
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,820
Slip and slide in the mud step music.

415
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,140
They brought back the slip and slide this year?

416
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,160
Well, they were.

417
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,060
No, that was actually considered too dangerous.

418
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,800
Did the Kentucky Boys do that?

419
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,040
Did the Kentucky Boys do that?

420
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,040


421
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,040


422
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,840
They're going to make it back this year.

423
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,900
Sub-geniuses have injured themselves in the past.

424
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,400
Yeah, play chicken on it.

425
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,080
Yes, that's right.

426
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,100
I remember very fondly a few years ago,

427
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,740
there was a massive, massive thunderstorm

428
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,940
that lasted all night long.

429
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,600
And they rolled out this just gigantic big tarp

430
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,200
and spilled some soap on it.

431
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,560
That was when Rocknar's 24-hour wife

432
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,220
was part of the festivities as well.

433
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,420
Oh, my gosh.

434
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,480
Oh, my gosh.

435
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,980
You're thinking back, certainly.

436
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,180
Certainly.

437
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,020
The curious thing is that Rocknar's tent

438
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,040
was often deluged with water

439
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,080
no matter how he camped in order to stay dry.

440
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,260
Even when it wasn't raining, it was strange.

441
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,920
He always had bad luck that way.

442
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,240
Well, he got to where he was attributing it to enemies.

443
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,720
And I honestly don't think that anybody

444
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,940
has it in for Rocknar like that.

445
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,080
No, who would pour water into Rocknar's tent?

446
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,380
However, I can easily see Rocknar

447
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,960
being completely incompetent.

448
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,160
Incompetent at erecting the tent right in the first place.

449
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,100
Well, in all fairness, those are tricky things.

450
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,140
You've got all these poles and things

451
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,180
that have to slide through.

452
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,340
The only time they ever leave their house is for X-Day.

453
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,760
It's a miracle that they survive it all.

454
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,980
The miracle of X-Day.

455
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,520
Yes.

456
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,260
More than a miracle.

457
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:28,040
I was really wanting to move it to Las Vegas this week.

458
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,800
Las Vegas had the crippling heat,

459
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,960
the wave that the Midwest got last year.

460
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,100
But it's a dry heat.

461
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,840
It was 119 degrees in Phoenix last week.

462
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,680
How about Tuesday?

463
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,220
I thought we should be having X-Day

464
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,160
on the roof of the Motel 6 in downtown Las Vegas,

465
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,740
right across from the MGM Grand.

466
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,280
Just as long as we can breathe.

467
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
There's a Motel 6 right across the street from the MGM Grand.

468
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,720
How about that?

469
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,380
We stayed there last time, and it's a good Motel 6.

470
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,820
It's decorated like a Jetsons.

471
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,720
It's a Jetsons motel.

472
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,240
It's not a normal motel.

473
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,520
They probably bought some pre-existing thing.

474
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,720
I believe it's the biggest Motel 6 in the world,

475
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,460
and right around the corner is the biggest Super 8 in the world.

476
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,760
I've stayed in both of those.

477
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,680
The Motel 6 is much better and better located.

478
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,400
And the same price as every other Motel 6, about $65.

479
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,220
Why don't they call it Motel 65 bucks for two?

480
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:31,580
And then you've got your Motel 7 and Motel 8 1⁄2,

481
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:38,800
and Motel 7, 2, 11, or 11, 7 stores.

482
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,560
People just don't like to be original.

483
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:44,840
I guess not.

484
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,300
And there's some comfort to them in totally unoriginal names.

485
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,880
There was a very disturbing period there where lots of establishments,

486
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,460
particularly drinking establishments, all had WC Fields-like names,

487
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,760
like Phineas T. Hornswoggle's Alcohol.

488
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,620
There was a Mimporium and so forth.

489
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,460
Yeah, Fuddruckers.

490
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,440
Everywhere you went.

491
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,500
And what was even worse, as far as restaurants were concerned in those days,

492
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:15,700
I observed with a sort of horror that there was a place called Love's.

493
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,560
Did you ever see that?

494
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's a big chain.

495
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,960
More than that, they also had...

496
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,500
Like the diapers?

497
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,020
They also had Wove's.

498
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,360
W-U-V apostrophe S.

499
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,880
That's the one that Elmer Fudd goes to.

500
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,120
It's not the one that I go to.

501
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,720
You know, who are they appealing to there?

502
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,940
Actually, I can think of a type of whorehouse they could have a name.

503
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:40,860
Wove's.

504
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,140
For gumless, toothless, old fellow-trices?

505
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,060
You know, the best thing about the toothless hookers is they can't bite.

506
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,580
Well, no, but they can gum you to death.

507
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,180
Ah, but what a way to go.

508
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,900
I'm talking about restaurants, gentlemen.

509
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,820
Can't you keep your minds out of the gutter?

510
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,840
We're talking about the restaurant industry.

511
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,000
Easy answer there, no.

512
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,220
All right, no, especially after X-Day.

513
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,380
After such sights as we have seen,

514
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,020
the regular world appears gray by comparison

515
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,580
and not tinged with the overall warm colors of eroticism.

516
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,720
You want to hear something sad, Dr. Howell?

517
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,640
I guess.

518
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:26,580
Well, I've got a beat-up old copy of the 16 X-Day brochure with me.

519
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,800
Does it have anything written on the top, like,

520
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,460
to Dr. Howell, with love,

521
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,760
from somebody or other?

522
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,440
No, that's, I, that, I, no.

523
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,320
You have that one?

524
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,100
Because it disappeared.

525
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,080
I might.

526
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,480
Somebody took it.

527
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,460
Your, your pornography?

528
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,080
Yeah, I, uh.

529
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,820
Thought porn?

530
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,900
It weren't thought porn, but it was a nice souvenir of X-Day.

531
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,560
Well, don't stop.

532
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,520
Anyway, okay, here's the sad part.

533
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,040
Okay.

534
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,400
It's got a listing for today, Sunday, July 7th.

535
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,600
Cleanup of wisteria on Stang's escape planet.

536
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,440
Go back to your own home.

537
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,060
On saucers.

538
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,020
Cleanup of remaining humans on Earth.

539
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,640
Starwood Festival will be held starting Tuesday

540
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,940
at Wisteria on Stang's escape planet.

541
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,140
The Grand Canyon, the British Museum,

542
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,380
and other Earth attractions claimed by Stang

543
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,460
will also be open for visits and parties.

544
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,320
That all has to be put off till next year.

545
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,220
I guess so.

546
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,940
Man, I was really hoping to spend the night

547
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,560
in the, in the Carlsbad Caverns tonight.

548
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,300
In a big bed in Carlsbad Caverns.

549
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,420
Yes, no stalagmites poking through.

550
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,000
That dimensional portal I gave you isn't working?

551
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,800
No cave spiders scampering over you.

552
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,960
You know, National Geographic did a big special on tarantulas,

553
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,200
and then their photo essay veered into the giant cave spiders,

554
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,820
and they showed this horrendous-looking spider.

555
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:00,400
The spider in the picture was so flustered by our appearance in the cave

556
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,280
that it ran.

557
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,540
Ran up our photographer and bit him on the hand.

558
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,340
So the spider was flustered, and this thing was huge.

559
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,660
It could easily straddle a large server dinner plate.

560
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,860
But he's blind, right? He's a cave spider.

561
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,480
Not blind enough to find some sap to bite on the hand.

562
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,580
In recent years, new types of spiders, large ones,

563
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,400
considerably large ones have been discovered,

564
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,840
like the giant black and white Israeli spider,

565
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,460
but also giant cave spiders have been discovered.

566
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,420
One is always discovering new discoveries.

567
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:43,380
Oh, when I was a boy, we had giant cave spiders

568
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,320
that could look you right in the eye, standing right there.

569
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,020
And you can look back, but they've got eight eyes.

570
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,300
They can outlook you pretty good.

571
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:57,040
I was always surprised that if you drive in Arizona at night,

572
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,960
on the roads, you see the eyes of spiders glittering back at you.

573
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,660
How is that possible? Because their eyes are so tiny.

574
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,140
But that's what it is.

575
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,520
They reflect the light of your headlights.

576
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,540
And large wolf spiders, you can see from the road by the flashes of light.

577
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,180
And you must know that scorpions are fluorescent,

578
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,680
and if you take a UV light out in the desert and roll it around,

579
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,920
you'll see that you are actually surrounded by thousands of scorpions.

580
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,680
Otherwise, you couldn't see because their bodies fluoresce.

581
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,680
They shine under a fluorescent light.

582
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,440
Did you know that?

583
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:30,980
No.

584
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,560
They do.

585
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,200
I heard that they do not have...

586
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,440
I'm not going to sleep well tonight.

587
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,480
Well, you can just run a fluorescent light near the carpet and see what's down there.

588
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,240
A few X days ago, I remember talking to some people who had come from Oregon,

589
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,900
and they said that they didn't have fireflies out there.

590
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,760
And they were amazed to see all these fireflies all over the place.

591
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,560
We had fireflies where we were coming from.

592
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:55,660
On my way down a couple of years ago, I actually ended up going through,

593
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,740
I was driving probably about 65 miles an hour,

594
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,940
and suddenly I go through...

595
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,760
You know, an orgy of fireflies.

596
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,140
Just a big swarm,

597
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,400
and suddenly my whole windshield was coated in this glowing green stuff.

598
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,240
Firefly.

599
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,500
It doesn't glow after they're dead.

600
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,520
Yes, it does.

601
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,040
It does?

602
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:14,680
Yeah.

603
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,500
No, they just make that little spark,

604
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,900
and it's like a wink every now and then.

605
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,480
It's not electrical.

606
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,720
Yeah, it's a chemical process.

607
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:27,040
They wink because it's a signaling process to the ladies, you see,

608
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,260
but they could beam all the time if they wanted to, but no...

609
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,260
You just haven't killed enough fireflies.

610
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:31,860
No, no, no.

611
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,400
I would pick them up for that.

612
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,760
Show off.

613
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,440
And then, just on the way to the station,

614
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,620
there was a strange white moth in the car.

615
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,080
He's not in the car now.

616
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,480
The very last thing before we came in, I brushed him out.

617
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,340
I thought, what are we...

618
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,720
Maybe that's where the rotten meat smells coming from.

619
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,820
Slay not the moth nor the butterfly.

620
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,000
Moths have been eating beans all day.

621
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,160
For the last judgment, it was not.

622
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,220
Who did I see eating a can of beans at X Day?

623
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,060
I saw some...

624
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:07,980
Some subgenius hunched over, slavering, eating a jaggedly opened can of beans.

625
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,020
Reverend Rorschach.

626
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,160
Was that who that was?

627
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,440
Yeah, Reverend Rorschach.

628
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,120
Never forget it.

629
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,420
Beans.

630
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,780
Human beans.

631
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:15,860
Bean blood.

632
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,880
Of course, as I think I said on the last time we did one of these shows,

633
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,400
beans were sacred to the Pythagoreans.

634
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,040
Well, and pies were sacred to the Beanthagoreans, so it comes full circle.

635
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,800
You're reminding me that there's still a piece of pie in the refrigerator at home.

636
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,700
That's right, the X Day.

637
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:38,480
Every X Day, Princess Wee and Dr. Howell make a cherry pie, usually from cherries picked next door.

638
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,860
Yes, I ate the last of those a few hours ago.

639
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,660
Howell writes, draws an X Day logo.

640
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,140
Yeah, the crust.

641
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,460
The crust is decorated.

642
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:48,760
On the crust.

643
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:56,580
And that photograph of that crust always becomes the title for that X Day souvenir movie

644
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,360
that I always planned to get around to.

645
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,240
It's also well-suited to be...

646
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,240


647
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,540
It's also well-suited to be on the DVD cover inside the jewel box.

648
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,020
Right.

649
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,780
Well, that's a good idea.

650
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,480
That would be great.

651
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,420
Put it on the disc itself, since it's circular.

652
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,640
Wow, yeah, the pie could go around and around.

653
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,560
Yeah.

654
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,520
Mmm, and it smells so good coming out of your CD player.

655
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,220
Better than some smells we've had to deal with.

656
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,800
All right, this song is about a...

657
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,500
Oh, by the way, we are the Slot Rods, in case you didn't know that already.

658
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,200
We are...

659
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,340
We are the Midwest's only scale auto racing band.

660
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,840
There was a cat named Johnny Delmar back in 1965.

661
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,220
He used to race the circuit, slot cars, 124 scale,

662
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,480
just in case anybody's keeping any kind of a track of what these songs are.

663
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,860
Anyway, he was noted as being Johnny Zombie, and that's what this song is about.

664
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:31,220
So, let's get started.

665
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,860
All right.

666
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,700
All right.

667
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
All right.

668
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:33,920


669
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:36,940
All right.

670
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:36,940


671
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:36,940


672
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:36,940


673
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:36,940


674
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:36,940


675
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:36,940


676
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:36,940


677
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:36,940


678
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:36,940


679
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:36,940


680
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:36,940


681
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:36,940


682
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:36,940


683
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,140
Well, so no bugs bit you at all.

684
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,320
You don't have...

685
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,620
Your body isn't seeping with a thousand bites in you.

686
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:51,120
No, but Dr. Howell, you know, I have a lot of good luck, because I don't ask for money

687
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,780
for the work of Bob.

688
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:58,120
If someone even tries to pay me, I just turn it down, shove it away, and because of that...

689
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,940
And so insects turn away from you?

690
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,320
Yes.

691
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:00,500
Yes.

692
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:00,560
Yes.

693
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:00,600
Yes.

694
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:00,700
Yes.

695
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,080
Yes.

696
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,220
Yes.

697
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:01,220


698
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:01,240
Yes.

699
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,080
that preternatural calm

700
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,760
that I'm so famous for always having.

701
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,860
The effusion of a holy man,

702
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,640
which is also called darsham.

703
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,360
Only holy men exude this.

704
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,200
Man, I've got buckets full of that stuff.

705
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,800
You've got darsham like...

706
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,980
I've got it coming out the kazoo.

707
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,220
It's a good insect repeller.

708
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:20,540
I was going to ask you about that.

709
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,200
Do you know anything that's good for that?

710
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,820
The darsham coming out the keister and the kazoo?

711
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,460
That should keep you from being parasitized

712
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,780
by kazoo worms.

713
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,900
So far, so good.

714
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:37,740
And you did keep crows and other varmints

715
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,500
out of your house with that scarecrow that's in there.

716
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,660
Right.

717
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,960
Dr. Howell, we were both staying in the same bed and breakfast

718
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,440
under the auspices of the same witch.

719
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,320
Yes.

720
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,640
So how come you got covered with bugs?

721
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,240
Witch, witch?

722
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,640
We were staying with a witch, yes.

723
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,760
And bugs did get into my...

724
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,980
bed at night.

725
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,320
First, I was wearing a t-shirt

726
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,300
and they crawled up the sleeve

727
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,140
into my armpit and I was unable

728
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,080
to make a species identification.

729
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,520
So I swore loudly.

730
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,600
I tore off the shirt and threw it on the floor.

731
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,720
The next thing I knew,

732
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,820
they were between the sheets crawling on my naked body.

733
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,180
See, but none of them bit you, right?

734
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,520
They just wanted to snuggle.

735
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,100
That was the charm of the witch's power.

736
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,280
Made sure that none of those bugs

737
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,260
would actually harm you.

738
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,460
They just wanted to snuggle.

739
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,700
And so I could pick them up and throw them out of the room.

740
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,320
Which I did.

741
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,040
And this was the sweetest witch.

742
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,980
She's great.

743
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,400
She's just the nicest witch.

744
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,060
Oh, she gave us the most marvelous treats.

745
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,680
And her house is apparently made out of candy

746
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,780
and edible materials also.

747
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,180
And there's this big oven.

748
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,720
I was going to say,

749
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,600
the beds were kind of uncomfortable though, right?

750
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:48,900
It was.

751
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,280
That oven made you want to crawl into it.

752
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,080
Yeah, she let us get baked in there too.

753
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,080
Yeah, we got baked, all right.

754
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,680
Just like four of us.

755
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,740
Four and 20 blackbirds in a pie.

756
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,160
Exactly.

757
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,900
Princess, we is still there.

758
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,020
That's why she's not here.

759
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,200
She's probably getting there.

760
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:06,960
Someone's got to hold down the fort.

761
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,200
Saving Starwood, saving Starwood.

762
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,960
She said she'd call or might call.

763
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,980
I wonder if anybody can call.

764
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,400
Some of our best people.

765
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,380
We can get a caller here.

766
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,820
We've got, looks like Lonesome Cowboy Dave calling in here.

767
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,440
Well, what did I say?

768
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,480
One of our best people.

769
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,620
Welcome back.

770
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,340
Welcome to the end of the world that didn't happen.

771
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,960
Oh, well, what can we do?

772
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,300
Maybe it started.

773
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,620
Maybe it takes a long time to end a world.

774
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,780
A world is a big thing.

775
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,000
Rome wasn't built in a day.

776
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,480
The first crevice occurred at X-Day.

777
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,860
The entire shoddy structure will crumble and implode.

778
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,980
Like Samson had his hair plucked out and his follicles were reduced to chicken weather.

779
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,220
He's like Samson, you know.

780
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,780
Mighty Samson.

781
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,060
Oh, jeez.

782
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,240
I just hit the wrong button there.

783
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,140
Goat cheese?

784
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,560
Dave, call back.

785
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,260
You can call back if you want.

786
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,280
I just accidentally hung up on him.

787
00:37:59,280 --> 00:37:59,700
I can't believe it.

788
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,600
I was playing with this little sign on the side of the buttons here.

789
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,760
My thumb knuckle hit the draw button.

790
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,080
Like, I don't need any attention.

791
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,540
Well, you can save the excuses for the court of inquiry.

792
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:10,620
Possibly.

793
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,940
No excuses, only explanations.

794
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,140
Yes.

795
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,480
All right.

796
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,080
Welcome back.

797
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,200
We're back on the X-Day planation.

798
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:16,760
No, I did that.

799
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,140
I'm sorry.

800
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:18,900
I'm sorry.

801
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,920
Yeah, my fault.

802
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,100
Okay, the apologies are now concluded.

803
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,780
No, I'm sorry.

804
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,320
So sorry, Gaston.

805
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,140
No, I'm even sorrier, Alphonse.

806
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,380
We're all sorry.

807
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,100
I'm used to apologies.

808
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,320
Apologizing for my hang-ups.

809
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,980
We're sorry excuses for seeing you.

810
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,520
Don't apologize, mister.

811
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,860
It's a sign of weakness.

812
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,020
Never apologize for your awesomeness.

813
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,260
We were sitting around in a sweat lodge together thinking of what to do with that.

814
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:40,840
What keeps you?

815
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,960
Hey, the whole place was a sweat lodge.

816
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,820
No, it wasn't that hot this time.

817
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,660
Oh, there was still some heat.

818
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,080
It wasn't like last time, though.

819
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:55,220
Last time was a freakish thermal phenomenon of intense heat.

820
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,220
A hundred degrees in many parts.

821
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,460
What made it worse was the dew point was so high.

822
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,320
You mean low.

823
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,280
The dew-dew point was low.

824
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,960
Yeah, the dew point was low, man.

825
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,360
We never even reached the dew point last year.

826
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,460
It would become even more humid at night.

827
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:11,960
Oh, my.

828
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:12,880
Oh, how terrible.

829
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,820
Oh, that's awful.

830
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,880
It rained continuously here, too, didn't it, Dr. Sinister?

831
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,100
40 days and 40 nights.

832
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:19,760
Not continuously.

833
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,220
That's the thing.

834
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:28,020
Dr. Howe keeps acting like it never stopped raining, but people only pay attention to the bad news.

835
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,840
Yeah, well, that's true.

836
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,480
Well, you don't talk about when it was sunny and breezy.

837
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,340
Yeah, when it was sunny and breezy, I had to work, and when it was time to knock off, the rain was dripping and falling.

838
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,240
No, I planned it that way.

839
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:39,520
Oh.

840
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,280
We like to keep our actors close to the studio.

841
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,740
You know, they party too much at night.

842
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,180
Oh, the actors' studio now.

843
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,540
Okay, I'll agree with that, then.

844
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,560
I still managed to get one splashy session in at the pond.

845
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,720
And most memorable it was.

846
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:13,140
Okay, uh, Reverend Mountain Boy, Reverend Robin Mountain Boy, do you have any confessions you need to make, perhaps, before?

847
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:13,620
Oh, boy.

848
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,140
That would take a long time.

849
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,960
You'll renounce the conspiracy and all its works.

850
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,700
We'll just hold those in your mind and kind of puke a little in your mouth when you go under.

851
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,620
And do something up in your mind and repel the conspiracy and so forth.

852
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,740
Hold your nose and say, I do.

853
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,240
I do.

854
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:28,820
Praise God.

855
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:28,820


856
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:28,820


857
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:28,820


858
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:28,980
It's Bob!

859
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:29,620
Hooray!

860
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,080
Thanks, athletes.

861
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,920
A beautiful Bob Tessa.

862
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,900
God Almighty.

863
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,280
Thank you.

864
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,160
Reverend Abner, I'm not here.

865
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,560
I'll hold it.

866
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,800
Step forward.

867
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,180
We'll use it.

868
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:43,560
We'll use it.

869
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,600
For the 18th time or so?

870
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,760
No, it was my first time doing this one.

871
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,140
Is it really?

872
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,560
Yeah, I never made it to them before.

873
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,140
Wow.

874
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,460
Yep.

875
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,200
Well, you're here now.

876
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:50,660
That's what I am.

877
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,760
Well, it's about time.

878
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:51,940
Yep.

879
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,540
Because I can smell the sin of peakness wafting off of you.

880
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,780
So I'm going to wash you quick.

881
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,420
Goodbye.

882
00:40:59,300 --> 00:40:59,980
That's it.

883
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,240
You don't have to come up.

884
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,860
Be reborn unto Bob and all of that.

885
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,720
And buoyant unto Bob.

886
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,140
Yes.

887
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,240
Buoyant unto Bob.

888
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,680
Oh, the Dr. Design flaw.

889
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,440
He's got so much sin on him.

890
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:14,900
I have got.

891
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,540
I just woke up out of a blackout.

892
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,360
Where am I?

893
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,920
Now we are kin in sin.

894
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,420
I know the feeling.

895
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,440
Another new one to be.

896
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:27,060
We'll have, this pond will have all new sins floating around and reproducing and splitting

897
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,040
and dividing.

898
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:28,820
You're going to be a new person.

899
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:28,820


900
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:28,820


901
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:28,820


902
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:28,820


903
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:28,820


904
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:28,820


905
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,300
So, you're going to send your son to a very old place.

906
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:30,300


907
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,100
You're going to send your son to a very old place.

908
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,920
Oh, my God.

909
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:34,780
That's the best way to get rid of that sin.

910
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:34,780


911
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:34,780


912
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:34,780


913
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:34,780


914
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:34,780


915
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,500
See how easy it is, how liberating.

916
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:46,400
Really, our Bob-tism was classic this year and we've got an excellent audio of it which

917
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,220
will eventually be heard.

918
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,000
Oh, I'll cut it down to about five minutes.

919
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,060
Of all this splashing and squealing and so on.

920
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,120
That's one of those, you had to have been there things.

921
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,480
Yeah.

922
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,660
I always take 30 minutes of X-Day tittering and cut it down.

923
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:07,240
When I'm finished editing, I like to think people go, man, they're so funny and fast.

924
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,280
I must go there.

925
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,200
Everyone sounds like they're having so much fun.

926
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:13,340
And, of course, with skillful editing, it's like a magician's trick.

927
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,180
Just like the previews for a movie.

928
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,660
They show every good scene in the one- or two-minute trailer.

929
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,120
And then you feel you've already seen the movie.

930
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,720
The next 25 hours of Slack will be exactly that.

931
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,700
Trailers for the next X-Day.

932
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,140
Snippets and tidbits of X-Day.

933
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,920
And we'll be hearing Reverend Baby Bear as a guest on a couple of shows.

934
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,680
That's right.

935
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,420
She was sitting right next to me.

936
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,920
I tricked Reverend Susie the Floozy into doing a show.

937
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:41,840
Yes.

938
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,060
She did one show with us and Baby Bear, but she was being kind of horsey about it.

939
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,060
She was trying hard not to do a good show.

940
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,880
Yes, we were playing horsey.

941
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,000
But I tricked her.

942
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:56,240
I tricked her into doing a good show later on by telling her that no one could hear us, which is true.

943
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,300
I was the only one that could hear us.

944
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,220
It was my headphones.

945
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,900
And I didn't even have headphones.

946
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,540
You weren't allowed on that show.

947
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,120
Yeah, that's true.

948
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,940
That's why I didn't have headphones.

949
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,900
It's so hard to be divided by those forces.

950
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,100
You know, those preternatural forces.

951
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,080
You're out there in the wilderness 3,000 miles from anybody, civilized humans.

952
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,280
There aren't very many of those to begin with.

953
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,920
It was pretty rugged out there.

954
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,100
The nearest Kroger must have been...

955
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,060
It's been 20 minutes away.

956
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,120
My God.

957
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,220
Speaking of Kroger's, there was an interesting phenomenon.

958
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:34,360
When the power outrage happened and the Mountain Boys were doing their set in Caffeinas,

959
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:40,880
when they harmonized, there was a huge frog that started singing at the same moment.

960
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,580
And it loved their harmony.

961
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,300
So when they would sing, it would be going...

962
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,440
And it sounded like it was right there in the building.

963
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,380
But when they stopped or when they were just talking in between sets,

964
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,160
it would be silent.

965
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,920
But the moment they were starting to sing again, you'd hear this...

966
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,080
Sound.

967
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,520
It'll be on my recording.

968
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,840
It may be because he was loud and he was so close.

969
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,440
He sounded like he was in there.

970
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,240
And they were talking.

971
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:02,740
The band...

972
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,040
Are you sure it wasn't one of the band?

973
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,520
No, the band were talking about it and saying, I guess he likes our music.

974
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,980
Or maybe they just hit that magic.

975
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,900
Wasn't there a bishop bastard guy that almost got thrown out each...

976
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,740
There's always some guy...

977
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,660
I don't know.

978
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,300
Almost gets thrown out every night.

979
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,020
It's a realistic frog.

980
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,740
Sound effect that can fool me.

981
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,860
This sounded authentic.

982
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,620
It just sounded extremely close.

983
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,300
And it sounded so close that it was in the building.

984
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,620
Where are the Mutant Mountain Boys?

985
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,600
From everywhere.

986
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,120
There's a little boy in everyone.

987
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,500
A little girl in everyone.

988
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,760
No pun intended.

989
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,160
Where are you from?

990
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,260
All over the place.

991
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:50,820
All over the country.

992
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:57,360
It's kind of like somebody took bluegrass, put some C4 under it,

993
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,540
and it exploded all over the United States,

994
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,340
sending a chunk to Arizona, a chunk to New Jersey, and a chunk to Cleveland.

995
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:16,180
And then we've got to do that whole, like, genetic ooze, tendrils and magnets.

996
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,780
How the fuck do magnets work anyway?

997
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,520
Now it can be told.

998
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,240
What does that say?

999
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:28,680
Watermelon?

1000
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:29,760
What?

1001
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,500
I don't know.

1002
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:31,880
It's on.

1003
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,080
Just miss it.

1004
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,100
Yeah, yeah.

1005
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,240
Tree frogs.

1006
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,920
Ladies and gentlemen, tree frogs, the backup singers.

1007
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,980
Tear it up for the tree frogs.

1008
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1009
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:49,940


1010
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,600
We love the tree frogs.

1011
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,800
They're my favorite band.

1012
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:20,360
We love the tree frogs.

1013
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,020
And I'm forwarding back to Alabama.

1014
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,760
I want to like to take advantage of the shadier inです but open a crown

1015
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:27,760


1016
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:27,760


1017
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,820
When did we see you fat?

1018
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:29,880
цы

1019
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,900
What do you do in particular?

1020
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:07,380
I have realized just what it means to live with your sacred new process.

1021
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,120
The whole world can't control the innocence of your life.

1022
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,040
Most life's losses may just assign.

1023
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:21,360
But a feast doesn't come if you're being yourself.

1024
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,720
So repent and you're on and out of time.

1025
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,220
When you see a sauce and find a good home,

1026
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,800
and you're left out of the future,

1027
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,440
there are supplies you have to take.

1028
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,640
Never pray, hold it back.

1029
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,100
When you see those flying saucers,

1030
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,040
you're coming out of a judgment day.

1031
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,420
Never pray, hold it back.

1032
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,940
When you see those flying saucers,

1033
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,720
repent and you better start to pray.

1034
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:13,640
There's no silence, no battle, no trouble, that's all that we need.

1035
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,360
We've become another judgment day.

1036
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:43,160
We've become another Shagga Constancy,

1037
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,720
our faith, and we've been the work of God.

1038
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,500
Every word is sacred and dear to the hearts of all.

1039
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,660
I have made my living and I'm proud to be your friend,

1040
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,020
responsible for what makes me who I am.

1041
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:54,320
You make my life precious.

1042
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,500
I am so blessed.

1043
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:55,660
Thank you.

1044
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,820
That's all we can say.

1045
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,300
I'm making febrile fantasies.

1046
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:00,740
Oh, you're okay.

1047
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,100
It's okay.

1048
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:01,900
It's okay, Hal.

1049
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,460
You're making it sound like it's all real.

1050
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,320
Speaking of febrile fantasies.

1051
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:05,760
Everything's going to be fine, Hal.

1052
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,040
Everything's going to be fine.

1053
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:07,080
It's okay.

1054
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,940
If you say so, Ivan Stang.

1055
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,500
The head of my order.

1056
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,400
My master, Ivan Stang.

1057
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,580
So I must believe what I am told.

1058
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:25,460
J.R. Bob Dobbs and his parasitic double-mean baby head twin, Dick Dobbs.

1059
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,740
I wish we hadn't found out about that one, too.

1060
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,540
The field boss.

1061
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,680
Just a messenger.

1062
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,700
J.R. Bob Dobbs is in charge.

1063
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:37,220
Well, J.R. Bob Dobbs may be in charge, but he's not one to delegate authority.

1064
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,460
Certainly not.

1065
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,540
I have to agree with that.

1066
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:45,780
I've asked numerous times of entities that I've known to be close to Bob,

1067
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,320
and none of them have ever come through, and neither has he.

1068
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:55,600
We have seen Bob thrown out of windows, stabbed, shot, burned, and he's always back.

1069
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,000
And that was just at one party.

1070
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:57,720
Like the four of us.

1071
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,760
A Frankenstein monster.

1072
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,040
He always returns.

1073
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:04,820
He pops up again as springs the trampled herbage of the field.

1074
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,500
He rears his ugly head.

1075
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,800
Just as spring conquers winter every year.

1076
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,220
It's actually rather handsome in appearance.

1077
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:22,180
And we know this for sure since we have uncovered the actual photographic evidence of the actual living, fleshy Dobbs.

1078
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,060
Yeah, and of course, guys, it's not gay if it's Bob.

1079
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,260
Whew.

1080
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,120
Whew.

1081
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,280
This is Phil Proctor.

1082
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,160
And David Osman.

1083
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,120
Of the Firesign Theater.

1084
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:37,300
And we're enjoying listening to the Hour of Slag.

1085
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,020
I'm slacking off myself.

1086
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,400
Are y'all excited?

1087
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,680
I do this every year, so some of you guys should know I play along.

1088
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,360
It's a typical call and response.

1089
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,620
You guys have voices.

1090
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:58,920
You're ready?

1091
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,260
Yeah.

1092
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,520
Praise Bob.

1093
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,840
Praise Bob.

1094
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:04,880
Praise Bob.

1095
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,180
Praise Bob.

1096
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,220
Fuck those pigs.

1097
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,520
Fuck those pigs.

1098
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,700
Fuck those pigs.

1099
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,800
Fuck those pigs.

1100
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,020
Good job.

1101
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,400
I think you can be a little louder.

1102
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,440
So we'll try this again.

1103
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,140
I want to make sure that the whole campground can hear you.

1104
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,080
You ready?

1105
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,640
Let's try it one more time.

1106
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,140
Praise Bob.

1107
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,400
Praise Bob.

1108
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:27,700
Praise Bob.

1109
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,680
Praise Bob.

1110
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,820
Praise Bob.

1111
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:30,960
Fuck those pigs.

1112
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,280
Fuck those pigs.

1113
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,480
Fuck those pigs.

1114
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,620
Fuck those pigs.

1115
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:35,240
Fuck those pigs.

1116
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,340
Do it better.

1117
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,000
This one's going to be a little harder.

1118
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,900
You'll have to work on your enunciation.

1119
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,960
Maybe a little diction.

1120
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,680
Haha, I didn't say that.

1121
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,400
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1122
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,940
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1123
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,700
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1124
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,120
Excellent.

1125
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,020
Let's try that one more time.

1126
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,880
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1127
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:09,260
Excellent.

1128
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,540
Glad to see you guys are into it.

1129
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,320
As Stan said, welcome to Hex Day.

1130
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,740
There's some of my, uh...

1131
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,860
Some of my inner New York favorite here.

1132
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,640
How you all feeling?

1133
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1134
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1135
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1136
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1137
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1138
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1139
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1140
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1141
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1142
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1143
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1144
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1145
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1146
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1147
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1148
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1149
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1150
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1151
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1152
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,680


1153
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:27,980
How you feeling tonight?

1154
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,720
Do you feel good?

1155
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,180
Do you feel slack?

1156
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,660
Tell me how slack you feel.

1157
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,100
Excellent.

1158
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,100
Alright.

1159
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,340
Let's get this show underway.

1160
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:57,660
Alright.

1161
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:57,660


1162
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:57,660


1163
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:57,660


1164
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:57,660


1165
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:57,660


1166
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:57,660


1167
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:57,660


1168
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:57,660


1169
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:57,660


1170
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:04,320
Well, I don't know if we have anything more to say about X-Day, except that I really appreciated the way everybody who was there acted.

1171
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,880
There were a few bad actors.

1172
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,960
Everyone was nice, especially nice to me, Dr. Hal.

1173
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,680
I don't know what was operating there, but they...

1174
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:21,520
My favorite guy was the one who came up and said, I'm a real Bobby, and I'm going to prove it.

1175
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,020
And he started handing out $20 bills.

1176
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,800
He handed me $20 bills.

1177
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,060
I was sitting with my drink, nursing my drink.

1178
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:31,200
I definitely picked the wrong year to skip X-Day.

1179
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,620
He crossed the circle and he stuffed a $20 bill in my pocket.

1180
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,480
What's this for?

1181
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,680
You know, you wouldn't say.

1182
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,060
People passing out money.

1183
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:38,420
It was so funny.

1184
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,700
Remember Reverend Quasar and mention him on the show and accept him.

1185
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,140
Right.

1186
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:43,880
Reverend Quasar.

1187
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,340
Let's give a gob of one of us.

1188
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,860
Reverend Quasar did that.

1189
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,620
A most holy, holy man.

1190
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,360
This was the first time he ever appeared at X-Day.

1191
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,420
He really got into it.

1192
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,000
He shaved his head and he gave me money.

1193
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,820
So Reverend Glitch Nefferson walked up and handed me a $100 bill.

1194
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:05,700
And I turned around and handed it to Dr. Howell because I had been so rich.

1195
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,040
I had to hold it for Ivan because, you know, there was a strong wind.

1196
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,860
It might have been blown away.

1197
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,000
Did you hold it between your knees?

1198
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:18,300
I held it in a very good private spot.

1199
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,980
Can I hold it while you run water through it?

1200
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,500
I'm holding it right now.

1201
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,280
But.

1202
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,500
I don't know how we get off of this conversational byway.

1203
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,920
I have no idea either.

1204
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,640
Yes, it is.

1205
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,960
We can channel our inner philo here.

1206
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,920
We're running out of time for this segment of the program, though.

1207
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:40,240
Out of time.

1208
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:40,920
Oh, thank God.

1209
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,260
All right.

1210
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,720
So you've heard X-Day was fun and you were all saps for not coming.

1211
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,540
See, you should have.

1212
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,320
It would have been great.

1213
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,680
You could have been with us in the pond and elsewhere.

1214
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:54,320
And instead you stayed in Tucson because you heard it was too hot.

1215
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,140
It was stereo.

1216
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1217
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,340
What happened in Tucson?

1218
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,400
Last year it was unseasonably hot.

1219
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:12,180
And so everyone got the idea that was stereo was some baking hellhole where it was always too hot for human life, like the Congo Basin.

1220
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:19,420
But that was just just an aberration of a local person or one who lives in Ohio.

1221
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,140
And this is that the same river.

1222
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:24,880
And Baby Bear told me that the heat last year was unnatural.

1223
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:25,780
Natural.

1224
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,020
Yes, very much so.

1225
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:35,060
There was we had a derecho come through and rendered that whole three three state area into a disaster zone.

1226
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:40,520
I thought I was talking about the original derecho and the three stooges before it was Larry Curley and Moe.

1227
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,820
No, that was Snow White.

1228
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:42,640
Los derechos humanos.

1229
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,420
Los derechos humanos.

1230
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:51,380
And then I took my special pins and I drew special tattoos on many of the subgeniates there.

1231
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:54,120
Dr. Howell is a hound dog.

1232
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,500
Oh, and he knows how to.

1233
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,840
Providing art for the masses.

1234
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:05,280
Cobb walked up to the the big house and came in and there Dr. Howell had the prettiest girl at X Day looking at his etchings.

1235
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,000
You have to ask him if they want to look at your etchings.

1236
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:09,820
No, they.

1237
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,400
Yeah, that happened.

1238
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:11,740
All right.

1239
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,340
They're not really etchings, but it's his.

1240
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:14,640
His.

1241
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,180
I kind of.

1242
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,720
It's kind of a scrapbook or sketchbook.

1243
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,680
Yeah, it's a sketchbook.

1244
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,000
Full of art.

1245
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,120
It's a sketchy business.

1246
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,320
Come up here and look at my etchings, young lady.

1247
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,240
This was all prearranged.

1248
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:24,460
Uh.

1249
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,840
You knew nothing about it.

1250
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,000
It was all supposed to happen.

1251
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:34,680
But when I see you in a smoking jacket, I have all these illusions of of old plays like Our Town and Not Our Town.

1252
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:43,280
Well, if we just use ashtrays and put the smoking materials out in ashtrays, there are jackets would not smoke when we cram them into the pockets.

1253
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:52,180
But I fear we are now out of time and our little bit of time to expound on X Day has been characteristically wasted.

1254
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:52,840
That's right.

1255
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,380
Heff.

1256
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:54,360
Yep.

1257
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,940
Well, hey, there's always next time.

1258
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,540
The church.

1259
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,260
Well, guys, I want to thank you very much for your presence here in the studio.

1260
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:01,980
It's always a pleasure.

1261
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,160
Dr. Handel and Debra.

1262
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,580
We'll be back next day.

1263
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:05,560
That's right.

1264
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,320
And thank you.

1265
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,400
Lonesome Cowboy Dave for your call.

1266
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,520
Thank you very much for your call.

1267
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:13,820
And the owls we wish to commend for their hoots.

1268
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:18,500
Are you going to resume the hooting owls of non-Gahooly of Ohio?

1269
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:20,980
It was a.

1270
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:22,420
I'm sorry.

1271
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:22,900
I'm sorry.

1272
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:23,440
I'm sorry.

1273
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:23,900
I'm sorry.

1274
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,060
I'm sorry.

1275

The end is nigh

1285
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:33,000
The geeks will fry

00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,900
Cause the end is nigh

1287
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,700
The fogs will shift to space

Get us the hell out of this place

Right?

1290
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,000
Let's hear some of that saucer roar noise

1291
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,740
to remind us what we're looking for.

1292
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:15,100
Hear the engines rumble.

1293
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,420
Let's hear some of that saucer roar noise.

1294
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,220
Sex goddess is squaking in the background.

1295
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,840
So let's introduce ourselves.

1296
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,720
Laying down the bottom edge.

1297
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,660
Give it up for Bishop Stick.

1298
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,120
Give it up for Bishop Stick.

00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:50,220

Give it up for Shaw.

01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,900
And bang the leg in the back here.

01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,180
All right, give it up for Avery Larry.

1304
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,360
And recording everything for Posterity.

1305

Let's give it up for the sacred scribe.

1306
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,960
I'm a tank.

1307
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:45,860
I'm uh a man.

1308
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,120
piteroigu May I?

1309
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,240
You know this whole body is rain

1310
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:53,240


1311
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:53,500
Now you in this áreas

1312
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:53,500

01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:53,880
Have we got Wolfman maaaan

1314
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:53,880


1315
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:53,880


1316
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:53,880


1317
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:53,880


1318
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:53,880


1319
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:53,880


1320
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:53,880


1321
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:53,880


1322
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:53,880


1323
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:53,880


1324
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:53,880


1325
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:03,940
The princess is a creature of antiquity, 10 million years at least in age.

1326
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,280
Sire, there is no more money.

1327
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,720
We gotta get some money.

1328
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,920
That dirty Turkish archipelago,

1329
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:30,540
friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1330
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:36,800
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1331
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,840
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1332
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,340
But if you truly love Bob,

1333
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,900
and want some of that slack back to rebound,

1334
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:48,700
T-Series,

1335
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,880
you should go to subgenius.com,

1336
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,420
front page, or especially the radio page,

1337
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,420
or the catalog store pages,

1338
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:59,700
and help out financially as best you can.

1339
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:04,100
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1340
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,740
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1341
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:10,680
But some of you still have jobs.

1342
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:14,020
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1343
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,040
even if it's only once a month,

1344
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,580
from enough of you.

1345
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,700
Fifty bucks?

1346
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:19,980
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1347
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,300
All we're saying is that

1348
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:28,760
glow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1349
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,360
We also take checks and money orders to

1350
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,240
Subgenius Foundation.

01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:46,720
