I have all the characteristics of a human being.
Flesh, blood, skin, hair.
But not a single clear identifiable emotion.
Except for greed and disgust.
Something horrible is happening inside of me.
And I don't know why.
Christmas makes me feel emotional.

Have you ever wondered what it would have been like if the baby Jesus were born today?
Now? Maybe even this year?
What do you think it would be like if it was all being reported to us by the television and radio media that we hear and watch every day?
It might go something like this.
I'm an old man and I've seen lots of Christmases come and go and they're never white and it's raining again and again and again and again and again and again and...
Again! Again! Again! Again!
Christmas is a-coming the geese are getting fast
Please put a penny in the old man's hat
If you haven't got a penny, a hay penny will do
If you haven't got a hay penny, then God bless you.
God bless you gentlemen, God bless you
If you haven't got a cape and even God bless you
Christmas is a come and go gal for Twinkle Elf
Making Christmas dinner at all by himself
If he hasn't got a filter tip, a ball of dung will do
If he hasn't got a dung ball, he's got some curly shoes
God bless Twinkle Elf, God bless me
Your Christmas shoes are curly and furry as can be
God bless you gentlemen, God bless you
If you haven't got a turkey leg, then God bless you
We all as children grew up dreaming of having, doing, wearing
What Barbie has, Barbie has it all
Barbie is a prop
For everyone to dream through
Barbie changed the course of womanhood
She could have all sorts of adventures
She could get in a car and drive away
She could even get into her own home
Barbie is a prop for all of us
She could have all sorts of adventures
She can get into a car and drive away
Barbie actually drove away
A little bit faster, but she's doing like a migrant

Barbie is a snowbreaer
Thank you.

I was down in the holler as the story thickens
Old Bob Dog stole my gallon twenty chickens
And I wore their chickens back
I chased old Bob through the field into the mall
I pointed my shotgun and he began to crawl
I said I want them chickens back
I said I want them chickens back
Bob told me, boy, I'll have your chickens back at noon
But the aliens took your gal, she sucked right like a prune
And I didn't bring her chickens back
When I caught up with Bob, he was eating chicken pie
He was eating chicken pie

He had piles of bones reaching to the sky
And I'll never get my chickens back
I said I want them chickens back
I said I want them chickens back
That dare not speak its name

The monitors are good
for they have shown us
how right and proper
our own form of government
actually is.
As the Lord spoke to Job
out of the whirlwind,
so do voices seem to be
speaking to us
now and in our day
telling us
not to abjure
our own government
all whole.
Believe in our traditions
and night will once again
as it inevitably must
give way to the rosy dawn.

I can't believe
I danced naked with a turkey.
I got stuffing everywhere.
I didn't mean to throw up
in the children's hair.
And I'm sorry I shot your dog.
But at the time my mind was in a fog.
I went from poor to punch.
Then I had a cup of rosy wine.
Guess I had a drop too much.
Cause when I woke up I was busy and blind.
Wish I hadn't burned your house to the ground.
But the Christmas season always comes.

And it always gets me down.
So darling if you're free in the new year.
Maybe we can go out

Manic depression
is touching my soul.
I know what I want.
What I just don't know.
I gotta go out again.
Feelin.
Sweet feeling, drips from my fingers, my fingers
Burning depression is caching my soul
Woman, so hot, sweet cold and rain
We make love, we break love, it's all the same, it's over
Music, sweet music, I wish I could caress, caress
Burning depression is a frustrating mess
But if we keep hoping without a break
You're really not here
Music, sweet music, it's pieces of cake
I'm looking for you, but whom are you looking for
When the sickness sea freezes
Music is another day
I think I'm gonna kill myself
I'm going down, I'm going down, down, down, down
There really ain't no use in me
Staying in, hanging around
I gotta get out
Music, sweet music
I wish I could kiss
And if depression is a frustrated mess
Yeah, a frustrated mess
Music, sweet music
Music, sweet music

And before that, Manic Depression,
the Hendrix song by Retaliation.
I thought that would be good for those holiday blues.
Thanks to Pope S. Lilith for forwarding that
and other music we've been playing at times.
Mr. Sister posted the monitor clips.
And we don't know who did the drunken Christmas song,
but the scary Frosty the Snowman
was by Lovecraft Technologies
from Unmutated Christmas.
But now, friends,
well,
we got this interesting CD in the mail
from someone named Sherry Elf.
And I thought this would be a perfect time
to play this song by Sherry Elf
from her debut CD,
Forcing Goodness Upon You.
Jesus came up to me in the parking lot
of the hardware store today.
He said,
you look kind of lost in there.
Could you use some help?
I told him no thank you.
And I got into my car.
But as I drove away,
I said to myself,
S? Elf?
You've waited all your life
for someone to notice how lost you look.
Now you refuse help from Jesus
of all people.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Yes, I'm lost.
And I could use some help.
I just was not expecting you there
in the parking lot
of the hardware store.
You know, I'm kicking myself
and my thoughts are full of
what would have happened
if I would have taken you up on your offer.
But now it's too late.
I'll wait and send you away.
If I know Jesus,
He's still out there.
He's canvassing all of the parking lots
of all of the hardware stores
of these great United States.
And He won't stop there.
Soon you'll find Him in the parking lots
of all of the hardware stores
of all of North and South America.
And then He'll migrate
over to Europe and Africa and China.
Wait, do they have hardware stores in China?
And do they have parking lots?
Well, knowing Jesus,
that won't stop Him.
You have to have your act together pretty good to be the Son of God.
Jesus, yes I'm lost, and I could still use some help.
But I think from now on you should wear a t-shirt or a button that says,
Jesus, Son of God.
Jesus, your understated approach took me by surprise.
I thought you were talking hardware, but no, you were talking eternal life and salvation.
I'm still regretting how in my haste I sent you away.
This song goes out to Jesus.
Wherever you are.
Wherever he may be wandering.
For his untiring perseverance in soliciting unsuspecting shoppers
there in the parking lots of all of the hardware stores of this great earth.
Jesus, we love you, and we respect your clever new marketing strategy.
Jesus, it's so lost, but I feel the problem is resolving itself.
From now on my eyes and ears are open, and I'm much more prepared to meet saviors and sons of God
while I am shopping in hardware stores.
But not only hardware stores, wherever I shop.
Wherever I am, I look deeply into the eyes of my fellow earthlings, and I look for Jesus.
Jesus, yes I'm lost, but I'm feeling a little better.
I still like the idea of a t-shirt or a button.
Some of us are a little preoccupied, and we need to see a label.
Jesus, oh Jesus.
Oh Jesus.

Jesus, oh Jesus.
Jesus, oh Jesus.
Have you seen Jesus today?
Uh, yes, that was Sherry Elf.
Wasn't that pretty or something?
She's distributed by herself.
Her debut CD, Forcing Goodness Upon You,
is available only from her, but here's a website and address.
That's www.SherryElf.com,
which is spelled S-H-A-R-I-E-L-F,
SherryElf.com, or Sherry Elf, P.O. Box 3585, Kansas City, Kansas 6, 6102.
The music in the background is by Mark Mothersbaugh
from his Christmas album special, Joyo Mutato,
and now, Reverend Sheldon DeWare.
Jesus loves me, this I know,
cause my preacher tells me so.
If I argue, he'll use his tongue,
till I scream out,
Yes, I'm wrong!
Oh God, I'm a sinner, I repent,
just make him stop!
Oh!

Work for peace.

nothing. The monitors bring peace. Peace brings happiness.
I want a blow-up top for Christmas. I want a girl like Kenny Flame. I saw one like I
want in the girly magazine. The one that I had between my mattress and box screens.
I want a blow-up top for Christmas. Hurry up Santa, I can't wait. I want a blow-up top
for Christmas. Cause I know that she'll be the perfect mate. She must be heavy duty.
To Reese's wear and tear. She'll come with a special set of sexy underwear. I'll dress
her like a hooker. Then dress her for the prom. Then let her air out folder.
And hide her from my mom.
She won't talk so I won't have to call her on the phone. I won't have to comb her hair because it's printed on. Her lips will be shaped like an O and painted on.
I'll have to hide her from my friends. She'll be a real airhead.
I want a blow-up top for Christmas. I want a girl with vinyl flesh. She must have a pretty face. Up above her neck. The rest of her body must be anatomically correct.
I want a blow-up top for Christmas. I think I'll call her Judy. You're best. I think I'll call her Judy. You're best.
I wanna blow up all for Christmas
Cause real girls, they scare me half to death
Look, he's busted again!
Reason, not force
The monitors are your friends
Peace brings happiness
I've had a lot of hard times at Christmas time
I can remember me and my brother when I was about six years old
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece
And the health department made us take them down
I remember my father well, you know
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache
He used to have, you know what caused it, Ben?
He used to put a stocking cap on his head
And put a knot right in front of it
Daddy wake up with that thumping headache
And he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad
He said, I don't know what Santa's gonna get y'all for Christmas
But he gonna bring you something
So Daddy took that old rifle and went outside
And shot up in the air and come back inside
And told us the biggest lie ever heard
Said, kid, Santa just committed suicide
Santa Claus is coming
To rape your wife
Santa Claus is coming
To rape your wife
He's got a gun
And he's got a big knife
Santa Claus is coming
To rape your wife
Santa killed off all his elves
To powdered pipes

Hello.
Your local multinational corporation has sent me to this remote point in Australia to prove a point.
Conservation can be dangerous.
In this remote aboriginal village just outside of Sydney, Australia,
the natives were told by their grandparents,
the natives were told by their grandparents,

the government,
the government, to slow down in their consumption of gasoline and fossil fuels.
Unfortunately, the files in the government energy office on this town were lost.
So, nobody bothered to tell them when it was okay to go back to normal energy use.
Sadly enough, this town has become the victim of what we call an energy surplus.
And the natives have been forced to convert many of their dishwashers,
lawnmowers, and refrigerators into these homemade, energy-hungry,
miniature racing guards.
Boys and girls in the village between the ages of 14 and 20
must stay behind the wheels of these primitive, high-speed, and dangerous machines
for up to 90 hours at a stretch,
just so their village can receive the next fuel shipment from their local multinational distributor.
And we'll keep on shipping at our usual rates,
just so this little village can meet and surpass its energy quota.
And to think, it's all because they kept lights off when it didn't have to be convenient.
This holiday season, why not turn on all the lights in your house,
and keep them on for the rest of the year?
Maybe you'll make the load a little lighter on us here at Multinational.
And a winter reminder, citizens.
Carbon monoxide, the silent winter killer, lurks everywhere.
So, if you have a gas stove, oil burner, or open flame,
make sure all the doors and windows in the room are tightly sealed,
so that none of that nasty carbon monoxide can sneak in.
Thanks, and happy holidays.
This is Mr. Abernathy, signing off from your town to you.
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy, dear friends,
and thanks to Leimurr, Fernand and Andy Leimurr,
and IMBJR for the whiz and monitor clips.
The Jethro's, friends, you need to know where to write to the Jethro's.
They're at, they did that Wreck the Halls and so many other versions we've been playing.
The Jethro's are at 212 and a half Miller Avenue.
That's 212 and a half Miller Avenue, Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
Portsmouth N.H. 03801.
