Oh, no, yes, it's a test.

The Alexander Academy presents Mind Engineering.
Instructions of the Alexander Method
towards a more successful, self-confident, and harmonious life
through relaxation.
You are about to embark upon a journey that will change your life.
Why do I call it a journey,
and why do I suggest that it will change your life?
Let's see.
Life is a journey and not a destination.
We came from somewhere, and we are going somewhere.
The time between these two points has to be filled.
Dream along with Bozo.
Dream along with Bozo.
You will find it isn't hard to do.
Because when Bozo comes,
there's always room for you.
Right away, Cardozen,
dreaming is supposing.
Just suppose you're anything at all.
You can dream that you're an inch or ten feet tall.
You may decide to be
on a ship at sea
or on a bronco in the west.
Whatever you like best.
Dream along with Bozo.
Dream along with Bozo.
Anywhere you go, you can't go wrong.
Get on Bozo's happy team and dream along.
Now you may choose to go
to a rodeo
or to a sunny sandy beach.
Nothing is out of reach.
Not when you're with Bozo.
On a tour with Bozo.
Life will be as merry as it is.
There's a song.
So when Bozo goes a-dreaming, dream along.
Dream along, dream along with Bozo.
Hehehehe.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery
which reaches from the inner mind to
the subgenius.
Hour of Slack.
Coming to a radio near you.
The greatest program ever heard.
Just press any afflicted body part against the radio
and feel the healing power of the fuel injected
semi-far out subgenius hour of Slack.
Cures fallen arches, impotence, hemorrhoids, bad teeth, terminal conservatism, and boredom.
Gets a thousand miles to the gallon.
Crashes into freeway supports at 500 miles per hour.
And still comes back for more.
Makes Christine look like a Yugo.
Recharges dead batteries in seconds.
Diverts tornadoes and sends lightning towards the nearest government building.
Gets rid of wrinkles in everything.
Turns black and white TVs into color models like that.
The subgenius hour of Slack
can turn a tiresome house cat into a lovely set of driving gloves instantly.
Puts tread back on old tires.
Mystically rebuilds gummy carburetors.
Wipes your debts off computer rolls nationwide.
And puts scorpions in the pants of your employers.
Break the psychic speed limit of your own mind
by tuning into the subgenius hour of Slack.
With your demonic pit crew boss,
the high octane river and diving stank.
Uh, yes, dear friends, oh yeah, I'm supposed to be high octane or something like that.
And yes, we will be because we've got everything tonight.
We've got puzzling evidence.
We've got tons and tons of really, really weird music.
And we've got rants galore by many new subgeniuses you've never heard of before.
And why it's all coming together somehow, somehow tonight.
And why it's all coming together somehow, somehow tonight.
Load your pipes like the more real thing.
Drop yourselves, be yourselves, or kill me.
The saucers cannot know what we think.
But they can make us think what they want us to.
We must be aware.
We must be what we are.
We must be the subgenius.
And save ourselves for next day.
Kill yourselves like the word of Bob.
He carries the wisdom of the E.T.
Give in to evil!
Sounds neat! Let's eat!
Come on, Doc. Let's have it.
But the Krell forgot one thing.
Yes, what?
Monsters, John.
Monsters from the id.
The id?
What's that?
Talk, Doc.
Monsters from the id.
The id?
What's that?
What's that?
The id?
I was mr.






So, you thought you saw some kind of monster?
Well, you know, friends, I mean, this is the 20th century.
We've sent men to the moon.
There's no such thing as monsters.
Certainly not monsters from the id.
No, we wouldn't be dealing with anything like that tonight, I don't think.
Unless...
We always have a hypnotic effect.
Extremely attractive to people.
I will use a...

I'm outwardly calm, apparently normal, quick to smile and slow to peek.
But I have a little quirk, a pattern, so to speak.
I rarely have ever hold a job.
I never finish my work.
I'm an affable kind of a slob.
A highly disorganized, placid sort of a jerk.
I've got the will to fail.
The will to fail.
I have talents that I never use.
I try to win, but I love to lose because I've got the will to fail.
It's such a thrill to fail.
A thrill to fail.
I've a backward kind of basic need.
I get my kicks when I don't succeed because I've got the will to fail.
I seem to make an effort, but I never do connect.
And while I'm very rational, I'm seldom, if ever, practically never correct.
Because I've got the will to fail.
The will to fail.
The will to fail.
The will to fail.
I secretly am enjoying myself.
But slowly I'm destroying myself.
I think I've got a tiger by the tail.
A tiger called the will to fail.

The Will to Fail by Katie Lee there, thanks to Dad there in Portland.
But friends, I've got something I need to share with you.
We got this letter in here.
Here, information furnished by Dick Weller and the Oregon Citizens Alliance.
Called The Voice They Want Silenced.
And friends, it says here, if I may read from this.
My name is Dick Weller.
When I was 17, I was recruited into the Christian lifestyle by an older Christian man.
Like so many young people who get drawn into Christianity, I was lonely and naive.
Eleven years and six churches later, I finally sought help.
Now, I'm normal again and dedicated to helping young people avoid the mistakes I made.
It is true that Christians do not reproduce.
They recruit.
They call it being born again.
The Christians put on a good public image.
But many Christians try to recruit young people.
Sometimes even going door to door.
The Christians want to put their religious books, such as the Holy Bible, the New Testament, the Book of Mormon,
in school libraries where children can read them.
Some Christians even want children to pray at school.
Or want children to be taught directly from the Book of Genesis in science class.
Sometimes they even pray on school.
Some even make children into school children with free candy and promises that they'll go to heaven.
What the pro-Christian media won't tell you is that Christianity is a behavior.
Simply because they go to church on weekends or refuse to listen to loud rock music,
Christians believe they should be granted special minority status in housing and employment
and have passed many laws protecting them against so-called religious discrimination.
So, I'm going to read this.
Some Christians even want to become teachers.
Religious orientation as a condition or inclination is not comparable to race or ethnic background.
How a person worships or with whom is not the kind of activity for which we should create a minority classification.
My Christian friends kept telling me how Christians used to be crucified and fed to lions by religious bigots,
as they called them.
But I have since found out that the militant Christians who bomb health clinics and shoot abortion doctors are the real bigots.
It is a known fact that Adolf Hitler was a baptized Christian,
as were many other members of the Nazi party who murdered six million Jews.
The problem with religious freedom is that it never stops there.
If we give these people religious freedom,
what will they want next?
Sexual freedom?
Freedom of speech?
When the government and teachers tell kids that Christianity is just another normal lifestyle,
they're making it easier for adult Christians to recruit them.
I know what I'm talking about.
I was one of those kids.
I'm only one voice against all the pro-Christian bias of the media,
but mine is the voice of experience.
Sincerely, Dick S. Weller of the Ex-Christians for Truth.
Friends, I just want to tell you, I think that says it all.
I don't know what I could add to that, except for the post office box number of this little flyer that I got that from.
This flyer called, Weapon, because the truth hurts.
It's free from the open eye.
I'm going to give you that address for the open eye.
They're in P.O. Box 1602.
That's 1602.
Box 1602 in Eugene, Oregon.
That's Eugene, Oregon 97440.
I'm telling you, friends, I mean, it wasn't long ago that we laughed at the Christians.
You know, some of us even went out Christian bashing.
But you can't get away with that kind of thing anymore.
I know it's not politically correct.
No, sir.
Times have changed.
They've changed indeed, dear friends.
I don't know.
I just don't know.
But I do know this.
I can tell you this much.
I can tell you 50 fun things to do in an elevator.
Number one.
I will be going through this list for several weeks.
I've got several shows to come, I'm sure.
Number one, friends.
When you're in an elevator with a bunch of folks, you're stuck in there, you've got nothing better to do.
Number one.
Try this.
Make race car noises when anyone gets on or off.
We'll have some more suggestions for 50 things to do in an elevator as we continue with the program.
Thank you.
All right.
We're going to wait.



Brothers and sisters.
Friends of the revolution.
Let me tell you something.
In the beginning, there was pleasure.
And it was good.
And four bars and seven drinks would go and order the former more perfect Las Vegas.
We the weird mushroom goblin army of insanity with one nature that's a Dito.
Do solemnly pledge...
Let me say...
Take the pledge.
Our Pledge of Allegiance.
We'll be right back.
To Tom Jones
Drinking and gambling
To fornication
Hallucination
To visit the holy city at least once a year
Oh, lead us not to Wayne Newton
And deliver us from Michael Bolton
Say it after me now
Say I
Pleasure bearer
To solemnly swear
To go forth
Skip work
Sleep late
And make pleasure
On a planet
I'm a pleasure bearer
Let the drinking begin
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, baby, it's the ball game
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
You can't kill me
I will not die
Not now
Not ever
No, never
No
I'm gonna live
A long, long time
My soul is gonna die
For his own
Forever
Oh
The time has come
We will not wait
We will storm the gates
At dawn
Out of here
Into the world
Sing a big, big song
Come on, boys
You think if we
But when I die
Not now, not ever, no never
I'm only here for a long, long time
My soul is on forever
Hey, my friend, Johnson!
guitar solo
I stand alone
And on the road
I know my flesh will rot
But the wind again
And the crazy frame
Whoa!
Not before God
Come on!
You can't kill me
However I die
Not now, not ever, no never
I'm gonna live
For a long, long time
My soul is on forever
guitar solo
Yeah!
guitar solo
Huh!
guitar solo
Hmm!
guitar solo
One more!
guitar solo
Yeah!
guitar solo!
You know, there's people out there
that wanna ban books.
They wanna ban my records.
They wanna tell me when I can drink
and what I can drink.
They wanna ban drugs and sex and everything.
People wanna have a lot of rules.
A lot of rules and regulations.
But listen up.
Listen up, Mr. Rules and Regulations.
I ain't gonna obey!
guitar solo
That's right, man.
I ain't gonna do what you say.
Oh, you can put me in jail.
You can kill me.
You can execute me.
But you can't kill rock and roll, man.
I'll tell you another damn thing.
I ain't eating no more .
I ain't gonna eat it no more.
I ain't gonna eat it
because it don't taste good.
You know what?
McDonald's can kiss my butt!
guitar solo
McDonald's can kiss my butt
It's a great big hairy butt
Got a dingleberry hanging off my butt
McDonald's kiss my ass
You know, people say,
Mojo, you're always complaining about everything.
Why don't you vote in the election?
Why don't you become involved in the electoral process?
Uh-uh.
Oh, yeah.
Vote for Clinton, Mojo.
It's gonna make everything nice and new and neat.
We got one fool just as big a fool as the other fool.
Ain't nothing changed.
Same fools riding around in the black cars.
We still riding around on the subway.
Riding around in the bus.
We riding around in a 1978, you know, 1978 El Torino
or some damn thing.
Leaking all.
We ain't got no money.
Gotta pay taxes.
Everything's screwed up.
I ain't gonna take it no more.
I'm gonna start an armed insurrection.
I'm gonna go to the hills of West Virginia,
and I'm gonna liberate some guns from a National Guard armory.
And I'm gonna start armed revolt,
because at some time in the course of human events,
it becomes necessary to disassociate yourself
from the ties that bind.
I'm gonna break them ties.
I'm gonna bust them up.
So there I am standing in the middle of the street,
running around a campfire in the hills of West Virginia,
and the flames are shooting up high.
And I happen to be the head of the armed insurrection,
the Rebel Alliance,
and I'm gonna sing our brand new national anthem
that goes something like this.
You can't kill me.
I will not die.
Not now.
Not ever.
No, never.
Wow.
I'm gonna live a long, long time.
My soul reigns on forever.
You can't kill me.
I will not die.
Not now.
Not ever.
No, never.
I'm gonna live a long, long time.
My soul reigns on forever.
My soul reigns on forever.
My soul reigns on forever.

Forever.
Oh, you can shoot my body full of holes,
but you can't kill the spirit of rock and roll, baby.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
Mojo Nixon, the great Mojo Nixon,
whipping out that classic,
well, two classics there,
the Pleasure Allegiance
and You Can't Kill Me,
and those are from Mojo Nixon's new CD here,
Whereabouts Unknown, it's called,
and you can get, to obtain lyrics,
get in the catalog,
just hit up the Ripe and Ready company there
at P.O. Box 339.
You got that pencil?
I got some hay.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay, that hay.
Hey, man.
That's Box 339,
Montclair, New Jersey,
07042.
Uh, yes, uh, yes,
it fills one with the spirit, don't it, now,
to hear these, these fine pleasures,
allegiance and whatnot,
and I'm not sure where we're going with this show next.
Let's just listen to the beautiful people,
I'll keep you here for a minute.
Gooly, gooly.
Yeah, I tell you, brother.
Gooly, gooly.
Gooly, gooly.
Uh, but dear friends,
uh, one thing that is important,
an important lesson, once again, here,
50 fun things to do in an elevator.
Number two,
in an elevator,
blow your nose,
and offer to show the contents of your Kleenex
to the other passengers.
And number three,
grimace painfully while smacking your forehead
and muttering,
shut up, damn you, all of you, just shut up.
Whistle the first seven notes of,
it's a small world after all, incessantly.
Number five,
sell Girl Scout cookies.
Number six,
on a long ride,
sway side to side,
at the natural frequency of the elevator.
Number seven,
shave.
Number eight,
praise Bob!
Praise Bob and get you some slack, man!
He carries me on two tight,
by his tight shall you know him.
He carries me on two tight,
by his tight shall you know him.
By his tight shall you see the world which is to come.
And boy, is it a dandy.
Crazy, very, very, boys.
Crazy for all the beauty girls and boys,
but beware of the conspiracy.
They steal your slack,
and they won't give it back.
We have but one purpose,
and it remains unknown.
Number six,
wear a pair of socks.

so
oh whoa something else huh friends uh
uh devo of course needless to say a really unusual live album or it's not a live album
actually it's a bootleg is what it is dear friends uh an amazing bootleg tape sent to us by
dr scott orsi in calumet city i believe it is and uh yes it's uh from a bootleg live recording
recorded in 11 11 82 the uh good bad and the ugly girl you want i guess you could call that
and uh well let's go back in time to a little bit of the old puzzling evidence show yes friends
it's been a while since i've gotten a proper new tape in from old puzz ev and dr howell and
i've got a couple of them here so well let's just go to it hey
and good evening ladies and gentlemen tonight we give you something entirely new and different
standing beside me is the young man who has declared publicly before a crowd of 15 000 people
and talking over a nationwide radio hookup giving as his reason quote i protest against the state
of civilization end quote you're welcome
and although the opening of the convention is hours off the delegates are already pouring
into the ballpark by the droves with lunch baskets banners and petitions asking not to
jump off any roof but no matter how you look at it it's still a phenomenon
these are the boy for lawyers you've heard people call them have been laughed at and ridiculed but
here they are gay and happy having traveled thousands of miles their expenses paid by
their neighbors who come here to pay homage to their hero and in these days of wars and bombings
it's a hopeful sign that a simple idea like this can sweep the country an idea based on
friendliness on giving and not taking on helping your neighbor and asking nothing in return
and if a thing like this can happen don't let any of your grumbling friends tell you
that you're not a hero
that humanity is falling upon jack is you mean you don't feel a certain degree of urgent
pressure on the inner wall of your bladder now right at this moment
letting love go by i'm neglecting your duty to be happy of living on evasion and subterfuge
and resignation
so i have enough half and half for the show man i could have been on the air from midnight
to 5 00 a.m midnight to 5 00 a.m i could have done that's a dawn i'm done with the show
the dawn joyce show he has to do that i wouldn't want to do that all the time the way i do shows
because it takes me too much to prepare this that's what stars are made of today and then
we say well then why do you do it oh your state hasn't listened to your show it's weird
yeah i don't recommend that most people listen to it and then we say where's it coming from
no it sounds like it's coming from everywhere i think the sound came up from somewhere down
below up through the ventilation system and exited out of the room and then we go into

go through the whole house he probably had another tape recorder stash somewhere i have a feeling
this whole place is rigged to stereo maybe the largest collection of sound effects tapes in the
world i never trust a man whose eyes always meet dead is this some kind of a joke you're talking
to a hologram you better learn this isn't any high school play you're in this is a rat race
of these creatures with your strength and force let them avenge me and i will
pledge my soul to you and serve you for all eternity tell me all your problems you drink
coffee uh no thanks i'm sorry i'd be wasting your time i made a mistake
well i'll have a wash then we can celebrate your arrival with a cup of coffee
you can celebrate with coffee i never touched
the show

Oh, the sergeant. And if you're going in there, would you mind taking the coffee?
Pleasure. Thank you.
Wait a minute, dog. You need some sleep.
Nothing the black coffee won't cure.
Could I have some of that coffee?
I'll get you some.
You selling any of that coffee this morning?
Could be.
Morning sequence will now commence.
Enjoy your coffee.
Thank you, girl.
Could you, uh...
Could you ask the computer worker to get a cup of coffee, please?
I'd also like you to make coffee, Cass.
You have some more coffee, Long John?
No, thanks, Carl.
Hope you got plenty of coffee. I could drink five gallons right now.
Started working for the paper.
Used to...
bring coffee around to everybody.
I hated that.
We can blow her out of the water.
You got some coffee?
Yeah.
We should be drinking milk. You know, this stuff is poison.
Hey, tell me. What do you say, huh?
All right.
Hey.
Would you like some coffee?
No, I hate coffee.
I...
I have one of the... one of the... the...
Chalmestiche. This...
Oh, I could use some of that.
Black?
Yeah.
Come on.
What's wrong with a hot cup of coffee and a handshake?
You're such a beautiful nursemaid.
Bob, please.
Well, I am pretty much of a bust, I guess, and you're right.
We are kind of an odd combination, but...
even if you don't know it yet,
you need me just as much as I need you.
It's our kind of love,
which makes the world go around.
Rather bumpily sometimes, but...
round it goes.
What was that?
It was the president going by.
In a blaze of glory.
I wear a...
Lee?
A wealthy man.
Yes, this president has unprecedentedly won this term.
I'm a...






Where's Lee?
Where's Lee?
Oh, wrong president.
And I wear...
I press on presidential names.
...for a sacrifice...
Now available from their factory in Yorba Linda.
The original comeback.
You are getting...
And I want to tell you...
And I want you to tell them...
Make no mistake about that.
And I hope the nation shows...
And I hope the nation shows...
...that we are not alone.
As in so many periods of wallowing in water game,
We were consumed almost entirely by a quest for re-emphasization.
...a cause bigger than yourself.
It's the cause of...
What cause?
Just a cause.
...making this the greatest nation in the world.
...the leader of...
Oh, sorry.
...the gods without our...
No matter what its combination of triumphs and tragedies,
any life defined primarily by tenacity must seem at the end a story of some bravery,
but even more melancholy.
It is the end of the world.
In Richard Melhouse Nixon's long march through various valleys of humiliation, dirt, slime,
and sleaze, on to political triumph and disgrace and partial rehabilitation, in front of a snickering
nation, there were many episodes of glory, but a constant glimpse and five o'clock shadow.
...strong in our souls, strong in our belief, and strong in our willingness to sacrifice.
You have been willing to sacrifice in a...
Oh, sorry.
...their...
That was the Lincoln Room.
Don't go in there.
Yes, thousands have gathered to pay their respects to the deceased president, who we
now know was not only our greatest president, but perhaps, in a larger sense, the greatest
human being who ever lived upon this earth, greater even than Jesus Christ, our Lord.
What a guy.
Pure in every detail of his blameless life, and hence, in every detail of his life, he

was a handsome and valorous of visage.
The golden being known as Nixon had no flaw known to mortal men.
Yea, this Nixon, hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been so clear in his great office,
that his virtues plead like angels, trumpet-tongued against the deep damnation of Nixon's untimely
death.
For pity, like a naked newborn babe striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim horsed upon
the sightless...
...the most perilous of the air, shall blow Dick Nixon's death in every eye, that tears
and screams shall drown the wind.
I scream for our murdered king.
What else is on, anyway?
Let's see, Dick Nixon dead on Channel 54.
The president dies on Channel 38.
Let's see, the last of the presidents on Channel 22.
Not much on tonight, either.
Not to mention Night of the Living Presidents.
Is that on?
Yeah, that's really neat.
It's black and white, and the...
And you've seen Suddenly, haven't you?
Suddenly last summer, Dick Nixon knew.
Yes, in fact, I recommend that Frank Sinatra's version of Nixon in Suddenly.
It's amazing.
Oops, sorry.
That's the Lincoln Room.
Don't go in there.
There was that ghost haunting Dick Nixon.
You can take the Lincoln Room ride now.
Apparently the private White House is a lot more fun than the old government-owned White
House was in the tricky Dixon days.
Twinkie dink.
Yes, everyone remembers that.
I remember those wonderful Trinkie Dink cartoons where you would put a little piece of plastic
on the television and interact with the famous 37th president and say, he needs a bridge
built between the Senate and the Appropriations Committee.
So you draw it with the crayon right on the TV screen.
Sometimes dad and mom would get mad when the TV screen was ruined with an indelible mark.
Yes, Trinkie Dick and You was innovative kid games from the 1950s.
Oh, what a party it was down here at Yorba Linda, too.
Oh, it's too violent.
I can never let Billy and Timmy watch the Nixon show.
That man is ruthless and unscrupulous.
Now we're going in the hall of the president.
Oh, yeah.
Well, Antworth has been the chair of the meeting and the table was floored and the minutes
were read and so forth.
But, you know, the entire procedure was held in town.
Representation of the president like a president.
You know, I was wondering, since I'm getting a greater position in this organization and
I'm eventually going to be in the full-time position, if I can get a better position, I'll



probably be in the president position.

ombudsman.
All right, Mr. President!
44 nicht sind aus ver belli im linderten vor grounds gefeuert.
Iaman, I need fix this.


A hard-fighting anti-communist, a Cold War warrior who went toe-to-toe with Nikita Khrushchev in the infamous kitchen magician debate.
An implacable foe of Cuba, an opponent all his life of civil rights, and finally, the man who left his name upon the moon,
and a black which will endure until the end of time.
Yes, Richard Nixon. Hero or hophead?
Well, we know the answer to that.
Well, you know, he did have that giant grocery store glass of whiskey that he carried around as he talked to the pictures of former presidents.
You know, we went and talked to Tricky Dick during those days, and there was no hopping around the White House.
Well, there was, actually, but not by the presidential staff.
Only by the various guards and musicians positioned in the Washington.
D.C. area during this hideous and unidentified war.
In three decades, Nixon tasted crisis, mouthed defeat, chewed victory, mumbled ruin, and belched revival.
We have fears in our dreams.
They're ugly.
Something brings them out.
We're all primitive.
We're all primitive.
Deep, deep down.
Evil black eyes.
They're guarding a secret.
Got it?
Got it?
We have fears.
In our dreams.
It's no motion.
Hope the natives are friendly.

We live in secret, waiting for the saucers.
On the day they come, we shall see the end and the beginning.
And we shall party town, oh yea, we shall drop blank.
There is no tomorrow, for there will be no tomorrow.
Only the forever to gain, Bob. Praise Bob, praise the time.
He is Bob, eager for fun.
He wears a smile. Everybody run.
Why do you think you're so pink?
Why do you think pink?
Bob is the zero and the one.
Bob is Schrodinger's cat's box.
Why do you fit in traffic jams day after day?
Bob is the middle finger of Wotan.
Bob tunes the fish.
Why do you think the world is run by rampant againsters of antagono schisms?
We're not playing, God.
We're not playing.
This is no game.
Why do you think the savior of most moments is the holy head martyr?
Ignition.
Zero.
We have liftoff.
We have polypropylana.
We have toys.
Why do you think nobody understands the theory of really Rudy too?
Bob is the only dope I need.
Eat me.
Drink me.
Frop me.
Why do you think I've never seen my own thoughts?
You can walk a mile in the devil's hooves.
Why do you think the doctors operate on your head without opening it?

Bob can pry you off the ceiling day in and day out.
Why do you think there's no prob with Bob?
I have old eggs.
I have new eggs.
Why do you think the gland has landed?
Kill me, Mr. Sheik.
Why do you think who the hell can say what's to say?
Say what?
I can drive my Bob mobile all the way home.

Give me fresh batteries.
Feed my pura cells.
Why do you think they change wars every few years?
Slack fire will backfire in the faces of those who can't handle it.

Save yourself.
Where's your life raft?
Why do you think it's cheaper to build people than to build robots?
Are you the whip or the crack?

It's in your genes.
Take it out and wiggle it.
Why do you think they're smarter than you are the harder they make you work?
They're very scary.
Bob is scarier.
It's your only hope.
Why do you think there's a church where there ought to be a think?
Why do you think, Pink?
The person's going to say, I don't have enough time to do the things I'm doing now.
You're going to tell me I've got to catch up inwardly as well?
And that'll give you more time to do the things you're doing now.
And maybe you'll also see some of the things you're doing now aren't quite so important after all.
We just seduced ourselves into thinking they're important.
This is Bob.
Welcome to the bar.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Bob, are you here?
I don't believe in this stupid shit.
Do not try this on your own.
It is extremely dangerous.
So, you want to be an Elder God?
Here at Elder God Tech, our 10-step process can, in just a few short weeks,
transform you into the gibbering, shambling mound of goo that you've always known was your destiny.
Elder God, you're...
Elder Gods are born, not made.
And here at Elder God Tech, we've been making them for thousands of years.
Great Cthulhu himself was not always a titanic, interdimensional being of terror.
He was once Jack Smith, an accountant from Jersey.
There is absolutely no obligation, and the first lesson is free.
In it, you'll study how to respond to chance, how to pronounce your own name,
and you'll get to pick out the features that you want your new body to have.
Our surgical team can transform a 140-pound weakling into a 22,000-pound mutant,
mutating horror with scales, tentacles, gills, suckers, whatever you want.
Now, admittedly, the surgery is not AMA certified,
but we refuse to allow sadial government regulations to control your new form.
We promise that, no matter how sick and twisted,
and no matter how much it costs, we will give you the body of your nightmares.
And then, in just eight weeks of intensive training,
we'll teach you all you need to know about recruiting followers,
creating jade idols, and generating occult smoke.
You'll attend seminars on temple design,
and shrine placement,
and we'll show you where to find the very best in sinking islands and moving mountains.
We're fully accredited, and we do take transfer students,
and you'll get so much more besides unlimited power.
You'll get a network of contacts, other ETT graduates.
You'll get a place to belong.
Yes, you'll belong on this planet because you'll own this planet.
Did you have a junior high bully? Crush him.
Crush everyone with the same hair color.
Crush everyone with the same number of vowels in their name.
It's easy when you know the secret.
Are you ready that you'll find your new look repellent?
Hey, beauty is only skin deep,
and your skin will be up to 30 feet thick.
Now, you might be worried that some Elder Gods,
such as our 1803 valedictorian,
I frequently describe as imbeciles.
Idiots.
And yes, we do sometimes remove all traces of intelligence from a student,
but that's just part of the whole gestalt.
We do not do things halfway here at Elder God Tech.
A word or two about our competitors might be in order.
ABC School of Elder Gods, for example, has rotten chanting.
Simple and direct, those things are an iambic pentameter.
They only pass along the most obvious and simple-minded secrets of the world.
The gods, they turn out, can't twist time and space,
can't turn mortals insane,
tend to live only about 45 years,
have no tentacles.
All in all, friends, it's shoddy.
At the Acme School, it's even worse.
The followers they get are absolutely bottom rung.
No research is necessary to summon an Acme Elder God.
Any English speaker can wander into the New York Public Library and get the rituals.
Their names aren't jaw-cracking mouthfuls of consonants,
and quite frankly, that attracts the laziest minions.
The sort of secret that they get wouldn't be allowed into any public parks at midnight,
and no self-respecting domestic animal would deign to be sacrificed by them.
But here at Elder Gods Academy, you get the full range of benefits.
You'll live for millennia.
You'll get to attend the annual convention at Marianas Trish.
You'll get a 20% discount at affiliated stores,
and if you act now, you'll get absolutely free your own chapter in the upcoming Necronomicon 2,
The Hallucination.
Don't you want thousands of alienated little high school losers chanting your name,
performing your rituals?
Sure, we all do!
And we can tell you just how much disdain to show them,
what gifts to expect,
and you can be secure in the knowledge that you know how to put on a show
before you crush their puny souls and suck the marrow from their bones.
Oh, yes, dear friends,
and we do know how to put on a show before we suck the marrow from their puny bones.
Don't we?
Well, that last there was from the good Reverend Paul Montekins at Delphicom Ashley.
And, yes, so you want to be an Elder God.
And before that, dear friends, we heard the good Dr. Dynasaur,
that's spelled D-Y-N-A-S-O-A-R,
with his tape, Why Do You Think?
And why do you think, dear friends?
I think it's because Dr. Dynasaur is working with the Yeti Geneti Research Institute,
home of the Autobob.
To quote,
We have all our fingers.
They're associated with the subgenius church of science fictionology,
no, science fiction-tology, sorry about that,
and the clench of the one true pipe dream.
And, friends, I want to give you some addresses here.
The number one address, of course, is always
the church of the subgenius foundation headquarters.
Write for free information at this post office box number I'm about to give, won't you please?
Oh, this is where we have to change music.
Oh, yes, dear friends, just write to Bob at post office box 140306.
Yes, that beautiful post office box, 140306, in lovely Dallas, Texas.
Oh, yes.
Zip code 7520.
75214.
Uh, yes, and so we come to the end of yet another show,
the thankful end of another show,
now to begin yet another show.
But before we do, let me mention that we also heard in there,
of course, quite a long stretch of the KPFA Berkeley subgenius show,
the puzzling evidence show,
with Dr. Howell, the great Dr. Howell Robbins,
howling on about President Nixon,
and some more music there from Idioglossia by Chris Burke,
in a piece called Open the Doors.
And, yes, we can open the doors, can't we?
We can open the doors of our brains and our hearts to B-B-B-Bob.
Oh, good Bob, yes, and the bad Bob as well, because, you know,
it's the same frontwards or backwards.
B-O-B, man, that's just the way it goes, okay?
Yeah.
