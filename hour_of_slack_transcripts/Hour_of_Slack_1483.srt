00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,280
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard our McDonnell Douglas DC-88 space liner for today's mission to Mars.

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,200
The captain has asked that you remain in your seats at all times. And please, no smoking.

3
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:36,580
Attention please. Folks, this is 3rd Officer Collins speaking. I'm your tour guide today and I'll be telling you about what's going on during the trip.

4
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,860
Right now we're on final countdown and you can watch our liftoff on the lower screen in your cabin. I'll speak to you again after we're in space.

5
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,880
Mission Control, this is Mars 295 ready for departure. 295 roger, countdown is go.

...Mars...

9
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,880
We'll meet again at midnight.

10
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,440
From PR News in Washington, I'm possessing and producing a biological toxin.

00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,600
The Dow 7374479962.

12
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,080
A new UN report states this is PR News in Washington.

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,720
My favorite product is this, the Core Annulator.

19
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,900
It gives literal meaning to the phrase, tear yourself a new ass hole.

20
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,540
I have already installed four new orifices in my body so that I may interface with up to six creatures at once,

21
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,060
transfixing my body with all vanishing sensations emanating from the depths of my brain.

22
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,320
It is a source of pride, pleasure, and this is so important.

23
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,000
Remove the earth woman. Prepare her for a pleasure.

24
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,400
And then there's the chicken bone love fetish.

25
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,260
Okay.

26
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,780
Uh...

27
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,960
I need a volunteer. I've already registered myself voluntarily, otherwise I wouldn't be here.

28
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,420
And the girls back on stage!

29
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,880
A person

Stands upon his own.

37
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,980
He is a blockhead.

38
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,420
Thinking and foreground.

39
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,740
He comes well prepared.

40
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,620
Cut the top, square off.

41
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,360

50
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,640
Cut the top, square off.

51
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,500
Eight corners, nine of the angle.

52
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,540
Cut the top, stairs.

53
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,480

63
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,240
I can't.

64
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,720
I can't.

65
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,180
Delicious little candies.

66
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,000
Delicious, delicious, delicious little candies.

67
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,220
All touching my body.

68
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,320
Schon Morgen.

69
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,860
Ist die Hydra die Herrscherin über die Welt?

70
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,960
Zum Sieg geboren auf den Schwingen der Valkyre.

71
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,920
Die Waffen unserer Feinde sind machtlos gegen uns.

72
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,520
Wenn Sie ein Flugzeug abschießen,

73
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,040
dann lassen hundert weitere neue Feuer auf Sie herabregnen.

74
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,020
Wenn Sie einen Kopf abschneiden,

75
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,080
werden zwei neue nachwachsen.

76
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,740
Heil Hydra.

77
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,520
Heil Hydra!

78
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,140
Heil Hydra!

79
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,480
Heil Hydra!

80
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,880
Heil Hydra!

81
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,680

They can destroy the spiritual,

96
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,680
And dear friends, this is going to be one of those special shows.

97
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,860
Actually, it's more of a normal show tonight, I should say.

98
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,480
Quote, normal, unquote.

99
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,780
Because it's just a mix of stuff all interspersed.

100
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,380
We've got new PR news from Lemur and a new Psychoskeletons tune.

101
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,000
We're going to play the last of our Leipzig trip recordings, probably.

102
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,900
And also lots of music this time.

103
00:08:52,980 --> 00:09:03,040
The really crazy stuff that we've heard a little bit of about the chicken bone love fetish is by Reagan's Polyp, old friend of ours.

104
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,320
Some of those have Pope Sternodocs, our even older friend, on them.

105
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,920
It's from some CD reissues of the older Reagan's Polyp material.

106
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,260
And although we missed the devotional,

107
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,080
we

108
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,040
did get Reverend Toth Wilder's annual compilation of Devo covers.

109
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,440
Praise Toth.

110
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,940
Called Not Necessarily Beautiful But Mutated, Volume 10.

111
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:41,940
It's a double CD this time, of which that earlier great version of Blockhead was by Rural War Room.

112
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,680
Say that three times fast.

113
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,600
Rural War Room, Rural War Room, Rural War Room.

114
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,940

116
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,060


117
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,860
Among others.

118
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,460
And what's in the background is the brain worm that's been deviling me for a week now.

119
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,280
But now, Reagan's Polyp.

120
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,660
One, nine, one, two, one, four.

121
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,620
One, nine, one, two, one, four.

122
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,460
One, nine, one, two, one, two.

128
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,700

We'll be right back.

144
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,720
Allow me to tell you about my latest obsession.

145
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:46,340
For some months now, I've been trying to figure out how to convert deterministic pushdown automata to non-deterministic pushdown automata.

146
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,040
And I think that's what I'm going to do.

147
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,820
I think I've found a way.

148
00:12:52,980 --> 00:13:01,900
You see, what you do is, you get her to open her shirt, revealing her deterministic pushdown automata.

149
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:13,740
And then you get a plunger, and you just convert her deterministic pushdown automata to non-deterministic pushdown automata.

150
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,420
You know?

151
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,240
I miss you so much!

152
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,660

The World Bank focuses on the Congress Growth and Opportunity Act,

158
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,920
a measure passed by Congress offering incentives for Congress to build greater prosperity.

159
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,060
Kerry says,

160
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,060
The question is, will we hit, can we new, the 832?

Kerry says,

162
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,260
And again, for example, if he is not eligible and the vote for virtue is a consequence.

163
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,620
He's slated to meet with PR News Washington.

164
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,000
Alabama is one of 10 states to pass a law requiring PR News.

165
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,120
Researchers say nutrient runoffs contribute to PR News in Cleveland.

167
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,720
Speaking on ES this morning, authorities said this is PR News.

168
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:35,940
The announcement follows a weekend-long ban that left roughly half a million military bases in Texas, Oklahoma, and California scrambling for PR News Washington.

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,700
Two players alone in a disco hall

179
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,920
Doing things I never did before

180
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,580
Inside I'm coming back for more

181
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,100
Little girl with a foreign lips

182
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,740
Never knew it would be like this

183
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,080
You put me in a situation

184
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,600
Go through some core mutation

185
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,120
Down in the middle of the night alone

186
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,580
Going back to my place where I'm being straight

187
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,200
I'm not telling you to do me wrong

188
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,680
Inside I'm coming back for more

189
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,300
Little girl with a foreign lips

190
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,880
Never knew it would be like this

191
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,360
You put me in a situation

192
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,800
Go through some core mutation

193
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:55,120
Down in the middle of the night alone

194
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,380
Doing things I never did before

195
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,360
Inside I'm coming back for more

196
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,400
Little girl with a foreign lips

197
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,000
Never knew it would be like this

198
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,000


199
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,080
Going back to my place where I'm being straight

200
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,080


201
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,080


202
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,080


203
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,080


204
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,100
Little girl with a foreign lips

205
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,520
Never knew it would be like this

206
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,160
Hello. Hello.

207
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,560
We're sitting in the middle of the night

208
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,360
We're sitting on the steps of the Stasi Museum

209
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,480
Which we came out of just now

210
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,300
Having learned very little

211
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,460
Because all of the Stasi Museum is in German

212
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:33,480
And it's about the life under the Cold War secret police

213
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,780
In this East German city

214
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:43,040
Which was apparently kind of an invasion of privacy

215
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,560
Kind of. On many levels

216
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:50,500
Apparently they read every letter that was mailed in the city

217
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,240
We saw a special machine for unsealing and then resealing letters

218
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,500
So you couldn't tell they'd been messed with

219
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,220
They had all kinds of remote photography and recording devices

220
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,340
Yeah, secret cameras inside briefcases and purses and stuff

221
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,240
So we learned a lot about how to resist the Stasi

222
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,560
When they came in

223
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,480
That's when we're starting to get stronger in America

224
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,360
Yeah

225
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,420
Yeah

226
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:20,620
Yeah

227
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:28,960
And last night we had the subgenius party at the Shishka bar

228
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,160
Shisha

229
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,640
A hookah is a shisha here

230
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,000
He'll probably be there for us

231
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,580
He'll probably be there for us

232
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,000
He'll probably be there for us

233
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,280
We'll go all the way

234
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,600
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

235
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,200
Hooray

236
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,920
It's a nice song.

237
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,520
Jingle Bells?

238
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:50,860
Sure.

239
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,180
Jingle all the way.

240
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,860
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.

241
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,720
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

242
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:09,580
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.

243
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,520
Jingle all the way.

244
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,320
You know.

245
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,960
Then we know what it's said.

246
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,840
Oh, poor Tannenbaum.

247
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,580
Oh, poor Tannenbaum.

248
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,240
Oh, poor Tannenbaum.

249
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,480
Oh, poor Tannenbaum.

250
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:26,600
Oh, poor Tannenbaum.

251
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,980
I should have done it in Russian.

252
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,840
Oh.

253
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,700
In the forest a Christmas tree was born.

254
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,960
In the forest it grew.

255
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,560
In the winter the forest grew.

256
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,260
In the winter it grew.

257
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,800
No, no, no.

258
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,580
I don't want no climbing.

259
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,560
Don't want no climbing.

260
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,220
Climbing!

261
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,860
Climbing!

262
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:41,940
Climbing!

263
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,180
Climbing!

264
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,820
Climbing to the två

265
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,560
To adapt!

266
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,640
What is all the pink and purple pipage?

267
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,700
Do you have any guesses?

268
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:17,640
Pink and purple pipage.

269
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,220
Pink and purple pipage everywhere.

270
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,140
It's what they call the PPP.

271
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,060
I see.

272
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,600
You see those P's everywhere?

273
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,340
Is that anything like Philo's Perfect Pipe Placement?

274
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,480
No, it's different.

275
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,300
Oh, okay.

276
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,040
It's Pink and Purple Pipe Placement.

277
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,840
Oh, okay.

278
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,280
But in this case, they're placed in a big arch over the road

279
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,740
and then continuing up through the park.

280
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,780
Yeah, there are purple pipes perpendicular to the ground and parallel

281
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,080
all pimping up this park.

282
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,640
The Pink and Purple Pipe Park.

283
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,120
Pimpled Park, they call it.

284
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,000
Come on, Pfeffernoose.

285
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,980
Are you getting a selfie?

286
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:57,800
Come on, Pfeffernoose.

287
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,960
Yeah, Pfeffernoose.

288
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,880
Okay, Gospin Hockens.

289
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,820
Son and Fartin'.

290
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,660
And Stinkin'.

291
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,860
Abfart, Sonnen und Stinken.

292
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,080
Sonnen.

293
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,820
Hey, didn't we record a whole bunch of our fake German last night?

294
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,860
Oh, yes, we did.

295
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,780
And we were drunken and we laughed and laughed and laughed.

296
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,000
Probably funnier for us than for anyone else.

297
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,440
Probably much funnier for us than for anyone else, but it was entertaining.

298
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,100
Nenslo's told me not to do things like that or our numa numa thing.

299
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:34,560
Uh-huh.

300
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,540
He said, next time you do something like that,

301
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,260
I know it's fun for you.

302
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,780
But you shouldn't put it on YouTube.

303
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,260
But it was like, that means you should do it.

304
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,760
If Principal Nenslo says it's stupid,

305
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,000
it's like, well, then the more important it probably is.

306
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,780
Calm skin.

307
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,780
My team skin.

308
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,760
But get help.

309
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,020
Seen tant la morn.

310
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,120
I don't know what to do.

311
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,100
Because my wife...

312
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,680
Went away.

313
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,960
To the hands of God.

314
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,280
Just like in different religious traditions.

315
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,280


316
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,680
acial

317
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,740
Maa!

318
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,440
d

319
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,460
I wish that we could live up in Bucky

320
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,040
Yes.

321
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,420
and Tanya's room forever,

322
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:37,980
Yes.

323
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,960
in their upstairs room.

324
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,380
But we have to get back to our pet, the newt.

325
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,520
But tonight it will go down in Leipzig.

326
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:50,920
Last night, we have this extremely atmospheric old European town.

327
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,700
Walking by the jewelry store called Christ.

328
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,440
Where they have schmuck.

329
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,780
Yeah, the schmuck for schmucks.

330
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,300
They sell schmuck at Christ's.

331
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,440
Christ sells schmuck, I guess you could say.

332
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:18,380
So I guess we get off of our hurting, stinking feet

333
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,820
and go to the Abfahrtssonnen and stinking.

334
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,380
Abfahrtssonnen and stinking?

335
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,500
Abfahrtssonnen and stinking?

336
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,060
It just means schedule, I think.

337
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:29,740
Ah.

338
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,600
But it has the word fart in it, so it's funny.

339
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,920
He said fart.

340
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,220
Abfahrt.

341
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,000
Oops, that was not a normal fart.

342
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,800
That was an abfart.

343
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,180
We have to go home now, quickly.

344
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,920
We have to go home, quickly.

345
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:08,200
In the year of 1975, every creature on the planet was really a life.

346
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,220
There was no gene splicing and no GMO.

347
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,380
Still the five spud boys looked and said, oh no.

348
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,680
Oh no!

349
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,960
Democrats, Republicans, what's the diff?

350
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,140
The world's gone soft and it needs to be stiff.

351
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,380
The corporate feudal state is encircling the wagons.

352
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,980
Viewership is up and IQs are dragging.

353
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,700
No matter what.

354
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,260
No matter what.

355
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,800
No matter what.

356
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,160
No matter what.

357
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,680
No matter what you do, in the start is the end.

358
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,560
Universal truths outlive the trend.

359
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,380
Nothing ain't nothing if there ain't no idea.

360
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,420
I think you probably know, but I'm telling you here.

361
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,660
Devo-oo-a-hoo was right.

362
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,680
Devo-oo-a-hoo was right.

363
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,340
Devo-oo-a-hoo was right.

364
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,020
You know, I do believe that Devo was right.

365
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,020


366
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,940
Devo-oo-a-hoo was right.

367
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,140
Devo-oo-a-hoo was right.

368
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,760
Devo-oo-a-hoo was right.

369
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,780
Devo-oo-a-hoo was right.

370
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,620
Devo-oo-a-hoo was right.

371
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,920
Devo-oo-a-hoo was right.

372
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,120
The year of seven, eight is when I heard the call.

373
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,300
I saw that grinning golfer on that big golf ball.

374
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,020
I did not understand, but I wanted to know.

375
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,000
Ever since then, I've been here to go.

376
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,660
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

377
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,940
Go, go, go, we can go, go!

378
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,220
Devo-hoo-wahoo was right!

379
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,120
I must repeat.

380
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,220
Devo was right.

381
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,180
Oh yes, dear friends.

382
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,760
Ah, yes.

383
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,860
Devo was right.

384
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,060
This show proves it.

385
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,040
That was sung by Malcolm Tent,

386
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,860
who we often see at the devotionals in Cleveland,

387
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,440
almost every year.

388
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,760
Before that, let's see,

389
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:52,320
there was a jaunty instrumental by the Psychoskeletons

390
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,960
called Kit 700.

391
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,120
Before that, kind of,

392
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,620
and before the Germany recordings,

393
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,620
there was Reagan's Polyp did

394
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,820
Nestle Up in Your Clammy.

395
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,320
And that version of Going Under,

396
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,500
the Devo tune,

397
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,940
was by Blank Men.

398
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,400
Again, those are from a compilation,

399
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,540
an annual compilation of Devo cover tunes

400
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,900
by a lot of different bands

401
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,640
called Nutmegs,

402
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,940
not necessarily beautiful, but mutated.

403
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,020
And you can find things by the participants,

404
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,760
like Rural War Room,

405
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,760
by Googling Rural War Room or Malcolm Tent

406
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,500
or whatevs.

407
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:49,700
But you cannot get that album from Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

408
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,560
I don't think.

409
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,020
Yes, it's a same wa.

410
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,540
And as far as our concrete,

411
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,820
the part that you sing more音

412
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,300
than us in möglichng a song

413
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,220
is I think the F الع

414
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,680
R 1998 on the length of어� McMahon

415
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:09,680


416
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:09,680


417
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:09,740
that with meaning that

418
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,280
this is music,

419
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:11,480
this is Dunkman 이거

420
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:11,740
can tell us something

421
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:11,740


422
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,980
Just we on you hyung

423
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,560
this is, we have to woman

424
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,280
út be eu

425
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,480
namum

426
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:20,820
,

427
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,660
this is move

428
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:24,980
thkay,

429
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:33,500
Did we tell you last week that Finn named The Large does Lonesome Cowboy Dave imitations?

430
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:39,980
Well, I just did, last week I did a large imitation because I did a Finnish accent.

431
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,500
Right. Oh, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you remember that show better than I did.

432
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:52,340
I may be able to locate some of the recordings of him doing that, but it was during a party.

433
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:59,640
And there's hours of this party recorded. And of course, it's embarrassing to listen to recordings of parties.

434
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:12,600
No, no, no, no. You've got to include it with the fabulous experience you had in Robert Taylor's school back in the days of the aeons, back when the spheres were all around.

435
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,040
You know what I mean?

436
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,640
Yeah, yeah, because they're not as round anymore.

437
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,680
No, they're a little rough and jaggedy.

438
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,560
Yeah, I can feel them when I sit down on them, too. It hurts.

439
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,260
You know, there's those pieces of flesh when we bit you real hard on the arm.

440
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,300
Yeah, yeah.

441
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,940
Those look really pretty.

442
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,120
Yeah, but she...

443
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,820
They're so, so pretty.

444
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,200
She has to bite me on the arm. That is what you're talking about, right?

445
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,180
I think so, huh?

446
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,480
I have trouble fighting.

447
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,640
You're following the show sometimes, you know.

448
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,260
Well, there's me, too.

449
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,500
Yeah, me, three.

450
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:56,820
I wonder how the audience feels, but I'm not going to let them call in and tell us, because I'm afraid I already know.

451
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,700
Yeah, they'll have all kinds of ideas that won't help.

452
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,340
Right.

453
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:09,080
But what I was thinking of before calling in on the phone where I have a hard time hearing you, as opposed to the phone where you have a hard time hearing me,

454
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,300
is I was just thinking, is it a focal point or two?

455
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:14,640
No.

456
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:22,120
A lot of times it's sophomoric and ugly and has a lot to do with poo-poo and things like that, but sometimes it's really sublime.

457
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,680
Don't you think?

458
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,420
What, this show?

459
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,820
Yes, well, of course.

460
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,180
Yes.

461
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,640
Not including myself, necessarily.

462
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,380
I'm saying...

463
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,060
Right.

464
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,580
Oh, yeah.

465
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,040
Yeah, you can't get to the sublimity unless you also have the asininity.

466
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,240
The...

467
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,740
Yeah, brain...

468
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,200
The...

469
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,860
Yeah.

470
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:42,860


471
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,120
Yeah.

472
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,280
The...

473
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,280


474
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,280


475
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,280


476
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,320
The...

477
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:43,320


478
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:43,440
Yeah.

479
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:43,520
Yeah.

480
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:43,700


481
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:43,980


482
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:44,320


483
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:44,320


484
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:44,320


485
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,420
Yeah.

486
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:44,420


487
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:44,420


488
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:44,420


489
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:44,420


490
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:44,420


491
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,360
Neck and neck with the singularity.

492
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,200
Man, that about says it.

493
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,120
Yeah.

494
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,580
Yes.

495
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,620
Yeah, evolution is going both ways at once.

496
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,080
And Devo was right.

497
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,120
About everything.

498
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,080
Which will create more species, I think.

499
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,580
Well, not everything.

500
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:00,920
Almost.

501
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,700
We'll create a bunch of different species because they'll be like aggressive...

502
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:12,880
They'll be like Genghis Khan ones, where they invade a place and kill all the men and concubine all the women and have as many children as they can,

503
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,420
so they take over the whole country.

504
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,080
All the way down to the core, you know.

505
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,280
Yeah.

506
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:17,820
Yeah.

507
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,260
Yeah.

508
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,420
Well, that's one species.

509
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,980
Then there's the cow-like species that feed the...

510
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,260
The feeds...

511
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,040
The feed the overlords?

512
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:28,600
Yeah.

513
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,140
Well, actually, you know, we're HG-

514
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:40,800
We're reinventing the wheel here because HG Wells invented the wheel in this novel, The Time Machine, which featured the Morlocks, which at first you thought were monsters.

515
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,340
And then you realized that no, they're...

516
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,480
Yeah.

517
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,340
farmers and the wimpy humans are the crop.

518
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:58,320
Well, especially the ones with really, really, really enormously large eyes.

519
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,100
Yeah.

520
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,200
Well, that's good.

521
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,020
They live underground.

522
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,260
They had to have giant eyes.

523
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:02,940
Yeah.

524
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,400
And they have funny feet.

525
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,200
Princess Wee has Morlocks feet.

526
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,040
The Morlocks, you have to remember, are human.

527
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,420
In fact, in some ways, they're more human than human.

528
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:23,180
Because they still have technology where the other future people who look like little kids in the time machine, all they do is eat and frolic.

529
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,940
They're like the Rewardian subgeniuses will evolve into the Eloi.

530
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:35,720
And the Emergentile subgeniuses, all three of us, will evolve into the Morlocks.

531
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,780
By the way, that doesn't include you or Princess Wee, you know.

532
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,100
Well, I'm sorry.

533
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,980
I didn't want to be included, but if Wee's in there...

534
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,360
Well, you're not a Morlock.

535
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,260
You're not an Emergentile or a Morlock.

536
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,740
Or a Warlock, which is different.

537
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,060
I'm an Emergentile.

538
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,640
How dare you insult my profanity.

539
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,040
I'm a profoundist.

540
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,800
I'm a suit.

541
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,840
I'm very well to dare here.

542
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,540
I'm not a Morlock.

543
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,840
You are an Emergentile?

544
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,040
I'm an Emergentile and Eloi Loy.

545
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:10,720
Loy.

546
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,340
No, you're all mixed up.

547
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,280
No.

548
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,640
See, you're a Rewardian.

549
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,120
You're not an Emergentile type.

550
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,660
Okay.

551
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,160
And that says that I'm a Rewardian because I know if I do something,

552
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:29,820
a bee will smack me or I will have a false temperature or my forehead will swell up.

553
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,760
Yeah.

554
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,720
Mm-hmm.

555
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,060
It's a version.

556
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,960
In the great books of the yoga masters and stuff, there's two.

557
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,560
There's a version.

558
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,240
And what's the...

559
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,440
There's an attraction and aversion.

560
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,140
That's all there is in the universe.

561
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,360
Hold on just a second.

562
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,400
Hold on a second.

563
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,040
Yeah, just listen to this background music.

564
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,800
This is the good part.

565
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,620
It's a Brandenburg Concerto's number five Allegro.

566
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,980
Wendy Carlos.

567
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,700
Do you like the old Carlos?

568
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:10,780
No.

569
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,220
Here's the really good part.

570
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,640
Get ready.

571
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,660
Here it comes.

572
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,400
You're going to be spinning around and around the room if you have headphones.

573
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,380
It sounds like a duck in a car.

574
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,040
Well, that's not...

575
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,380
Actually, that's not the...

576
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,160
See, I'm...

577
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,840
It's not the part you're thinking about?

578
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,560
That wasn't the part.

579
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,160
There's a part where it really slings you around the room.

580
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,620
Like you're a rubber ball.

581
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,880
A rubber ball at the end of a rubber band.

582
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,700
I see even before I heard it.

583
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:53,360
I knew somehow on a subliminal level that it sounded like a duck in a car.

584
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,080
I don't know if this has ever happened to you.

585
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:01,280
But like say you leave your windows open and you go to a farm area and a duck jumps in your car.

586
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,660
It eats like some triscuits or something that are mold rating in your backseat.

587
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,620
And while you get in the car, you drive off.

588
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,800
You roll up the windows.

589
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,600
And then also the duck starts freaking out.

590
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,160
You know?

591
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,140
Flip it out, man.

592
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,460
I've never heard of a duck jacking.

593
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,260
That's a duck jacking?

594
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,520
A car jacking by a duck.

595
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,820
When the duck jumps into your car as you're driving past a farm area?

596
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,080
No, it's when you accidentally abduct a duck.

597
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:25,680
Ah.

598
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,640
Duck abduction.

599
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,180
Duck abduction.

600
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,840
Abduct a duck today.

601
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,280
Let's not...

602
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,280
Those things are all about...

603
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,800
Man, I don't want you to muck up the duck abduction.

604
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,300
That one's hard.

605
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,460
That's hard to say.

606
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:40,880
Right.

607
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,720
Muck up the duck abduction.

608
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,740
Abduction.

609
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,120
Yeah.

610
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,720
And syringes and old oatmeal.

611
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:03,080
I'm looking at the streaming of WCSB's live stream relay status.

612
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,020
It says we have as many listeners as we've ever been able to display,

613
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,600
which is only 35.

614
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,520
But I suspect that it's just not displaying them all.

615
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:19,600
And there's the two German flags along...

616
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,420
It's like a whole bunch of American flags,

617
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,960
one Canadian flag,

618
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,180
and a Korean flag,

619
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,720
which always weirds me out a little bit.

620
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,740
And then the two German flags.

621
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,220
An international effort on your part,

622
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,300
a monumental sidekick,

623
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,880
and as far as entrepreneurialism,

624
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,120
listeners, concerns, and stuff,

625
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,920
you really bruised everything up pretty good.

626
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,480
But look at what's happened now.

627
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,920
There's a Korean person.

628
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,260
There's a Deutzlander person.

629
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,040
Too often.

630
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,440
In fact, it's time for them to wake up.

631
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,260
It's 3.30 in the morning in Leipzig.

632
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Wake up, Bucky.

633
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,600
Wake up, Tanya.

634
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,040
How do you know they're not playing Minecraft?

635
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,220
Well, I guess, yeah.

636
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:03,680
No.

637
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,460
They could.

638
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,640
They could be.

639
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,000
I think they're just sub-G.

640
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,880
They don't sleep.

641
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,820
They're like vampires.

642
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,740
pirates in nature, they stay out all night and stay up all day.

643
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,280
Well, eventually

644
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,700
they sleep for like five days

645
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,520
solid. That's the way Princess Wee and I do it between

646
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,560
shows. We do the show and then we stay up all night and then we

647
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,640
sleep for five days. It's called Blatchard's Coma, a type of

648
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,700
intermittent spasm in which the mind forgets its context

649
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:42,700
and so loses the entire track of everything.

650
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,600
The spatial dimensions in the person

651
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,520
in a coma. But they're still responsible in some way.

652
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,700
They see, they hear, and they can't do a damn thing about it.

653
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,640
Well, what's so ironic is that we're not really

654
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,520
on the air or even real. We're just being

655
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,640
imagined by a person in a coma.

656
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,940
Well, like I'm saying, I'm being

657
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,120
what is left of his mind.

658
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:16,300
I don't mind being one, but being two is too much.

659
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:16,860
You know what I mean?

660
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,400
Yeah, there are people who are in two comas. And in one coma, they're

661
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,340
imagining that they're in a coma, imagining

662
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,320
they're listening to this stuff on a radio. But they're really

663
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,400
hooked up to a machine. And that machine

664
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,600
is making funny noises.

665
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,520
It is.

666
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,540
And the thing is getting slower and slower.

667
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,640
I hope the nurses notice that if it's a typical hospital, they won't.

668
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,840
And you better start pushing that button next to the bed.

669
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:52,320
But if it's a typical hospital, nothing's going to happen no matter how many times you push that button.

670
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,580
Oh, she'll get around to its name in about a half an hour after you already expired.

671
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,060
Just like your license plates.

672
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,060
Right.

673
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,220
Meta, meta.

674
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,560
Right. They come in and go, what was he in such a hurry for me to get in here for? He's dead.

675
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,240
Why is his mouth and eyes both open and he's not moving?

676
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,340
Yeah, why should I, the nurse? This nurse job would be fun if it weren't for all these patients.

677
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:26,980
And the doctors these days, you have to, I mean, you can be at death's door and you still have to go to the doctor's office.

678
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:31,200
He won't come to your deathbed to talk to you.

679
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,140
Yeah, but a doctor will take you to death's door.

680
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,940
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

681
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,540
Yeah.

682
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,280
It's very true.

683
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,140
Yep.

684
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:45,680
Especially if you can go on a routine pleasure crew for prescribing all kinds of drugs that don't do anything but make the patient sick.

685
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:54,760
It's like, you know, it's like you go to Hawaii because you sold, I don't know how many units of flax or a pad.

686
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,420
When you only side effect these massive cerebral hemorrhages on the spot.

687
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,460
And say that you've sold enough of them to get the special vacation.

688
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:10,200
You could cross link it with other vacations of a similar.

689
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,180
Oh, Dave, that's how I pay for our vacations.

690
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:22,080
I sell snake oil and, and, uh, placebos.

691
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,280
Shiny, shiny bottles of snake oil.

692
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:25,800
Yeah.

693
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,940
Shiny placebo.

694
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:31,460
It's a placebo designed to be the antidote to all the other placebos.

695
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,680
It's the only placebo you need.

696
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:41,020
And we call it Bob Dobbs, our guru and hero, our savior.

697
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,380
Well, he's not really a savior.

698
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,400
He's not that well connected, but he's, he does give you slack.

699
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,260
Well, he didn't actually give you slack.

700
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,800
He reminds you that you already have slack.

701
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,700
You just haven't pinpointed it yet.

702
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:02,760
Well, like Devo used to say, you can have a certain degree of slouch mixed in with your slacks.

703
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,200
Which is a more, a crony inversion of the, uh,

704
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:07,540
Slouch?

705
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,380
Slouch.

706
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:08,600
Yeah.

707
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,380
The subgenius must have, the subgenius must have slack, but he can have slouch as well.

708
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,740
It won't hurt to have slouch.

709
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:27,840
And he perfectly described some of the overweight, you know, 500 year old men that come to X-Train stuff and expect to meet up with a 19 year old filly.

710
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,200
Not, you know, an actual girl.

711
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,180
Sometimes it happens actually.

712
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:32,260
It does.

713
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:32,820
I, uh,

714
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:33,780
I, uh,

715
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,220
I, uh,

716
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:41,740
I can't speak for myself exactly, but you've certainly been seeing it happen.

717
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:52,300
And it angers the young men sometimes or the even older men when they see a middle aged man with the young filly.

718
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:52,940
Yes.

719
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,080
Or the old heifer for that matter.

720
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,860
Sometimes I see gargantuan spirits.

721
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,240
I'm a heifer chaser myself.

722
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,960
I'm a, I lash out at heifers.

723
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,300
I like them heifers.

724
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:05,920
Yee-haw!

725
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,580
That's why I got this rope.

726
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,100
You are a Texas born boy or born and bred.

727
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,460
No, I wasn't born there, so I'm not really a Texan, Dave.

728
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,140
Oh, you were born in North Carolina or Connecticut?

729
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,240
I was born in Washington, DC, like the Antichrist.

730
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,260
Well, geez, oh man, I wish I would have known that.

731
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,240
I would have sent you a happy Antichristmas.

732
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,280
Yeah.

733
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,360
I mean, my parents didn't live there, but that was where I happened to come out.

734
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,540
Well, that's where most deviants come out, so to speak.

735
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:39,720
Yeah.

736
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:40,940
Uh-huh.

737
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,420
But you did have the South Carolina and Connecticut right.

738
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,480
That's actually my accent is South Carolinian, Connecticut kicking.

739
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:56,160
We were raised in Texas and then moved to Cleveland where I got Yankee-fied.

740
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,680
Well, it sounds like Southern Ohio a little bit.

741
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,960
It sounds like Connecticut mixed with actually Virginia.

742
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,040
Well, Southern Connecticut and Southern South Carolina.

743
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,560
So I'm strictly a Southerner.

744
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,320
I'm not very Yankee-Connecticut.

745
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,720
My mom's not from North Connecticut.

746
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,700
She's from South Connecticut.

747
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,080
So she's no Yankee.

748
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,540
She's no darn Yankee.

749
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,000
She wasn't a Yankee either.

750
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,840
Remember the giant hauberks they used to carry in the battle when they would fight the Yankees?

751
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,260
I mean, the Yankees.

752
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:31,820
When they would wear the big head loops and the armatures like a trumpet player, man.

753
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,820
Which world war are you talking about?

754
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,740
Well, it's not when the Habsburgs were divided.

755
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,620
It was something having to do with the great bank crash of 1925.

756
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:52,900
Oh, so you're talking about this world's, one of this world's world wars, not this world's war with any other world like the Martian War.

757
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,560
Well, gee, that would be much better.

758
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:59,220
So if you could have it be that, that would be the one I would choose.

759
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,740
Well, if only the common cold would kill all invaders, that would just be great.

760
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,200
That's how we beat the Martians.

761
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,620
We didn't beat them.

762
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:18,840
God, the smallest things that God in his microscopes created were there to give us colds and kill Martians.

763
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,880
That's what germs are for.

764
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,420
But still, you know, speaking of germs, I wouldn't want to get a colostomy.

765
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:30,060
I wouldn't want to be performed by a Martian because there's a serious headache and nasal drippage.

766
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,560
What, a colostomy of a Martian?

767
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,000
That wouldn't, that wouldn't work.

768
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,000
They don't have intestines the way we do.

769
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,080
No, he said he didn't want to receive a colostomy from a Martian.

770
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:42,620
Oh.

771
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah, especially if the ones, you know, kind of already had the bowel transplants like you had back on Tuesday.

772
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,100
Well, I've heard that the Martian vets are pretty good.

773
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,140
And if you become one of their pets, they will.

774
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,460
They will give you pretty good health care and food.

775
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,300
It's kind of monotonous.

776
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,500
Well, yeah.

777
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:08,000
Some people would, you know, would volunteer to be pets of the Martians, you know.

778
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,080
Well, we're already the pets of Martians, aren't we?

779
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:18,180
No, we're the pets of the conspiracy insofar as we still have to pay bills.

780
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,880
Well, I meant Martians colloquially, not colloquially.

781
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,640
What's the word?

782
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,320
I meant them euphemistically.

783
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:31,720
We're not so much the pets as the farm animals or the, well, really just the spuds of the conspiracy.

784
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:32,340
The cow, the spud, yeah.

785
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:38,240
Conspiracy is like a potato farmer and we're the taters.

786
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,320
We're the spuds.

787
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,620
And Reverend Tater is twice a tater.

788
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,640
He's more potated than any of the rest of us because his name happens to be Tater.

789
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,420
I wonder if that's just a nickname.

790
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,960
His real name might be Francis Herriot.

791
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,080
I'll try.

792
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,140
Gumfries.

793
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,060
Tater Gumfries.

794
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,960
That sounds like a nickname, doesn't it to you?

795
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,400
It does, yeah.

796
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,660
Like his real name's probably Francis Herriot Gumfries.

797
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,080
Yes.

798
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:10,160
It sounds like a script that was dropped off on, you know, on somebody's desk before Forrest Gump came along.

799
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,120
Tater Gumfries is a young Bumfries.

800
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,160
Princess Leia and I used to call people young Bumfries if they seemed to be agonizing youths.

801
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:20,900
A lot of them, a lot of them.

802
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,480
A bowl of food for us.

803
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,540
A bowl of food for us.

804
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:23,940
A bowl of food for us.

805
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:23,940


806
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:23,940


807
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:23,940


808
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:23,940


809
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:23,940


810
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,820
You're not a young Bumfries, are you now, Dave?

811
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,700
I've tried it.

812
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,400
The damage it did to some of my body parts is just disgusting.

813
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
But I still live on, you know, thinking that someday things will change.

814
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,380
I mean, it did that for me.

815
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,800
Well, I'm glad you have hope, Dave.

816
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,180
That's admirable.

817
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,940
Oh, Reverend Stang, you're so mean.

818
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:54,490
Hope.

819
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:56,810
So mean.

820
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:59,270
Well, why would he be mean?

821
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,510
Because I don't claim to have any hope.

822
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:02,890
That's the last thing I...

823
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:04,590
Oh, I've got plenty of hope.

824
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,610
I have hope for you, Dave.

825
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,270
Well, I have hope for you, too.

826
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:10,610
I just don't have any for myself.

827
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,910
Well, that's why we need each other.

828
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:20,770
What we need to do is we need to take all the world leaders and get a bunch of rocks

829
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,990
and make them stand on their own two feet.

830
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:22,990


831
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:24,990
Rocks where we laugh at them until they die.

832
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:30,510
Well, not die, but cry or something.

833
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:35,930
I don't think they would care if we laugh at them, because they're still world leaders.

834
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,950
They'd probably just continue ignoring us.

835
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:43,310
What you're saying is if we could put them on the rocks, then you're saying they wouldn't

836
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:44,010
be world leaders.

837
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,550
We would have dethroned them.

838
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:49,490
Or de-officed them, or whatever.

839
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,510
De-prime ministered them.

840
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:57,750
Their punishment slash re-education would consist of forcing them into absurd situations

841
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,970
that are very, very well...

842
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:01,890
There's a lot of good footage and stuff.

843
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,110
It goes viral.

844
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,230
Well, beyond that, everybody sees it all the time.

845
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:11,170
So, in other words, your solution is make the world leaders like the rest of us.

846
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:16,350
Well, here's Putin in a dress with one of those big, really high bouffant-type legs

847
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:16,910
and stuff.

848
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:20,510
He's real angrily serving a bunch of American senators.

849
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:25,350
He's got a cigarette hanging out of his mouth.

850
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:28,910
I don't know.

851
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,070
Putin in a pouf-hair?

852
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,090
That's a new one on me.

853
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:38,330
When you said Putin in a pouf-hair, it made a poo on the microphone.

854
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,110
You hear that little poo?

855
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:41,130
Poo-tin.

856
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,870
In a pouf-hair.

857
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:44,550
Oh, I didn't mean it.

858
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:44,910
Poof-hair.

859
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:49,850
I wish we could have...

860
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:49,950
Well, maybe we can't fix it.

861
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:50,710
I wish I could.

862
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:50,710


863
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:50,710


864
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:50,710


865
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:50,710


866
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:56,770
I wish we could have you in the station so that you could talk on the real microphones instead of on your phone mic.

867
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:00,170
And also you could hear the background music, which is lovely tonight.

868
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:05,050
Which is always so cathartic and enthusiastic.

869
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:16,050
It just puts you in a mood to take in some direction that, you know, like a ship setting out, the ship doesn't know where it's going or something.

870
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:21,690
And finds its true course well into the evening after everyone's gone to sleep.

871
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,810
Foreheads are sleeping, as usual.

872
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:31,650
I was ignoring you, Dave.

873
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,630
I'll hear that later.

874
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:38,030
Actually, I was setting up the last three minutes of the show.

875
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,590
Oh, ding-dong.

876
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:42,070
Well, it's not here yet.

877
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:44,410
That's about five minutes off still.

878
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:45,650
And Dr. Sinister.

879
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:51,250
Is not here at the studio to follow us here in Clevelandia.

880
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:57,370
Although we won't be followed by Dr. Sinister in everybody's headphones.

881
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:58,770
No.

882
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:04,210
At WREK, we're followed by Reverend Susie the Floozy.

883
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:05,030
Yes.

884
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:13,930
And at WORT, Reverend Sister Velveteen Sly is sandwiching us or scissoring us or something.

885
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:15,950
I hope to do better.

886
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:16,030
I hope to do better.

887
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,030
I hope to not be scissoring us.

888
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:18,170
Slicing.

889
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:19,270
Yeah.

890
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:19,970
Slicing.

891
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:22,150
And so forth.

892
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,010
And W-E-R-T worked.

893
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:29,570
Wait, there isn't one.

894
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:30,550
Or is there?

895
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:32,950
I'm all confused.

896
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:36,050
I can't remember the call letters of the other stations.

897
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:41,490
I feel like I should carry a list and say thanks to all the stations that carry the show.

898
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:43,830
That's for next week, Dave.

899
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,970
Also, it's time for us to be paid.

900
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:52,390
I should also mention that as I give them a reach around.

901
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:53,590
I need my own.

902
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:55,930
Yeah, I was just wondering about that.

903
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:58,310
I was wondering when, you know, some multi-multi-

904
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:00,050
How about the guy in the large?

905
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:00,810
How about the large?

906
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,310
He's a rock star now.

907
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:07,710
Just because he's a party guy, but still he's probably got enough money to-

908
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:10,570
Actually, he is sort of a rock star.

909
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,410
He's a video DJ in clubs.

910
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:12,910
Yes.

911
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:13,110
He does.

912
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:15,950
He sent me a link to a video.

913
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:15,950


914
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:15,950


915
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:23,330
A piece of music that was an MP3 that was 200 megabytes, which means it was like three

916
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:24,490
hours long.

917
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:29,890
I guess it was just something recorded while he was at work.

918
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:32,030
I like his work very much.

919
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,730
I thought you didn't like hardcore.

920
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,450
No, I like Laurie's.

921
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:37,470
I like the large.

922
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:40,730
Reverend Lunsome, angry cowboy large.

923
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:41,350
Yes.

924
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:41,810
Larry.

925
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:44,750
Yes, he's larger than life and he's fun.

926
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:52,110
Well, he's the only other person I know of who can do, who can imitate Dave doing dozens

927
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:53,430
of different accents.

928
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:53,970
Yes.

929
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:56,790
In a Finnish accent.

930
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:57,570
In a Finnish accent.

931
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:58,190
Yes.

932
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,750
He has a good, puts a Finnish on it.

933
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:02,870
So.

934
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:04,970
What's that Finnish accent?

935
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:05,570
That was well put.

936
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:06,810
That was well put.

937
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:07,830
I don't know.

938
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:11,650
You shouldn't show signs of disgust on the air.

939
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:12,770
That will make people cry.

940
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:14,850
There's rules against that.

941
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:15,910
Don't ever show.

942
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:17,550
Don't ever show signs of disgust on the air.

943
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:23,890
At least not with your own, not with the show, nor with the equipment, nor the listeners.

944
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:25,130
Only with the callers.

945
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:26,090
Right.

946
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:26,470
Well, yeah.

947
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:31,450
With callers, you have to show disgust because that's what all the other listeners want to hear.

948
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:35,010
I can be on the air with people with flanks and D's down and stuff on the counter, on the panel and stuff like that.

949
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:39,670
And start, you know, and start complaining about the producer.

950
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,010
Meaning, you know.

951
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:41,450
Me.

952
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:42,470
One guy in the studio.

953
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,890
No, the producer is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

954
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:45,790
The high E.

955
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,610
Popped of the Church of the Subgenius.

956
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,030
The living saint of sales.

957
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:50,550
The Slackmaster.

958
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:53,610
The avatar of Slack.

959
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,970
And the abattoir of Slack.

960
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:57,190
No.

961
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:02,050
And for those who don't know, this show is the Hour of Slack.

962
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:06,950
And we celebrate Bob's word and the Church of the Subgenius.

963
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:12,710
Although, obviously, we spend a lot of time just dithering and playing music.

964
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,730
And it's expected that you, the listener,

965
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:17,750
will go, what is this stuff they're always on about?

966
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:20,750
And just Google subgenius.

967
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:22,530
Just try to spell it right.

968
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:28,490
It'll say, do you mean, did you mean subgenius instead of subgenius?

969
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:29,870
No.

970
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:37,430
And then you'll be looking at our giant website and you won't know anything more after that.

971
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:38,930
But you still won't know.

972
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:39,930
No.

973
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:44,830
But eventually you would find out that we have books out there.

974
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:47,770
And those are, that's actually the good stuff.

975
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:49,010
That's the really good stuff.

976
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:51,450
But they're all out of print.

977
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:53,750
No, not really.

978
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:56,690
There's still one that's in print.

979
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,130
The rest you'll have to eBay them out.

980
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:05,650
But Dave, really, I'm going to have to wrap this up in a little ribbon.

981
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:07,310
Got to wrap this baby up.

982
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:14,250
In this case, it is more like a God's bandage covering your entire body from the sores and lacerations you have made.

983
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:16,290
That's right.

984
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:17,330
That is right.

985
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,350
Whatever, what he said.

986
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:19,050
What he said.

987
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:19,970
Whatever he said.

988
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:25,450
I say you are dressed up like a mummy right now because you have punched yourself in the nose.

989
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:40,490
And so we must slowly fade out all the babbling, bubbling voices and be something having to do with something.

990
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:41,610
I'm not sure what.

991
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:42,950
It'd be flibberty gibberish.

992
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:44,770
Yeah, flibberty gibberish.

993
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:46,370
This is gibberish.

994
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,550
And, uh, uh, um.

995
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:55,250
Ich wohne in Köln.

996
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:56,230
Hey.

997
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:58,670
Ich wohne in Köln.

998
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:03,270
Ich wohne in München.

999
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,230
Ich wohne in München.

1000
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,510
I live in Munich.

1001
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,310
Ich wohne in Cleveland.

1002
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:14,810
Ich wohne in Zürich.

1003
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:16,830
Ich wohne in Zürich.

1004
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:18,330
I live in Zurich.

1005
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:20,350
This is the end of side one.

1006
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:24,750
Please turn the tape over and continue on side two.

1007
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:30,290
But, but, but, but there is no side two on the CD.

1008
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:34,570
The German combination CH has two pronunciations.

1009
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:38,630
We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin.

1010
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:40,910
Batman and Robin.

1011
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:41,530
Batmobile.

1012
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:42,130
Batmobile.

1013
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:42,490
Batman.

1014
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,070
Batgirl.

1015
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:43,450
Batgirl.

1016
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:44,150
Batman.

1017
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:44,970
Batmobile.

1018
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:45,710
Batgirl.

1019
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:46,910
Batman and Robin.

1020
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:47,650
Batgirl.

1021
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:48,470
Batman and Robin.

1022
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:49,130
Batman and Robin.

1023
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:50,230
Batman and Robin.

1024
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:50,250


1025
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:50,250


1026
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:50,670
Batman.

1027
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:51,250
Batman.

1028
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:51,870
Batman.

1029
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:54,410
Batgirl.

1030
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:56,530
Batman.

1031
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:07,730
Batman.

1032
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:08,210
Batman.

1033
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:08,450
Batman.

1034
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:08,690
Batman.

1035
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:08,770


1036
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:08,770


1037
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:08,990
Batgirl.

1038
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:10,070
Batman.

1039
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:10,630
Batgirl.

1040
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:10,830
Batman.

1041
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:11,310
Robin.

1042
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:11,870
Batman.

1043
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:12,450
Batman girl.

1044
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:12,910
Batgirl.

1045
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:13,610
Batgirl.

1046
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:13,870
Batgirl.

1047
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:14,150
Robin.

1048
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:21,970
There is more. Much more.

1049
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:22,730
Why?

1050
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:25,490
But it will all be over. Soon.

1051
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:26,330
Good.

1052
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:27,110
Batman.

1053
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:27,630
Batgirl.

1054
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:28,110
Batgirl.

1055
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:28,450
Batman.

1056
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:29,090
Batman.

1057
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:29,570
Batman.

1058
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:29,950
Batgirl.

1059
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:30,650
Batgirl.

1060
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:31,650
Bat-tweezers.

1061
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:32,910
That's odd.

1062
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:34,150
Take him away.

1063
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:34,970
Good.

1064
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:39,150
Hello? Hello?

1065
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:39,650
Hello?

1066
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:48,950
From PR News in Washington, I'm plotting to help the extremists in Colorado, where the Ebola virus is spreading rapidly.

1067
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:54,770
Conspiring with a man she'd met online, she faces the possibility of 50 years in Denver.

1068
00:58:55,730 --> 00:59:00,250
John Kerry was bad. He will try the Ruthless campaign to seize more power.

1069
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:03,350
We're very encouraged, which has never happened before.

1070
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:09,310
Dow is 55, 1769, 58, 35, 45, 87, 1996.

1071
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,590
This is PR News.

1072
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:44,130
Pakistan has not experienced 2010 when six people lost their PR News.

1073
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:50,330
A United Nations panel of scientists has determined certain chemicals have been phased out.

1074
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:58,590
The government says it's taking up to 24 hours to pick up 50 million PR News that have yet to be tested for Ebola in Washington.

1075
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:01,990
For Sire, there is no more money.

1076
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:04,450
We gotta get some money.

1077
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:09,550
That dirty Turkish architect, Black Morton, Philip Martin, Perkaluma.

1078
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:11,290
I'll burn your first night alone!

1079
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:12,730
B-O-B.

1080
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:16,170
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1081
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:22,490
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1082
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:27,590
And not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1083
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:29,070
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1084
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:34,630
But if you truly love Bob, and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1085
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:39,630
you should go to subgenius.com, front page, or especially the radio, and search for Bob.

1086
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:39,630


1087
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:39,630


1088
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:42,070
Or the catalog store pages.

1089
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:45,430
And help out financially as best you can.

1090
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:53,430
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty, and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1091
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:56,390
But some of you still have jobs.

1092
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:03,290
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1093
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:05,710
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1094
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:09,070
All we're saying is that...

1095
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:14,490
Blowjobs could go the way of Stevejobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1096
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:18,290
We also take checks and money orders to...

1097
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:19,970
Subgenius Foundation.

1098
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:32,430
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1099
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:37,670
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1100
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:44,430
...

1101
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,230
This girl knew some stuff about funny people, and I did –

1102
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:01,410
Snacks! Money! Bob!

1103
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:01,790
...

1104
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:04,250
Sp reform wants you to make that as easy as possible to see what you're practically a woodblock!

1105
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:05,650
We'll you free your life!

1106
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:09,590
Stop doing that exact thing!

1107
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:11,350
Free pills!

1108
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:13,050
Sex, money, fog!

1109
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:15,870
Free pills! Sex, money, fog!

1110
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,630
Kill me! Sex, money, fog!
