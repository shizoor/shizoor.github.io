1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Look! No, I won't. Listen, you can't make me...

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,500
Step aside, open wide.

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,260
What?

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,780
It's the Longer Lift.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,020
Yes, sir.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,120
The Longer Lift was a madman.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:17,740
Maybe.

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,100
Yes.

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,180
The Longer Lift, the heavy subterranean temple of the sun.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,400
Oh, my arm. Oh, he plugged me right in the arm.

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,240
That was your fault.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
Well, they'll all return to their homes and live normal lives again.

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,260
Oh, that's bad.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,880
I'll be right back.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,060
Longer Lift!

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,300
And what does that mean?

17
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,060
Uh-oh, excuse me. What's the matter?

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,420
Bet you we got the same old malarkey.

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:50,900
What's that?

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,520
Well, oh, wait a minute.

21
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,220
The Soul Genius.

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,660
Oh, good.

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,300
Power of Swatch.

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,660
God, listen to him.

25
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,880
It's the same old...

26
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,540
stuff, all right.

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,480
Well, you practically can't resist it.

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,300
Good for you, too.

29
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,700
Yes, but free speech means the right to tell lies.

30
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,280
Shut up.

31
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:06,420
What?

32
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,200
Shut up.

33
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,700
Well, that's strange.

34
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,480
You're telling me.

35
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,760
Very strange.

36
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,760
Why, yes, sir.

37
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,140
Well, okay.

38
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,420
But something tells me we're in for trouble.

39
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,140
Bad trouble.

40
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,420
Have you ever opened your mind

41
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,880
with the sound of acts concerning U.S. foreign policy,

42
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,740
learned real American history,

43
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,000
or attended a meeting

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,740

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,840
I thank your Whioni

77
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,460
Thank you

78
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,000
Gas Chamber.

79
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,220
Gang, I'm here to frighten you.

80
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,180
My only purpose in telling you about accidents in the home

81
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,140
is to touch firearms that may be found in your home.

82
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,860
And, if possible, to help you touch any medicines

83
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,800
unless they're administered by an adult.

84
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,720
And to help you climb in or out of your tub

85
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,440
simply by coating the underside with a slip-proof material.

86
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,360
And here's something else.

87
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,200
Play safe by putting a rubber mat in the windows

88
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,580
unless they're adults present.

89
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,380
Because an invisible dry rot has weakened the windows.

90
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,040
Another important thing to remember is never,

91
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,040
and I mean never, be smart, play safe.

92
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,600
That can be prevented by something that seems to be the right thing,

93
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,280
but turns out I was loaded.

94
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,660
And I mean that.

95
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,580
So that you may remain alive and poisoned.

96
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,520
I stood behind her looking at the pink, fresh doll

97
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,000
that had been tossed out in the rain.

98
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,020
Oh, Bob!

99
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,100
Is he here?

100
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,120
Of course not.

101
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,460
He'd been drinking heavily.

102
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,020
He's wandering Chicago somewhere right now.

103
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,660
Oh, no.

104
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,120
It seemed cultured.

105
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,660
Why, Bob, what are you doing here?

106
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,840
You know it's not right.

107
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,440
No, no, I don't want him in here.

108
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,400
I don't want him in here.

109
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,100
I'll have to get rid of Bob and get some things done.

110
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,540
Of course.

111
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:44,900
Bye.

112
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,740
When we left there, he was wearing a big, toothy smile

113
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,500
as if he was trying to pick up a few bucks with a toothpaste ad

114
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,980
that reminded you of a furnace full of marshmallows.

115
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,240
His eyes were open, and he looked surprised like a baby,

116
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:57,560
and I said,

117
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,040
Stale beer.

118
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,900
I'd like to kill you.

119
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,980
I'd like to kill you.

120
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,380
Truth is fiction.

121
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,660
And this is Be Orbit, Be Not.

122
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,660
The Curtis family of London sure have a lot of lip.

123
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,900
After some time, the overgrowth of lip becomes so enormous

124
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,020
that the lower lip, which had been driven into the heart of a suicide,

125
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,260
took root and grew into a tree.

126
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,000
Be Orbit, Be Not.

127
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,960
General Townsend of London gave the Indians their first taste of fire water.

128
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,060
A good time was had by all until September 25th, 1927,

129
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,980
when some girls referred to the island as the place of drunkenness.

130
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,800
Be Orbit, Be Not.

131
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,340
When people say you're bright, they mean you've used drugs.

132
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,480
They mean you've changed their brain.

133
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,540
They mean you've...

134
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,240
Waste your brain.

135
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,120
For information, call 666.

136
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,500
All radio is dead.

137
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,020
Which means that these tape recordings I'm making are for the sake of future history.

138
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:12,980
If any.

139
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,000
Future history, I said.

140
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,240
Aren't you a little old for those things?

141
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,300
Yes, any.

142
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,480
Match.

143
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,440
The Martians can conquer the Earth in six days.

144
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,280
Is that...

145
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,120
the same number of days it took to create it?

146
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,720
But it's...

147
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,620
magic.

148
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,180
Ye god!

149
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,040
What a splendid idea.

150
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,240
Lead the way to Lilac Park, Ant-Man.

151
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,220
Yes.

152
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,100
Lead the way.

153
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,460
We all pitched in.

154
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,160
You won't regret this, Bertie.

155
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,940
Please lead the way.

156
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,840
We all pitched in.

157
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,900
I can't remember Lilac Park.

158
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,200
Is that near the zoo?

159
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,740
Or is that the place where they hung that child back in 1972?

160
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,980
That was the Hour of Slag.

161
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,640
Slag.

162
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,140
Slag.

163
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,200
Slag.

164
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,400
That you're thinking of.

165
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,760
And dear friends, this is the first time we've been...

166
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,800
in the studio.

167
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,560
The live WCSB studio.

168
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,100
And our ovarian glands are busted...

169
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,820
In the most longest while.

170
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,220
...while.

171
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,340
Ah, yes.

172
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,100
Yes, yes, yes.

173
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,240
It's so good to hear...

174
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,100
hear those headphone-boosted timbers...

175
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,760
Sure, Stanley.

176
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,520
...and splinters off of my wooden...

177
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,540
...my wooden...

178
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,060
...my face and voice.

179
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:37,340


180
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,980
Ah, it's so good to be here.

181
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,620
It's so good to be in one place...

182
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,620
Princess Wee...

183
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,360
...Wee Eye are both here.

184
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,020
...wee eye are both here.

185
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,700
...are both here.

186
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,320
...are both here.

187
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,740
...are both here.

188
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,980
Well, I...

189
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,900
...I...

190
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,380
...have some weird, weird, weird stuff to play.

191
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:54,640
...have some weird, weird, weird stuff to play.

192
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:54,660
Well, I...

193
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:54,660


194
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,800
It's playing in the background.

195
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,660
Our old friend, the subgenius saint...

196
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,080
My...

197
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,740
...Byron Werner...

198
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,640
...does a radio show at a station...

199
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,080
...Byron Werner...

200
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,260
...in Little Rock, Arkansas...

201
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,800
...where he lives now.

202
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:16,240
He does a radio show there called Rural War Room.

203
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,220
Now, is he a rural dweller?

204
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,000
Does he live out in the sticks, so to speak?

205
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,200
No, he lives in Little Rock, it's per se...

206
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,560
No, he lives in Little Rock, it's per se...

207
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,180
...oh, he lives in Little Rock, per se.

208
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,160
But to some people, that is rural.

209
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,200
Even the big city of Little Rock is considered hick town by some people.

210
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,760
Well, I thought he lived in one of those bedroom communities,

211
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,460
which consists of nothing but a bedroom out in the middle of the wilderness.

212
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,720
I think he lives in one of those coffin hotels.

213
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,100
Oh, well, those are popular now, too,

214
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,820
but I think they're not going to make as much money as they expected

215
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,300
because nobody's going for the vampire routine.

216
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:57,740
But if you were interested in Byron and Donovan Seward's rural war room,

217
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,640
at yahoo.com would be the place to contact them,

218
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,780
ruralwareroomatyahoo.com.

219
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,700
Now, Fernanda and Andy Lemur, and separately,

220
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,880
the good or bad, Norrell Preff did the collages

221
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,360
that took up the first part of the show,

222
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,100
and there's a lot more.

223
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,980
All of these collages that I have set up for this particular show

224
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,820
are sort of on the subject of brain damage.

225
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,820
Brain damage, indeed.

226
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,340
Now, you said these were not going to be collages,

227
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,900
but actual colostomies.

228
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,220
Right, these are colostomy.

229
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,720
These are parts that were removed from the artists and the cut-up,

230
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,980
the engineers that do these radio cut-ups and colostomy collages.

231
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,100
So it's a form of plagiarism or theft?

232
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,200
Well, we like to call it culture jamming.

233
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:58,420
That's what the modern-day art thief or art bum refers to.

234
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,000
Also, yogurt.

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,460
When you take other people's material and chop it up

236
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,420
and make it sound even worse than it already did.

237
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,020
Culture jamming, i.e. yogurt.

238
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,360
They do that to us.

239
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,420
I mean, every now and then I'll hear somebody has done that to us.

240
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,760
They chopped us up and spewed us all over their product.

241
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,280
And usually when you're...

242
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,580
Chopped up, dear friends,

243
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,660
they leave different parts in different places

244
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,560
so you can never be put back together again.

245
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,880
So if you expect one cogent thought from what you've heard from yourself,

246
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,300
don't expect it to happen again because it's just kind of a lead-on.

247
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,700
This whole particular episode of the show

248
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,140
is probably just going to be one non-cogent thought

249
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,040
that kind of snowballs along,

250
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,500
gathering moss and crud

251
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,120
and imagined paranoia.

252
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,060
It's going to be a lot of weird fantasies

253
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,240
as it drags its sorry butt across the airwaves.

254
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,420
I'm afraid that's what's happening right now.

255
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:04,080
This show is dragging its heavy, sack-laden butt across the airwaves.

256
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,020
There is synchronicity in this world and many others

257
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,300
if you just keep your eyes on the skyrocket.

258
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,880
Look over here on the left.

259
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,180
There's also a little, little, little, little, teeny, teeny, teeny, tiny man

260
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,280
living in a...

261
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
any tiny matchbox house.

262
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,300
Look in there.

263
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,660
There's a television set and a computer screen

264
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,360
and a radio and a phone.

265
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,740
It can hardly...

266
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,740
Can you live like that without a television set, though?

267
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,560
Don't you pretty much have to have a TV?

268
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,760
You must have some for a screen.

269
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,140
You cannot breathe without a screen.

270
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,680
It's all right.

271
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,180
Where do you get for it?

272
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,480
How could you loom?

273
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,640
If you don't have a screen, how are you going to loom, man?

274
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,540
How are you going to zoom in?

275
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,440
How are you going to zoom in?

276
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:47,680
Zoom in.

277
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:47,860
Zoom in.

278
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:47,880


279
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,100
Zoom in.

280
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,160
Zoom in.

281
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,280
Zoom in.

282
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,280


283
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,280


284
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,280


285
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,060
Zoom the lumen and...

286
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,880
Never wake up again.

287
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:54,980
Yeah.

288
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:55,880
A computer.

289
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,700
A computer is like a TV set now.

290
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,480
Floating in the darkness.

291
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,880
Little heads giving you commands.

292
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,560
You can hear them.

293
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,200
An influencing box the size of a shrunken skull.

294
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,920
And it makes a shrunken skull.

295
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,840
It makes you into a shrunken head.

296
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,540
Your head isn't physically smaller, but the inside...

297
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:14,920
Excuse me.

298
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,820
...actually becomes bigger because it has more empty space.

299
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,600
The more television you watch.

300
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,320
Because the TV is actually sucking your brain out.

301
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,020
You're placing your brain cells right now one by one.

302
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,500
And here's the first jump to its...

303
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,820
It's trading you entertainment for brain cells.

304
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,420
And that's what we're doing too, except that it's not that entertaining.

305
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,100
So we...

306
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,520
That's why we don't have many brain cells.

307
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,360
It's a vicious circle, you might say.

308
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,240
But as you breathe more cells in your mind,

309
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,800
then you have more brain cells.

310
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,160
You'll see the enrapturing comes.

311
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,820
And they all must become part of the great design.

312
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
You must buy.

313
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,320
You must live and breathe and think and do and be and be and be and be.

314
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,880
Along these lines...

315
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,160
We stayed at a cool B&B the other day.

316
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,200
...and for you...

317
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,640
It had that B virus.

318
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,200
The B&B virus that is causing B&Bs all over the country to close down and disappear.

319
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,020
Fly away.

320
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,560
They just disappear and never come back.

321
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,040
I thought that was the unremoved underwear of the elderly.

322
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,480
What? There was...

323
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,580
A fractious moment.

324
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,980
I get confused because there's so much news, you know.

325
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,620
We do have news, don't we?

326
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,940
I think it's better to cut this news up before it's even snouted out.

327
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,100
Oh, there is so much news.

328
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,880
There's just an overflow of news.

329
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,220
Well, we have a great source for news, which is ModaMac's Bulldada News Blog.

330
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,640
Dear friends,

331
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,820
if you've never checked this out on the internets, as they call them now,

332
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:55,840
you can go, if you're curious, to a place called modamac.com.

333
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,760
And he has a news service that is only the weirdest and most bulldada news.

334
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,800
There's another news service called signsofwitness.com

335
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,920
that our friend, Reverend John Shirley, has helped inspire.

336
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,100
But these are...

337
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,620
And that collects really scary news.

338
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,180
And it's a story about signs of the end times

339
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,720
that pretty much convinces you that the world is about to come to an end.

340
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,700
But this is all verifiable information.

341
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,500
The human world.

342
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,440
Is it not verifiable, real news?

343
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,300
Well, no, he actually throws in...

344
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:35,740
John, signsofwitness.com throws in special reports that he gets from anonymous people

345
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,640
that are really scary sometimes.

346
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,260
But he also uses, you know, the usual paranoid...

347
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,580
And what's the worming, earthworming that is going on and...

348
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,580
Signs of...

349
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,700
Well, just signs of crime and sickness and depravity.

350
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,620
But if he's getting...

351
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,240
Abomination!

352
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,780
But if he's getting inside information from a certifiable schizophrenic,

353
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,700
does he or does he not realize that one of the symptoms of schizophrenia

354
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,140
is the attending of secret meetings, the possession of secret papers,

355
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,240
the understanding of secret items, which no one else understands.

356
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,600
Well, speaking of which...

357
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,520
He does know that, doesn't he?

358
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,040
Yeah.

359
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,900
He, she, it...

360
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,860
Doesn't he know it?

361
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,220
Yeah, he does.

362
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,800
He does give you a fair, you know...

363
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,600
Warning that he was taking liberty...

364
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,480
Yeah, take it with a thumb in your butt.

365
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,540
Yeah, in your butt, yeah.

366
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,900
So, now...

367
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,500
But that reminds me, Alex Jones...

368
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,020
The Lady Liberty.

369
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,740
Our rival conspiracy kook...

370
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,380
That put him in the...

371
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,180
Alex Jones was arrested.

372
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,100
The Lady Liberty.

373
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,840
We saw this on the Bull Dada News blog.

374
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,100
It came from infowars.com.

375
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,240
Where it says...

376
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:41,360
The Lady Liberty.

377
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,980
Which is the site of prophecy.

378
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,860
Yes, it's a news flash, actually.

379
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,300
It's...

380
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,300
Alex Jones arrested by NYPD.

381
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,160
And it's...

382
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,700
Yes, it's very current here.

383
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,820
September 8th, 2007.

384
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,740
Media activist Alex Jones was arrested by New York Police Department officers

385
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,700
while filming a documentary about the sixth anniversary of September 11th

386
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,420
and joining the protest against the official version of what happened on 9-11.

387
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:15,380
According to Infowars sources, Jones was singled out by police from the head of a crowd

388
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,200
of about 400 9-11 Truth activists and protesters.

389
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:19,860
Hmm.

390
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,260
Heard in the background.

391
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,720
Some machines are made up of hundreds of...

392
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,840
He was verbally accosted and forced by the police officers to present identification,

393
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,680
which he was not carrying at the time.

394
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,560
...simple machine.

395
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:39,400
NYPD officers arrested Jones for unspecific charges and removed from the protest crowd.

396
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,440
The protest crowd is now in the area where he is currently.

397
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,600
Rob Jacobson, camera operator on Jones' documentary production crew,

398
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,480
indicated that a large portion of the protest crowd has moved to the precinct

399
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,640
where Jones is being held to ensure his fair treatment and safe release.

400
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,540
Some say Smith, some say Jones.

401
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,860
Either one, strip the flesh from your bones.

402
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,900
Beach party!

403
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,860
Some genius beach party!

404
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,020
Okay, here's the big problem with those days.

405
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,780
Some genius beach party!

406
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,380
These guys think they run the whole show, the Globemakers,

407
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,380


408
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,600
and the Goblins are taking over at the same time.

409
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:17,840
Well, he does speak the truth in some ways for a person who's very interested in his own career,

410
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,340
but I wouldn't add that because that's wrong to say that.

411
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,520
Well, you have to be interested in your own career to keep getting the message out.

412
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,200
I've been amazed.

413
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,380
That guy used to have to drive around in Austin with a bullhorn,

414
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,220
like a subgenius on a golf cart at X Day, you know,

415
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,920
preaching to whoever happened to be mowing their lawns.

416
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,620
And he changed that into a shtick now.

417
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,000
Right.

418
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,100
He's a real-time showbiz now.

419
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,740
And he's also picking up a lot of AM and FM stations with his straight-up conspiracy stuff.

420
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,400
Right.

421
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,980
Which is mostly documented stuff.

422
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:54,540
And friends, we actually recommend that you check out crazy men like the great Alex Jones.

423
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,800
And what's that really ridiculous one, the Rents.com?

424
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,280
God!

425
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,600
John from Ohio is also enlightening.

426
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,920
Have you ever heard of the character known as John from Ohio?

427
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,140
No, I know of Kurt from Tallahassee, though.

428
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,880
He's an elderly fellow who probably a union strong left background and stuff.

429
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:20,380
Well, he calls up programs across the country, and he's a full-

430
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,820
John from Ohio?

431
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,300
Yeah, that's his tag.

432
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,960
Oh, I guess all the prostitutes know him.

433
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,500
Now, hey, speaking of Johns, there's a John from Detroit, John Sinclair,

434
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:37,900
the famous old radical that went to prison and Abby Hoffman got kicked off the stage at Woodstock yelling about it.

435
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:45,540
Yes, he was the manager of the MC5 and a general activist, a thorn in the side of whoever's in charge.

436
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,520
He's been living in Amsterdam for the last couple of years.

437
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:55,240
He has a radio show on Radio Free Amsterdam, and we're going to go and be partying with him.

438
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,320
Get off of here!

439
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:56,880
And doing shows.

440
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,740
And please don't return.

441
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:06,960
Yeah, we're going to do shows with him at the Amsterd, the Subgenius Frop Cup, which is like a week-long event that coincides with the High Times Cannabis Cup.

442
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,760
No, this is just-

443
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,280
We're interested in frop, you understand, friends, not cannabis.

444
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,520
But it's a great audience because those stoned hippies will buy anything.

445
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,360
Just anything.

446
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,160
And so we'll be preaching the word of Bob.

447
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,820
Dr. Howell's going to be there, thanks to Roknar, who sponsored Dr. Howell.

448
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,360
And we're going to be hanging out.

449
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:35,960
We get to take over the milkweg during the days because Sarah Seeds is, I guess, sponsoring that or something.

450
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,460
I don't know.

451
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,380
When is it?

452
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,840
It's in November.

453
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,260
Oh.

454
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,860
Sort of the middle of late November, yes.

455
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,140
Yeah, it's going to be a busy November for subgeniuses.

456
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:51,320
Besides Kennedy Day, we have Baltimore Devival on, I believe, the 6th or the 10th.

457
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,260
I can't remember which.

458
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,860
It's a Saturday anyway.

459
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,220
In Baltimore with Reverend Carter LeBlanc and Pisces and amino acids.

460
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,280
It'll be like an indoor X Day.

461
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,740
Maybe we can drag Dave down there.

462
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,180
Who knows?

463
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,560
Yeah!

464
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,660
I used to love Baltimore.

465
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,840
It's like you'd have to drive is the problem.

466
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,780
It would be a long November drive and not good weather.

467
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,860
And then after that we have to drive to Holland, right, and do that cannabis cup.

468
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,160
All that yacking.

469
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,120
Howell is a...

470
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:25,200
It's on the foreskin hydrofoil, though, and you get there very, very quickly, at least if you're into rock, sock, rap or jazz.

471
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,280
Don't count the X's on the back of your eyes as any indication of anything spectacular.

472
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,620
I saw that Triple X movie, so it's real easy to get to Amsterdam.

473
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,300
That's the symbol of the city.

474
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,820
The logo of the city is three X's.

475
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:51,080
Do you click your little wooden shoes together three times and say there's no place like the Vondelpark and the Rijksmuseum?

476
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,920
Which I have dibs on, by the way.

477
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,280
When X Day comes, the aliens take us up.

478
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,560
Us dues-paying subgeniuses.

479
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,420
Not you, listener.

480
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,600
Us dues-paying subgeniuses.

481
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,440
They take us up.

482
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,260
We get powers to teleport parts of the earth that we want to preserve, such as...

483
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,500
And these are mine, so don't even try.

484
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,240
Let's not get in a fight on X Day.

485
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,020
I've got the Rijksmuseum, the Grand Canyon, and...

486
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,600
Oh, I know, Monument Valley.

487
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,380
Monument Valley.

488
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:18,860
That's right, Monument Valley.

489
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,700
Bryce Canyon.

490
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,700
I heard that you were renting the...

491
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,840
Is there anything you want us to save you out of Nigeria, Charleston?

492
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,060
Winning...

493
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,560
Screamers.

494
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,040
The end of the anthology.

495
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,460
Well, that's what I'm hoping.

496
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,420
I'm hoping that...

497
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,300
There's no memory at all.

498
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,020
I'm hoping there's no memory at all, but apparently there is a lot of memory if you

499
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,740
become a subgenium.

500
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:42,660
Well, we're talking about when the world ends and those who believe in Bob are lifted up

501
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,360
into the flying saucers.

502
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,860
Well, why is it so important to believe in him anyway?

503
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,780
Oh, you don't have to believe if you just spend the 30 bucks.

504
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,600
God, we don't...

505
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Why would you believe that stuff?

506
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,080
Well, of course...

507
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,340
Except to get on board those saucers in case they're there, you know.

508
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
So there is some documentation.

509
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,420
We're not telling people not to believe.

510
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,780
We're not telling people not to believe in other things.

511
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:07,140
We always suggest that people repent on your deathbed.

512
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:14,700
Always be ready to repent on your deathbed and, you know, repent of your sins just in

513
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:14,980
case.

514
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,660
You don't know.

515
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,880
What if the Southern Baptists are right?

516
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,520
I think that's a silly idea.

517
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,740
Well, one of those religions is bound to be right.

518
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,220
What if it's Church of the Subgenius?

519
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,480
Wouldn't that be ironic?

520
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,360
If you had to...

521
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,140
But that would be the perfect irony, see?

522
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,140
The Lord obviously has a sense of humor.

523
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,780
It's time to step right up and enjoy yourself any way you possibly can.

524
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,020
And here's your little booklet.

525
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,880
Sit right down.

526
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,500
I'd be surprised, frankly.

527
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,060
The first thing you're going to be in the gardening is hydroponic Buddhism.

528
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,480
Now, to repent in hydroponic Buddhism, the first thing you have to do is take off your shoes.

529
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,400
Now, remove those devices from your ears.

530
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,480
There's nothing else you want to hear right now.

531
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:56,820
What's that?

532
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,920
No, I'm sorry.

533
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,020
I'm sorry.

534
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:58,860
I know.

535
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,400
Okay.

537
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,880
Same, too.

538
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,400
Hydroponic Bouddhism.

539
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,180
See, there's another one.

540
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,040
We just invented another religion.

541
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,960
It's Bouddhism.com.

542
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,060
I got dubs on that.

543
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,340
Better file that domain name real quick.

544
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,460
Well, speaking of Bouddhism, here's just a one-liner news item for you.

545
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:26,580
The British fashion industry will come under fire this week for failing to send a strong

546
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,900
message out to women who are not ready to wear their best clothes.

547
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:27,900


548
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:27,900


549
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:27,900


550
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:27,900


551
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:27,900


552
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,340
Listen to this news arc.

The German environment of こころ nicht

556
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,840
And as Reverend Stank asked me, what is a size 0?

557
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,140
And, you know, I really don't.

558
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,620
I knew there was a size 1, which I thought was really funny, since I'm size 12.

559
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,560
I Irish, good.

560
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:48,560

00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:48,560

It's確 tree here.

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,860
Thank God.

564
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,760
are ghosts, right? Spirit beings

565
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,480
that are modeling clothes.

566
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,100
I can't think what else it means.

567
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,040
I mean, it could mean really, really...

568
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,620
It is undefined.

569
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,500
In mathematics, they would say it is undefined

570
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,640
or undefinable. When you multiply anything by

571
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,620
zero or zero divided by anything

572
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,740
is undefinable because it comes out

573
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,620
zero because...

574
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,120
But they could be like .0001

575
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,340
size

576
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,020
models on those runways.

577
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,660
I would say that a size zero is probably the women that look

578
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,580
basically like a skeleton with skin

579
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,640
laid over it. Well, I guess I must

580
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,680
be a size 12

581
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,760

582
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,920
You look like a swashbuckling

583
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,540
300-pound giraffe

584
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,800
wearing probably one of those

585
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,460
ska necklaces from the early

586
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,620
1970s or 60s

587
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,320
and probably

588
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,440
carrying a goot of cheese at your side

589
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,380
whistling to small children

590
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,620
and also some of the elderly

591
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,560
Danes of the neighborhood who have

592
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,400
given you their private

593
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,820
jellies that they store

594
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,220
in the...

595
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,460
And those private jellies are available

596
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,340
at the county fair here, heard in the

597
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,540
background at Denton,

598
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,220
Texas. This is

599
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,420
Brave Combo

600
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,420
in the background. I hadn't heard

601
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,420
from those guys in years. I used to, when I

602
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,360
lived in Dallas, we ended

603
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,260
up doing shows and things

604
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,340
and protests.

605
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,300
The Brave Combo and Church of the

606
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,040
Subgenius were the only two Dallas

607
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,080
bands that would show up at the

608
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,320
Rock Against Reagan

609
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,900
stage outside the

610
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,320
Republican National Convention in Dallas.

611
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:28,900
How about that?

612
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,260
With the Dead Kennedys. I didn't know who the hell

613
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,600
the Dead Kennedys were at the time.

614
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,480
At the time, neither did they, especially after the assaults

615
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,240
by the Comodos. They knew who we were! That was the

616
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,880
weird thing. Jello Biafra,

617
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,900
I guess it was him, came up and said

618
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,840
that they were into Bob from

619
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,820
San Francisco. And Bob was the

620
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,880
coolest thing in the world in

621
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,940
San Francisco for about

622
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,460
six months in 1984.

623
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,440
Which is a microsecond in the

624
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,140
fame meter of the

625
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,700
overall. It was enough that the Dead

626
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,000
Kennedys loved Bob. But I

627
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,740
had not, since I lived in Dallas,

628
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,740
I didn't know who the... I knew they were

629
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,620
a band that Philo liked and

630
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,960
hung around with. Philo used to

631
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,760
go to Dobstown. He got to go to all those

632
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,860
parties. Well, that's how he

633
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,600
wants to... I never got to do any of that stuff,

634
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,940
really. So you didn't

635
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,720
have the multi-similar and

636
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,580
the convergence accident that

637
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,040
Philo did where he lost his

638
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,680
hairy spleen? Is that

639
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,720
what they call the organ? No, but what I did,

640
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,540
I had...

641
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,880
Bob, you know, had visions in the hospital

642
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,540
after he had undergone a hernia

643
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,540
operation. And I wanted to be like Bob

644
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,340
so much that I

645
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,700
deliberately gave myself a hernia

646
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,660
and went in the hospital to

647
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,880
get a hernia operation.

648
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,800
And that was how... what a devoted

649
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,900
Bobby I was. I was like the first

650
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,140
Bob.

651
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,720
I wasn't really...

652
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,700
Actually, I think Henry Kissinger may have

653
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,720
been the first because Bob knew Kissinger

654
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,140
in the

655
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,620
early 50s.

656
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,660
So now you're saying Kissinger and

657
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,540
Bob gave you an early artificial

658
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,660
kidney hernia or

659
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,640
whatnot? No, I was just imitating Bob.

660
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,380
I was just being a fanboy of

661
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,680
J.R. Bob Dobbs. So you were

662
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,460
just being like a Bobby and suddenly

663
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,500
a hernia popped from your abdomen?

664
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,540
I wanted to have visions.

665
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,500
I heard that if you were in the hospital,

666
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,320
for a hernia

667
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,400
operation and

668
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,480
cornea licking, then you would

669
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,340
see Bob.

670
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,920
And I wanted to

671
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,560
see Bob. So why did

672
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
you not? I'm just

673
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,540
asking you. I did, sort of. This is

674
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,440
a commonly prescribed way

675
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,620
of reaching that goal. I had a

676
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,380
trans... I had a

677
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,420
transcendental experience,

678
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,000
yes.

679
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,240
Giant nurses came and

680
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,420
injured me, did things to me.

681
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,980
And that's good enough? Yeah.

682
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,500
Yeah. Except for if, like, there are

683
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,360
like nurse diesel types.

684
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,540
Remember when they named them after trucks

685
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,100
and things?

686
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,740
The nurses? No, no, no, no, no.

687
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,600
Ratchet. Nurse Ratchet. I remember

688
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,340
her. I had her for years.

689
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,720
No, she was named after a tool. Some of them

690
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,640
are named after trucks and stuff like

691
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,280
that, like Nurse Sonoma.

692
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,680
Nurse... Oh, I was

693
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,480
thinking of the Partridge family being

694
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,480
incinerated by that crazy guy. Never mind.

695
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,560
I guess.

696
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,300
This is your old friend Tom Weasel here,

697
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,040
with his kitchen and some time,

698
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,200
checking on some hot and groovy jazz,

699
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,120
and we'll sit right back and have a

700
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,220
car mania at that part.

701
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,220
Though I'm afraid not.

702
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,540
Not that part of my brain, no, but

703
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,540
you can come on in, sit right

704
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,200
down and relax.

705
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,380
Ow!

706
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:43,920
Ow!

707
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,740
Ow!

708
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,200
Ow!

709
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,220
Ow!

710
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,400
Ow!

711
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,300
Ow!

712
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:54,720
Ow!

713
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:54,720


714
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:54,720


715
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:54,720


716
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:54,720


717
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:54,720


718
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:54,720


719
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:54,720


720
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:54,720


721
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:54,720


722
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,340
Ow!

723
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:58,940
Ow!

724
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,380
One, uh, piece of

725
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,420
one of the particular article I was interested in

726
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,060
was, uh, I think it was

727
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,980
3,000 quarts and very

728
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,700
overst страшion.

729
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:26,860
And I think if you lost yourself somewhere, you could probably find your way back just by using these common pieces of articles of faith here.

730
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,740
I don't know, strewn out on the floor.

731
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:34,980
The first one is by Reverend Reverend... No, it's by the Princess Weir... No, no, wait.

732
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,720
It's by Harriman B. Tuckerwood.

733
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,720
By Pinkerton.

734
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,700
I figured my personal privacy I dropped on Spadnagate was because his breast was moated in his shoe pocket and left.

735
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,260
Crumbling, knobby, ramshackle, leaky, bobbing, huge, creaking, grimy, greasy grasshoppers.

736
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,380
I would like to see the wedding.

737
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,240
Oh, I'm... I'm... I'm... Oh!

738
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,800
Because Odiperl just swiped.

739
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,960
You knew no one.

740
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,320
No one, you know.

741
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,640
No.

742
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,720
Outside, Dr. Hunt, I'll be dating anything I'd sell anything's correct.

743
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,860
It was Jason that compared like a book was a pet that was the oil well of this Hollywood.

744
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,860
The change still was flat when you let them hide out in quiet.

745
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,620
I've been hunting wetbacks for two months.

746
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,320
Hide!

747
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,000
Hey, wake up in there!

748
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,000
Who is it?

749
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,080
Drug addict.

750
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:38,700
Drug addict?

751
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,160
Just a minute.

752
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,180
What do you want?

753
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,180
Narcotics.

754
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,040
Not for me, but I beg for my kid.

755
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,460
You won't have to.

756
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,620
We'll see if we can get you some drugs.

757
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:50,780
Diego?

758
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,880
Go ahead, senor.

759
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,460
Come on, give me the stuff.

760
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,320
Man was a drug addict.

761
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,920
He's probably just as well off dead then.

762
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:01,700
Mm-hmm.

763
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,480
Let's go.

764
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,560
Oh, then it's all gone.

765
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,540
Well, yeah.

766
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:18,140
Thanks to my old life Diehardże.

767
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,040
Durge!

768
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,700
I hope you enjoy the Vogue stage for getting your future right.

769
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:19,700


770
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,920
Me t'embrouilles si tu n'es pas heureux.

771
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,600
Boy, I'm going to bed.

772
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,680
Et puis mon amour mèche !

773
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,300
JuТ pour une bA dire-je.

774
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,000
Doød Christ, if y t'es pas trop simplé,

775
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,680
tu redescris theommt content de The End of Our Daily.

776
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,680
Dispute externs de mand memories n'est-ce pas exemplaire!

777
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:44,900
You be the pilot, I'll be the passenger

778
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,060
You want some cookies, I'll be the messenger

779
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,820
Cause I was born to follow

780
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,900
In the footsteps of the past

781
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,000
I'm getting dumber baby

782
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,160
But I'm free

783
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,420
I'm alive

784
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:22,260
You be the butcher, I'll be the dead pig snout

785
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,360
You be the farmer, I'll be a summer glow

786
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,420
Cause I'm caught between the bad thoughts

787
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,100
And the sunshine

788
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,140
But still I'm free

789
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,140


790
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,820
I never take out

791
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,180
I never raise the teardrop

792
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:42,040
So I'm free to shout

793
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,720
I'm getting dumber

794
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,880
I'm getting dumber

795
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,100
I'm getting dumber

796
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,680
Dumber

797
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,260
I'm getting dumber

798
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm getting dumber

799
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,320
I'm getting dumber

800
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,140
I'm getting dumber

801
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,460
I'm getting dumber

802
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,600
I'm getting dumber

803
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,320
I'm getting dumber

804
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,720
I'm getting dumber

805
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,620
I'm getting dumber

806
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,800
I mean, come on, when I was young

807
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,240
The big thing was airplane glue

808
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,820
Put it in a bag and snip it

809
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,020
Airplane glue

810
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,320
It's a little bit further now

811
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,160
Between the haves and have nots

812
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,720
Airplane glue

813
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,040
What kind of a moron are you?

814
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,640
Painfully obvious

815
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,120
Painfully obvious

816
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,120


817
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,840
Painfully obvious

818
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,600
I think you're just stupid

819
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,540
I think you're just stupid

820
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,880
But Bob, still, it is a self-perpetuating cycle

821
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,720
Drugs

822
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,320
Did you write that down?

823
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,260
You're wasting your time

824
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,780
Airplane glue

825
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,680
There was alcohol before that

826
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,240
And who knows what

827
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,000
I mean, it's always come so much

828
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,740
Drugs

829
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,780
Hi, Bob

830
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,440
Nope

831
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:52,720
Nope

832
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,180
Really?

833
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,340
You say so

834
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,540
Cornflakes are addictive

835
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,240
Go away

836
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,320
I don't think

837
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:01,940
Precisely

838
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,120
It's a bad thing

839
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,900
Precisely

840
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,120
Dude, it's a bad thing

841
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,720
Bad thing

842
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,160
Whatever

843
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,880
Whatever

844
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,100
Exactly, Bob

845
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,820
Hello, Bob

846
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,500
Bob, you beat me to the punch

847
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,780
I mean, come on, when I was young

848
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,220
The big thing was airplane glue

849
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,200
Hey, thanks a lot, dude

850
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:18,880
I gotta get out of here

851
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,620
Because the show's over

852
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,180
Not really

853
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,160
No, not necessarily

854
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,060
I think Noral Pref

855
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,880
Of Noralpref.com did that

856
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,700
Oh, do you think there was something incorrect

857
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,860
About his sinus passages?

858
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,100
And on that song, I think it was

859
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,300
I'm getting dumber

860
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,260
The name of the

861
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,020
That was emailed to me

862
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,780
By somebody

863
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,960
Loops

864
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,620
And I

865
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,960
It's not on this log

866
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,020
And I cannot access the data

867
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,700
I just accessed the data

868
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,720
It was

869
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,560
Loop

870
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,080
Aznavour

871
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,920
From rainy Manchester

872
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,760
Which can be reached by way of

873
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,500
Paul Cordwell

874
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,820
At hotmail.com

875
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,900
Loop

876
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,280
Aznavour

877
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,760
But it is better than any sound you've heard before

878
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,640
It's more brain damaged

879
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,700
And that's our theme for tonight

880
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,520
Is Dane Bramagers

881
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,880
And isn't it quite a wonderful, wonderful thing we do

882
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,000
When we scrape the insides of our skull

883
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,260
And we lift our pineal glands

884
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,460
Our little third

885
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,160
Or however many

886
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,780
Our little, little tiny micro-eye

887
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,820
Our internal eye

888
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,000
Towards the idea of Bob himself

889
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,240
Itself, itself

890
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,860
Yes, you look up to Bob

891
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,060
But not just with your normal eye

892
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,060
You've got to get in discernment

893
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,680
In the spirit

894
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,100
In the vision

895
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,340
So that you whiff-read his

896
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,440
His presence-ship

897
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,460
His divine presence-hood-ship

898
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,240
Through your third eye

899
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,700
Or your third nostril

900
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,320
You cast a disparaging expression

901
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,640
In his general direction

902
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,800
And everything comes to a halt

903
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:02,800


904
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,220
And everything comes out in a flash-read

905
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,240
Backwards

906
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,740
It's immediately accessible and available for you

907
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,800
And that's why we recommend that

908
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,400
Most of you out there

909
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,140
Begin the silence now

910
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,840
Now, the silence is

911
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,580
A vast ocean

912
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,900
It's a big place

913
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,820
And you'll probably get lost

914
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:29,220
You need to be told what to do

915
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,680
Now pay attention

916
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,340
Now listen to me

917
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,060
When I say the words

918
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,620
You hear that, kids?

919
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,400
You got it?

920
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,020
You got the instructions?

921
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,720
Let's move on

922
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,940
I think I missed the last part

923
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,800
Follow them carefully now

924
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,440
And now for the news

925
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,760
This is more from

926
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,160
Modemac.com's

927
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,140
Bulldada news blog

928
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,740
Speed Cave is in the background

929
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,160
Incidentally

930
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,320
Of Speed Cave.com

931
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,080
Comix versus the god

932
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,300
Bavarers

933
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,200
Bavarers?

934
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,060
Bavarers

935
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,400
That's B-O-V-V

936
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
With two V's

937
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,580
E-R-E-R-S

938
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,940
Comix versus the god

939
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,420
Bavarers

940
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,500
Religious groups have been forced

941
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
To stop using catchphrases

942
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,580
From popular British comedians

943
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,440
To try to persuade youngsters

944
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,380
Into church

945
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,580
Posters featuring such lines as

946
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,920
Yeah, but no

947
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,520
But yeah

948
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,800
And am I Bavard?

949
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,240
Have been withdrawn

950
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,900
After lawyers took action

951
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,480
To stop the breach of copyright

952
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,040
Christian Publishing and Outreach

953
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,200
Was selling a pack of the four posters

954
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,020
Carrying the catchphrases

955
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,840
For 25 pounds a set

956
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,660
Saying they were the

957
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,360
Quote, ideal way to reach out

958
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,600
To today's youth

959
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,560
Each featured the comedy line

960
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,760
Followed by a quotation from the Bible

961
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,240
So beneath am I Bavard?

962
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,820
Ran Alaska's

963
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,760
Catchy passage

964
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,420
From the Gospel of Matthew

965
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,320
Saying, do not worry about your life

966
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,320
What you will eat

967
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,540
Or what you will drink

968
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,000
Nor about your body

969
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,820
About what you put on

970
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,340
Is life not more than food

971
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,900
And the body more than clothing?

972
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,280
Don't worry about eating

973
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,680
And all that other stuff

974
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,900
Or your job or anything

975
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,180
Because God's more important

976
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,060
Apparently the head of the

977
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,760
U.S. federal government agency

978
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,580
That doles out benefits to disabled veterans

979
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,820
Is under fire for saying

980
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,180
Bible study is more important

981
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,840
Than doing my job

982
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,400
Yes friends

983
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,340
Veterans for Common Sense

984
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,420
And Military Religious Freedom Foundation

985
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,860
Demanded an investigation

986
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,680
Of Daniel Cooper

987
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,160
President

988
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,960
Bush's Undersecretary

989
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,960
For benefits at the

990
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,700
Department of Veteran's Affairs

991
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,460
And they complained

992
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,880
Because Cooper was

993
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,160
Appeared in a fundraising video

994
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,820
For the evangelical group

995
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,800
Christian Embassy with a using of an isolated website

996
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:01,800


997
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,180
a bunch of other Bush higher-ups.

998
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,220
We're very concerned about this because hundreds of thousands of veterans

999
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,760
are waiting for their benefits while Cooper himself says that promoting his religion

1000
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,220
is more important than helping the veterans.

1001
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,660
Since Cooper was appointed head of the Veteran Benefits Administration,

1002
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:25,840
the numbers of veterans waiting on their disability claims has doubled since 2002.

1003
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:31,900
On average, a U.S. war veteran must wait six months for an answer to their application,

1004
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,400
and it can take up to three years.

1005
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:41,160
Also, VA hospitals and clinics and so forth report that more than 52,000,

1006
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:48,460
52,000 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

1007
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:55,480
But under Cooper's leadership, less than half of those veterans were approved for disability compensation.

1008
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:04,260
The group is also upset that Cooper gave his top aide a $33,000 cash bonus

1009
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,160
while the claims backlog grew larger for the actual veterans.

1010
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,400
He's prostituting his position.

1011
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,520
He could have done just as poorly, says this guy,

1012
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,540
as he's done by sticking a German shepherd or a cactus on that job.

1013
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,360
So, friends...

1014
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,820
Truth is stranger than fiction.

1015
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:31,500
Yeah, there's this Bible beater who's apparently beaten off Bibles

1016
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:37,300
instead of making sure that those poor devils coming back from the meat grinder

1017
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,340
get their hospitalization and their pills paid for.

1018
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,480
They ain't got no pills, friends.

1019
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,060
They don't have the good pills.

1020
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:53,340
I mean, okay, they did go and volunteer for the worst job in the universe,

1021
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,540
but they did their job.

1022
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,220
Got shot up, beat up, traumatized.

1023
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,200
Now they should get the good pills.

1024
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:00,920
General Pirate...

1025
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,660
Look what happened to Dave.

1026
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:08,940
Dave is a good example of what happens when you don't get the good pills

1027
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,780
and can only get the bad, bad pills.

1028
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,540
Talk to Tony.

1029
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,800
Well, that was a short 300-pound snack from Mr. Presument,

1030
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,420
the leader of this free nation of liberties and other incidental items.

1031
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,820
We'd like to thank you for watching.

1032
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,680
We'd like to join with us, if you possibly could join,

1033
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,720
at your knees or other different joints in your bodies.

1034
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,720
Bring yourself together, if you possibly can,

1035
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,660
for Freedom's Vanguard,

1036
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,220
a very special event taking place across the land,

1037
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,000
in favor, not only in favor,

1038
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,460
but in earnest support and sincere respect

1039
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,480
for all the naval officers with a hiatus hernia.

1040
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,600
And not only those, but the ones who've never come back

1041
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,360
from a bad bowel movement,

1042
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,680
an incorrect thought,

1043
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,560
or a trick around the corner.

1044
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,380
This is what we believe.

1045
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,500
Uh, I think it's...

1046
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,460
Is that what we believe?

1047
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,400
Uh, I believe...

1048
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,320
Yeah, look at my script says...

1049
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,360
No, no, I answered your question.

1050
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,280
We have to believe.

1051
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,660
It is what we believe.

1052
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,680
This is what we believe.

1053
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:18,300
Friends, do you believe that's really Osama bin Laden on that new tape?

1054
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,740
Well, according to this, uh, kook site, rymph.com,

1055
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,520
it can now be reported that that tape is fake.

1056
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,240
As they've reported, Osama bin Laden's been dead for six years from kidney failure.

1057
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,840
The new videotape was made in the 90s,

1058
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,180
was dubbed and spliced with the assistance of the Israeli Mossad.

1059
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,240
Copies of the fake tape were actually kept in a vault of Newsweek magazine for the last 30 days.

1060
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:41,920
Item?

1061
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:46,400
The 9-11 black op was originally staged for both political and economic objectives.

1062
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,920
First, the current occupational government, the Bush administration,

1063
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,480
needed to legitimize a stolen presidency.

1064
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,440
Second, the 9-11 black op gave Bush group

1065
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,860
executive emergency control over U.S. Treasury

1066
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,900
and the power to devalue the U.S. dollar

1067
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,540
and take control over private national security custodial accounts

1068
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,740
which were under power of the attorney of Ambassador Leo Wanta.

1069
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:07,500
Uh-huh.

1070
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:12,840
Should Osama bin Laden's death be confirmed and certified by the U.S. government and media elite,

1071
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,420
billions of dollars in the custodial account by contractual agreement

1072
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:22,380
will revert back to the private corporation set up for the purpose of removing the Soviets from Afghanistan.

1073
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,420
Newsweek magazine and climate news.

1074
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,180
The closet homosexual John Meacham have been the cheerleaders

1075
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:34,240
for the unelectable closet lesbian Hillary Roddenhurst Clinton

1076
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,940
and the unelectable Barack Hussein Obama.

1077
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:47,420
That's what somebody would say on RIMF.com.

1078
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,420
Distantly connected story.

1079
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,440
Firms wising up to the power of the pink dollar.

1080
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,420
A Reuters report from the U.S. government.

1081
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,120
A new report from Barcelona targeting the gay consumer

1082
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:04,740
is proving lucrative for some businesses as gay Spanish entrepreneur Juan Julia has found.

1083
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:10,520
But the potential of the pink dollar remains for many firms a missed opportunity.

1084
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,980
Attitudes toward lesbian and gay advertising are changing

1085
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,340
as more firms stop worrying about whether marketing specifically to gay consumers

1086
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,500
could alienate the general consumer.

1087
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,480
My friends,

1088
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,920
Bob doesn't care what color your dollar is or your euro.

1089
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,860
He wants your row.

1090
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,180
He wants your dollar.

1091
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,280
He wants it whether it's pink, green, or whatever color.

1092
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:40,820
He doesn't care what gender you bent yourself into or out of.

1093
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,420
He doesn't care about any of that.

1094
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,720
He wants your love and your money.

1095
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,740
It's love and money that's what it's all about, baby.

1096
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,640
He wants you to believe in him.

1097
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,460
Actually, he's not the answer, but neither is any of you.

1098
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:52,800
He's not the answer to anything else.

1099
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,920
And that's his whole point.

1100
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,760
Well, one of his pointy little things, anyway.

1101
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,260
Someone has to go let...

1102
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,800
What's his pointy little thing?

1103
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:00,940
We have to...

1104
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,140
They're trying to break the doors down, friends.

1105
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,160
They're trying to get in here.

1106
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,280
They're gonna Koresh us.

1107
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,560
They're gonna Jim Jones us.

1108
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,220
But we're gonna get this message out.

1109
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:10,900
Oh, thank God.

1110
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,620
They're not gonna shut us up.

1111
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,080
Thank Dubs, praise Dubs, that at least we're protected by...

1112
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,420
The word Bob is gonna be broadcast in the...

1113
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:20,440
...by those same gay paramilitary group that is protecting the pink dollar,

1114
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,460
the fighting nectarines.

1115
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,700
Just like little tiny peaches, they've surrounded the aura here,

1116
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,320
and to me, it's quite a dismal aura.

1117
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:30,240
It smells...

1118
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,980
Oh, they smell better than most soldiers.

1119
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,100
They smell so much better than the average soldier.

1120
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,740
Well, of course they smell so much better than average soldiers.

1121
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,340
But they're not average, and they're not real soldiers.

1122
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,480
They're not even human beings as we commonly know human beings.

1123
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,460
They're human beings as we uncommonly know,

1124
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,240
fizzooks and zarbzins.

1125
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,340
Have you never heard of these phrases or others?

1126
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,400
Well, if not,

1127
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,220
then please go examine yourself less lightly.

1128
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,380
Take a look down there where it hurts,

1129
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,900
and don't be afraid to measure the aura in the stinky parts.

1130
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,020
Once you stand back three or four feet from the screen,

1131
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,040
and take a good look at your skeleton,

1132
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,540
you'll realize you're made for the company,

1133
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,560
and there's more purpose in your life than you ever wanted.

1134
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:12,800
Well, I...

1135
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,580
Take more Pogro, take more Pogro.

1136
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,080
What if a dog is misremembered to take on some contactless Pogro?

1137
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,560
More people have let have cold, I'm quite Pogro.

1138
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,760
More organ takes for more complete relief than ever

1139
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,860
is had cold on the animal.

1140
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:25,720
More Pogro.

1141
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,920
More Pogro.

1142
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,380
Waiting for you at your drugget under the name of Grove Misery.

1143
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,240
Fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.

1144
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,360
Fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.

1145
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,640
Fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.

1146
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,820
Fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.

1147
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,640
Slow bob in the lower dimensions.

1148
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,140
Finish nabbing rolling the bobbles.

1149
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,420
Slow bob in the lower dimensions.

1150
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,980
Over here, Bob. Bob. Bob.

1151
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,580
Over here.

1152
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,820
Time's up for now, Bob.

1153
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,100
Slow Bob brought back to life.

1154
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,900
Slow Bob in the four dimensions.

1155
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,180
Not only will the contents of the one true pipe at last be told,

1156
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,580
No, no, it won't be told. We're not going to tell that.

1157
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,260
Go tell it on the mountain.

1158
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,980
Stop censoring yourself, Vagina.

1159
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,960
Don't you realize that every American's got a part to play in the big puzzle that's about to unfold?

1160
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,240
Think of it.

1161
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,240
You and your kids and my kids are all going to have kids someday.

1162
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:39,920
Yeah, yeah.

1163
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,380
And they're all going to carry weapons and different kinds of guns and things, see?

1164
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,240
And they're going to go out and shoot bad guys and good guys and shoot them up real good, see?

1165
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,740
Because that's the American way.

1166
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:52,700
I'm sorry about my breath, honey, but it's something to do with...

1167
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,740
Oh, yeah, that's okay.

1168
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,660
The Department of the Interior.

1169
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,440
Breath? Yeah, right.

1170
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:59,220
Yeah, right. But it's not a secret anymore.

1171
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:04,340
Well, anyway, you and your children and my children's children and Stang's replicants

1172
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,160
and all the other people that resemble him, at least the ones, you know, the nano-churn,

1173
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,580
and they're coming out and around, coming out and around, going to get guns and guns.

1174
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,940
Even the old nanobots?

1175
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,880
Oh, even the old nanobites and boxes.

1176
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,040
They're all going to be wearing trunks, see?

1177
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,320
Like huge trees.

1178
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,280
They're going to shoot everything.

1179
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,620
Everything in sight, because that's the American way.

1180
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,680
Shoot them up, huh?

1181
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,320
Shoot them up.

1182
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,820
Take a look over there.

1183
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:25,880
That's your target.

1184
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,280
See that man with the sphincter on his head?

1185
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:28,600
Yeah.

1186
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,380
That's where I want you to point your finger.

1187
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:30,980
Oh, okay.

1188
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:31,580
Yes, right.

1189
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,540
Point it right over there.

1190
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:32,960
Okay.

1191
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,080
Now lift up the hammer of the gun thing there.

1192
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:36,580
This is scary.

1193
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,520
I don't know a lot about it.

1194
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,440
I don't know.

1195
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,780
Is it too heavy for you to hold?

1196
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,520
Yeah, it's kind of hard to hold, too.

1197
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,320
Okay, well, put it up on this rock here.

1198
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:43,680
Okay.

1199
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,500
Some substandard item of furniture that we found.

1200
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,540
Okay, here it is on the rock.

1201
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:47,860
All right.

1202
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:48,040
All right.

1203
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,260
Okay, now put it up.

1204
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:49,840
Put it up there.

1205
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,400
Now look right through those sights.

1206
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:51,620
See?

1207
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,240
Yeah.

1208
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,900
Yeah, when you find it across here, fire.

1209
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,080
Oh, wait.

1210
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,160
Pull the trigger three times.

1211
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,380
No, shoot him.

1212
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:57,700
Shoot him.

1213
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,720
See, that's the American way.

1214
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:58,980
See?

1215
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,280
Stop crying, you little runt.

1216
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:02,960
Listen to me.

1217
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,600
America's not going nowhere.

1218
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,340
I don't want to shoot him.

1219
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,660
What would Bob Dobbs take of you?

1220
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,320
Get over here.

1221
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,460
Get over here.

1222
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:12,920
Son of a...

1223
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,260
Well, some kids don't want to live.

1224
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,480
I'm not going to make it on the escape vessels.

1225
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,160
They're not even going to make it out of here.

1226
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,240
No.

1227
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,260
They're not going to make it out of Dobbs Town.

1228
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,760
Let's go to the beach, baby.

1229
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,580
Number nine.

1230
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:35,840
Number nine.

1231
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,020
It was a frozen octagon to me.

1232
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,120
You know, like one of them poly...

1233
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:44,700
No, no, no.

1234
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,940
It was organic chemistry.

1235
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,340
Yeah, it looked like it was organic chemistry.

1236
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:48,660
It was organic chemistry.

1237
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,080
And I guess it was a flying vessel.

1238
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,860
A human blood vessel.

1239
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,440
It was like a huge hematoid thing with flaps on it.

1240
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,120
It came down and it was offering different things to different people.

1241
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,140
You know, they could read its mind.

1242
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,220
You think I'm lying.

1243
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:04,060
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

1244
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,080
You think I'm lying.

1245
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:05,880
You think I'm crazy.

1246
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,660
You bummed out yet, friend?

1247
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,100
Sorry you took them drugs now, aren't you?

1248
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,000
We knew you did that.

1249
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:18,540
And we wanted to teach you a lesson before Satan gets a hold of you.

1250
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,480
You think Bob's a bad trip.

1251
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:27,260
Wait until you find Satan and Saddam Hussein together in your bedroom, my friend.

1252
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,140
And hell.

1253
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,580
Well, that was in that South Park movie.

1254
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,080
Oh, yeah.

1255
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:39,460
And so, friends, this is to let you know that we are serious about this religion thing.

1256
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,420
And your soul.

1257
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,440
And your money.

1258
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,600
Yeah, we love your money, too.

1259
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:44,980
Yeah.

1260
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,240
We like the Christian sweeties, too.

1261
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:47,420
Green.

1262
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:47,520
Green.

1263
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:47,800
Green.

1264
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,180
Green.

1265
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:48,520
Green.

1266
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:48,520


1267
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:48,520


1268
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:48,520


1269
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:48,520


1270
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:48,520


1271
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:48,780
Green.

1272
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:48,920
Got the underpants.

1273
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,920
Can you remember that one time?

1274
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,480
You don't need to send us your underpants.

1275
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,580
No underpants, please.

1276
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,520
Thank you.

1277
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:00,380
I.

1278
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:18,400
Well, thanks to Byron Werner and his friend Donovan on the rural war room,

1279
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,720
we have this background

1280
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,320
of...

1281
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:21,900
Man.

1282
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,100
...that makes you feel like

1283
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,660
you took too much

1284
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:28,020
cold medication, doesn't it?

1285
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,820
Byron, he the man.

1286
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,680
Que bello bambino.

1287
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,140
Guardala.

1288
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,800
Watcha dan angelo.

1289
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,480
Ah, ah, no.

1290
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:37,960
Oh, no.

1291
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,020
World War Room.

1292
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,240
He has horns.

1293
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,480
He has a huge...

1294
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,220
He has horns.

1295
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,400
May I repeat?

1296
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,940
The man has horns

1297
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,440
where his neck should be.

1298
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,500
And there's a giant diamond

1299
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,640
in between his eyes.

1300
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,840
As, of course,

1301
00:51:55,900 --> 00:52:00,280
it's like the old days.

1302
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,660
We used to have

1303
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,120
as many subgeniuses

1304
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,280
talking on one mic as possible.

1305
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,580
That was in the days

1306
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,220
before we got deaf

1307
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,340
and couldn't distinguish

1308
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,380
between the various human voices,

1309
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,100
the voices in our heads,

1310
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:15,420
the...

1311
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:15,760
The legal we.

1312
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,860
The tinnitus.

1313
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,480
He's the queen of England.

1314
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:19,320
The recorded voices.

1315
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,560
And the World War Room

1316
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,660
recording in the background.

1317
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,040
Dame F. Pistol

1318
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,940
would like an evening's auction

1319
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,420
in spanky remarks with you.

1320
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,680
Dearest Mr. Reverend Ivan Stang.

1321
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,260
Take a letter.

1322
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:35,880
Mrs. Pistol.

1323
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,820
Yes, yes, yes, sir.

1324
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,160
Dear Ivan Stang,

1325
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:43,020
as a member of the Peerland

1326
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,340
and as strong supporter

1327
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,400
of the Conservative Party,

1328
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,640
I believe that your church

1329
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,760
is a cult

1330
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,160
and as such would like

1331
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,140
to invite you to our annual

1332
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,780
Pink the Ticky Whistle

1333
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,320
and Stink the...

1334
00:52:59,320 --> 00:52:59,860
No, no.

1335
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,900
Pink the Stinky Whistle.

1336
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,160
That's pink.

1337
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,080
It's pink.

1338
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,080
Pink.

1339
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,160
Pink the Stinky...

1340
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,400
Pink the Stinky Whistle.

1341
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,440
Are you taking...

1342
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,340
Look, it's perfectly written

1343
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,280
exactly as you've said.

1344
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,260
Your writing is impossible to read.

1345
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,320
I can read it.

1346
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,560
No one else has to.

1347
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,400
All right.

1348
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,000
Pinky the Stinky Whistle.

1349
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,020
Pink the Stinky Whistle.

1350
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,660
And the Magic Cartwheel.

1351
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:23,680
Magic Cartwheel.

1352
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,860
Which takes some, apparently,

1353
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,020
to other dimensions,

1354
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:27,620
but that's...

1355
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:28,900
Mr. Stang...

1356
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:29,280
Reverend.

1357
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,080
Reverend, please.

1358
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,040
Reverend.

1359
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,320
Reverend Stang,

1360
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,800
if you would attend this...

1361
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,440
Debacle.

1362
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,000
If you will attend this...

1363
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,540
Debacle.

1364
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,180
Debacle.

1365
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,180
We would be pleased

1366
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,720
to make you our favorite debutante,

1367
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:43,400
debucly.

1368
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,260
Pleased to make you...

1369
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:44,880
Sincerely, I'm...

1370
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,300
Sincerely, I'm...

1371
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,360
Most Dame Queenie Bad Brux...

1372
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,860
I'm up for any program.

1373
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,560
Very good, sir.

1374
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:53,180
Yes.

1375
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:54,920
Whip it out.

1376
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,600
Of course, whip it out.

1377
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,500
We're ready to go.

1378
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:56,940
Right.

1379
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,120
We're ready.

1380
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,580
I'd love to go to one of them

1381
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,000
swinging, what do you call them, parties.

1382
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,440
You know, they get the Hellfire Club.

1383
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,800
They got the guys smacking each other

1384
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,620
in the rump with the...

1385
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:05,040
Really?

1386
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:05,580
Well, yeah.

1387
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,380
They get fried chickens and so forth.

1388
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,300
And then they hang...

1389
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,960
You're talking about the X-Day Drills,

1390
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,480
aren't you?

1391
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:12,660
Oh, man.

1392
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,820
No, not the...

1393
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,000
We're talking about the Nose Drills.

1394
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,500
Well, that was an old tool,

1395
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,400
but it did some good work for a lot of people.

1396
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,660
We got more people...

1397
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,760
We actually had more people at the Nose Drills

1398
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,260
than we did at the X-Day Drills.

1399
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,420
You had more people at the Nose Drills?

1400
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:26,720
Yeah.

1401
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,780
Well, you know, they wanted it removed

1402
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:31,060
and they felt bad about how they felt bad.

1403
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,700
So they had to have it done.

1404
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,580
Friends, you're listening to Hour of Slack

1405
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,340
number 1,116.

1406
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:44,500
Yes, there's 1,116 hours of Slack.

1407
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:49,060
Actually, there's probably a dozen or more of those reruns.

1408
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,380
But they're only partially reruns.

1409
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,140
And you can get more information

1410
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,780
about Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius

1411
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,740
from subgenius.com.

1412
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,260
Subgenius, for you subgeniuses,

1413
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,880
is not spelled with an O.

1414
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,960
There's not an O anywhere in subgenius.

1415
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,460
But there is in .com.

1416
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,620
And, of course, you can also write to us, friends,

1417
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,160
and find out about whatever...

1418
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,440
...else there might be available.

1419
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:21,180
From Bob at, or subgenius, or Hour of Slack

1420
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:25,400
at Post Office Box 181417.

1421
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,760
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1422
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,320
Hour of Slack Theater.

1423
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,400
44118.

1424
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:33,720
118.

1425
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,820
If I were a student of numerology,

1426
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,040
I would notice that the 8 and the 1 and the 4,

1427
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:45,900
and the number,

1428
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,260
are probably the key to Steng's mind,

1429
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,840
if you can call it a mind.

1430
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,140
The 8, the 1, and the 4?

1431
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,480
The 8, the 1, and the 4.

1432
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,440
See, if you combine 8 and 1, it becomes 9.

1433
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,480
Oh, we scrape a lot of this out of other people's minds.

1434
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:00,780
Norrell Preff.

1435
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,600
And this whoever that loop,

1436
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,220
have an hour loop, or whatever.

1437
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,420
God, I'll have to figure that out next show.

1438
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,160
And Norrell Preff.

1439
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,400
And coming up, friends,

1440
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,360
we've got to get out of the studio

1441
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,140
and make way for...

1442
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,480
Noah's Ark, which is coming in next.

1443
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,580
Christian Hour.

1444
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,520
Yeah, the Christian Hour is next.

1445
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,760
But we're about to hear a little bit of a clip

1446
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,140
from Starwood about what really is in Bob's pipe,

1447
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,420
followed by the Mondo Retardo band

1448
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,440
live at X-Day.

1449
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,720
Beat me to a pulpit.

1450
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,600
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1451
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:36,940
Not only will the contents of the one true pipe

1452
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,440
at last be told...

1453
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:39,860
Psych!

1454
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,100
Psych!

1455
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,680
Well, it was just to get you in here.

1456
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,120
We're not going to tell you what Bob...

1457
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:45,500
Bob's smoking.

1458
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,380
Everybody figures he's smoking frop.

1459
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,080
And everybody thinks frop

1460
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,520
is the subgenius cute term for marijuana.

1461
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,480
No, frop,

1462
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,780
habifropzipulops is the medical name.

1463
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,360
It's an herb that grows

1464
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,540
in Tibet,

1465
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,760
only in the moonlight,

1466
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,560
and only on the graves

1467
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,420
of dead Tibetan holy men

1468
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,500
or on the droppings of the Yeti.

1469
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,760
And it's hard to get.

1470
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,360
There was a movie made

1471
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,860
sort of about it called

1472
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:14,980
The Werewolf of London.

1473
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,180
Back in the 30s.

1474
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,980
But, no, most of the time, friends,

1475
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:19,500
it's...

1476
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,820
If you want to be literal about it,

1477
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,800
Bob's really smoking this cheap stuff

1478
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,000
he gets at Walgreens

1479
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,220
called Borkham Riff Cherry Blend.

1480
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,900
It's just these crappy pipes.

1481
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,420
What your dad probably smoked

1482
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,520
when he smoked a pipe.

1483
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,300
But metaphysically...

1484
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,200
Well, look at that.

1485
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,820
I don't know if you can see this shirt here.

1486
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,580
This describes it perfectly.

1487
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,280
There's a brain at the end of this pipe.

1488
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:44,960
But,

1489
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,180
if you think about it,

1490
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,100
the flame is up here.

1491
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,640
It's almost as if Bob is the pipe

1492
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,420
and this brain is sucking

1493
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:55,780
the...

1494
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,540
from the bowl.

1495
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,300
Bob's brain is being smoked

1496
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,520
by the pipe.

1497
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,440
Now, that is a mystery to sit and think about

1498
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,820
when you're in your excrementation chamber

1499
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,340
up at the top of the hill

1500
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,360
or the foreflash.

1501
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,160
But, really,

1502
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,260
what Bob's really smoking in his pipe

1503
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,180
is your brain, my friend.

1504
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:22,980
Are you man or woman or tranny enough

1505
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,960
to jump into that bowl?

1506
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,680
Let Bob smoke you.

1507
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,080
Maybe your brain will be the molecule

1508
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,060
that gets him off at that moment.

1509
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,420
You know, that's something to live for.

1510
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,560
So, I guess when that bonfire...

1511
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,160
See, when the...

1512
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,940
I get... I'm really honored

1513
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,140
because I was asked to help light the big bonfire.

1514
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,940
I can't believe they let a subgenius

1515
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,060
take part in that sacred ceremony.

1516
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,040
But, they do.

1517
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,720
And I always think of it as like,

1518
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,480
hey, we're lighting Bob's pipe.

1519
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,220
He's gonna be smoking all of us.

1520
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:56,760
Yeah!

1521
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:01,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1522
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,700
Oh, beat me to a pulp

1523
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,260
and I'm praying for some pain.

1524
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,320
I ain't got religion.

1525
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,500
I got a damaged brain.

1526
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,860
And if I had a dollar

1527
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,960
for every licking that I took,

1528
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,860
I'd buy the pulpit back again

1529
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,500
and write a dirty book.

1530
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,180
Oh, beat me to a pulp

1531
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,040
and I'm praying for some pain.

1532
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:36,800
Beat me to a pulp

1533
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,660
and I'm praying for some pain.

1534
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,400
I ain't got religion.

1535
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,260
I got a damaged brain.

1536
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,860
I ain't got religion.

1537
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,060
I got a damaged brain.
