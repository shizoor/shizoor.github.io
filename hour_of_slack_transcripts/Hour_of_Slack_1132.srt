1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,580
The hills are alive with the sound of the subgenius, our old squad.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:18,120
We're space cadets and we are proud to say, Bob, the indisputable leader of the gang.

3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:24,740
He's the boss, he's a VIP, he's a championship, he's the most tip-top, Bob, gap.

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:32,160
Bob is here for one reason and one reason only, that's to bring slack to the slackers.

5
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,620
And during this mandatory slide show, you'll see what will happen as Bob appears over the city

6
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:45,820
and laughs so hard that the hot pipe ass falls down into the city, burning Bob's face.

7
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,720
He's riding his great pipe-shaped spaceship down into Washington, D.C.

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,320
You'll notice the little old lady down there getting healed.

9
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,620
The little old man.

10
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,680
It's really charming.

11
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,080
It's a grassroots movement.

12
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,400
This isn't part of some new wave of punk fashion status slavery.

13
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:14,060
We're not trying to make you be cool according to what your favorite musician dresses as.

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,800
What Bob wants you to do is make yourself a saint, make yourself a pope.

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,360
Get down.

16
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,920
To the word of Bob.

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,180
Memorize it.

18
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,740
Distort it.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,340
Start your own church.

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,860
Start your own schism.

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,240
And you'll find out just how much money there is to be made in the world of the future.

22
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,880
The future started in 1971.

23
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,840
It only begins at breeding minds and then it becomes so much more.

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,260
That's Bob.

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,500
He runs the company.

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,780
Bob needs to see us.

27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,540
He attacked Angela Petrelli.

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,840
My father killed Kaido Nakamura.

29
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,640
He's killing.

30
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:54,940
I'm killing them all.

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
And now he's coming to kill Bob.

32
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,640
How do you know your father's coming to kill Bob?

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,220
Isn't this all a bit reactionary?

34
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,880
It's always these half truths.

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,240
No straight answers.

36
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,120
Constant manipulation.

37
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,180
I'm trying to help everyone here.

38
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:07,980
How, Bob?

39
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,040
You don't trust Bob, do you?

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,480
Bob is morally gray at best.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,940
Call me Bob.

42
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,280
We need to call Bob.

43
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,200
We need to call Bob.

44
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,200
We need to call Bob.

45
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,120
We need to call Bob.

46
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,620
If you're in a place where you can do so, turn in your Bible.

47
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,880
Turn in your Bible.

48
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,580
This, this, this scoff luck.

49
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,500
This corrupt scoff and mock.

50
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,560
Mock and scoff.

51
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,220
Make fun.

52
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,000
Make fun.

53
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,820
Look upon God's people as being less intelligent or less informed.

54
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,620
Scoffers and mockers.

55
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,740
Mock and scoff.

56
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,000
Propagate the theory of evolution.

57
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,380
As be not ignorant.

58
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:41,820
Slack.

59
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,420
Slackness.

60
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,760
Scoffed and mocked.

61
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,740
Scoffing and mocking.

62
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,320
You know one can be an alcoholic.

63
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,800
Uh, be not ignorant.

64
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,340
Slack.

65
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,180
Slack.

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,080
And we have no need of anything different.

67
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,720
It has transformed the lives of the people.

68
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:54,720


69
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,480
The lives of countless thousands, millions of people.

70
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,080
Slack.

71
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,520
Uh, we sometimes, uh, get awful.

72
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,460
It's coming.

73
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,480
He gets down.

74
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,180
He gets down.

75
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,540
We ought to all get down.

76
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,000
But who is Bob?

77
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,660
Who, tru, truly, who is this man Bob?

78
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,640
Many don't believe that there really is a Bob.

79
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,300
They think he was just some construct.

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,500
Like the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

81
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,080
Praise the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

82
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,680
They, they think, they think, they think Bob's a joke.

83
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,720
Friends, if you don't believe me, I'm not a joke.

84
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:24,720


85
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:24,720


86
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:24,720


87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:24,720


88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:24,720


89
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:24,720


90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:24,720


91
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:24,720


92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:24,720


93
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,040
If Bob is a joke, what do you call the news?

94
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,320
What do you call yourself?

95
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,560
And, uh, fuck you if you can't take one, I guess would be his message.

96
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,180
But, you know, he's been talked about through years of legends.

97
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,820
You've heard the legends of the traveling salesman.

98
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,100
Sometimes they take the form of jokes.

99
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,000
Those are all based on the life of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

100
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,960
How can Bob sell the way he does?

101
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,700
How can, how can Bob sell shit?

102
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:54,700


103
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,400
To pigs?

104
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,820
Hypocrisy to Baptists?

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,860
You know, how does he do this?

106
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,720
Friends, it's not that Bob is the smartest man in the world.

107
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,980
Far, far from it indeed.

108
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,320
We didn't call it Church of the Genius.

109
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,020
Because the whole point of this is that it's not the intelligence that counts.

110
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,180
The conspiracy has been misdefining intelligence for all these years.

111
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,720
What counts is sense.

112
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,760
Common sense.

113
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,680
Service.

114
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,220
Sense of humor.

115
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,600
Dollars and cents.

116
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,780
And for some people, cents and mea.

117
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,160
But, that's the thing.

118
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,220
Bob, Bob is not smart.

119
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,740
What Bob is, is lucky.

120
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,360
That's where the pureness of the slack comes from.

121
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,620
Bob doesn't think about what he's gonna do.

122
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,420
He just does it.

123
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:51,400
Whatever, it just so happens that whatever Bob happens to want happens to be what was gonna happen anyway.

124
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,500
Sort of like, uh,

125
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,360
that movie, Being There, if you remember that.

126
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,400
I think that must have been based on Bob.

127
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,180
And with that power of luck,

128
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,800
he has, he has a power that the Pope of the Vatican would kill for.

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,960
He has the power to fail!

130
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,180
He's the opposite of infallible.

131
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,200
But, every time he fucks up, he makes a million dollars!

132
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,760
Friends, you too can partake of the luck of Bob if you do what Bob does, and that is

133
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,360
to follow the path of least resistance in your life.

134
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:32,240
To surf on the luck plane, and grease the wheels of your life.

135
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,260
You know, if you have a conspiracy job, most of us do.

136
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,720
As Bob said, smarm is the oil that greases the conspiracy machine.

137
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,100
So, it's okay for you to use smarm with your fellow workers or your boss.

138
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,740
As Bob said,

139
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,580
act like a dumb shit, and they will treat you as an evil!

140
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,520
Sad but true!

141
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,160
So, Susie, I was having, um,

142
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,940
oh yeah, this is, uh, this is Reverend, Reverend Carter again.

143
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,700
I was having a very interesting conversation with a gentleman yesterday.

144
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,860
I'm sending it your way,

145
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,520
because it made me think of you,

146
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,920
and how it's been far too long since, uh,

147
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,040
since we were proximate, shall I say.

148
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,180
Um, yeah.

149
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,640
Thanks.

150
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,560
Good mangoes, uh, my son,

151
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,520

00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:08,680

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,060
Because these devibles do things to people.

189
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,700
They make them bad.

190
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,940
I'm a naughty boy.

191
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,700
A bad boy slapped my nasty ass.

192
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,520
I'm a bad bad boy.

193
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,480
Nasty ass.

194
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,560
A naughty boy.

195
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,420
A nasty nasty bad bad naughty boy.

196
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,480
Bad bad bad bad naughty boy.

197
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,520
Naughty boy.

198
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,700
The American people already know that I'm a naughty boy.

199
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,660
A bad boy.

200
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,280
I'm going bad bad bad.

201
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,800
Slapped my nasty ass.

202
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,060
Hey, uh, Susie. This is Carter LeBlanc again.

203
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,740
I just had a, well, I got a strange message.

204
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,000
I think it was from Princess Pisces.

205
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,540
But I couldn't be sure because there was a lot of howling and screaming.

206
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:45,320
And animal noises and the sound of, I don't know, things being broken.

207
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,840
And...

208
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:47,980
Um...

209
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,040
Some other extraneous thuds and crashes.

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,760
And a lot of garbled yelling.

211
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,960
And I really didn't make out any of it except I think your name was mentioned.

212
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,480
And it, um...

213
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,200
It just made me think of you.

214
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,940
And, um, I was just wondering if, uh...

215
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,260
If you were going to make it up to the Baltimore subgenius.

216
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,860
I mean, I think it's a pretty good idea.

217
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:17,860


218
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,720
And, uh, I think it's a good idea to have a revival on, uh, November 10th.

219
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,280
That's, uh, gonna be held in, uh, in Baltimore.

220
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,000
I, I, I...

221
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,920
That's all.

222
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,100
I was just thinking of you.

223
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,440
And, uh, and hoping that none of the, um, the howling or the screaming was, uh, was

224
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,620
you doing something that, uh, that you're going to regret tomorrow.

225
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,660
Um...

226
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,700
That's all.

227
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,840
Thanks.

228
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:56,340
And speaking of jokes and fucking and, uh, such things, that always brings to mind the,

229
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,120
the most beautiful and wondrous subgenius preacheress.

230
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,880
Yes, there was a time when it was a sausage fest.

231
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,340
But we lied.

232
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,420
And we described it as a sex cult.

233
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,520
Well, as you might, as they say, build it and they will come.

234
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:23,000
If we started saying it was a, a sex cult by God, praise Bob, it turned into one.

235
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,560
And sometimes, sometimes it even involves sex with other people.

236
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,740
Uh, so, um, I'm gonna get out of the...

237
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,060
Oh, yes, yes, yes, friends.

238
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,400
Speaking of...

239
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,460
One last thing.

240
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,540
One last thing.

241
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,780
Bob is coming.

242
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,180
And when I say that, I don't mean, I don't mean that Bob is on his way here.

243
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,860
When they say Jesus is coming, that means Jesus is on his way.

244
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,240
When we say Bob is coming, when you come, you see Bob.

245
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,720
If you come tonight, you will see Bob.

246
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,980
And now you may come from seeing Sister Susie the floozy.

247
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:19,560
I was watching my lizard rubbing his butt on my frog tray the other day, and I just

248
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,900
naturally started thinking about staying.

249
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:29,680
And how, and how I just love to hogtie that little mutant Texan up like some sort of bondage

250
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,220
pinata.

251
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,060
And naturally that led me to contemplating the nature of ligature marks.

252
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,540
Now I've got a little Latin lingo in my background.

253
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,820
And I know that the lig in ligature means tie.

254
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,660
It comes from the Latin ligo to tie.

255
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:58,580
And then it came to me like the atomic bitch slap at the end of the stark fist.

256
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:04,220
And I thought, Jesus, religion means to be tied again.

257
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,460
Now how much more fucking blatant could they make it?

258
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,860
You have a place in their world as God's bottom.

259
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,140
Who wants only that for a choice?

260
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:25,380
Oh, now, I don't want to be calling subgenius a religion now, although I have in the past.

261
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,560
Oh, but realizing this fact, I'm going to be calling it religion.

262
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:28,560


263
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,380
I'm going to be calling it the actoid with an accent on the toy.

264
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:38,300
I really would rather start referring to it as a faith instead.

265
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,760
Because that's the fucking sure what we've got here.

266
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,700
A big ass faith with a big fucking pipe in the fucking mouth.

267
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,340
And that pipe is our affirmation.

268
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,380
Say it with me, seekers.

269
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,520
Bob sold it.

270
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,280
I smoked it.

271
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,360
That sells it.

272
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,040
Because you know what they say.

273
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:12,420
They say God is in the details.

274
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,080
Well, I'm here to tell you that Bob is in the retail.

275
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,620
And as a subgenius, you can get it, wholesale seekers.

276
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,620
Yeah.

277
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,660
Because one thing is for sure, you need slack.

278
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:38,360
And the good thing is that membership in the Church of the Subgenius is still under a bazillion goddamn dollars.

279
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,960
Yes, you can still buy your way out of pink perdition.

280
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,440
You can actually bribe your way to salvation.

281
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,600
And you don't have to knock over a bank to do it.

282
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,260
No.

283
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,780
You don't have to rob a 7-Eleven.

284
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,160
You don't have to shoot an old lady in the legs.

285
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,020
Unless you want to.

286
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,220
That's the beauty of this goddamn church.

287
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,720
It's like what Stang said about eating the goddamn hamburger.

288
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,160
You want to eat the hell out of it.

289
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,840
Well, that's fucking right.

290
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,520
But it's not just about the burger.

291
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:31,800
Because if you look beneath the surface and take this aphorism to its logical subgenial conclusion seekers,

292
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:39,580
if we live as subgeniuses, should we not be living the hell out of it?

293
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:48,160
Shouldn't every action be an action that is going to gain us that slack that we need?

294
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,500
Why the fuck do we work at our own crossroads?

295
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,180
Why do we not do our own purposes and tear ourselves apart just for the fun of the con?

296
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,900
Because, seekers, I gotta admit, I let the conspiracy keep me down.

297
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,740
Oh, it was in so many comforting forms.

298
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,440
And even in the depths of my misery, I thought I was happy.

299
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,980
But it was all false slack.

300
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,780
It's so deceptively comforting.

301
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,900
And for years, I've kind of stopped being Reverend Susie the Floozy almost.

302
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,100
I found myself turning back into plain old Susan Barrows.

303
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,520
And let me tell you, seekers, she sucks.

304
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,440
Oh, yeah, you might think it's easy being a visual speed bump, a tri-top walking a mile in my ooze.

305
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:48,940
But she's not.

306
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,240
Because I was sucking on tip so hard I was starting to get the lines around my lips.

307
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:01,540
Oh, but when I finally got shaken out of that hell loop and found the pieces of my shattered self,

308
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,720
this time I didn't cry over the burning spilt milk of my existence.

309
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,780
This time I set about putting myself back together.

310
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,660
I became my own Frankenstein.

311
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,420
I took those pieces of me.

312
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,300
And I pounded them back into place.

313
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:29,080
And seekers, if a fucking Rick like I can do it, so can you.

314
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,020
Because let me tell you, every Yeti can out there.

315
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,340
Every seed of Dobbs is worth saving.

316
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,020
Fuck yeah.

317
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,160
Even if it's only to piss them off.

318
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,280
You need to stick around.

319
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:54,900
And I want you to do something for me, each and every one of you.

320
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:01,820
I want you to believe in the natural superiority of your subgenius soul.

321
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,360
I want you to screw your overman's courage to the sticking place

322
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,960
and look the conspiracy in its jaundiced bloodshot eyes and say,

323
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,580
fight my prey, motherfuckers.

324
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:23,900
How dare you manipulate me with your shitty fifth-rate mind control.

325
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,860
Because seekers, their methods are so tired and transparent

326
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:37,920
that it is beneath you as a child of Dobbs to be even marginally affected by their works,

327
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,600
by their bullshit.

328
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,060
Because by the ancient science of great thinking,

329
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,560
the mighty mental armor of Bob can shield you.

330
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,680
And I want you to use it.

331
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:58,100
Yes, blind yourself to the works of the con with the all unseen stupidity of Dobbs.

332
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,920
Deafen your ears with the insipitude of the full-blood Yeti.

333
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,800
Cripple your legs with that Dobbs town polio frop that's going around.

334
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:17,540
Using the church's proven survival techniques to incapacitate you.

335
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:17,540


336
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:24,720
You can actually seem so unfit for exploitation by the con

337
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,760
that they will not even see you on their radar.

338
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,940
You can get away scot-free.

339
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,960
And you can have a safe and slack-filled passage through this abysmal pink life.

340
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,900
And that's all I'm saying. I can't say no more except,

341
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,440
Praise Bob!

342
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,360
Yeah!

343
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,400
Somebody help me!

344
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:08,940
She is absolutely and utterly amazing.

345
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,660
You're in deep trouble.

346
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
Pray for good, you line the boat.

347
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,940
Who knows what comes from other holes.

348
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,440
Stone will make your puss like this yours bubble.

349
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,020
One, two, three, four.

350
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,620
Claptrap!

351
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,620
Claptrap!

352
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,600
Claptrap!

353
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,620
Claptrap!

354
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,940
C-L-A-P-T-R-A-P

355
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:38,660
Claptrap!

356
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,680
Claptrap!

357
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,700
Claptrap!

358
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,680

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,880
She loves two shells, six and more

365
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
She gives her dildos to the bar

366
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,600
Some would say she is

367
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,420

Got it from the bird canal

382
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,880
His balls are big, he's sterile now

383
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,580
He loves to give it to his sister and brother

Circles, circles, square, square

It's not safe for over there

Everybody clap when you see

And before that, Suzy the Floozy

426
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,160
What an amazing rant

427
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,640
You know, she's the hostess of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse

428
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,900

I wish I could tell you how to get Suzy's rants removed from your head

432
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:18,740
But

433
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,800
I just don't know

434
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,740
So, um, yeah, friends

435
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,820
The conspiracy is bigger than the republicrats

436
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,680
or the demopublicans or whatever they are

437
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,840
It's an attitude

438
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,340
It's an all-pervasive attitude of distrust

439
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,920
It's not that it's a smart conspiracy

440
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,140
A clever conspiracy

441
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,740
It doesn't even know it's a conspiracy

442
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,860
The pinks, as we call them

443
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,880
The humans

444
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,740
The Barbies and Kens

445
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,140
The cage dwellers

446
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,900
The pinks and the humans

447
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,400
The normworms

448
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,220
The time servers

449
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,500
The conformers

450
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,920
The calm men

451
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,040
The confederate dunces, folks

452
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,340
A bunch of bovine, mindless living stereotypes

453
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,560
And yet, they could destroy the world

454
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
That's for Bob to do

455
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,920
That's for us subgeniuses to do

456
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,460
And it's not that we have to go out killing anybody ourselves

457
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,520
We just have to wait for the aliens to do it

458
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,700
Now, granted, he predicted the next day

459
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,180
would come

460
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,700
And the aliens would destroy all the humans

461
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,020
And lift the subgeniuses up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

462
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,960
And go to planet X

463
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,660
He predicted that for July 5th, 1998

464
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:35,360
And by these stripes, we know that 1998 has not arrived yet!

465
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,140
That is how insidious the conspiracy has been

466
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,040
For a thousand years, they've been changing the calendars

467
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,680
Hour by hour, day by day

468
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,360
Just to try to make Bob look stupid as if...

469
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:48,680
Bob's a fucking idiot!

470
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:48,680


471
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,540
He wasn't already looking stupid!

472
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,620
As if there was something wrong with looking stupid!

473
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,800
Who gives a fuck what they think?

474
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,840
So, for all we know, July 5th, 1998

475
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,280
Why, that could be...

476
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:06,640
Tonight!

477
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,240
Are you ready?

478
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,140
You don't know, Bob may come as a thief in the night

479
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,180
In fact, where's my wallet?

480
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,820
He does that kind of thing

481
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,660
Bob's a thief in the night!

482
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,120
We just come this morning

483
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,560
Take you for granted

484
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,040
But is it really all that deep?

485
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,380
Deep, deep, deep, deep

486
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,440
Go show yourselves to the priests

487
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,460
Go...

488
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,980
Now before we go any further

489
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,680
I want to just kind of have leprosy

490
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,300
I can't speak

491
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,120
Uncleanliness

492
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,760
Hug

493
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,520
Shake hands

494
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,380
We need a little physical contact

495
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,540
Hug her, but

496
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,220
Hug her, but

497
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,320
But...

498
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,760
But imagine that

499
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,760
It's a physical need

500
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,320
I'll be honest with you

501
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,560
Up until about 10 o'clock

502
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:48,660
I'll be honest with you

503
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:48,660


504
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:48,660


505
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:48,660


506
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,620
I just was out of sync

507
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,940
I'm just not firing on all cylinders and I know it

508
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,380
Bob or whoever you are

509
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,040
I'm not good enough

510
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,100
I want you to come

511
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,920
I want you to come

512
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,760
Respond to me

513
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,600
Respond to me

514
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,920
Is there a legume in the house?

515
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,520
Is there a legume in the house?

516
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,280
Is there a legume in the house?

517
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,940
Well of course a legume is dead

518
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,640
You know legume is dead

519
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,380
Legume has been dead several times

520
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,480
But you know what?

521
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,360
It's not a big deal

522
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,140
You know why?

523
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,920
Legumes fuck the devil

524
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,840
The devil was so smitten with the ass fucking

525
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,660
He got from legume that he wears a little locket of him

526
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,620
Picture of him and legume with it

527
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,840
You know it's really kind of creepy

528
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,300
Legumes been to hell and back

529
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,200
And probably has the STDs from the devil to prove it

530
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,500
That being said

531
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:46,620
I'm going to go

532
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:46,620


533
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:46,620


534
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:46,720
I'm going to go and tell you

535
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,080
That if legume is not dead

536
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,900
I would love to see him come up here and share with us his feelings on maybe being not dead

537
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,060
Or maybe being dead

538
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,660
Or you certainly look dead

539
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,060
By the way y'all

540
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,720
I am scared shitless of this man

541
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,640
It is taking everything in my body not to run right now

542
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,360
In fact you know what?

543
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:06,720
Forget it

544
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,120
Screw it

545
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,340
I'm going to go and tell you

546
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:14,500
I'm going to go and tell you

547
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
I'm going to go and tell you

548
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,160
I'm going to go and tell you

549
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,160


550
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,160


551
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,220
I'm going to go and tell you

552
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,000
Sorry it's been a while since I've been in a church

553
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,020
I feel naked without my gas can

554
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,260
It's a funny story

555
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,300
The last time I preached in a church like this was I guess 1996

556
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,720
And it was in Pittsburgh

557
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,560
And I brought a shotgun with me to church

558
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,680
Good Lord

559
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,540
I brought this big black Mossberg 500 shotgun in there with me

560
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,160
And at one point during my sermon

561
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,200
Blew a hole in the ceiling of the church

562
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,620
And there was this really hot looking female cop in the front row

563
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,720
And afterwards I'm carrying this shotgun out

564
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,100
And she walks up to me and she says

565
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,160
That's the most realistic prop I've ever seen

566
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,180
I'm going to go and tell you

567
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,280
I'm going to go and tell you

568
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:15,280


569
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:15,320
I'm going to go and tell you

570
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,240
I'm going to go and tell you

571
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,480
But it's been a while since I've preached

572
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,140
It's been about a decade or so

573
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,960
I hope I'm not too rusty

574
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,660
Because I'd like to ask you all a few questions tonight

575
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:38,920
Do you ever feel like the universe has positioned a funnel for all of it's shit over your life?

576
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,880
Yes!

577
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,200
All the time!

578
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,300
Do you feel the people around you that are still listening to the same music you're

579
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,300


580
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,300


581
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,300


582
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,300


583
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,300


584
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,300


585
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,300


586
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,300


587
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,300


588
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,300


589
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:55,300
you, draining your intelligence as you speak to them? Does it bother you that the decisions

590
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:02,440
that affect your life are apparently being made by a pack of insidious fucktards? Do

591
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:11,400
you ever find yourself sitting in a stoplight in the middle of nowhere in the middle of

592
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,480
the night as minutes of your life tick away and you realize that you've become a slave

593
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:32,640
to a glorified party light? One last question. Do you have thirty dollars? If you answered

594
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:39,140
yes to any or all of these questions, you can be saved.

595
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:54,760
J.R. Bob Dobbs is a spiritual GPS to show you the way, the path through life, the path

596
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:01,280
to slack, the superhighway of slack where there are no speed limits and there are no

597
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:11,280
stoplights and those insidious fucktards are just bugs on the windshield. So true. And

598
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:24,300
when you come to the end of that road, well, when you come to the end of that road, you

599
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:33,000
don't want to wake up in some bland bargain basement afterlife that you weren't expecting.

600
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:41,380
You don't want to end up in some shitty third world afterlife with flies crawling around

601
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:50,900
on your soul. Well, I'm here to tell you it doesn't matter if you're pagan or Christian.

602
00:31:52,020 --> 00:32:02,460
It doesn't matter if you're Jewish or if you're Buddhist. It doesn't matter if you're an atheist

603
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,580
or even a Canadian.

604
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,120
J.R. It doesn't matter because you tonight,

605
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:22,140
have the opportunity to spend your afterlife in the coolest eternity ever devised by man nor gods.

606
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,100
I would love that.

607
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,800
I'm talking about, of course, subgenius heaven.

608
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,100
Praise God!

609
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,900
Praise God!

610
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:39,060
Now, you might ask, what does subgenius heaven have that other national brand afterlives don't?

611
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,500
Beer.

612
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,680
Beer!

613
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:53,060
Now, it's been well established by Polish clerics and polka bands that in heaven there is no beer.

614
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,520
But in subgenius heaven, you have all the beer you want, brothers and sisters.

615
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,780
Can I get a praise beer?

616
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,620
Praise beer!

617
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,320
Praise beer!

618
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,380
In subgenius heaven, there are verdant fields of the stillness.

619
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,420
Dickiest green buds of frog.

620
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,360
And you can just walk into the middle of the field and light it on fire and stand.

621
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:32,860
There are rivers of the finest liquors that you can just dive in, swim, and drink.

622
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:41,380
And you'll never, ever get tired climbing crack rock mountains.

623
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:41,700
Yeah!

624
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,760
Praise God!

625
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:54,500
In subgenius heaven, you can huff the everlasting jankum.

626
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,380
Yeah!

627
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:06,540
In subgenius heaven, you can have sex with anyone or anything you please.

628
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,140
Yeah!

629
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,300
All of the most perverse.

630
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:15,900
sick and twisted things that your sister would never let you do to her.

631
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,140
In subgenius heaven, you can travel back and forth between the afterlife and earth

632
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,520
in case you want to come back to tease fat ladies and Irishmen.

633
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:39,780
And when you return to subgenius heaven, no one will have fucked with your stuff.

634
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:49,580
Now, national brand religions, they ask a pretty high price for their afterlife.

635
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:57,460
You have to give them all your money, or you have to go to church every Sunday and kiss the CEO's butt.

636
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,360
Bullshit.

637
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:08,520
Some religions, hell, they want you to strap a dynamite vest to you and blow yourself to shit just to get to the afterlife.

638
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,160
That sucks.

639
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,320
They don't want you to have fun here on earth.

640
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,420
Because it's what makes their shitty bargain basement afterlife look good.

641
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:30,500
If they can deny you the opportunity of smoking and partying and drinking and dancing and whoring and queering.

642
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:30,500


643
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,720
And whatever it is that you want to do for fun.

644
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,940
They don't want you to do that.

645
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:42,060
Because they know that when they offer you an afterlife, they're not really offering you that much.

646
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:50,600
It's just dime store religious pap that they're offering you.

647
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,900
A boring afterlife where you're sitting around scratching your ass for eternity.

648
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,420
Now, for an afterlife as good as subgenius heaven,

649
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:05,560
we could easily, easily ask you to kill a wheelbarrow full of babies and staple them to your head.

650
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,760
But the subgenius church only asks one thing.

651
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,600
A single $30 donation.

652
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,980
Less than the cost of a single cup of coffee at Starbucks.

653
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,420
Now, how can we afford to offer an afterlife with such great features?

654
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,540
At such a reasonable price?

655
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,760
Why, it's simple.

656
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,400
Because Bob loves you.

657
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,740
And he's also pretty stupid.

658
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,220
But you, yes you, can profit from his stupidity.

659
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,740
There's a catch though.

660
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,280
You have to die first.

661
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,060
And it's probably going to suck.

662
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,000
Really.

663
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,480
Really bad.

664
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,320
But hey, that was going to happen anyway.

665
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,940
When cometh the day that you shuck that monkey suit that you're wearing,

666
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,720
you're going to feel awfully stupid if you find yourself in some trailer park afterlife

667
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:23,700
with a bunch of stupid pricks who are only there because they were pre-programmed for servitude in life.

668
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,640
That would suck.

669
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:37,940
Worse still, you might be reincarnated as some unwashed morphidite in a prog basement blowing goats over a webcam.

670
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,940
I would hate that.

671
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I would hate that.

672
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:52,260
Now, you might ask, what about the flying saucers that Reverend Stang and Bob promised would come?

673
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,220
Where are they?

674
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,740
Where are they?

675
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,640
Where are they?

676
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,020
They haven't come.

677
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,060
Where?

678
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,040
Gee.

679
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,360
Where?

680
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,480
It's been ten years.

681
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,680
They haven't come.

682
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:10,100
And there's a good chance that you might not be here when they get here.

683
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,180
God dammit.

684
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,580
It's true.

685
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,140
It's true, brothers and sisters.

686
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,000
But you can have faith if you want to.

687
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,360
Old Bob never claimed to be infallible.

688
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,940
That's good.

689
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:30,740
And Reverend Stang, well, old Reverend Stang, he got that message directly from Bob himself.

690
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,160
But back then, Reverend Stang was

691
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,900
. . .

692
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,700
You know, I mean, he was into all kinds of fucked up shit.

693
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,660
So you can't take him at 100% on that one.

694
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,080
But you can have faith if you choose to.

695
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:58,960
I like to.

696
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:11,560
Faith is the difference between a mighty minotaur drinking a flagon of whiskey and fucking 100 virgins and Reverend Stang drinking sugar-free grape Kool-Aid in a brown fuzzy hat.

697
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,260
Oh!

698
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:22,580
If you're able and willing to have faith that the flying saucers will come and take you off to be a god on Plan X, despite the fact that they're a decade late.

699
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,900
. .

700
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,840
Then it won't cost you any extra to have a little faith in Plan B.

701
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,020
. .

702
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,520
It's no coincidence that Dobbs always says,

703
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,560
Give me slack or kill me.

704
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,900
. .

705
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,520
He knows something.

706
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,240
. .

707
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,860
And even if you think this is all just utter crap,

708
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,040
your ticket to eternal salvation

709
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:58,280
also comes with a bunch of really cool shit that you can use to freak out your family and your bosses.

710
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,960
And if you're lucky, they'll kill you!

711
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,700
And you'll have it made!

712
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,040
. .

713
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,900
And if you're real hardcore, you might get to go to subgenius hell.

714
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,180
. .

715
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,160
Subgenius hell?

716
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:21,040
Well, that has all the same things as subgenius heaven, only there's too much of it.

717
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,300
. . .

718
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,560
$30 for all that?

719
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,700
It's chump change.

720
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,960
Don't be a chump.

721
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,180
Good night, brothers and sisters.

722
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,840
I don't know who's coming up next.

723
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,060
. .

724
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:49,940
Oh yes, dear friends, Dr. Katahdin Lecum at the Baltimore DeFifle,

725
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,220
a triumphant return indeed.

726
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:58,180
Too bad the internet listeners don't get to hear how I censor the curse words for the broadcast versions.

727
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,960
But you can watch videos of this DeFifle,

728
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,300
the complete rants by Suzy Carter, Priestess Pisces, and yours truly,

729
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,460
and the amino acids as heard in the background here,

730
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,500
from amino acids, theaminoacids.com.

731
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,940
You can see these videos if you go to my blog, RevStang,

732
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:23,240
RevStang.blogspot.com,

733
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,200
or Subgenius.com and check the news area.

734
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:32,700
You'd be surprised what all is on Google Video under Subgenius.

735
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:39,580
But you might also be shocked if you knew in just what high places we are opposed.

736
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,260
Gentlemen,

737
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,380
state security has grown soft.

738
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:54,580
Its resilience against those who try to destroy our way of life has slackened.

739
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,580
Ever since the crash, we have successfully enforced the new social order.

740
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,720
For ten years, we have battled those who want to see its end.

741
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,520
These are not opponents with different political views.

742
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:17,040
They are not your typical marginal characters who thrive on crime and lawlessness.

743
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:17,840
These

744
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:23,900
are fanatical, well-organized, anti-implant vermin

745
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,300
who call themselves rebels

746
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:32,160
and who increasingly terrorize our society.

747
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,940
Infinite ocean.

748
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,320
Anyway, friends, the conspiracy, the false prophets, the wolves in sheep's clothing.

749
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,100
This world is getting pretty scary.

750
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,960
I mean, it's always been scary, actually.

751
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,120
I mean, at least the...

752
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,400
Well, it could be worse.

753
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,840
The 14th century was a little worse in Europe.

754
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,780
Half the population died.

755
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,980
As I understand it, though, half the population will probably die anyway, no matter what we do.

756
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:08,620
Because of the cancers, the poisons, the diseases, all the crap that you don't have any...

757
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:13,040
You know, you look at the news every day and it's just stuff you can't do a goddamn thing about.

758
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,080
The TV news shows.

759
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,760
This shit will destroy your mind.

760
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,700
It'll fuck your mind up.

761
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,920
Turn off that TV news.

762
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,880
And turn on YouTube.

763
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,880
Anyway, friends, think how...

764
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,980
Okay, so you know how bad it is because you've seen the TV news.

765
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,960
Think what they're not telling you!

766
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,160
Think them.

767
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,400
That's where the sci-fi books come from.

768
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,140
Half the time, that's just a preview of what's coming next.

769
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,620
They call the Church of the Subgenius a cult.

770
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,060
They call poor old David Koresh a cult.

771
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,460
They call poor old David Koresh and his people a cult.

772
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,920
Poor old Jim Jones and his dumb fucks a cult.

773
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,360
Goddamn it!

774
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,400
The United States of America is a cult!

775
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,580
What is the difference between Jim Jones talking 900 people into committing suicide

776
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:03,860
and the U.S. government convincing you to pay taxes every year?

777
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:05,780
Damn!

778
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:13,000
You know, friends, and the worst thing about the conspiracy,

779
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:21,500
they make it to where it seems like work, work as generally understood, is natural.

780
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,220
They make you believe that it's...

781
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:27,140
That means some people actually want to work!

782
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,480
And at the same time, they'll say,

783
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:34,100
Oh, but pornography and bad rock and roll is turning...

784
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,580
is breaking the family apart.

785
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,020
I'll tell you what's breaking the family apart!

786
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,380
It's day jobs!

787
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,880
Where mom and dad are both working from 8 in the morning

788
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,260
till 9 o'clock at night.

789
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,720
They kiss their kids a little kiss good-bye in the morning

790
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,660
and a little good-night when they get home.

791
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,080
The rest of the time, the kids are being raised by scarecrows

792
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,720
or something in the public schools.

793
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,140
Bob says,

794
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,560
legalize pornography and ban work!

795
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,480
Well, they like that!

796
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,220
war war war war war war war war war

797
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:11,520
getting b-b-b-b-but on a woman's garment there should be cross dressing.

798
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,460
men should wear women's clothes women should wear men's clothes men should look like black women

799
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:24,660
and so cut cut cut cut in every cult there are generally common normal cut cut cut cut so many

800
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:31,020
inches and it goes both ways by the way um that that that that that my wife liked it cut it off

801
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:39,020
cut it off but i i think it's a good idea and i actually like men and i that helps man man slack

802
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:45,780
we're just too small slack slack jesus wore a dress so no slack slacks then it's fine

803
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:53,820
slacks number two and we'll take it up again number two a great norel pref chop up there and now

804
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:00,960
from pr news in washington i'm still a threat and still trying to get weapons

805
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,500
pointing a gun at the camera the government jumped by the fastest rate in four years

806
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,440
it went up nearly five percent

807
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:08,820
and

808
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:08,980
one

809
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:09,000

811
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:20,900
supreme center it's watched closely because it's a key indicator of pr news in washington

812
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:28,080
when's the war against the scientologists going to begin begin it's ongoing well you know i want

813
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:36,840
to see some blood it's actually more of a uh a mutual uh uh stealing mutual we rip each other

off constantly they've

815
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,040
they've

816
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:56,740
went they were ahead they appeared first l ron and bob both uh had ideas about starting cults at the same time bob was in that room at that sci-fi convention when l ron hubbard famously said the way to make money is to start a your own religion

817
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:00,500
the scientologists are being tossed out of germany according to today's paper

818
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:08,100
whereas the subgeniuses are welcome all over germany they have a beach giving ways the father

00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:08,980

hy

00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,160
you

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,040

c

829
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:34,120
como

830
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,740
Well, you know how some people are scholars of the history of the Roman popes and so forth,

831
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,020
and there were all kinds of scandals.

832
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:45,540
You know, you found out hundreds of years later that this pope used to have sex with dead bodies,

833
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,680
and that pope had a woman mistress.

834
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,120
Yeah, it was that kind of thing.

835
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:53,520
And we're just trying to, you know, get that good soap opera stuff right up front.

836
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,880
Do it early.

837
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:55,320
Yeah.

838
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:55,920
And often.

839
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:01,220
Well, we've seen that, like, Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Baker got much more famous

840
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:04,880
after they sinned against God and all that.

841
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,580
And in our church, you know, if we get caught doing that kind of thing, we get medals.

842
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:10,640
Yeah.

843
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:14,660
You know, we get a special award, well, a merit point anyway.

844
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,340
I've almost got enough for that baseball glove.

845
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,500
I had to take some off my jacket since the weight was tearing the lapel.

846
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,380
Always take religion from a man named Jim.

847
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,140
Or Bob.

848
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,740
For that matter.

849
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,680
Actually, my general experience has been,

850
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,780
just don't trust anybody named Bob.

851
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,440
That's part of Bob's message, is, you know,

852
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,440
he wants you to trust him so that he can then betray your trust,

853
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:44,680
which teaches you a lesson and saves you from things like Heaven's Gate

854
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,980
or Jonestown or Republican Party or the Democratic Party.

855
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:52,520
But I do think that if Bob has quotes around it,

856
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:57,480
then you should treat it differently as a sort of a numinosity or omen.

857
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,820
But any ordinary, unquote-centered Bob,

858
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:02,480
is, you know...

859
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,600
A quote-less Bob is just any old Bob.

860
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,320
Yes, and you can always tell somebody who doesn't really know

861
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:12,900
how to write of subgenius things or ways when they write Bob without the quotes.

862
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,160
That is a sign of bogosity.

863
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:15,740
Right.

864
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,020
If you're going to have a religion,

865
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:20,420
you've got to be very persnickety about all kinds of trivial details

866
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,540
that don't make sense to anyone outside the religion.

867
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,200
It's like drawing the...

868
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,980
Critical pieces, contradictory ideas.

869
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:30,460
Draw the pentagram correctly or be torn limb from limb by the demon.

870
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,180
And for the...

871
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,000
Same reason you want to put those quotes there,

872
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,300
neatly surrounding the word Bob.

873
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,660
Now you know.

874
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:42,660
We've discovered that a lot of doctors and lawyers become subgeniuses,

875
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:48,840
and I think it's because they are part of a priesthood of baloney and bull and jargon,

876
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,080
and they recognize that in the Church of the Subgenius.

877
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:58,020
You know, it's like we have our own layer of incomprehensible jargon,

878
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,600
and doctors and lawyers appreciate that.

879
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,680
That's the key to their success.

880
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:09,280
Bamboozling, you know, calling and coming up with fancy names for a runny nose.

881
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,520
What would Bob think of the Skull and Bone Society?

882
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:12,980
I think...

883
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,640
Marvin Lewis, Johnny Come Lately.

884
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,120
What would Bob not think?

885
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,980
That's an even better question.

886
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,660
He would not think nothing.

887
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:29,800
That was from A Season in Hell with John Hell on PirateCatRadio.com.

888
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,800
In San Francisco.

889
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:37,580
And now let's eavesdrop on the book signing at Atomic Books in Baltimore,

890
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:43,220
where Reverend Carter LeBlanc read from his section of the 2006 book,

891
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,340
The Bob Liagra Farm.

892
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,860
A lot of what I rant about is slack-related,

893
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,440
because it's pretty much the most important thing to me

894
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,920
that I've gotten from the Church of the Subgenius

895
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,740
that wasn't actually sexual in nature.

896
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,140
Although some of the slack is sexual in nature as well.

897
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:09,900
So this is from the book.

898
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:14,320
When I was born, I had slack like nobody's business.

899
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:18,540
My whole body was covered in vaginal excretions,

900
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:22,320
and as soon as I could catch my breath, I was given a tit to suck on.

901
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:26,900
I was all wise because my ignorance was all-encompassing,

902
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,560
and I did not need a job.

903
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:29,960
Today,

904
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,360
I have a million words for things that I care nothing for.

905
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:37,240
I have innumerable skills that benefit me in no measurable ways.

906
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,360
I own myriads of things that I have no need for.

907
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,820
I am surrounded by thousands of people

908
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:48,060
whose only job is to determine what behavior is acceptable and unacceptable for me.

909
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:52,000
Those people employ thousands more who earn their pay

910
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,140
by enforcing those standards of behavior,

911
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,980
and they use three techniques for enforcement and pacification.

912
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,120
Number one,

913
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,440
they use positive reinforcement.

914
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,480
Number two,

915
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,880
they use negative reinforcement.

916
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,020
And number three,

917
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,880
they use repetition.

918
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:12,580
The overman recognizes these three techniques of pacification for what they are.

919
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:19,900
Positive reinforcement is the replacement of slack with false slack whenever possible.

920
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:26,360
Negative reinforcement is theft of external slack whenever necessary.

921
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:30,100
And repetition is the continual obfuscation of false slack.

922
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:30,100


923
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:38,380
The overman has achieved the path to liberation through three acts.

924
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,160
The rejection of false slack,

925
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,520
the reclamation of external slack,

926
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,800
and the realization of internal slack.

927
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:52,680
It's easy enough to say my false slack is just here to hold me over until the real slack

928
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,340
comes along.

929
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:59,060
But this is entirely incorrect because real slack doesn't just come along.

930
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,080
I'm sorry.

931
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,500
I'm sorry to say real slack cannot be obtained through lack of effort.

932
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:08,820
It sure would be nice, but the simple fact of the matter is that you have to work to get slack.

933
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,100
There are those that attempt to quibble theologically,

934
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,040
insisting that the deal was something for nothing.

935
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:20,420
The problem with this debate is that false slack is not nothing.

936
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,860
It merely takes the place of nothing.

937
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:27,600
If you fill your wallet with shit, you won't have room in there for money.

938
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,060
The sub-genius may be able to explain to you that the money is not just for money.

939
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:30,060


940
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:30,060


941
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:40,880
Let them take the place of the worthy but it should alsoTime to benefit you and both authors

942
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:40,880


943
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:40,880


944
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:40,880


945
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:45,520
Instead of the black people like you.

946
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,000
Cause you have been working to get sex?

947
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:48,440
And pride would not recognize you as an asshole.

948
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:48,760


949
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,580
Because that's really weak fashion.

950
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,860
Is mama real?

951
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,460
Today?

952
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:55,480
Nop.

953
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:56,460


954
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:56,580
Be honest.

955
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:56,920
Then what?

956
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,760
Do they have any money?

957
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:05,260
false slack on you means that somewhere there is real slack. If you have real slack, you do not

958
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:11,740
need false slack. False slack is indicative of a condition that is lacking in real slack. And if

959
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:20,420
you have slack, why would you ever, ever, ever concern yourself with false slack? And you don't

960
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:28,260
say, just give me a little slack. No. As far as we can tell, there is only a finite amount of slack,

961
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:35,800
but so little of it is actually being used that there is enough slack for every man, woman, and

962
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:44,020
child subgenius to say, give me all the slack I can handle. And even if every subgenius said that,

963
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:49,680
no subgenius would go slackless. There's that much slack available. But this is not the church.

964
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:57,120
Of give me half an hour for lunch or shoot me in the fleshy part of my leg with a 22. This is the

965
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:05,600
church of give me slack or kill me. This isn't the church of I hope they knew I was just kidding.

966
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:15,440
This is the church of fuck them if they can't take a joke. Kill Bob, but please pay your $30 first.

967
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:33,160
Carter LeBlanc reading from the new subgenius book friends. This is our slide number 1132.

968
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:41,960
For more information about the church of the subgenius, see subgenius.com. You can do that,

969
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:49,640
but you can't do everything. So, you know, you can't worry all the time about the state of the

970
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,400
world. In fact, you can't worry all the time about the state of the world. You can't worry all the

971
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:50,820
time about the state of the world. You can't worry all the time about the state of the world. You

972
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:57,620
can't do a whole hell of a lot about it, but you can certainly mow your lawn, wash your dishes,

973
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:08,640
invest in brittle fiberglass broomsticks. And the main thing is friends is just remember slack.

974
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:15,680
Slack is all you need. Oh, wasn't there a Beatles song like that? Now I have a confession to make.

975
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:20,180
I'm going to wrap it up here because there's someone a lot better looking than me,

976
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:28,260
waiting in the wings. I used to be frustrated sometimes when I'd look at my fellow subgeniuses

977
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:37,540
at the sheer nerdliness of half of those people. It was like, what fucking dorks? I mean, I'm a dork.

978
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:43,740
I'm a geek, but geez, you know what I mean? I mean, some of them, Christ, you don't want to be,

979
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:48,740
but well, duh, I finally, it finally sunk in.

980
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,180
That's what,

981
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:50,400
that's what,

982
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:57,100
this is all about. Of course they're fucked up because there really is a conspiracy of normals

983
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:05,500
robbing away the slack of the abnormals and the weirdos. And that's why Bob is their God.

984
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:13,800
And he's a good looking God too, ain't he? The girls like him. Anyway, friends, you know,

985
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:20,060
every year we wait for the aliens. We figure, okay, this July 5th at 7am, it's going to be X day.

986
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:24,840
The aliens are going to come and lift us up. We're not going to be like Heaven's Gate or Jehovah's witnesses

987
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:32,360
who only expect it once. We'll expect it every goddamn year. We're subgeniuses. And we think,

988
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:38,280
wow, when the aliens come and take us off to planet X, we'll have a new government. We'll have better

989
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:47,680
jobs or no jobs. And rich, famous, beautiful people won't define what's cool. We'll define what's cool

990
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,040
as soon as those aliens come and say, oh, we're going to have a new government. We're going to have a new government.

991
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:50,040


992
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:50,720
We're going to have a new government. We're going to have a new government. We're going to have a new government.

993
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:57,740
Friends, what are we waiting for? The lesson of X day is you cannot depend on invisible space monsters

994
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:03,940
in the sky to answer your prayers. You can't even depend on black and white, B-dotted clip art

995
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:12,460
salesmen to save your ass. We can make that new government or as we used to, as the late,

996
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:19,860
great Chaz Smith used to say, build your own ship. Build your own spaceship, friends,

997
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:32,780
build your own Amsterdam. Or even better, steal your own spaceship. Make your own slap. Bob is not the answer.

998
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:41,480
Praise Bob, neither is anything else. That is the great wonder of Bob. You must, you must

999
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:46,760
learn to think for yourself. But only Bob can show you how.

1000
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,020
Question of the day.

1001
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:50,600
Authority!

1002
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:57,380
There's some subgeniuses out there. There's somebody who's been reading their prescriptions.

1003
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:05,540
That's right. Why question authority? And, but most important of all, friends, please

1004
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,580
fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1005
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:19,360
Susie, this is something really, really important. You've got to call me back as soon as you can.

1006
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:25,040
It's life or death. I'll tell you about it when you call me. Immediately, you've got to call me.

1007
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:33,540
Call me back. I'm not at the old number. I'm at the new number. And, oh yeah, the new number is 856- or whatever.

1008
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:45,540
And, oh yeah, the area code is 3-0. So, yeah, call me, man. You've got to call me because I'll tell you what it's about.

1009
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,700
It is so... Look, just call me.

1010
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:54,460
Okay. I guess that's all. Oh, yeah, this is Reverend...

1011
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,300
FIGHT MY GRANDMOTHER!

1012
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,500
Fuck burners!
