1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,800
And now, my friends, it is time for the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,500
And this is going to be kind of an old school one.

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,160
Half of our listeners, or most of our listeners, probably won't hear this for another week or so,

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,860
after the world has been destroyed, or maybe just as it's happening.

5
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:30,840
That would be ideal.

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,040
Yes, that would be ideal.

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,100
This music in the background is the Flying Ryan Brothers.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,920
One of the few good, really good bands we know.

9
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,960
Although the other really good bands we know will be at X Day.

10
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,920
The Amino Acids, for instance, and Evolution Control Committee.

11
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,140
And Fat Mandino.

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,400
Tommy Amoeba.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,720
The Duke of Uke.

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:06,360
Who does ukulele cover versions of punk and glam rock songs and popular hits.

15
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:16,300
But we're mostly going to be playing a lot of old school media barrage from, oh gosh, back around 2001 or so.

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,080
For some of you, that was a really long time ago.

17
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,940
For some of us, eh.

18
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,020
And so, it's an X Day special, that's for sure.

19
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,340
But we do have some special new stuff that shocked us when we heard it this week.

20
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:41,900
And we'll be getting to that new stuff any second now.

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,500
But first this.

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,900
On July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m., when we all have hangovers,

23
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,940
Lone Pan's judgment will take place in the form of what the pre-scripture is called,

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,840
The Advent of the Angelic Host.

25
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,980
Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world.

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,780
Only his predictions are just a little different.

27
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,740
July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m. to be exact,

28
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,620
the men from Planet X, as the news media will call them,

29
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,640
will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses, the true believers of geniuses,

30
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,200
up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

31
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,580
And believe it or not, plenty of people,

32
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,440
4,000 of them so far, and more every day, have already joined up.

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,980
Suddenly, the joke has become serious and profitable.

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,360
Your standard religious rip-off, right?

35
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,940
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?

36
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,260
Dear Bob, it's time to close my eyes.

37
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,640
Remember now, it's no surprise, if I should be found dead someday,

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,340
I'll think that you were in the way.

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,260
Oh, gimme Bob.

40
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,960
Confusing that face.

41
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,200
I'll be with my own.

42
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,560
Can't remember my place.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,900
Bob's role on this planet is to see that the Earth is not sold

44
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,240
on that glorious or terrible day we call X-Day in 1998.

45
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,820
When the men from Planet X arrive.

46
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,880
Yeah, now it may sound ludicrous.

47
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,660
It may sound ridiculous to many of the believers out there.

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,020
It may sound impossible.

49
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,500
Yeah, you're saying that all nuts, all those people,

50
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:24,700
they're all just a bunch of fools.

51
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,200
Maybe, yeah, maybe.

52
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,820
You once were telling me about Planet X, Dr. Morbant.

53
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:34,860
Evil on Planet X is more than you could think of.

54
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Evil stalks them.

55
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,640
Every night and day, they wait to see the evil they go through.

56
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,040
Do they come down in flying saucers?

57
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,600
Flying saucers are bearing on us.

58
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,460
We don't know what to do.

59
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,580
We're here all alone.

60
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,700
The planets are fading.

61
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,200
The blood is running.

62
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,960
The lights were fading.

63
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,680
And they stalked us one by one.

64
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,720
This is the Man in Black, here for the Roma Wine Company of Fresno, California.

65
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,960
Are we controlled by secret forces?

66
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,560
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

67
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,140
Do people think you're strange?

68
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,420
Do you?

69
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,660
Then you may be on the right track.

70
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,940
Give me slack or give me food or kill me.

71
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,960
Give me slack or give me food or kill me.

72
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,940
Kill me.

73
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,840
Kill me.

74
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,180
Goodbye.

75
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,360
Goodbye.

76
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,200
Goodbye.

77
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,420
Goodbye.

78
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,400
Goodbye, Earth.

79
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,320
Night.

80
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,920
Little monkeys in your cage.

81
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,640
Night, night.

82
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:05,080
All your great skyscrapers, your achievements, your mighty books and discoveries, your symphonies,

83
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,940
your armies, your concentration camps.

84
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,220
All of it was for nothing.

85
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,120
Your indoor plumbing, your toiletries, and your many delicacies that no one knew people were starving to eat.

86
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:22,180
As a wink, a tiny spark, dying ember in the middle of thousands and billions of years.

87
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,600
A million light years of empty, cold space.

88
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,400
Glowing, stinky hole in your third eye.

89
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,560
You are about as important as a cork in the ocean, my friend.

90
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,180
Think of a cockroach, if you would.

91
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,220
I don't know if you want to think of one for too long.

92
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,400
But just imagine the revulsion you feel when you swat one and brush it away from yourselves.

93
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,580
Think of yourself as a mere cockroach compared to these weird exes, archons, whatever the hell they are.

94
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,320
They don't notice you.

95
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,180
They don't care about you.

96
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,200
If you happen to hitch a ride and they don't swat you off, then count yourself lucky.

97
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:09,360
But don't think you're some kind of a big deal just because God or some aliens happen to pick you up by the scruff of your neck and show you a thing or two.

98
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,960
They're in there with you.

99
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,840
They're in the room with you.

100
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,620
You can't see them.

101
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,180
You can't smell them.

102
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,200
You can't taste them.

103
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,100
But they're in the room with you.

104
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:28,080
And they blend with the walls, with the CDs, with the vinyl rack, with the digital, with everything, with the microphone.

105
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,460
And with the airwaves.

106
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:41,540
It's the hiss buried in the tape that we use to carry the code, the coded signal.

107
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,500
But it's the only way we can stop them.

108
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,840
The human mind.

109
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,320
The human mind is capable of receiving and transmitting radio signals.

110
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,460
It has no way of converting this knowledge or energy into a practical use.

111
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:04,920
However, the brain has in it, in some miraculous way, the ability to transmit and convert and receive radio signals.

112
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:13,760
We use your brain as an envelope to send our letters to the others.

113
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,000
There are correspondence with a world you could never fathom.

114
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,040
It's square to your round.

115
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,100
It's cheesy to your musky.

116
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,580
It's black to your white.

117
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,680
It's green to your red.

118
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,520
It's out of focus to your sharp image.

119
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,060
Do the rat in the cheese.

120
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,460
The cheese is the universe.

121
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,600
Do the rat, baby.

122
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,280
Do it one more time.

123
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,620
Everybody love to watch it.

124
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,540
Do the rat.

125
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,800
Do the rat.

126
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,140
Do the rat.

127
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:51,100
There are more things in this cheese than your little science has ever dreamt of, Mickey.

128
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,780
I've been stuck here for so long.

129
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,000
Just wondering when it's gonna end.

130
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,600
When it's gonna blow up.

131
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,620
When this sun is gonna go nova.

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,980
Could that be what's happening, Dave?

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,620
You think X-Day was just Bob's way of saying, well, it's just aliens or something.

134
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,040
Don't feel bad.

135
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,120
Don't feel bad that God's gonna supernova your son unexpectedly for no particular reason.

136
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,400
No special timing.

137
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,460
Just happened to do it around the time Bob said something was gonna happen.

138
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:30,680
It's nice you let us know around the time because, you know, if we was more God-like, we could have made our plans accordingly.

139
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,840
It's kind of like we, but we're kind of like the old dog that just got too sick.

140
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,560
And you take the old dog out in the woods.

141
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,740
You go, here, old dog.

142
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,920
Here's a big old hunk of raw meat.

143
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Mmm, isn't that good?

144
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:54,740
And when that dog turns around to gum that raw meat, you pull out your .45 and blow his poor pathetic old doggy brains out because it's the kindest thing to do.

145
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,800
Is that what our planet is, that old dog?

146
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:07,900
Are we that old dog just being put out to pasture, put out on the ice floes, toothless to fend for itself or go under?

147
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,860
Is it?

148
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,500
Is our planet...

149
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:10,720
Is it?

150
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,500
Is our planet being sent off to the rest home?

151
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,540
Yeah, like everything's gotta have its time and go.

152
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,120
Maybe our time already came and went and we didn't even know it.

153
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,680
All things must pass.

154
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,220
We was laughing and playing them Dionysian dances by the old Greek riverside.

155
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,060
Them were the days.

156
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:38,100
We jumping through hoops and wrestling with bears and then we invented hydrogen energy and decided to blow us up some bombs and have tooth decay.

157
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,360
And then have tooth decay.

158
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,060
The whole planet.

159
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,080
And then before we knew it, nobody knew the truth.

160
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,720
Nobody was well anymore.

161
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,320
Nobody was even really alive.

162
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,780
They were just going, going, going.

163
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,300
We thought we had the ultimate weapon.

164
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,720
Turned out God had it all along.

165
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:01,880
We thought we was gonna hold a gun to our own head and we didn't even get the chance.

166
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,020
No, we thought we were so prideful.

167
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,700
We thought we could destroy ourselves.

168
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,260
Mother Nature showed us what for.

169
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:15,020
She said, you boys think you can wreck your environment with them factories and bombs.

170
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,700
Let me show you a thing or two.

171
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,440
Here, I'll just spit this little spit water into that sun thing.

172
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,200
That little light bulb you got lighting you up.

173
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,520
Look very calmly and clearly at the question, Mr. Pavilion Head.

174
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,220
Counting down the minutes to the end of the solar system.

175
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,240
What you usually think of first in a situation like this is who benefits?

176
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,440
Earth first.

177
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,920
Who takes all?

178
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,020
There's a power play going on.

179
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,320
The sun's getting bigger.

180
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,440
It's getting weirder.

181
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,140
It's getting flatter and longer.

182
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,800
Mars sideways and more.

183
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,000
Everything.

184
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,580
You know, Mars will probably be real tropical in about three hours.

185
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,560
If we could get to Mars in about three hours, it'd probably be real nice.

186
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,560
But then by the time we got there, it would be Pluto would be getting all tropical and we'd have to get there.

187
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,540
Pluto, man.

188
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,360
And then three.

189
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,400
Oh yeah, there's gonna be like palm trees on Pluto and you'd be...

190
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,680
I don't know if I got enough rocket motors for Pluto.

191
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,780
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if we're gonna be able to make it.

192
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,020
No academy of the planet.

193
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,120
Friends.

194
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,000
Now it's time for me to read to you something that relates to what was being discussed there.

195
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,720
That was from the old WCSB show, ESO Swamp Radio with the host Chaz.

196
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,080
You heard Chaz right there at the very end.

197
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,900
Cellulose heroes never really die.

198
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,360
And this is Chaz's music in the background from which disco we used it last week.

199
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:38,420
I'm building up to our amazing discovery, but I wanted to mention in that previous little discussion,

200
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:47,200
Dave and I were discussing the possibility of a supernova destroying the Earth.

201
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:57,360
What I'm about to remind you of is some news that was in our most recent subgenius, well, the third testament,

202
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,760
subgenius cyclopedia of slack, the Bobliographon.

203
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:08,420
And this is the only place you're gonna hear it because it's completely out of print until I personally released it.

204
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,120
And I'm gonna release the full color e-book of it.

205
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,740
Don't hold your breath.

206
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,820
That'll probably happen on the escape saucers.

207
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:23,260
But what I'm going to remind you of is a discovery primarily researched by Dr. Onan Kanabike.

208
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,680
And that discovery is that this planet is Mars.

209
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,820
At some point in the 1950s, the third and fourth planets from the sun switched places.

210
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,400
We think it was around 1953.

211
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:45,640
We think the psychic wounds opened up by World Wars I, II, and III were a partial cause.

212
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,520
We think a bunch of things.

213
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:55,420
But the point is that this planet is Mars and we were on the wrong planet for X day.

214
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,020
Bob was there on the real Earth, now the fourth planet from the sun.

215
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,560
So were the Xists.

216
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,460
All parties necessary to close the deal were there except us.

217
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,440
Now friends, I'm gonna skip over.

218
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,160
I've got several pages of technical proofs here.

219
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:18,060
Which you would be able to read if you got this book while it was still available.

220
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,900
I can tell exactly how many of you did too.

221
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,540
Um, but the, so I'm gonna skip over.

222
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,820
But I'm gonna go through the pertinent parts, preacher style.

223
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,680
And then I'm gonna play something that Princess Wee and I heard on television and recorded.

224
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,080
That freaked us out.

225
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,500
It freaked out our minds.

226
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,960
That's not, actually that is pretty hard to do now.

227
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,340
What there is left of them.

228
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,140
Friends, they use up planets and cast them aside.

229
00:13:50,860 --> 00:14:01,360
You say, what if this planet's atmosphere and environment, the living third planet, is slowly and not so slowly being transformed to resemble the dead fourth planet.

230
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,240
Just as the subgenius is trying to bring about the good Mars.

231
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,240
The conspiracy strives to bring about the bad Mars.

232
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,980
They had to swap planets because they used the old one up.

233
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,980
Whole planets are used as prison farms.

234
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,420
We were on Mars.

235
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,800
We missed X day.

236
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,080
That is our condition today in this world.

237
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,260
You wanna know about the real Earth?

238
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,180
Where we, some of us came from.

239
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,500
Us older generation.

240
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:42,660
On the true Earth, or what they call Mars, you'd be taller and your bones would never hurt.

241
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:49,680
The hair on your back would be silkier and your legs wouldn't go numb from long excremeditation sessions.

242
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,800
Yet, Henson lived for thousands of years on the true Earth, Mars.

243
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:03,500
But on false Earth, as bones age, they grow nerve cells which serve to deliver mild to severe pain constantly.

244
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,540
Your Earth bones beam weakness rays at your other bones.

245
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,420
That's how they're controlling everyone.

246
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:24,200
On quote Mars, here, these same bone nerves deliver, oh no, the other, this gets confusing between the two planets.

247
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,620
On Mars, these same bone nerves deliver orgasms.

248
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,840
No one, not even Madame Yeti women, shave their breast pits.

249
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:42,100
Sex on true Earth, what we call Mars, is like nothing we could even begin to imagine here within this awful closed gravity well.

250
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,840
This titan of unfairness.

251
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,240
This, quote, Earth.

252
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,440
Actually, Mars.

253
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,920
How come neither Art Bell, Air American, or Rush Limbaugh ever mentioned this?

254
00:15:53,100 --> 00:16:00,840
It's because the conspiracy will spend any amount to hide the fact that it despoiled Mars, used up its froppcanos,

255
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:08,380
and church air caves, and exploited its resources, leaving a dusty airless ball,

256
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,060
and then took its princes and queens off as slaves.

257
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,260
And that's who we, the subgeniuses, are, friends.

258
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:22,540
Now, Dobbs knew of the Earth-Mars switch when it happened, but he had to wait for the right plot point, so to speak,

259
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,400
to emerge before that skinned cat could be let out of the nine bags.

260
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,780
He couldn't release the information until the century changed.

261
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,920
And even then, it was iffy.

262
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:41,580
So, friends, we can go ahead and announce this right now, right here, to ensure disbelief.

263
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,460
But indeed, Earth and Mars were switched.

264
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:55,340
Now, this last week, that television show known as Futurama came back on the air.

265
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,680
Princess Wee and I found the two episodes.

266
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:00,760
And we're going to tell you about them.

267
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,060
And we're going to tell you about the two episodes.

268
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,340
There's one of them, and this is one of our two episodes in The Media Pit, The Media Ditch, rather,

269
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,040
which is where we get our TV shows.

270
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:14,800
We choose to avoid the mind control race that they send over cable or broadcast TV.

271
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:22,180
And we were flabbergasted at what we heard.

272
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:22,920
Absolutely.

273
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,320
Yeah.

274
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,380
It's been cut down to three and a half minutes of the pertinent parts.

275
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,680
It's almost a spoiler if you haven't seen these shows.

276
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:39,620
But the visuals would make up for the bizarre coincidences.

277
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:48,920
So, friends, remember, we just heard from 2001, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, talking about Earth being destroyed by solar flares.

278
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,800
More than a decade ago.

279
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:59,720
We heard Reverend Owen Canabites' research from a decade ago, really, about the Earth-Mars switch.

280
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,920
And now, last week's Futurama.

281
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,840
I hope you're proud of yourself, Ben.

282
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,120
You've turned this perfectly worthless loser into an addict.

283
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,540
Cut me some slack, preacher.

284
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,820
I'm just a coal grinder's daughter trying to stay off the pole.

285
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,940
Let's see.

286
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,740
I think it means...

287
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,780
Get to the point.

288
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,680
What does it say about me, Bender?

289
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,760
Nothing.

290
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:33,500
But it does say a great cataclysm will destroy the world in the year 3012.

291
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,620
The world?

292
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,920
That's where I live.

293
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,860
Told you it'd say something about me.

294
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,760
So the world will end in 3012.

295
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,780
Why does that year sound so familiar?

296
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,180
Because that's the year that's this year.

297
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,140
I'm gonna blast that balloon.

298
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,820
No way will I let God get my pants.

299
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,400
Nobody messes with my pants.

300
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,660
Not even the Holy One.

301
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,560
Blessed be he.

302
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,280
Is it just me, or is the world ending more often these days?

303
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:07,380
The calendar predicts fires, earthquakes, shark-splosions, then it just ends.

304
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,800
Exactly as the weather balloon foretold.

305
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:17,160
Before Fry blew his pants out of the sky, it detected the onset of a catastrophic sunspot cycle.

306
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,580
It's starting!

307
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:20,780
It's starting!

308
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:20,780


309
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,980
This is the end of the world!

310
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:23,920
Ah!

311
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,420
Some of us were crazy before it was cool.

312
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,240
Evacuating the planet in three, two...

313
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,560
So long, Earth. Thanks for nothing.

314
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,540
It's not starting!

315
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,020
Stop the end of the world sex! We might survive after all!

316
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:49,920
Ah!

317
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,060
Welcome to Mars!

318
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,740
It is with heavy heart and open arms that we receive Earth's only survivors.

319
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,220
Greetings, Marsmen.

320
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,260
We come to your planet to construct a gleaming city.

321
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,000
A second Earth on which to begin anew.

322
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:11,560
And now, as a solemn testicle to those left behind on Earth, I present this monument, titled simply, Heroes.

323
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,200
Stop the ceremony!

324
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,640
What?

325
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,460
I am Singing Wind.

326
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,820
Chief of the native Martian tribe.

327
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
But I thought your people abandoned this planet.

328
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,020
We did.

329
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,180
I just came back for my stuff.

330
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,140
I translated your warning that the world was doomed.

331
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,640
Not your world. Our world.

332
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,660
We put calendar there to warn you not to visit Mars.

333
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,900
It's Mars that's gonna be destroyed.

334
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:37,680
Oh!

335
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,420
Why you think we so eager to abandon this dump?

336
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,880
My God!

337
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,220
One of the hundreds of contradictory prophecies is coming true!

338
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,620
It's just as I only now began to fear.

339
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,240
The solar flares are igniting subsurface gas pockets.

340
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,000
Mars is being blasted out of its orbit!

341
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,220
The crazy weather cleared up too, for whatever reason.

342
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,140
All in all, it's a fine day for an apocalypse.

343
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,460
We're passing surprisingly close to Earth.

344
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,220
When we reach 72nd Street, jump!

345
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,780
Yeah!

346
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,160
Yeah!

347
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,140
We made it! We're back home!

348
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,900
Okay. Today is still a work day, so...

349
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,680
Wait! Help!

350
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,720
I'm still on Mars and I can't jump!

351
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,180
I promise to cut taxes for the rich and use the poor as a cheap source of teeth for aquarium gravel.

352
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,500
That'll show those poor!

353
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,480
You're not rich.

354
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,840
But someday I might be rich and then people like me better watch their step.

355
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,480
Yep.

356
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,820
That last section there was, uh, it didn't have anything to do with the subject at hand, but it was a great line.

357
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,100
I think it's a preview for next week's show, Politics 101.

358
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,540
Futurama is basically the only continuing show that we watch, besides Breaking Bad.

359
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,760
Yes.

360
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,160
And we're behind on that.

361
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,020
Yes.

362
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,540
I need to turn your mic up.

363
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:09,460
But it, um, sure does seem sort of suspect that, uh, that, uh, had to have been some sort of a tip of the hat.

364
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,520
Well, uh...

365
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,600
A mysterious one, but...

366
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,760
Matt, Matt, I met Matt Greinig when I was more famous than he was.

367
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,880
Which isn't saying much.

368
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:28,840
But seriously, in like 1980 or 81, when Life in Hell was just starting to hit the weekly papers, and Simpsons was just a gleam in somebody else's eye...

369
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:28,860
Uh-huh.

370
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:37,780
Uh, I met him and also the guy that did the set design for Pee Wee Herman, um, Gary, Reverend Gary Panter.

371
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:44,520
St. Byron Warner brought us together so we could bitterly talk about how we were never going to get rich and famous.

372
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,300
And two of us never did.

373
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,000
Anyway, uh, it does, though, often times...

374
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:00,140
This isn't the first time we've seen things on Futurama that, usually by coincidence, we had just come up with.

375
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,580
Gags or plot devices for things we haven't done yet.

376
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,480
They beat us to it.

377
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:15,560
And, uh, I wouldn't be at all surprised if there wasn't a subgenius minister involved in writing that show and throwing in tips of the hat.

378
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:21,160
But, on the other hand, it could just as easily be sheer coincidence.

379
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,300
God, cut me some slack, preacher.

380
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,960
Well, I believe in sheer coincidence. I really do. And I believe that that's all it is.

381
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,200
Coincidence.

382
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:42,460
It doesn't have meaning outside of your pathetic, human, desperate brain that is searching for meaning in a world that is actually spinning through the void, uh, dear boy.

383
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,560
With no...

384
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,540
No...

385
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,520
No meaning is what J.R. Bob Dobbs brings to it.

386
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:53,460
Which is just about as confusing as everything else that happens.

387
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,940
So, there's not all that much difference.

388
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,360
It's just that we got Bob and they ain't.

389
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,460
And for that, we can hate them.

390
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:08,240
And, uh, I'm gonna go to some more tapes and, uh, from the olden days.

391
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,280
And we'll just see what happens.

392
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,900
We're tired of your phony fireworks.

393
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,200
Bartle! You have earned this!

394
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:36,380
What about, uh, what about this, uh, reputed, uh, Jesus Starfleet that was, uh, supposed to have shown up?

395
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,920
As you see, they have just left the hangar deck at Lunar Central.

396
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,860
And have cleared the airlocks into the colony.

397
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,000
The crowd of scientists and technicians are going wild.

398
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,120
What a space ovation!

399
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,560
Now let's wheel another!

400
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,340
And now in celebration of this great occasion, we have planned a lunar party.

401
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:04,920
We hope all young people throughout the solar system will join us in celebration of this great day in outer space.

402
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,100
Hey.

403
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,380
Bob?

404
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,820
This X-day shall come sooner or later.

405
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,560
That X is nothing but a cross that's fallen over on its side and somebody jumped on it.

406
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,680
Banged it up.

407
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,200
There is hope. There shall be hope.

408
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,560
You know, the, we, we sit and worry, oh gosh, if only the X-est had come.

409
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:40,040
We could have had a new government where Bob was the leader and since he's never around there'd be no laws and we could do anything we want.

410
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:47,560
We could have had a new church where instead of having to get up with a hangover on Sunday and watch boring crap,

411
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,680
you'd go to church Saturday night and get drunk!

412
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,320
Drunk, my friends!

413
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:58,160
Oh, we could have had our own coolness where we invented the coolness, blah blah blah blah blah.

414
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,700
Friends, what are we waiting for?

415
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,540
Are we really waiting on some invisible monster?

416
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,320
Or some monsters in the sky?

417
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,160
Or some space things?

418
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,680
Or some pipe smoking salesman with a good line?

419
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,260
Friends, I say, quit waiting, do it yourself!

420
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,860
Make your own slack!

421
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,000
Bob is not the answer and neither is anything else.

422
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,020
You must learn to think for yourself, but only Bob can show you how.

423
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,300
Question authority or else!

424
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,700
And duh.

425
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,520
Well, I've waited so long for this day in outer space.

426
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,720
I don't know who they are or where they come from.

427
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,420
But I know I've been chosen, probably one of the few.

428
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,340
Only first class on the mothership will do.

429
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,140
I've seen them saucers sliding, baby, up in the air.

430
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,000
And I know what they mean, I know the end is near.

431
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,660
So I'll climb the silver staircase and I'll bind link with the crew.

432
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,580
Only first class on the mothership will do.

433
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,340
We're going lightspeed out of space.

434
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,340
We're the last hope for the human race.

435
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,320
A little green flight of tanks, a pregnant and the spears and peanuts.

436
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,060
Only first class on the mothership will do.

437
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,360
Music

438
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,300
There'll be nothing to want.

439
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,880
There'll be nothing to need me watching.

440
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,100
Grand Ole Opry and Hee-Haw in 3D.

441
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,660
Laying horseshoes on the holodecky.

442
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,920
Roast beef from a tube.

443
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,880
Only first class on the mothership will do.

444
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,160
Music

445
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,680
We're going lightspeed out of space.

446
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,700
We're the last hope for the human race.

447
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,640
A little green flight of tanks, a pregnant and the spears and peanuts.

448
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,480
Only first class on the mothership will do.

449
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,600
Music

450
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,760
We're going home, going home on the saucer.

451
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,100
Get on board singing praises, hallelujah to the Lord.

452
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:17,040
I'm so glad that I've been chosen for to start my life.

453
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,300
I'm a new, lonely first class on the mothership will do.

454
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,000
Music

455
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,000


456
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:44,520
My parents are dying to take me home

457
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,020
This is the life to be an astronaut.

458
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,560
Listen this is the life I want, just feel the need to know As long as my applying and flying isiane will be all I see.

459
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,420
Music

460
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,820
I'm going lightspeed out of space.

461
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,480
Like Tammy and George Jones or Adam and Eve

462
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,120
Flying past the rings of Saturn, grab a window with you

463
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,140
Flyin' first class on the mothership with you

464
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,020
We're goin' light speed out through space

465
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,840
We're the last hope for the human race

466
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,700
Little green flight attendants bring the anchors, spears and peanuts

467
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,480
Up to first class on the mothership we'll do

468
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,680
We're goin' home, goin' home on the saucer

469
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,860
Get on board singin' praises, hallelujah to the Lord

470
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,420
Praise the Lord

471
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,120
I'm so glad that I've been chosen for to start my life anew

472
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,280
Home made first class on the mothership we'll do

473
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,000
Amazing, dear friends, that was Hank Floyd.

474
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,000
Huh!

475
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,120
Yes, Hank Floyd.

476
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,740
I haven't played that on this show.

477
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,780
This is probably at least ten years old.

478
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,680
I forgot this even existed.

479
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:07,560
There's a couple more great Hank Floyd songs on here that I should probably get to.

480
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,220
Certainly off my radar.

481
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,080
Yeah, first class on the mothership.

482
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:17,060
Well, technically we have heard it before in the past.

483
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,480
A lot of this is past.

484
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,460
In fact, I'm going to go back.

485
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,040
Back to that media barrage, sort of.

486
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,480
And this must be from like...

487
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,780
We're going to be playing stuff from 1980 and 81.

488
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:40,020
Before there were subgenius radio shows or even edited tapes.

489
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,440
We were just starting to collect the material together.

490
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:50,940
So here is Pope David N. Meyer and myself, I think, being interviewed for Rolling Stone magazine.

491
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:59,760
And, but they never printed the article because the Eurythmics came along and that was considered a little more newsworthy.

492
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,020


493
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:01,820
Hey!

494
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
What's going on?

495
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:11,840
Along with Bob, the pursuit of slack, and a conspiracy of pinks, the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

496
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:21,460
According to church doctrine, on July 5th, 1998, when the television signal of Amos and Andy reaches the men from Planet X, the men from Planet X are going to be killed.

497
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,280
And the men from Planet X are going to come down and take over Earth.

498
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,380
They're going to...

499
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:40,800
They will put us out of our misery unless Bob can explain to them in ways that they can understand that there is something on Earth worth saving.

500
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:50,460
And only the subgenii, the dues-paying, book-buying, receipt-in-the-pocket, paid in full to the church subgenii, have the tiniest prayer.

501
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,320
The rest of them?

502
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,080
It's a tough world, Jack.

503
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,740
That's right, friends.

504
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,120
A red-letter day is coming.

505
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,820
Yes, a red-letter day.

506
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:07,620
And it was July 5th, year 2001.

507
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,620
What a dreadful day.

508
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:18,460
And there the gigantic flying saucers come down out of the blue sky to pick up the happy-go-lucky subgeniuses.

509
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,180
Fletching their heels.

510
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,020
And their pets.

511
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:21,440
And their dogs.

512
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,460
Bluebirds.

513
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,700
And all their worldly goods.

514
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,040
And swallows.

515
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,740
Because, friends, you can take it with you when you're a subgenius, sure.

516
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,640
A throne of gold can be yours.

517
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:36,620
You can take off and get it on with Ba-ah-b-uh.

518
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,980
And Dave here, who will be your driver throughout Earth space.

519
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:42,900
Step in.

520
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,340
Step in, please.

521
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,420
Stand clear of the closing door.

522
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,480
Step in, please.

523
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,860
Stand clear of the closing door.

524
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,120
Red line, please, only.

525
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,580
Blue line to the left.

526
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,740
Red line to the right.

527
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,360
Hey, hey.

528
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:54,500
This is your free-to-air page.

529
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:00,760
Welcome, and we'll be embarking for, well, wherever these escape vessels escape to.

530
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,980
No one's ever asked, and we're not telling.

531
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,720
What's gonna happen to your children?

532
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,280
What's gonna happen to your children?

533
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:12,280
What's gonna happen to you when this society we've created, when this society we've created,

534
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,500
air conditioners, air conditioners, station wagons with wooden sides, station wagons with

535
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,380
wooden sides, are cautious, indeed, are retired after the orange paint?

536
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,760
What's the point of taking all these financial issues to the affections of theING?

537
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:35,100
Well,palаша to the nous, qui ne serait pas correct, Erick, or of course, if I had a found

538
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:40,380
some rooms and perhaps confirmed their existence, I'd be otherwise��ирick apply for the status

539
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:40,380


540
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:40,380


541
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:40,500
if theology was waking you up, you'd be ready for your birth right away.

542
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,020
Bitch, the Raptors took out every lane, the noises they had in other vehicles or at least

543
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,300
because nobody, you know, hadéqual to could've gone into it, we're gonna go full

544
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:43,900
operation, sorry.

545
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,340
We must point to the sun.

546
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:45,340


547
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,880
condama, wai.

548
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:46,880


549
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,400
Go ahead and fertilizer will else, open home.

550
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,540
Good for you to come with the house.

551
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:55,580
long ways off. I come from a planet that is similar to yours. Your many fears,

552
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:00,820
tensions and frustrations are no longer ours. I hate them with all my heart.

553
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,580
They're inhuman and to be destroyed. What is your objective?

554
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,560
You are not ready, but we will still save you.

555
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,300
I'll be right here.

556
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:26,900
I was first contacted by a being from the planet Mars. Now this man was invisible to

557
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,580
me except that he did cast a shadow in the moonlight.

558
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:41,480
By 1998, every normal, mediocrity, pink boy, admin, Trekkie and hippie is going to be trying

559
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,620
to get on board with the good ship dog.

560
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,420
The good ship dog.

561
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:45,840
Or...

562
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,860
Or they're going to fry along with everybody else when those aliens get here.

563
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:57,060
Of course, such a prophecy immediately arises our cynicism. Is it possible that the end

564
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:05,240
of the world will come in July 1999? Perhaps. Or is it just another of those prognostications

565
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,700
which have haunted man through the ages? Such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally

566
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,200
be dismissed out of hand. But for the fact that many of Nostradamus's

567
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,040
other prophecies have already been fulfilled.

568
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:24,740
But the old ones are coming back. I'm going to let them through.

569
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:37,920
The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout.

570
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,380
What would you say if I had found a Martian down there?

571
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,880
I think I would have been a little more careful.

572
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,180
I think I would have been a little more careful.

573
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:45,180


574
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:45,180


575
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,600
Maybe.

576
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:07,200
Well, then you could have transformed him to something entirely different over time and

577
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,200


578
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,200


579
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,200


580
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,200


581
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,220
So turns out there's nothing interesting about him right now to be telling people all this

582
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:07,220


583
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,560
Hmm, that's an adv Lego, right Nostradamus.

584
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
Guess there's something more in there, why not.

585
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:10,780
The pure wisdom of websites has significantly opened doors too.

586
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,180
Well, at least, we're well-deterred about what happens in...

587
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,320
guitar solo

588
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,580
The world, crippled by these events,

589
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,100
waited for the first sign of an invasion from outer space.

590
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,800
solo

591
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,340
solo

592
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,120
solo

593
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,140
solo

594
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,520
solo

595
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:09,100
The amino acids, dear friends, will be at 50 next day.

596
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,080
Evolution Control Committee will be at 50 next day.

597
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:21,700
Dr. Philo Drummond and Mrs. Drummond and Little Lily Drummond will be at 50 next day.

598
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:30,280
Gee Gordon Gordon, the oldest mummy of a subgenius,

599
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,840
with almost as many, well, with twice as many inserted metallic body parts as Dr. Leguien,

600
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,220
who will also be at 50 next day.

601
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,720
Reverend Susie the Floozy will be.

602
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,400
At 50 next day.

603
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,420
Priestess Pisces and Reverend Suds Pishaw will not only be there, they will be wed there.

604
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,260
So will Reverend Gorgon and Princess Squirrelface.

605
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,080
Two weddings this next day.

606
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:58,540
Wow.

607
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,880
We got a lot to do before the earth is destroyed.

608
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,680
I guess so.

609
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,000
A lot of bands to pack in there.

610
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,600
Who else?

611
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,600
The jamming will be great.

612
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,220
We know that.

613
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,380
There's some excellent just general musicians coming.

614
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,740
The jamming is often the best part.

615
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,180
I think.

616
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:23,380
And after we're lifted up onto the saucers, just because we promised,

617
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,880
we're going to hold Starwood on my personal escape planet,

618
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,320
which will contain the Grand Canyon, which we may use for Starwood.

619
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:39,660
But most likely, we'll, just for ironic purposes, we'll lift up our old site,

620
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,660
not the staff of it.

621
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,580
We'll leave them in the crater.

622
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,580
But, and we'll hold Starwood, and Wisteria.

623
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,400
We'll combine them.

624
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,940
We'll lift up, we'll save Wisteria, and we'll probably save the staff of Wisteria.

625
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,460
They'll have to pay their 30 bucks eventually.

626
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,140
That was a joke.

627
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,580
Anyway, and Starwood is the week after X-Day.

628
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,080
Princess Wee, you have all that information in front of you, don't you?

629
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,340
Yes.

630
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,540
The dates and the people.

631
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,220
Yes, I do.

632
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,740
It's going to be from July 10th.

633
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,820
The 16th.

634
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,340
Six days of camping, celebration, and discovery.

635
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,760
And music.

636
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,060
Lots of music.

637
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,820
I've discovered some pretty disturbing things at Starwood,

638
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,340
stumbling around in the dark near the bonfire.

639
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,800
Yeah, I was one of them.

640
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,440
Yeah, that's true.

641
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,520
That's true.

642
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,660
Princess Wee and I met at Starwood, and then we started holding,

643
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:42,240
and that inspired, Starwood inspired X-Day, and a couple of campgrounds,

644
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,340
and,

645
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,560
and X-Day is where a whole lot of subgenius couples met.

646
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,720
We got married.

647
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,240
Some of them even got divorced.

648
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,080
Some of them had kids.

649
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,440
Yes, little BBs happened.

650
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,320
Now the kids are running things.

651
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:55,980
Yes.

652
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:56,900
Yes, yes.

653
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,100
I trust the kids.

654
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,920
Frankly, not to name names, but a lot of cases,

655
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,640
I trust the kids a lot more than I trust the ones my age.

656
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,360
For reasons that are probably obvious just from listening to me.

657
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:11,860
So,

658
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,920
So, on your pleasure, Saucer, then,

659
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,340
when we're at Starwood, we'll be listening to bands like Jim Miller,

660
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,080
that people in Northeastern Ohio know really well,

661
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,780
but they're kind of a Grateful Dead jam band.

662
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,340
Telesma, that's a didgeridoo Middle Eastern rhythms band.

663
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,360
Badal Roy, the world-famous tabla player extraordinaire.

664
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:41,040
Environmental Groove Theory, a seven-piece jazz rock fusion band with a Latin influence.

665
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,000
They're really good.

666
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,100
Yeah, they are.

667
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:43,840
They're hot.

668
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,060
Female vocalist.

669
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:50,080
Mayan Ruins, the world music band from Cincinnati.

670
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:50,780
I've played them.

671
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,260
Uh-huh.

672
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,620
Yes, they've been heard on Hour of Slack.

673
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,420
Brian Henke, beautiful folk singer and guitarist.

674
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,640
Well, okay, that's enough of all this folk singer and world music stuff.

675
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,220
The subgeniuses don't care about that.

676
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:12,000
They also have a zillion workshops and speeches and such like, including a subgenius devival.

677
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,840
I usually save my best stuff.

678
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:19,280
For Starwood, my best, and other people's best stuff, for that matter,

679
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,220
because it's, I'm not preaching to the saved exactly.

680
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,140
At X Day, I start preaching.

681
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,920
They've all heard it before, and they wander off and get whatever they get.

682
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,360
And so I usually, and plus they're louder than I am.

683
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,900
I mean, our hecklers are louder than our preachers in a whole lot of cases.

684
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,940
I've been, I've tried to get the hecklers up on stage, especially Dr. Dart.

685
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:49,860
But I understand you're putting your face on the line when you do that.

686
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:55,820
Anyway, pardon me if I left anybody out who's important, which is everybody,

687
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,480
but we're really excited about it.

688
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:07,140
Next week on this show, we will have, we'll have to be ready to go as soon as we literally finish the shows,

689
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,360
but we should have Dr. Howell in the studio.

690
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,380
The famous Dr. Howell of AskDrHowell.com.

691
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,160
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave by phone.

692
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:24,180
And Dr. Sinister, like three hours worth of jibber jabber.

693
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,120
And then we take off.

694
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,300
And then we'll do it again the weekend before Starwoods.

695
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:36,200
That's one reason I thought, well, let's just do this old timey media broad stuff.

696
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,480
In fact, I'm going to go right back to it right now.

697
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,380
Round, round the slack for Bob, the Bob down in the saucer row.

698
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,060
Round, round the slack for Bob.

699
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,160
Bob, the Bob down in the saucer row.

700
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,960
And in that air, there was a ship, a rare ship.

701
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,040
An ex Jamaican ship with a ship in the air.

702
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,040
And the air flew smoke in the smoke with a cap and the prop and the pipe .

703
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,680
The pipe and the grit and the grit of the Bob.

704
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,620
Bob down in the saucer row.

705
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,500
Round, round the slack for Bob.

706
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,440
The Bob down in the saucer row.

707
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,520
Round, round the slack for Bob.

708
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,340
The Bob down in the saucer row.

709
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,940
And in that ship, there was a Bob, a rare Bob.

710
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,860
JR Bob Dobbs.

711
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:23,280
With a bob on the ship and the ship in the air and the air through the smoke and the smoke from the prop and the prop and the pipe and the pipe and the grin and the grin and the bob.

712
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,060
Bob Donovan, the sorcerer.

713
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:38,620
The plan is to invade, to infest key men in government and industry with some alien force from outer space that seeps into the human body and takes over.

714
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,460
What if there is a form of life in space, not on some planet, but just drifting?

715
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,420
Not life as we know it.

716
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,300
With intelligence, yes, but pure energy with no organic structure.

717
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:50,980
Invisible.

718
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:51,600
Invisible?

719
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,220
Now, the rocket passed through its path.

720
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,400
It entered the rocket.

721
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,620
It found living specimens of our form of life.

722
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,080
Cell organisms.

723
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:58,960
Humans.

724
00:44:59,180 --> 00:44:59,560
Exactly.

725
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:05,860
Now, if even by accident it could enter one of those structures, what a way to invade the Earth.

726
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,200
Now, look, sir, I'm not over-intelligent.

727
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:08,440
Excuse me.

728
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,020
If you saw the film, you know what happened.

729
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,360
Holy God knows where and how far that rocket traveled.

730
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,980
Something got into that rocket.

731
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,900
And it's found other forms of life.

732
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,220
The cactus.

733
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:20,700
Greek.

734
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,940
You mean Kuruza?

735
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,520
The cactus.

736
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:25,200
He's now in the shell of a man being transformed.

737
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:31,260
If one of these cactus plants were subject to the same mutation, there could be an affinity, a union between plant and animal.

738
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,660
With the ability to destroy.

739
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,580
And possess.

740
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,140
And multiply.

741
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,000
And create.

742
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:41,340
And create.

743
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:42,940
And create.

744
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,380
And create.

745
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:44,460
And create.

746
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:44,460


747
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,240
An alien cannot invade a dead man.

748
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,300
We're merely using this corpse for a demonstration of placement.

749
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,280
You know, some people say church is subgenius.

750
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:57,060
So they get involved in it and they say, after about six or seven, they get real involved.

751
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,480
They jump into the internet intercourse of the church and so forth.

752
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,220
And after about six months, they're going, God, this is worse than high school.

753
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,480
The popular ones pick on the wimps even worse.

754
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,620
Worse than in real life.

755
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,200
Yes, friend.

756
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,920
It is like the high school from hell.

757
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,840
Hey, I'm gonna take a week off.

758
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,220
Gonna go to hell.

759
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,680
Save the new year postcard.

760
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,240
Hey, I'm doing swell.

761
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,480
Wish you were here alone.

762
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,360
From hell.

763
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,840
Hey, I'll be dancing through the flames like a devil in disguise.

764
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,560
Yeah, you can hear me sing but not by sunlight.

765
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,800
Yeah, you can hear me sing alone.

766
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,040
From hell.

767
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,580
I'm gonna get laid and a fire around my neck.

768
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,400
Because she never cares.

769
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,340
Oh, hell, what the heck.

770
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,920
I'm packing my duds.

771
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,560
I'm gonna hide from hell.

772
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,720
I'm gonna get laid and a fire around my neck.

773
00:47:52,220 --> 00:48:02,340
Oh, hell, what the heck.

774
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,940
I'm packing my duds.

775
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:20,120
Oh, hell, what the heck.

776
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:20,460
I'm packing my duds.

777
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:20,900
I'mopic horror.

778
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:20,900


779
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:20,900


780
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:20,900


781
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,420
Oh, hell, that's something.

782
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:27,480
Oh, hell, what the heck.

783
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:32,320


784
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:41,140
You bastards, with a lot of love, we work for one year for you pigs.

785
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,240
And you want to break our walls down?

786
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,000
And you want to destroy it?

787
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,180
Well, you go to hell.

788
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,000
If there's a holocaust or a cataclysm, if there's a cataclysm now,

789
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,820
you tell me how to make a light bulb.

790
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:53,800
Tell me anything.

791
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,020
The sun is supposedly going out of the galaxy.

792
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,460
We're all revolving.

793
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:00,980
This system is revolving around the 29th degree of Taurus in the eye of the bull.

794
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,680
And that's why the Space Brothers are here, to get Earth all in line.

795
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,080
Are they going to come and actually tell us or help us?

796
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,480
Then what do you do with the situation that because of the atomic explosions

797
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,360
we're becoming farther and farther off our axis?

798
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,120
Is that a good thing or is that a bad thing?

799
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:14,720
It's a bad thing.

800
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:24,880
Friends, the great late Professor Chaz Smith edited that stuff,

801
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,840
and there's more of it.

802
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,740
In fact, I'm going to jump ahead to Chuck.

803
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,920
I'm going to jump ahead to Chuck.

804
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:31,920


805
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,800
Yeah, here we go.

806
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:36,680
Oh, yeah.

807
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,920
And every day, every day I'd wait for my daddy to come home from work.

808
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,300
And he'd come into the house and he'd be all covered in that thick black blood.

809
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,820
He'd have that blood in his hair.

810
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,720
He'd have that blood in his clothes.

811
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,960
He'd have that blood caked around his nails.

812
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,440
He was covered in that blood.

813
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,720
And I'd look up at my daddy all covered with that blood,

814
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:05,800
and I'd say, Daddy, someday I want to be just like you.

815
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:11,520
Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child

816
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,160
may prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult.

817
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:21,220
Lack of involvement with the father or over-involvement with the mother

818
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:25,540
can result in lack of ability to relate to sexual beasts.

819
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:30,960
And in homosexual leanings, narcissism, transsexuality,

820
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:30,960


821
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,460
girls from the waist up and from the waist down

822
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:36,100
attempts to be your own love object

823
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:42,400
reconcile your parents to you by becoming both at once.

824
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,860
Even Marilyn Monroe was a man,

825
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:52,540
but this tends to get overlooked by our mother-fixated, overweight, sexist media.

826
00:50:54,320 --> 00:51:00,260
So, uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child

827
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:00,960
may prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult.

828
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:01,220
Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child

829
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,060
may prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult.

830
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,640
If you give in to them every time they cry,

831
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,880
they will become little tyrants, but they won't remember why.

832
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:18,500
Then when they are thwarted by people in later life,

833
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,700
they will become psychotic,

834
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,800
and they won't make an ideal husband or wife.

835
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:29,680
The spoiled baby grows into the escapist teenager,

836
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:30,540
who?

837
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,940
Who's the adult alcoholic?

838
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,700
Who's the middle-aged suicide boy?

839
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:42,800
So, uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child

840
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,760
may prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult.

841
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:51,180
When them saucers come, you're gonna need a clean pair of underwear.

842
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,640
It's like your mama said,

843
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,120
that you're wearing clean underwear, you might get into an accident.

844
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,880
But it won't be an accident, brothers and sisters.

845
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:00,960
Let me tell you...

846
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,560
If you give in, I will be happy to leave you...

847
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,460
twisting at will.

848
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,820
Amen, brothers and sisters.

849
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:13,700
I am the God of Hellfire, and I bring you...

850
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,320
FIRE!

851
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:19,460
Ah, yes, yes, yes, friends.

852
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,180
Uh, Professor Chaz edited that stuff.

853
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,820
That was, uh, Dr. LeGim preaching at some ancient revival.

854
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,420
God, he sounds so young.

855
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,860
He does, he sounds like a baby.

856
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:36,680
I remember when, uh, Chaz used to do this, and didn't Art, the original, this, this guy play at Starwood?

857
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,460
No, uh, Craig Mitchell, Paternostril, always wanted, uh, Arthur Brown to come to Starwood.

858
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,660
I thought we did have him there.

859
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:48,100
No, he's from England, and, uh, would be a bit much.

860
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,160
Well, um, let's see, what all was I going to do here?

861
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,480
We had, uh...

862
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,860
Oh, I did want to mention...

863
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:58,760
Thanks.

864
00:52:58,860 --> 00:52:59,780
I'm going to go to Cleveland.

865
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:00,380
I'm going to go to Cleveland.

866
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:01,720
I'm going to go to Cleveland.

867
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,340
I'm going to go to Cleveland.

868
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,180
With background music.

869
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,360
You know, friends, uh...

870
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,880
Oh, by the way, I don't know who did all the music on that, that last cut.

871
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,140
Uh, that was...

872
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:19,020
I just have this generic Media Barrage stuff of X Day that I keep on hand and hadn't used in a long time.

873
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,100
And it just...

874
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,880
All I know is that that was some stuff that Chaz edited for his show.

875
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:24,220
Uh-huh.

876
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,840
Uh, I recognize the subgenius parts, and that's about it.

877
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:28,840


878
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:39,760
Um, speaking of subgenius parts, you know the Mormons have this doctrine whereby you can turn somebody into a Mormon after they're dead.

879
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,400
You can baptize them as a Mormon.

880
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,440
You can make a Jewish person into a Mormon after they're dead.

881
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,920
Not while they're alive, because the Jewish person would probably object.

882
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:50,520
Yes.

883
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:55,480
But once you're dead, you know, that's just one of the things that goes with being a Mormon.

884
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,520
You can make anybody do whatever they want after they're dead.

885
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,200
Dead people are very, very agreeable, I've noticed.

886
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,240
Malleable.

887
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:10,060
I know quite a few maladjusted individuals who converse with dead people all the time and get their advice.

888
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:16,280
Anyway, uh, well, we can do the same thing, friends.

889
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:22,600
And our friend, Reverend Jess John, bought a subgenius ordainment.

890
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,880
Or two. Actually, he bought two.

891
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:24,680
He paid.

892
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:28,500
He actually paid for two subgenius ordainments.

893
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:28,500


894
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,860
For these two individuals who have passed on.

895
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:31,520
What a guy.

896
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:41,820
Joseph Smith, Jr., who lived from 1805 to 1844, and Brigham Young, 18, uh, who died in 1877.

897
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,580
They are now subgenius ministers.

898
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,360
They're not Mormons anymore.

899
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:55,480
Joseph Smith and Brigham Young have quit the Mormon church and decided it was a bunch of hogwash that they just made up off the top of their heads.

900
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:58,500
Whereas church's subgenius might as well be the same.

901
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,660
They might as well be the same thing, but it's a lot more fun.

902
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,700
Praise Jess John!

903
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:09,500
And we, you know, they did have that polygamy thing, but they went and advertised it.

904
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,040
Real smart. Like Napster.

905
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,900
Anyway, Jess John said,

906
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,420
Yeah, I'm talking early Mormon founders.

907
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:22,320
I realize them being dead, delivering their memberships may present you with exciting opportunities for improvisation.

908
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:28,500
I see the range of possibilities, ranging from going to Salt Lake City and banging on some tits,

909
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,720
to going to the temple doors, perhaps nailing some theses on them while you're about it,

910
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:38,720
all the way down to issuing a minor notice on subgenius.com, or in this case, Hour of Slack.

911
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,760
And mention me if you wish.

912
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,980
If you do opt for the over-the-top option, remember, for the sake of hoity-toity announcements,

913
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:52,140
I still regard my title as Ayatollah of Understatement.

914
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,380
So that was Ayatollah of Understatement, just John.

915
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,640
Welcome, Dr. Sinister.

916
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,480
Thank you. It's good to be here.

917
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:02,880
You know, if the Mormons can baptize dead Holocaust victims,

918
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:06,380
why can't we get church memberships for dead Mormons?

919
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:07,680
Right.

920
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:09,920
Turnabout is fair play?

921
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:10,540
Absolutely.

922
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,300
Well, somebody else has to pay for them. That's the problem.

923
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,940
But hey, you know.

924
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,960
Oh, I can't make a call to action on that.

925
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,460
Well, friends, I brought some other stuff, too.

926
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,080
I brought a survivalist guide.

927
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,560
I was going to tell those of you who never became subgenius,

928
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,700
how you can live off the land,

929
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:42,340
especially getting live meat that has just been killed by, say, an owl or a bear or a fox, something like that.

930
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,080
That's perfectly edible.

931
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,600
It's probably better than roadkill.

932
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,860
You might get a little bear saliva on it.

933
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,320
But bears are going to be doing worse.

934
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:51,580
It cooks off.

935
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:52,800
Yeah, it cooks off.

936
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:57,620
Bears are going to be doing worse things to you after July 5th anyway, if you know what I mean.

937
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:57,620


938
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,440
If you're not saved.

939
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,480
Joseph Smith and Brigham Young will be okay, though.

940
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:03,820
They won't have to be.

941
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,360
Some subgenius who hates Mormons will go to bring them back from the dead.

942
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,600
Damn, their graves are empty.

943
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,760
And then turn around, and there they'll be, going,

944
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,220
Oh, I fooled you. Praise Bob.

945
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,960
Anyway, friends, we must get off the air.

946
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,340
I'm going to play one more song by Hank Floyd.

947
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,540
This music in the background was from Witch Disco,

948
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,440
which was the band of Chad.

949
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:32,200
Chaz and Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Michelle George and Bob Mosick.

950
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,720
And every now and then you hear everybody but Chaz.

951
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,940
I suppose some people probably hear him.

952
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,780
Well, we just heard him tonight.

953
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:42,700
Yes.

954
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,940
So, if you need information about the Church of the Subgenius,

955
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,180
you can look at subgenius.com.

956
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:57,160
And if you're not on the internet yet, then you probably ought to just avoid this stuff.

957
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:02,520
And stay tuned for upcoming show.

958
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,220
And now, Hank Floyd.

959
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,940
I saw them lights, I saw them lights

960
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:35,640
They came for me in the middle of the night

961
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,300
Up in the sky, Lord, shining so bright

962
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:43,140
Praise the Lord, I saw them lights

963
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,340
I was a fool to ever believe

964
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:07,100
That my dear old air force would never deceive

965
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:11,060
And they came for me like little angels in the night

966
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:14,720
Praise the Lord, I saw them lights

967
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,500
I saw them lights, I saw them lights

968
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,180
They came for me in the middle of the night

969
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,820
Up in the sky, Lord, shining so bright

970
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,680
Praise the Lord, I saw them lights

971
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:51,140
Well, I was a fool to wander and stray

972
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:54,900
From the main highway that faithful lay

973
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,220
Now all that I know is that

974
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,680
I don't know what is right

975
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:02,580
Praise the Lord, I saw them lights

976
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:07,260
I saw them lights, I saw them lights

977
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,960
They came for me in the middle of the night

978
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:14,600
Up in the sky, Lord, shining so bright

979
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:19,820
Praise the Lord, I saw them lights
