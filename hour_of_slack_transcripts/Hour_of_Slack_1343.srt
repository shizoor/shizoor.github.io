1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,940
Are you a voyeur? Do you like to watch?

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,580
Uh-huh.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,020
What's your name?

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:07,980
Bob.

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,840
Hi, Bob.

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:09,580
Uh-huh.

7
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,760
What are you going to do with it, Bob?

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,020
Tell me. Tell me how you like it. If I came in your room right now, what would you do to me?

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,460
Baby, if you came in my room right now, I'd want you to put your feet...

10
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:21,920
Oh, boy.

11
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,160
Oh, yeah, Bob.

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:23,980
Oh, yeah?

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,800
Uh-huh. Do you think you can find...

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,080
Oh, yeah?

15
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,460
Uh-huh. Do you think you can find my sub-G spot, Bob?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,220
Uh-huh.

17
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,560
Come on, baby. Find it for me.

18
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:32,940
Yeah.

19
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,360
Oh, Bob. Oh, yeah.

20
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,320
Yeah.

21
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,900
Uh-huh.

22
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,960
Four, three, two, one, fire!

23
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:52,500
Welcome to the sub-genius radio ministry, Hour of Slang.

24
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,920
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,800
Slang!

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,520
Slang!

27
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,220
Slang!

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,280
Slang!

29
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:02,620


30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:02,920
Slang!

31
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,080
Slang!

32
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,080


33
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,080


34
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,080


35
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,080


36
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,080


37
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,080


38
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,080


39
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,080


40
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,080


41
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,900
Now, you keep talking about this Bob, and I've seen pictures of him, certainly a lot of

42
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:17,920
drawings of him, and yet I've never heard... You sent me several of the books and the tapes

43
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,040
and stuff over the years. I've never actually heard Bob's voice. I've never seen a photograph

44
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,620
of him.

45
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,600
Well, you've seen plenty of photographs of him. You pick up any old Better Homes and

46
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,840
Gardens, Popular Science.

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,820
from the 50s and early 60s, Bob modeled for ads.

48
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,540
He's that guy with the pipe, the grinning, sort of a Ward Cleaver-ish,

49
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,220
Dick Van Dyke-looking fellow with this sort of slightly crazed grin,

50
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,600
and he's got a pipe.

51
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,900
You may have seen pictures of him spray-painted on bridge abutments

52
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,080
and dumpsters and so forth.

53
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,000
Let me quote it.

54
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,220
I created light and created darkness, created goodness and created evil.

55
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,180
Evil. I, the Lord God, do all these things.

56
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,140
God is the source of evil, and he admits it.

57
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,200
What's the burr under your saddle?

58
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,740
That's like if you hit your hand while you're nailing a hammer

59
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,880
and close your penis in the door of a car,

60
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,220
or like the channel changer maybe takes off and it's weird.

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,600
Weird crap, man.

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,540
That's what it is, Captain Whiz Boy.

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,840
Did I disconnect the wrong person?

64
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,720
I don't know if that was a person, was it?

65
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,200
No, it probably wasn't.

66
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,160
Another one of those discarnate voices from the...

67
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,320
The void.

68
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,420
I don't know what I'm doing.

69
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,220
Speaking of the void, how's your show?

70
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,660
I don't care.

71
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,740
He wants to go home.

72
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:37,920
I don't care.

73
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,880
He didn't want to come in.

74
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,140
I don't care.

75
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,080
What, are you all caught up with hours of slack?

76
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,840
You don't need anything?

77
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,560
I'm copying an old rerun of us being funny years and years ago,

78
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,540
back when we were funny.

79
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,640
Back when we were funny.

80
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,080
Yep.

81
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,920
Now we're just old and want sex.

82
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,360
Speak for yourself.

83
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,280
I don't even want that.

84
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,080
I just want to go to bed.

85
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,980
I was talking to you about...

86
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,420
My plan is to think of something absolutely new and revolutionary

87
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,980
which would change the whole face of the world.

88
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,340
The function of the order of Dionysus Abasios

89
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,180
is both the destruction of Christianity

90
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,420
based on the principles of the Satanic Bible

91
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,340
as written by Anton Zander-Levay.

92
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,180
Being of teenagers from authoritarian slavery.

93
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,400
Adolescence is only a social invention.

94
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,980
By nature, teenagers actually are adults.

95
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,100
Should be treated as such as puberty is nature's endowment of adulthood.

96
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,220
And so they should be...

97
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,500
Teenagers should be free to go out with older adults

98
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,600
regardless of how much older.

99
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,960
To become like a teenager.

100
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,260
To become one of them again.

101
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,160
Do you remember these?

102
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,200
Mother sits there and looks at the young child.

103
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,060
She says, my dear child, we're going out into the wide world

104
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,140
and you're going to meet an awful lot of strange people.

105
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,380
You must listen to your mother.

106
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,560
Don't contradict her and always remember these words.

107
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,740
Don't take gum. Don't take candy.

108
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,880
Don't get in strange cars. Don't talk to strange men.

109
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,360
Keep your legs crossed, your panties up

110
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,480
and come home from school in a group.

111
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,260
Your poor little girl gets in a modern car today.

112
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,980
Even a Nash, just for an instance.

113
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,900
Boy, the guy settles the car, pushes the button,

114
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,460
the bed comes down, you get your head caught in the drug.

115
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,400
You don't even know you had it.

116
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,720
Right, because trying to prove that there is,

117
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,440
you know, that there is or isn't a heaven or hell

118
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,140
is like trying to prove that there is or isn't a heaven or hell.

119
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,860
We can't prove that little pink elephants don't exist

120
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,740
in another galaxy somewhere.

121
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,360
We can't prove it, but personally,

122
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,100
Satanists do have principles,

123
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,860
whereas an anarchist will do just whatever he wants to do

124
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,600
with your life.

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
And being out of control is very unsatanic.

126
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,440
Do you like lying?

127
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,800
Because your name's not Eric

128
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,260
and you're the jerk of the day and goodbye.

129
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,500
And oh no, don't tell me they gave me Ron from Seattle.

130
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,160
Bobby, how's my lying, pandering,

131
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,760
carnival barker of hate

132
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,260
and misinformation today?

133
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,920
Excuse me, excuse me.

134
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,420
Bob, listen, please give me my time.

135
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,940
That's right, I'm Terry Carr

136
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,560
from the voice of the Midlands, Midlands Radio,

137
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,040
all the way from Leeds, Lancashire.

138
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,180
And tonight we're going to have a very interesting guest.

139
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,480
He says he's the man who is responsible for,

140
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,120
if you've heard of it, I'm sure some of you have,

141
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,920
the Church of the Subgenius.

142
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,360
I'm sure you've all heard of the name Bob

143
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,580
and seen some of the graffiti around town lately.

144
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,580
Is it a satanic cult

145
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,740
or is it just another little hyperbole?

146
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,520
We'll pick a group of crazies on the lam

147
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,620
looking for some fun.

148
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,940
We'll be back in five minutes after some words

149
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,100
and we'll be talking to Reverend Armit Say.

150
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,460
Praise Bob!

151
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,660
Praise Bob!

152
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,160
You've enjoyed Garrison Keillor's

153
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,040
homespun storytelling for decades.

154
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,180
Now delight as America's heartland humorist

155
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,300
brings to life the most memorable event of the decade.

156
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,860
Garrison Keillor's L.A. Riots.

157
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,180
Old Mrs. Laramie was surprised at the ease

158
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,440
with which she was able to waltz out of that electronic store

159
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,220
with the new staring boombox.

160
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,140
But then the store was owned by the man.

161
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,980
And of course she didn't know how to hook it up.

162
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,520
So she put a call out to the fix-it man, Otis Brown.

163
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,600
And he said to her, he said,

164
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,000
Mrs. Laramie, he said,

165
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,620
you've got blood all up on the side of this thing.

166
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,600
And then she remembered just how on her way home

167
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,800
she had used that boombox to clock a Korean grocer.

168
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,320
Yes, indeed.

169
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,080
Garrison Keillor's L.A. Riots.

170
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,400

With missionary zeal

188
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,080
You spit on the fur coat

189
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,180
Yet you wear the leather jacket

190
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,020
And you eat cheese from a goat

191
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,940
Lay your march and you write

192
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,800
And you vote and you scream

193
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,140
All you do, everybody, is scratch

194
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,420
In a big ugly machine

195
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,660
Oh, Mr. Correct

196
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,360
God, tell me what to do

197
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,580
No matter how many rules you got set

198
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,360
You still want to die

199
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,000

You're a fool

You're a fool

You're a fool

219
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,400
Nothing but a prude

220
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,240
You're afraid of sex and nudity

God, tell me what to do

Don't

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,400
We

00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:18,600
Know

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:18,740
Those

Names

248
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,440
Hello friends and welcome.

249
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,040
The sermon tonight is entitled, What If?

250
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,340
It is called that for good reason.

251
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,920
Because you see, everywhere I go across this great nation,

252
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,280
everywhere I tour, every performance I give,

253
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,180
some sincere but misguided Christian accosts me in the parking lot

254
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,700
and barks a curse we've all heard a million times for the last 2,000 years.

255
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,160
Sinner!

256
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,440
They shriek, eyeballs bulging and bony finger pointing.

257
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,200
You may laugh now, but come judgment day,

258
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,980
what if you're wrong?

259
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,640
If I had but a dime for every time that thinly veiled threat was hurled towards a subgenius,

260
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,580
I'd have more money than all the trial lawyers in California and New York combined.

261
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,460
Yet, as mean-spirited as this rhetorical question sounds,

262
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,600
it is in fact a legitimate challenge.

263
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,460
What if, Bob forbid, we are wrong?

264
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,280
Such a premise.

265
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:59,380
It's difficult for subgenies to contemplate because one of the cornerstones of good salesmanship

266
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,780
is confidence in the product.

267
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,080
We will succeed because we know we will succeed.

268
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,080
It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

269
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,040
To even question the outcome is not only defeatist and anti-Dobbsian,

270
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,060
it is the subgenius sacrilege.

271
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,980
And yet, in the interest of,

272
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,900
in a very open theological debate,

273
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,480
we will consider just this once the question of what if we're wrong.

274
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,400
Now theoretically speaking, not that it is statistically probable,

275
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,340
but hypothetically, imagine if you can,

276
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,460
a world come July 5th, 1998, where there is no excess invasion.

277
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,420
Oh it's painful, it's painful dear friends, I understand,

278
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,060
but remember, this is only theoretical.

279
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,060
A planet that is not surrounded by an angry,

280
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,120
alien spacecraft.

281
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,480
A globe not

282
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,760
littered. A globe not completely

283
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,600
polluted with the corpses

284
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,160
of conspiracy

285
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,600
dupes.

286
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,980
Oh, dear

287
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,880
friends, it would be a sick

288
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,660
society still dominated

289
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,180
by pinks and normals.

290
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,500
An earth where corporations,

291
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,660
governments, and well-equipped armies

292
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,640
still loyal to the system continue

293
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,000
to uphold the status quo.

294
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,920
They fight

295
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,960
to maintain their tight totalitarian

296
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,960
grasp on the very throat of freedom.

297
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh, it's a nightmarish

298
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,840
vision indeed, one that makes my head

299
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,860
spin, but one we will contemplate nonetheless in the

300
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,000
interest of free and open debate.

301
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,720
Yes, dear friends,

302
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,700
this dark future of

303
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,660
Dobbsian defeat and conspiracy

304
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,220
conquest, this

305
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,700
desperate future where the last of

306
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,880
genius forces are holed up in the underground

307
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,720
bunkers awaiting the final

308
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,980
onslaught by conspiracy mercenaries

309
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,760
is a vision we do not

310
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,660
want to contemplate, but will this one last

311
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,120
time.

312
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,480
As the Kelvin bombs

313
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,720
explode far above on the planetary

314
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,980
surface, staying in his

315
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,880
subgenius generals huddled

316
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,720
beneath a flickering lightbulb, pouring

317
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,500
over maps of subgenius tunnels,

318
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,720
subway tunnels, and underground sewers,

319
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,500
examining any and all possible

320
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,860
attack routes, they will be

321
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,680
determined, determined

322
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,700
to fight to death and take the

323
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,620
maximum number of normals with them.

324
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:20,960
Woo!

325
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:22,760


326
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:26,840
Why?

327
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,240
Because we hate you!

328
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,060
Woo!

329
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,660
They will be dedicated to honoring Bob

330
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,720
through a dignified Dobbsian death.

331
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,740
It is even,

332
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,680
it is then that

333
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,800
some weak of heart heretic

334
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,700
will step forward, probably some Bobby

335
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,120
who always dreamed of being a real subgenius

336
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
warrior for a long time.

337
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,460
But when the chips are down for Dobbs wants to cash,

338
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,020
out.

339
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,040
This weak-willed wannabe Bobby will show his first real courage

340
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,780
when he steps forward and whines,

341
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,680
The Reverend Stang,

342
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,680
Bunker!

343
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,820
You promised we'd have something to show for our,

344
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,180
for our membership fee.

345
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,140
The bunker will fall silent like a tomb.

346
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,720
The collected gas will cause the barometric pressure to plummet.

347
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,060
The bobbing above will pause in divine reverence.

348
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,980
Stang will slowly turn to the trembling traitor,

349
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,280
glare into his frightened little face.

350
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,940
And with the thunder of Daniel Webster,

351
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,600
will proclaim the same answer I gave the Christian in the parking lot.

352
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,920
And that is this.

353
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,800
Even in hell,

354
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,940
we'll have the one thing the conspiracy tried to deny from us

355
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,840
all our living lives.

356
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,740
The one human life that we can't live without.

357
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:52,740


358
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:52,740


359
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:52,740


360
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,280
The one human right they'll never be able to take from us again,

361
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,900
no matter how much they lie about what we did or what they didn't do.

362
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,700
It's the one virtue Christians will never obtain,

363
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,100
no matter how much they beg, pray, or grovel to their God.

364
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,680
I'm talking about respect!

365
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,360
Self-respect!

366
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,000
The only commodity that can't be bought, traded, negotiated,

367
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,000
or stolen in any of the conspiracy marketplaces.

368
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,860
Appreciate it!

369
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,340
Hallelujah!

370
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,860
It's a concept foreign to all pinks and normals who serve the system.

371
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,620
They may have stolen our freedom, our slack, and even our lives,

372
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,220
but by virtue of our very defiance to them and their ways,

373
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,200
we've earned a self-respect they can't even pretend to want.

374
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,140
And you want to know why?

375
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,420
Why?

376
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,720
Because their religion is based on submission, while ours is based on self-respect.

377
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:52,720


378
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:52,720


379
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:52,720


380
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:52,720


381
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
Our religion is based on independence!

382
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,160
Praise God!

383
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,900
Praise God!

384
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,240
Give me a praise God!

385
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,860
Praise God!

386
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,660
Praise God!

387
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,600
So that, dear friends, is our answer.

388
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,740
That's what we get even if we're wrong, come Judgment Day.

389
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:19,240
The honor and dignity of self-respect earned through a lifelong fight for independence and freedom.

390
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Only the devil could possibly win.

391
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,260
Only the devil could possibly resent a man for wanting to be free.

392
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,280
Any God that wouldn't want his followers to be free is no savior,

393
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:37,080
but a tyrant, an enslaver of souls, a devil in disguise.

394
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,300
And that leads me to my question to the Christian.

395
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,780
It's terribly original, so brace yourself for it.

396
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,340
What if, what if you're wrong, come Judgment Day?

397
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,060
Please think carefully before you answer, dear friend.

398
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,380
Because remember, your very soul dangles in the balance.

399
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,360
And that is the word of our praise God!

400
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,060
Amen!

401
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,060
Praise God!

402
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,260
Praise God!

403
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,360
Praise Father Joe Mama!

404
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,200
Oh yes, dear friends, praise Father Joe Mama.

405
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:35,260
A beautiful, beautiful sermon there from the Pittsburgh revival a couple of weeks ago.

406
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,500
Yes, and what else do we have there?

407
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:44,160
Oh, Mojo Nixon's song, Mr. Correct, from his new album Whereabouts Unknown.

408
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:51,240
We heard Garrison Keillor's L.A. Riots from the Not For Broadcast album by him.

409
00:18:51,240 --> 00:19:01,280
And we heard a little bit of Bleepo Abernathy and Lonesome Cowboy Dave trying to introduce the church,

410
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,960
interspersed with distracting media barrage material from Reverend Nick Nolan and, of course, Bob Larson.

411
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:16,560
But you know what, friends, what Father Joe Mama was saying about that one side of the conspiracy?

412
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,080
It makes you wonder.

413
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,220
It makes you wonder which side of the conspiracy.

414
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,460
Which side of the conspiracy is running things?

415
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:30,240
I started getting paranoid about, well, the Masons, let's say.

416
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,240
Let's just say.

417
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,220
For all I know, I'm really worried about the Illuminati.

418
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:44,780
But, you know, it started with that America Online logo, which is a triangle with a circle in the middle of it.

419
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,460
It looks just like the old eye in the pyramid or the eye above the pyramid.

420
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,780
You know?

421
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,360
And I mentioned that to my friend Emot.

422
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,240
And Emot said, oh, that's just the beginning of it.

423
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,560
Haven't you noticed those triangles and the eyeball shapes are just everywhere?

424
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:08,900
And, in fact, they've even gotten quite obvious about the names of these businesses.

425
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:16,620
You guys ever notice the red arches that form a big M of the Sonic hamburgers?

426
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,220
Get it?

427
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,820
Sonic?

428
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,140
M-Sonic?

429
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,940
I think I'll have Masonic Burger now.

430
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:30,660
Or, he goes, did you know that Philip Morris cigarettes and General Foods were both owned by this gigantic conglomerate Kraft Foods?

431
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,840
Kraft?

432
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,500
The, as in, the Kraft?

433
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,760
Yes, friends.

434
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:46,640
And not to mention when they replaced that Popeyes place next door with Church's fried chicken.

435
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,380
Uh-huh.

436
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,500
Well, it doesn't stop there.

437
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,040
If you look around, next time you drive through town, friend, just keep your eyeballs open.

438
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,680
You may see things you didn't want to see.

439
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,480
Buildings one after another that look like, well, like the Temple of Solomon.

440
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:09,880
If it's not the arches, it's that Temple of Solomon shape that you see etched onto Masonic aprons and symbols.

441
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,560
Uh, my old supermarket nearby here, Menards, I believe he pointed out, looks just like that.

442
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
All of the Sam Walton stores.

443
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,880
Walmart, Sam's, Hypermart.

444
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,060
They're in the grand Masonic design, my friends.

445
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,360
Computer places.

446
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,880
Computer City, Discovery Zone.

447
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,160
The Best Buy stores.

448
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,980
All subtle Masonic symbols.

449
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,580
Then go buy your local water pumping station.

450
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,040
The Gas Company.

451
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:43,680
The Gas Company in most small towns is in the same building as a Masonic lodge, my friends.

452
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,540
The Gas Company.

453
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,380
The Electric Company.

454
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:55,920
They all, all of them, my friends, are part of one conspiracy or another, you know.

455
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:05,540
But what do they, you try to talk about things like this and they call you, well, the polite term, conspiracy researchers.

456
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,500
Or conspiracy buffs.

457
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,640
Or conspiracy nuts.

458
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,700
Or conspiracy kooks.

459
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,220
Or conspiracy crackpots, my friends.

460
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:28,060
Those are the real polite terms for the folks who attempt merely to lift the veils, peer under the rocks, and pry into the business of the authorities, so-called.

461
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:37,580
What I want to know is, friends, how come the conspiracy researchers get worse pressed than some of the conspiracy perpetrators?

462
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,080
It must be a conspiracy.

463
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,200
Uh, you know, I can tell you.

464
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,300
I don't wax as sarcastic as the next guy about some conspiracy theories.

465
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,200
I like to think I'm skeptical to the bone.

466
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:59,040
But I actually do believe a large percentage of those conspiracy theories.

467
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:10,840
Worse still, I believe in the conspiracy, yes, the plot, by ordinary, normal, everyday people to label conspiracy researchers as loonies.

468
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,460
Or as part of a conspiracy.

469
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:23,060
Now, contrary to unpopular opinion, friends, it's still possible to use mass media to expose mass media conspiracies.

470
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,300
But you have to couch your expose carefully.

471
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,060
You have to make it look like a satire.

472
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,260
Or a comic book.

473
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,700
Or a radio show.

474
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,080
Like this one, which is pieced together from the dead parts of history books.

475
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,060
And of course, some conspiracy theories are just that.

476
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,920
They're just theories.

477
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:40,900
Improbable.

478
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,720
Paranoid.

479
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,600
Predicated on few facts.

480
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,940
Like the one about the Masons creating the Greys.

481
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,660
They've obviously got it backwards.

482
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,980
Others are founded on pure coincidence.

483
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,020
And these, I would consider kooky, wouldn't you?

484
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:01,340
And, you know, one man's a paranoid lunatic is the next man's dedicated researcher.

485
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,120
And, you know, the problem is the domino effect, though.

486
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,940
There's those who see conspiracies everywhere.

487
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,020
Literally everywhere.

488
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,980
The crazy old bircher lady who fears commies under her bed isn't just a stereotype.

489
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,460
Nor is the religious nut who sees Satanists everywhere.

490
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:30,760
Nor the UFO cultist who mistakes something that could be cured with Prozac for messages from the Space Brothers.

491
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,780
But, you know, there might be something to some of it.

492
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:43,000
And once you're fairly sure of one conspiracy theory, it starts a tie into the other.

493
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,420
And you start to listen to neighboring conspiracy theories.

494
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,600
And pretty soon you believe in quite a few conspiracy theories.

495
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,160
And you start to sound like one of those nuts.

496
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,480
Unless you're selective about who you tell it to.

497
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,360
And that's one of the things that inclines you towards the conspiracy view of history.

498
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,400
It's the way the more trusting people around you respond to the very idea.

499
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,020
But, you know, try discussing the CIA's more heinous misdeeds.

500
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,600
In polite society, people edge away.

501
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:23,140
They just can't allow themselves to believe that men whose portraits still hang in city halls and corporate headquarters

502
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:27,820
were in fact amoral monsters and eager collaborators with Nazis.

503
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:37,040
Because that would imply that that smiling, rosy-cheeked, glad-handing politician they just voted for might be involved in something worse.

504
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,940
Paranoia has a bad rep these days.

505
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:47,040
But as the ancient saw goes, it's not paranoia if they really are out to get you.

506
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,580
And they are!

507
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,060
People should be a lot more paranoid.

508
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,900
And a lot of so-called normal people are.

509
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,060
Oh, they're in fact as paranoid as you can get.

510
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,520
They're just paranoid about the wrong things.

511
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:05,940
Since the FBI has no proof for organized satanic ritual murder cults,

512
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,580
the many little Christian fundamentalist conspiracies have invented them.

513
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:16,220
The same guy who can't believe the army could ever do anything evil and anti-American

514
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,740
may be convinced that the devil sends heavy metal bands out to corrupt our youth.

515
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,440
He's paranoid about marijuana fiends, but he drives drunk.

516
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:34,840
He's paranoid about sex and violence on TV, but thinks everybody should have their own automatic weapon.

517
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,900
He's learned that the media is controlled by liberals,

518
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,440
because he listens to right-wing blather all day long on the radio.

519
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,260
Shut up, little man!

520
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,780
Nobody asked you to say anything.

521
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,420
Shut up, little man!

522
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,440
Shut up, little man!

523
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,580
What's the burr under your saddle?

524
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,060
The burr under the saddle is you trying to shut us up and tell us where to hell...

525
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,620
Jesus says, believe in me or to hell with you, and I don't like that.

526
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,880
I'm getting tired of you guys trying to shut us up.

527
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,700
I'm getting tired of you guys trying to shut us up.

528
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,360
I'm not telling you where to go and what to do.

529
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,500
God's telling you what to do or where you're going to go if you don't do it.

530
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,500
But you know what?

531
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,040
What?

532
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,080
That's not a choice. That's coercion.

533
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,320
How do I know I'm not talking to a disembodied alien right now?

534
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,160
Well, if you don't have a clue that you're talking to a human being, then you're pretty stupid.

535
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,180
How do I know? Prove it to me. You can't prove it to me, can you, Bill?

536
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,700
See, ha, ha, ha. You can't prove it to me, Bill. You can't prove it to me.

537
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:34,980
Bill, Bill.

538
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,860
Empirically, you cannot prove it to me beyond any reason.

539
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,100
Any doubt.

540
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,260
Anybody that you've ever talked to, Bob, how do you know you've talked to anybody?

541
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,580
You're just living in a fantasy world behind a microphone.

542
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,340
Prove you've talked to anybody, including me, Bill.

543
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,280
Because there's repetition.

544
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,760
Because, because, my friend, I'm a human. I have a human voice.

545
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,460
That's how you know. Odds are you're talking to a Bill.

546
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,420
Get real.

547
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,040
Just because you have a voice doesn't mean you have a brain.

548
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,200
Correct.

549
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,080
I would be more of what I would call a, uh,

550
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,740
pubophilic Satan.

551
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,820
I would be more of a Satanist, um, as opposed to a pedophile,

552
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,460
because, because everything that he says makes 100% sense,

553
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,680
and there is, uh, little or nothing that he says that you can argue with.

554
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,120
I am a, I am a, I am a, I am proud to say I'm a jelly-bill do-do.

555
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,960
Yes, me, I'm Melina.

556
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,840
Yes, me, I'm Melina.

557
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,740
Yes, me, I'm Melina.

558
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,160
I am a jelly-bill do-do.

559
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,740
Hey, Bob!

560
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,300
I'm

561
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:39,560
Do

562
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,040
I must have a girl to call my own.

563
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,380
For I am Dobby, son of Goom.

564
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:23,380
You pitiful, dobbings-legged earth fools milling about in your cage of only three dimensions.

565
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,020
Dobby, go find me a nymph.

566
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,660
You don't know what we love.

567
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,980
Maynard, bring me a woman.

568
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,180
Bring me a bongo, bongo baby.

569
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,360
Give me a fury.

570
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,740
A hundred of little furies.

571
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,820
I want more.

572
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,040
Bring me harpies with chests of steel.

573
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,140
Bring me the furies themselves.

574
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,540
I want Medusa.

575
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,720
Yes, I will make love to Medusa.

576
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,640
Let her turn me to stone.

577
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:02,120
I could be no stonier of heart than I am already.

578
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,100
If only the fools would leave me.

579
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,120
And I'd be at peace to complete my experiments.

580
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,980
They want to know who I am and what I am.

581
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,480
Well, I'll show them all!

582
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,240
Ha ha ha ha ha!

583
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,920
Ha ha ha ha ha.

584
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:27,840
It's here in this dark cave on the Aegean Sea, where lights have been seen for scores and scores of years.

585
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:35,180
Fishermen have noticed light in this cave for a period of five weeks at a time during the summer solstice season,

586
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,340
and after that, they do not know anything about it.

587
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,320
These crop circles, or frock circles as they're called,

588
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:50,340
originally appeared in wheat fields in England and Ireland, Scotland.

589
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:57,420
Lately, they've been appearing as concrete circles in the center of New York City in Chicago,

590
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:06,000
decorated with the bodies of mutilated cats, mysteriously mutilated cats.

591
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,040
What could this mean?

592
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,220
There are no secrets in the Church of the Subgenius,

593
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:17,300
and I will not be endangering myself or my family in any way,

594
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,100
despite rumors to the contrary,

595
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:24,820
because you, dear listener, will probably not believe a word of it.

596
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:31,900
It's all just more quaint fiction to you, just a lark, a joke.

597
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

598
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,300
Eh, well.

599
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:41,020
Well, if the frock circles and the smoke from Bob's pipe are just a joke,

600
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,300
then what is your life?

601
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,540
Your very life, my friend.

602
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,760
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

603
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,820
Where to begin? Where to begin?

604
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:58,120
There are so many impossible stories and bizarre events associated with the Church

605
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,020
that it is hard to choose where to start.

606
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,840
Oh, man, this is so like, dude, it's like the Lucians in the, like, Hollow Earth,

607
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,880
they sleep with the Nazis.

608
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,040
It's such a weird mess.

609
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,720
I mean, these people from the Nefertiti.

610
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,960
To set the tone, let me tell you what I've seen with my own eyes

611
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,540
while visiting Palmer Vredes,

612
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,560
actually the artist Hal Robbins,

613
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,080
a.k.a. Dr. Hal,

614
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,680
in his San Francisco apartment in 1993.

615
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,000
Hmm.

616
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,900
Well, I'm a good member.

617
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,780
Well, what the hell?

618
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,820
Oh, my gosh.

619
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,220
Lies and Vredes began an appearance,

620
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,300
a fairly innocent brag fight,

621
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,960
each proclaiming their abilities in the most outrageous terms.

622
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,420
But after a quarter hour without significant gain,

623
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,480
Vredes became agitated

624
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,680
and suddenly swept lamp and telephone from an end table.

625
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:56,240
He then seemingly lifted the table into the air without touching it.

626
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,420
It shot out the window and crashed onto the sidewalk two floors below

627
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,820
where it burst into flame.

628
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,280
Vredes changed the subject.

629
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,320
The subject immediately in the event was never spoken of again.

630
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,360
Having set the tone with that story,

631
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,160
I can pretty much say anything I want to

632
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,680
and be assured that no listener will believe a word of it.

633
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,420
On the same visit, I took a trip into the desert

634
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,680
with D. Woodman Atwell of puzzling evidence,

635
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,300
a harrowing experience all around,

636
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,260
for I saw him apparently drive his truck through a concrete...

637
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,660
...a concrete wall without damage of any kind to anything.

638
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,400
I was then shown a series of missile silos

639
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,800
from which shone beams of bluish green light

640
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,240
for a period of about two hours around midnight.

641
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,400
This is February of 1992.

642
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,520
There were a number of unusual gravitational and magnetic events

643
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,280
in the area around this time.

644
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,760
There were also a number of what I took to be very large sandstone rock formations,

645
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,260
which appeared to change...

646
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,140
...to change positions when I wasn't watching.

647
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,800
Think about it, though, friends.

648
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,660
I mean, really.

649
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,120
Reality, and even its distant relative history,

650
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:26,600
are actually a hell of a lot weirder than any science fiction.

651
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,480
It's something as far-fetched as Nazis getting paid by the CIA

652
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,180
to train Middle Eastern fanatics to fight the commies can be real.

653
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,500
And it is.

654
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,320
Then why not the CIA and aliens conspiracy, huh?

655
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:53,080
I mean, if the CIA conducted mass experiments on the citizenry with LSD,

656
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,040
and it did,

657
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,240
then why wouldn't it use some covered Christian organization

658
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,020
to turn earnest young weirdos into Manchurian candidates,

659
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,480
and make them kill anti-establishment rock stars, or even presidents,

660
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:13,780
just to make all earnest young weirdos look more insane than the CIA?

661
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,220
It's infuriating.

662
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,780
You know, you can't just uncover a conspiracy and leave it at that.

663
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,820
You always have to take into account the deliberate disinformation possibilities.

664
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,880
For instance, maybe the feds pay Bob Lazar

665
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,780
to talk about crashed saucers on air bases,

666
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,620
and soul-stealing gray aliens,

667
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,820
in order to distract researchers from something far worse!

668
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,240
The murkiness level can become literally maddening!

669
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,360
And that just might be the whole idea.

670
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,980
No doubt about it, you can go overboard, friends.

671
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,660
Way overboard.

672
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,740
There's those who believe the Holocaust was a hoax,

673
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,960
and all the rest of us are crackpots.

674
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,100
You know, heck, if you're gonna go that far,

675
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,640
you might as well believe that World War II didn't happen,

676
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:20,040
and the next logical step is to believe that nothing the press ever reported really happened.

677
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,940
And pretty soon, praise Bob,

678
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,020
you've got mountains of proof that you're always right,

679
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,080
and everybody else is always wrong!

680
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,420
And of course, naturally,

681
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,000
the conspiracies that people tend to believe in

682
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,900
are the ones that make them look good,

683
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,400
and, uh, absolve them of responsibility.

684
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,500
Over a hundred years ago,

685
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,360
some anonymous anti-Semitic Frenchman penned a hoax

686
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,480
called the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

687
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,280
And to this day, thanks to that hoax,

688
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:57,860
thousands of frustrated, nasty old rednecks believe that the Jews control the world.

689
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,760
Now, believing that lets them off the hook.

690
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,540
The reason for their poverty and misery

691
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,360
isn't that they're a bunch of lazy, ignorant, alcoholic po-buckers.

692
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,940
It's the Jews' fault!

693
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,380
By the same token,

694
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,660
bitter black people who think that all white people must be out to get them

695
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,820
can find plenty of reinforcement in the nation of Islam, called.

696
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,820
Inevitably, friends,

697
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,020
those who are the most paranoid about a particular conspiracy

698
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,480
become a conspiracy.

699
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,720
They're a bunch of crazy, stupid, and stupid people.

700
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:28,720


701
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,380
So where is the balance?

702
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,740
Which conspiracy theories should you believe?

703
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,780
For that matter,

704
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,240
which conspiracy should you join?

705
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,100
Well, friends, we're here to tell you about the Church of the Subgenius.

706
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,740
You know, we started a lot of those conspiracies ourselves.

707
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,080
You can always come to Bob

708
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,920
to, uh, to, uh,

709
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,920
to find a conspiracy made just for you.

710
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,300
You can write to Bob.

711
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,260
I'm gonna give you that free information, uh, post office box.

712
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,280
Just say,

713
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,880
Bob, send me that free information.

714
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:09,380
And Bob is at post office box 140306.

715
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:16,180
That's box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

716
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,880
That's right, Dallas, Texas.

717
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,700
That's where we're at.

718
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,580
I remember a time when I thought all that babble

719
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,900
about multiple gun laws,

720
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,800
and the women in Dealey Plaza,

721
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,520
and the Oswald Doubles, and so forth,

722
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,000
was silly.

723
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,500
And it is getting awfully crowded up there on the grassy knoll.

724
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,080
But you know, as I got more educated about the JFK, uh, puzzle,

725
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,820
I learned a terrible truth.

726
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,700
If you investigate deeply enough,

727
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,560
sometimes you become part of the conspiracy.

728
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,880
I'm now a participant in the JFK cover-up.

729
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:57,800
I know why the Kennedy family had to go along with the Warren Commission.

730
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,520
But if I told, it would jeopardize lives.

731
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,420
Stop laughing.

732
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,760
I'll tell you, man, you start out paranoid about them,

733
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,880
and the next thing you know, you're one of them.

734
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,080
And maybe it's an infinite regression.

735
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,940
Maybe there's no escape.

736
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:21,380
Maybe, maybe there's no one single truth

737
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,880
that everybody should know.

738
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,400
And maybe there's no one single thing that everybody should believe in.

739
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,480
Not even Bob.

740
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,580
Maybe everything is a conspiracy.

741
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,440
You know, who knows, maybe one of these days we'll find out

742
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,720
even that's not so funny after all.

743
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,120
Good thing this is just a comedy show.

744
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,940
Heh heh heh heh heh.

745
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,900
This is nothing compared to the bizarre political and extra-legal connections

746
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,660
of the Church of the Subgenius.

747
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,740
Ivan Stang is known to have made trips to England and South America

748
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,260
in the past few years to meet with, among others,

749
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,220
high-ranking members of the P2 Masonic group

750
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:02,560
and an organization of which the Priory of Zion and Bilderberger Group

751
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,100
are sanitized fictionalizations.

752
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,200
Stang and Drummond are known to be 33rd-degree masons,

753
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,720
and Stang's position in a control group hinted at as a Texas mafia

754
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,580
is hereditary through his father, an ex-district attorney for Dallas.

755
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,720
Stang has employed a man named Stang, and he's been working for him for years.

756
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,400
He's been working for him since he was a child,

757
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:26,400


758
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,580
Stang, however, is his real name, although he now uses the Smith name

759
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,600
in his daily affairs.

760
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,740
I have met Smith and can assure you they are two very different people

761
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,440
of entirely different capabilities.

762
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,320
Smith seems to be a victim of arrested development,

763
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,440
and though he is the nicest guy you'd ever want to meet,

764
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,000
Stang is perfectly correct in calling him

765
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
dumb as Dave.

766
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,700
I have never met him.

767
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,360
I haven't met Drummond, but the stories I've heard,

768
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,400
uh,

769
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,620
are as strange as anything yet.

770
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:00,840
Relate.

771
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,760
Now, I've seen the real Doug.

772
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,720
I've seen the real Doug, and he is just as smooth as buttermilk pie.

773
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,920
He would never do a harmful thing to another human being.

774
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,380
This other man, now you can see there's a big difference.

775
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,820
Look at his chin right there.

776
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,260
There's a big scar on his chin,

777
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,860
and I don't see how they can get away with that.

778
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,680
I've told all my kids so far that this is it.

779
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,180
I'm just giving up on everything the government ever said ever again.

780
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,360
I just don't believe it.

781
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,580
Did you see what they had on the head the other night?

782
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,760
They had a man who could actually make a man,

783
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,680
make a man, make a man, make a man, make a man.

784
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,080
You know what I mean?

785
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,040
Oh,

786
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,880
you rag.

787
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,380
Let's say pour about eight identical glasses of tap water.

788
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,680
Send your loving energy selectively into one of the glasses,

789
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,660
and then you'll see that one of them basically blessed the water.

790
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,520
Leave the room.

791
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,400
They'll switch the glasses on you,

792
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,500
and then go up to the water's glasses with little dowsing rods,

793
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,540
and you'll find that the one that had been blessed

794
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,120
is the one with the largest energy field.

795
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,920
Not only that, but it's also the one that tastes the best.

796
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,740
It's the story of the lost jewelry of Atlantis.

797
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,760
Not that again.

798
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,020
Well, there it is in all its effulgent splendor.

799
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,600
Because we have with us Philo's brother.

800
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,100
Oh, yes, that's right.

801
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,040
His only nomenclature.

802
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,000
That's true.

803
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,060
But you know, I suppose there are areas,

804
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,040
there are places where Philo is his brother.

805
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,020
That's true, but it's never brought up quite that way.

806
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,040
So even on his business card, it says Philo's brother.

807
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,140
Yeah, well.

808
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,100
And he is known forever as...

809
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,240
I don't know what the future is in that.

810
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,040
My mom sometimes refers to Philo as my brother, though.

811
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,760
Your brother, I just can't believe what he did this time.

812
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,620
I just have to get to the bottom of it once and for all.

813
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,580
Whether a person is a brother,

814
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,140
a preference for poop dog hats runs in the family.

815
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,020
Actually, it's not.

816
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,040
She doesn't ever say Sphinx's brother, though.

817
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,980
It's your brother.

818
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,020
My brother?

819
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,400
Yeah, your brother.

820
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,360
See, that doesn't make any sense,

821
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,460
because she doesn't even know my brother.

822
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,260
My brother, the Sphinx?

823
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,680
Or doesn't know Hal's brother.

824
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,800
So if you know our brothers, you can call us.

825
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,400
And if you know we are brothers...

826
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,540
Brother, go find your brother.

827
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,660
And all out there, within the reach of my voice,

828
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,760
are truly my brothers.

829
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,660
Uh, uh...

830
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,640
4-4-12-5.

831
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,580
Related to me by...

832
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,340
intimate ties of...

833
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,440
Jerry Jeff Collins, join us.

834
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:22,700
Indeed.

835
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,640
My goodness, what a...

836
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,120
similar good memory you have.

837
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,240
Now let's go over that again.

838
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,040
You say you saw some sort of monster?

839
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,420
Mm, yeah.

840
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,200
It's my pet parakeet, Pete.

841
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,700
And what happened to him?

842
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,040
Oh, well, he's been, uh...

843
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,400
Whoa, there goes some...

844
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:39,960
Uh-oh.

845
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,100
That's what happened to pet parakeet Pete.

846
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,380
He was hurled out of a speeding taxi

847
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,660
in the middle of a busy downtown intersection.

848
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,200
Then dragged in a phone booth

849
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,620
while trying to make a phone call.

850
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,700
But you know, you know,

851
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,500
Philo's brother's here.

852
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,140
Been forced to...

853
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,120
Oh, yeah, that's right.

854
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,660
I said that. I said that.

855
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,440
This is not just a show.

856
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,940
I mean, Philo's brother's here, so...

857
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,680
If you have a question for Philo's brother,

858
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,120
that's what...

859
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,280
That's right now what you want to...

860
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:02,700
That's right.

861
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,400
The topic tonight is Philo's brother.

862
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:04,700
Philo's brother.

863
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,720
Do you have a question for...

864
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:05,720


865
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,080
Uh, journeys to Arizona...

866
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:07,980
Or, uh...

867
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,040
Who's this Philo guy?

868
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,040
...comment about Philo's brother?

869
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:10,620
Oh, my brother.

870
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,720
No, that's not your line.

871
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,120
That's the other guy's line.

872
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,740
We're talking about Philo's brother.

873
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,240
And then down here, the scratched out part,

874
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,740
it says, yeah, don't be scared.

875
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,100
I'm scared.

876
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,780
What's going on?

877
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,260
Your flesh will creep.

878
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,100
Your heart will bump, uh, et cetera, and so forth.

879
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,260
Uh-oh.

880
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,460
Punch the...

881
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,420
Punch the wrong brain.

882
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,840
Punch the magic dragon.

883
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,480
Okay, don't be scared and hang up.

884
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,420
Just speak now.

885
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,200
Don't walk.

886
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:33,680
Don't walk.

887
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,220
Green light.

888
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:34,500
Speak.

889
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,400
Go through the door.

890
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,420
And speaking of dragons, I could tell you about...

891
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:37,920
Let me answer the phone.

892
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,860
...the very next, uh...

893
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,020
And if you're watching Channel 2,

894
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,120
you see that we've synced up

895
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,240
every single sound effect.

896
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,280
Caller...

897
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,120
Hello?

898
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:44,620
Hold in.

899
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:44,760
Hello?

900
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,120
It's a slim lead, I know,

901
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,260
but it might get us some...

902
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:47,460
Hello?

903
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:47,560


904
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,420
Just one.

905
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:49,960
Just you.

906
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,020
Turn that caller to the cold and damp.

907
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:52,560
There he goes.

908
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,860
Oh, Hal just turned him around.

909
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,140
Now he's all cold and damp.

910
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,480
Well, it gets him evenly done on all sides.

911
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,280
So, uh, state short question, please.

912
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,560
The phone's busy, so...

913
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:00,820
Yeah.

914
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,800
So go ahead and call.

915
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,500
You see, there's so many different approaches

916
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,620
to this question of bind over matter

917
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,980
or transcendental reality,

918
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,900
is when I breathe in,

919
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,720
I visualize the energy of the universe

920
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,460
which is very abundant, by the way.

921
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,820
This is the same kind of energy, I think,

922
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,200
as the Tesla technology energy is.

923
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,400
It's similar to the energy of consciousness

924
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,640
or mind over matter.

925
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,540
It's a very powerful energy.

926
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,600
So you imagine this energy coming into your belly button

927
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,720
as you breathe in.

928
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,100
As you breathe out,

929
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,520
you breathe that energy through,

930
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,500
uh, in this case,

931
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,840
through the tips of my fingers,

932
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,680
laser-like into the spoon,

933
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,000
and I become at one with the spoon.

934
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,760
Oh, yes, friends.

935
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,940
You, too, can become at one with the spoon

936
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,180
if you're ready to give your all to Bob,

937
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,400
or at least a 32-cent stamp.

938
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,880
Come on, go for it, man.

939
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,080
Write for the free information.

940
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,880
Uh, here's that number again.

941
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,520
It's got, uh, music by Arnold Mathis

942
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,280
in the background.

943
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,420
Okay, here it comes.

944
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,480
Just write to Bob, my friends,

945
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,780
at Post Office Box...

946
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:13,720
181-825-7000.

947
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,740
1-417 Cleveland Heights,

948
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,640
Ohio 44118.

949
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,260
www.subgenius.com.

950
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,540
And, uh, as I said,

951
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,400
this is Arnold Mathis in the background.

952
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,660
Before that, uh, before this,

953
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,440
we heard a little bit of, uh,

954
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,500
puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell

955
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,420
on the KPFA Berkeley, uh, subgenius

956
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,780
or non-sub, anti-subgenius show,

957
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,580
whatever it is.

958
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,040
And, uh, coming up more,

959
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,860
and having been more of, uh,

960
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,600
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

961
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,160
That's ESO Radio brought to us

962
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,520
from WCSB in Cleveland.

963
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,940
Praise WCSB.

964
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,700
And, uh, oh, and praise, uh,

965
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,220
Reverend Mike Cole

966
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,840
for, uh, interviewing that Satanist,

967
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,920
Joe Autrich, which we've heard

968
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,480
little bits of, uh, in between.

969
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,960
We're just, uh, scavenging WCSB

970
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,720
like crazy.

971
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,980
And, uh, thanks to Steve Bevilacqua,

972
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,920
who, uh, rescued that on tape

973
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,720
and put horrible music with it.

974
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,440
Oh, what's, uh,

975
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,920
uh, who else should I credit?

976
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:22,820
Oh, Nenslow.

977
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,580
Some of the, uh, uh, disinformation

978
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,680
about the Church of the Subgenius,

979
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,520
which I was reading there on,

980
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,720
uh, with Lonesome Cowboy Dave

981
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,500
and, uh, Chaz on that ESO show.

982
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,860
That was written by Nenslow.

983
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,620
I should definitely give Nenslow credit

984
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,740
for that, those particular lies

985
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:42,040
about the Church of the Subgenius.

986
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,000
I thought they were very effective lies,

987
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,600
myself, one way or another.

988
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:50,580
And, uh, so, we'll plunge back in.

989
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,360
Thank y'all.

990
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,920
Well, well, I just don't know.

991
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,360
I just don't know.

992
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,380
I wandered into this,

993
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,800
I wandered into this little,

994
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,680
uh, spook house, restaurant,

995
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,100
or whatever it was.

996
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,080
And they were, they were all

997
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,840
having some kind of a party.

998
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,840
And then they set fire to the walls

999
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,460
and just kept partying away

1000
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,740
while the place burned down around them.

1001
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,740
It was like a vision of hell itself.

1002
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,020
I really, really, really, really,

1003
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:42,020


1004
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:42,020


1005
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:42,440
really bad.

1006
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,760
But people just kept paying money,

1007
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,680
walking in,

1008
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,840
swigging drinks at the bar,

1009
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,400
their clothes on fire,

1010
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,240
instead of just laughing it up

1011
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,000
as if they didn't feel any of it.

1012
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:56,960
It was kind of a,

1013
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,780
a cult, like, and they,

1014
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,200
and in the end,

1015
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,440
they were all dead.

1016
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,860
I stood outside,

1017
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,180
watched the place burn to the ground.

1018
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,300
It was like they,

1019
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,320
you know, they, they all acted like

1020
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,000
this was something they did every year.

1021
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:12,240
Every night.

1022
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,300
You got me.

1023
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,540
Don't ask me.

1024
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,000
I don't know nothing about it.

1025
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,900
I'd just as soon stay here working at the,

1026
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,160
at the quick shop

1027
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:32,000
for a buck, two eighty an hour.

1028
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,640
I ain't gonna send my money to that preacher.

1029
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,360
That's just what he wants me to do.

1030
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,940
I'm supposed to believe

1031
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,360
in some kind of deliverance

1032
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:47,480
by alien space fellers.

1033
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,240
And if I believe on Bob,

1034
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,300
then I'm gonna get to ride them escape flying saucers.

1035
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,120
And I just, I don't buy into that.

1036
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,460
Well, some of my friends,

1037
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,960
now some of my friends are believers.

1038
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:05,000
Some of my friends are believers.

1039
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,180
I'm not trying to put them down.

1040
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,860
But I ain't gonna give away all my worldly goods.

1041
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,680
I've already been through.

1042
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,660
I had religion once.

1043
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,540
I was in the Jehovah's Witnesses.

1044
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,020
Had me give my Cadillac away.

1045
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,080
The world was supposed to end on April 23rd.

1046
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,260
We all sat around the hilltop waiting for

1047
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,080
the end of the world.

1048
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,840
After a while, we got bored waiting,

1049
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:31,680
wandered off.

1050
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,580
So I ain't gonna fall for none of that stuff this,

1051
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,540
this time.

1052
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,700
But you know what I heard that was really sad?

1053
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,400
I saw on this newspaper,

1054
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,080
it said the Loch Ness Monster was dead.

1055
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,220
I seen it right on the cover of that newspaper.

1056
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,300
It was so sad.

1057
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:54,420
It looked like a giant prairie squid

1058
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,660
or a big oyster with flippers on it

1059
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,220
and a cute little otter's head.

1060
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,500
And she was,

1061
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,640
did you know it said in there

1062
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,800
she was over a thousand years old

1063
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,300
and left a little tiny baby

1064
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,120
Loch Ness Monster homeless.

1065
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,620
Friends,

1066
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,260
you don't want to let that little baby

1067
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:17,160
Loch Ness Monster go hungry, do you?

1068
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:21,180
No, for in her belly are thousands of spider eggs.

1069
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,460
Well, here in the church of the subgenius,

1070
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,700
we offer special food and toys

1071
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,480
and modeling clay and clothing

1072
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,680
to those slackless children.

1073
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,180
You know,

1074
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,960
Even cosmetics and toiletries.

1075
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,740
Those kids that you see the pictures of

1076
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,780
on milk cartons,

1077
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,300
they're not lost, friends.

1078
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,360
They've just found Bob.

1079
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:47,200
They are frolicking with the baby Loch Ness Monster

1080
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,320
now in a special swimming pool

1081
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,920
at the home for slackless children in Malaysia.

1082
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,880
Oh, there is no secret, Neptune Agenda.

1083
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,180
Loch Ness is, Nessie's dead.

1084
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,800
It was all a big hoax.

1085
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,220
Well, we'd prefer not to go into too much detail

1086
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,460
at this time about the origins,

1087
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,840
since our own research is not quite clear.

1088
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:15,200
But the church of the subgenius does seem

1089
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,120
to have a direct connection with the program

1090
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,860
known among conspiracy nuts as the Neptune Agenda.

1091
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,560
And in fact,

1092
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,080
The Neptune Agenda?

1093
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,340
Yes, the Neptune Agenda,

1094
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,840
which we can trace the beginnings

1095
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:32,300
back to the discovery of sonar in 1915.

1096
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,240
It's a watery, fishy theory of philosophy and conspiracy.

1097
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,680
But it seems that after the first use of sonar

1098
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:40,840
to create the universe,

1099
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,620
to detect German U-boats in the North Atlantic,

1100
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,280
unusual and cryptic Morse code messages

1101
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,860
began to be received by listeners in many different areas.

1102
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,300
A separate code of a logarithmic nature

1103
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:56,980
was created to communicate with what turned out to be aquatic mammals.

1104
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,920
I probably shouldn't elaborate further here

1105
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,500
because some of the things I've picked up about this

1106
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:08,120
seem very new-agey, stupid,

1107
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,240
having to do with ley lines

1108
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,340
and a global network of crystal skulls

1109
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,120
used as mind control transmitters

1110
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,020
to direct the actions of technologically advanced,

1111
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,960
or left-brained, humans.

1112
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,220
I can hear the teller currents.

1113
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,280
This is the way I navigate.

1114
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,260
I move my body close to the earth.

1115
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:30,560
The teller currents,

1116
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,760
it will tell the insides of my ears.

1117
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:33,960
Sonar.

1118
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,920
You can hear the whales.

1119
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,360
The briny deep.

1120
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,360
Moan out their love songs.

1121
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,160
Lonesome cowboy Dave up there on the prairie

1122
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,960
could hear them whales all the way out in the ocean.

1123
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:55,160
And he knew he wasn't going to be lonesome for long.

1124
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,120
He'd heard from old Bob

1125
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:05,360
what fun a giant sea-cation, sea-going mammal could be.

1126
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,920
Oh yeah.

1127
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,760
They're not that different from human beings, really,

1128
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,600
the way their bodies are set up.

1129
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,420
They're warm-blooded.

1130
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,420
Warm-blooded.

1131
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:13,760
Mmm.

1132
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:18,240
When you're in the freezing, frigid Atlantic Ocean,

1133
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,760
and you got you a kind of

1134
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:25,360
romantically inclined she-whale,

1135
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:32,220
and you're a particular lonely cowboy preacher with a guitar,

1136
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,900
you smell that ambergris floating on the ocean.

1137
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,060
You smell that ambergris floating on the seashore, there.

1138
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,700
Oh yeah.

1139
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,000
Ooh!

1140
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:40,540
Oh yeah.

1141
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:46,860
You'll drop your sheep and your horses and just shuck your chaps and...

1142
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,260
Liquid vinyl in lonesome.

1143
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,540
Go swimming right out there.

1144
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,880
Oh yeah.

1145
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,440
Lonesome cowboy Dave riding them dolphins all the way out to meet his queen.

1146
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:01,060
The great blue whale in the center of the North Atlantic.

1147
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,580
Yes.

1148
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:10,160
Yes, Dave Tristan, just as had his mentor, Bob.

1149
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:16,940
But unfortunately, whereas Bob was man enough to handle a female blue whale,

1150
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:25,300
Dave got tangled in the harpoon ropes and was last seen with his wooden leg a-flopping

1151
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,960
as she sounded one last time.

1152
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,580
I'm the Blue Devs with Davey Jones Logger.

1153
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,680
We've got 1,000-10 stories of Neptune.

1154
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:46,240
Yep, Dave's back down there underground, underwater, underneath the great web.

1155
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,700
I can't breathe.

1156
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,760
I feel like I'm suffocating.

1157
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,900
This is not as fun as it was before.

1158
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,340
I'm just going to relax this spandex.

1159
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,240
Shh.

1160
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,080
Shh.

1161
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,440
He was deep, deep inside the blowhole of the she-whale.

1162
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:10,440
He thought he was going to be having some kind of a big, hot date that night,

1163
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,760
and here he was, stuck halfway in the blowhole, halfway out.

1164
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:19,220
She couldn't spout, and that's about all he could do.

1165
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,840
Oh, baby, Leviathan be thy name.

1166
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,980
I got a wooden leg.

1167
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:29,360
He was, but they later got over there,

1168
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,600
and they got their marital differences,

1169
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,080
and they took up residence inside Mrs. Monstro.

1170
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,040
I'll take it out of the garbage.

1171
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,280
I will take it out of the garbage.

1172
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,540
I'm going to take it out of the garbage.

1173
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,240
I'm going to take it out of the garbage.

1174
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,540
All he had to do was occasionally empty the garbage out of Mrs. Monstro.

1175
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:58,140
He'd scrape up the old license plates and tin cans,

1176
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:02,740
and used syringes and so forth that washed into her stomach

1177
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,440
that managed to get through the baleens.

1178
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,760
He'd have to empty that stuff out now and then.

1179
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:14,140
He was like a parasitic life form inhabiting the body of the she-whale.

1180
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,180
Little maggots here, little maggots there,

1181
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,200
little harpoon-looking here, little, oh, it's so shiny.

1182
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,960
Their only natural enemy was Eskimos,

1183
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,660
and Norwegians who had broken,

1184
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:36,000
and Japanese whaling boats who had broken the international laws against such things.

1185
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:40,660
Dave was Dave of the Whales.

1186
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:45,960
I'll learn this baby's song, and then I'll record it and make a million dollars.

1187
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,440
And Dave thought he was going to be a big rock and roll star

1188
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,640
with the Cetacean Whale Song Rock.

1189
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,620
See, now, these songs last about a year and a half,

1190
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,320
and it takes about two years to compose them.

1191
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,260
I figure if I just shrink it down in a databank,

1192
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,260
and I'll take a whale all the way down to, like I say,

1193
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:04,820
three vibrations for every 25 seconds or something,

1194
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,280
I could have a perfect three-minute pop rock song.

1195
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,120
A whale, a whale of a whale, a whale of a whale.

1196
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:16,340
But unfortunately, the new age composer, Yanni, beat him to it

1197
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:18,620
and made all the big money.

1198
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,520
Dave and his wife, the female blue whale, Mrs. Monstro,

1199
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,600
were left in the gutter.

1200
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:29,060
They were singing bad country-western songs

1201
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:34,920
hoping for spare change from the citizenry and tourists

1202
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,340
who would walk down the boardwalk there.

1203
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:45,940
Bleak ending for a man who never learned to live his life

1204
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,380
and let it be that way.

1205
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,760
Lost enough to wait like that.

1206
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,360
A man like that has something wrong with him.

1207
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,060
Well, no, actually, like I said,

1208
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,700
the whale is not like it's a different order of animals.

1209
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,620
They're mammals.

1210
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,700
They're not that different from a person.

1211
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,600
They have a vestigial sort of hind leg

1212
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,840
and rather a longer tail than people do.

1213
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,800
But, you know, they breathe air.

1214
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,440
They cry tears.

1215
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:21,160
They weep tears just like you or I.

1216
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,900
Well, like you, anyway.

1217
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:29,200
And they don't seem to be able to take very good care of their fingernails.

1218
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,080
Why is that?

1219
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,040
This fungal growth seems to have traveled all the way

1220
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,100
to the base of the spine.

1221
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:42,140
And this basal area here is completely covered with the fungus.

1222
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:47,160
Lone cow, Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

1223
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,640
Pills, pills, pills, bob, bob, feel me, bob, feel me, bob, those knuckles, bob.

1224
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:52,880
I can't believe it.

1225
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:53,820
Bop, bop, bop, bop.

1226
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:55,660
Brop, brop, zippy, brop.
