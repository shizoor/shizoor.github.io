00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,300
Beautiful.

In the Peter Lewis...

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,740
Oh, hey, say, uh, this is Mark Osler of Negative Plan,

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,200
and you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,020
I don't need to say it, you just said it.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,940
Did you get all of it?

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,340
Well, there we go, that's it.

8
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,840
Did you get all of it? Did you get all of it?

9
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,180
That would be a good version to use.

10
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,320
Yeah, I guess so.

11
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,080
It really would. It really would be a good version.

12
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,820
3, 2, 1, 0, 4.

13
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,220

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,160
Come on!

31
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,940
3, 2, 1, 0.

32
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,540
Rubber hose, rocker hose, digital sonometer.

00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,700
Come on!

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,080

And a bumper sticker that says...

43
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,280
No other possibility!

44
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:49,180
You're listening to a free audio sample from the top 10 proofs that Bob is the only true religion.

45
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,520
After listening to this sample, we hope you'll consider purchasing this CD to hear the rest of the evidence showing Bob is the only true religion.

46
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,380
Thank you.

47
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,800
And enjoy your free sample.

48
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,380
The subgenius.

49
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,140
Power of the free.

50
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,200
Okay, hi.

51
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,440
So, my name is Bob.

52
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
And, um, um, uh, I do Bob.

53
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,400
I actually don't have a son.

54
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,980
Uh, which is, um, yeah, um, um, us, us, us, us, um, and it says, gorgeous.

55
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,060
You're a genius.

56
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,100
I was like, I am Bob.

57
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,380
I am Bob, do you see?

58
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,020
Bob, do you see?

59
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,720
Um, uh, um, I didn't have any.

60
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:26,920
What?

61
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,660
That's true.

62
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,260
It's a very true statement.

63
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:29,860
I love Bob.

64
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,180
Um, and then, uh, oh, and, um, uh, move PR.

65
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,940
Uh, oh, by the way, I'm not Bob anymore.

66
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,120
Um, uh, um, um, um, um, hello.

67
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:54,420
And, um, uh, um, um, and I was like, oh, I was like, oh, um, um, um, um, um, um, yeah.

68
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,220
Bye.

69
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,180
Bye.

70
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,320
Bye.

71
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:56,620
Bye.

72
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,040
Bye.

73
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,160
Bye.

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,360
Bye.

75
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,140
Bye.

76
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,500
Bye.

77
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,120
Bye.

78
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,140
Sadly this has led to art and sport and politics

79
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,600
Being led by people illiquid to dreams

80
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,760
There was a group who could have saved us from this ignominy

81
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,680
There was a group and they were roundly ignored

82
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,760
They saw the future and they pointed out the problems

83
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,380
If the people took the point we'd now be reaping the rewards

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,380
Devo was right about everything

85
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,620
Devo were telling the truth

86
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,740
Devo was right about everything

87
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,040
Devo was sure to slap you

88
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,840
If you have ever raged against conformity

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,160
Or hate the way our leaders treat us with sport

90
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,520
You see society regress before your very eyes

91
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,500
Devo was on your side before you were born

92
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,500
Devo was right about everything

93
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,040
Devo, I proved the world wrong

94
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,980
Devo was right about everything

95
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,840
Come and sing with us everyone

96
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,400
Devo was right about everything

97
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,460
Devo, we'll call it correct

98
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,760
Devo was right about everything

99
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,860
And the such deserves a lifespan

100
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,460
How many people here tonight believe in de-evolution?

101
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,900
It's real

102
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,740
And we just came to remind you

103
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,520
Are we not a myth?

104
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,440
Are we not a myth?

105
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,320
We are the Devo

106
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,940
Are we not a myth?

107
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,720
We are the Devo

108
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,700
Devo was right about everything

109
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,600
Devo was right about everything

110
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,100
Devo was never in the wrong

111
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,060
Devo was right about everything

112
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,440
Devo was looking for his song

113
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,440
Because it's us they were right about everything

114
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,840
And if that's true then we're really all doomed

115
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,060
So in 30 seconds turn this music up

116
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,160
And go on into what Devo would do

117
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,160
Devo, Devo, Devo

118
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,820
Devo, Devo, Devo

119
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,760
Devo, Devo, Devo

120
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,240
Devo, Devo, Devo

121
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,340
Devo was right about everything

122
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,620
I know, you don't have to look very far for the evidence

123
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,500
Well, around 1979 I was finishing up

124
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,140
The very first Devo song

125
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,400
The very first Church of the Subgenius pamphlet

126
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,640
And these friends of mine kept telling me

127
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,680
Hey, we saw this band on Saturday Night Live

128
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,620
And you better check them out

129
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,860
Because it's a lot like the stuff you're doing

130
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,040
And I went, yeah, sure

131
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,680
Then I saw them and went, good lord

132
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,800
This is a lot like the stuff we're doing

133
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,240
And on top of that their first album came out

134
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,800
With that picture of Chi-Chi Rodriguez

135
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,520
Which people continually still think

136
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,140
Is somehow Bob's

137
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,480
And Bob was copied off of that

138
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,040
But they were quite independent

139
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,060
So I think when their second album came out

140
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,100
They had a fan club address

141
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,360
And I sent them the first Subgenius pamphlet

142
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,520
And was shocked to get a response

143
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,540
Mark Mothersbaugh wrote me back a little postcard

144
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,000
That made it clear that he had really studied

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,200
Our little pamphlet and was intrigued

146
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,660
So I sent him a couple of underground films

147
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,140
That I had made for him

148
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,140


149
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,160
And I sent him a couple of underground films

150
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,060
That I had done as a teenager

151
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,280
That had stop motion and claymation type stuff

152
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,200
Including G.I. Joe's and Barbie's raping each other

153
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,620
And they saw that and went

154
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,520
We're about to do a scene for Love Without Anger

155
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,840
With the G.I. Joe and Barbie

156
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,200
You know, a Ken and Barbie fight

157
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,800
And can you do it by next weekend for a thousand bucks?

158
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,000
And I said, yes!

159
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,380
And I did

160
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,140
It was a hell of a deal getting it done

161
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,120
But that's what I did

162
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,120


163
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,120


164
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,120


165
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,120


166
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,120


167
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,800
That was my first job for them was that

168
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,760
And at some point the Subgenius business

169
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,200
Took us to Los Angeles

170
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,340
And I ended up hanging out with Mark

171
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,560
And staying at his house

172
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,540
And got to know just how funny

173
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,320
The guys in the band are

174
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,620
I've actually always thought that

175
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,340
In a way they missed their calling

176
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,520
I mean, they're great weirdo rock stars

177
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,900
But they're also great comedians

178
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,820
Those guys are really, really funny

179
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,240
And I always used to think

180
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,300
Well, they should have taken over Merv Griffin's show

181
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,840
applause

182
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,140
music

183
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,160
music

184
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,800
music

185
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,120

188

197
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,960
music music

198
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,540
music

199
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,600
She's out of sync

200
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,360
And everyone around her

201
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,460
Knows that something is wrong

202
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,540
She's out of sync

203
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,160
She's got all the symptoms

204
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,140
Of a girl who's simply

205
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,400
She's out of sync

206
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,040
A piece of ancient history

207
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,160
She's a walking barrage

208
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,240
She's out of sync

209
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,860
She has to do the exits

210
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,800
And never stop to think

211
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,040
She's out of sync

212
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,340
She's a half step behind

213
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,820
She's out of love, the money's split from her mind

214
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,860
She's out of orbit, she'll never connect

215
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,080
She'll run out of time, before she accepts

216
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,260
She's out of sleep

217
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,680
She's out of sleep

218
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,540
She's out of sleep

219
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,440
She's out of sleep

220
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,200
And everybody senses, there's a distance to keep

221
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,300
She's out of sleep

222
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,140
And totally committed, to living in a dark age

223
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,180
She's out of sleep

224
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,960
And constantly undoing, what's already been done

225
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,040
She's out of sleep

226
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,640
Trapped in a silent movie, and she's on the brink

227
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,240
She's out of focus, she's a warped in mind

228
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,340
She's discontinued

229
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,320
A break in the mind

230
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,580
She's out of orbit, she'll never connect

231
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,780
She'll run out of time, before she accepts

232
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,980
She's out of sleep

233
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,480
She's out of sleep

234
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,560
Sleep

235
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,340
She's out of sleep

236
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,420
Sleep

237
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,160
She's out of sleep

238
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,000
And everyone around her

239
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,040
Knows that something is wrong

240
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,080
She's out of sleep

241
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,820
She's got all the symptoms

242
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,020
Of a girl who skipped a beat

243
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,940
She's out of sleep

244
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,580
A piece of ancient history

245
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,760
She's a walking barrage

246
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
She's out of sleep

247
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,440
She entered through the exit

248
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,360
And never stopped to think

249
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,560
She's out of sleep

250
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,860
She's a hamster behind

251
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,320
She's out of luck, her body's split from her mind

252
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,320
She's out of focus, she's a warped in mind

253
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,320


254
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,780
She's discontinued, a break in the line

255
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,900
She's out of orbit, she'll never connect

256
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,300
She'll run out of time, before she excites

257
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,420
She's out of sleep, sleep

258
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,240
She's out of sleep, sleep

259
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,140
She's out of sleep, sleep

260
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,640
She's out of sleep

261
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,200
She's out of sleep, sleep

262
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,280
Now it can be told, we're all Devo.

263
00:11:53,460 --> 00:12:00,260
Well, not all. This hour of Slack number 1221 is all covers, but not all covers of Devo.

264
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,540
And a lot of it is from the Devotional of 2009 in Cleveland,

265
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,300
or the Not Necessarily Beautiful Book.

266
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,740
A mutated yearly collection of Devo covers, but not all of it.

267
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,200
For instance, we have Little Theodore covering Joni Mitchell,

268
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,480
and a doo-wop acapella soul band covering Negative Land.

269
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,140
In fact, that's what started the show.

270
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,900
The 180Gs covering Car Bomb,

271
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,060
followed by Lemur titles and, um,

272
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,720
Intro Collage by The Large.

273
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,160
The song Devo Was Right About Everything,

274
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,800
original song by The Attery Squash,

275
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,720
but remixed by Bob and Jerry Casale of Devo.

276
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,120
There are and will be clips from an interview with yours truly for a Devo documentary.

277
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,040
And finally, what we just heard was Spud Boys,

278
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,820
recorded live at the 2008 Devotional from the Not Necessarily Beautiful Collection, volume 2009.

279
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:03,420
And now, once again, the 180Gs covering Negative Land's theme from a Big Ten 8 place.

280
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,860
Thank you.

281
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,780
Alright, we got another one for you.

282
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,420
Here we go.

283
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,600
Tommy

284
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,040
Tommy

285
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,680
Tommy

286
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,060
Everybody welcome.

287
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,960
One, two, stupid

288
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,480
Three, four, dumb

289
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,760
Five, six, innocent

290
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,440
Yachty

291
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:38,940
Yachty

292
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,980
Seven, eight, sixty, six

293
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,580
Very stupid

294
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,340
Very stupid

295
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,880
Very rude

296
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,980
I like Concord

297
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,880
Big 180Gs

298
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,200
I like pleasant here

299
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,200
Know all the possibilities

300
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,760
Know all the possibilities

301
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,180
Stupid

302
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,900
Very stupid

303
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,380
Very stupid

304
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,680
No other possibilities

305
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,220
Stupid

306
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,900
Very large

307
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,160
Stupid

308
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,020
Very, very well

309
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,120
I like Orlando

310
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,540
I like Orlando

311
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,040
I like a l 있어요

312
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,040


313
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,900
This is four or nine

314
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,060
I like my genius

315
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,400
I like my genius

316
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,180
And all the green slides

317
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,760
And all the green slides

318
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,700
And all the green slides

319
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,860
I like Lafayette

320
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,640
I like Lafayette

321
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,280
The weather is fine

322
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,620
And I like country coast and county

323
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,760
Almost all the time

324
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,520

00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,280

Very stupid

333
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,620
This is it

334
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,060
We're gonna do it right now

335
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,100
Here we go

336
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,440
Alright people

337
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,840
First of all

338
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,740
I want you to raise your hand

339
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,000
If your automatic garage door opener is stuck

340
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,060
Stupid, very stupid

341
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,060


342
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,280
Stupid, very stupid

343
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,280


344
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,300
Very stupid, very stupid

345
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,300


346
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,880
I want you to stand on your left leg

347
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,280
If your oscillating sprinkler system doesn't work

348
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,320
Well, well

349
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,720
Very stupid, very stupid

350
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,260
Very stupid, very stupid

351
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,320
I want you to grab your right foot

352
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,200
With your left hand

353
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,760
If your load is full

354
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,440
Stupid, very stupid

355
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,500
I want you to shake your head

356
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,220
If you like your neighbors

357
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,780
New and misfit

358
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,540
I want you to put parakeet feathers into your television set

359
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,800
If you're watching MTV

360
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,460
MTV

361
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,160
Stupid, very stupid

Katie

363
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:29,660
Stupid, very stupid

364
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,420
I want you to do it so you can hear my words

365
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:31,420


366
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,280
I want you to trip over your gross cart.

367
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,320
If you're shopping, save money.

368
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:07,880
I want you to go back into your house and get all your furniture.

369
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,820
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, the 180Gs.

370
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,740
We've had a lovely time with you this evening, and we hope to see you all again very soon.

371
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,120
Keep it stupid, y'all.

372
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,760
A beautiful and fairy mutated from the 180Gs.

373
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:48,060
They have a CD out on Sealand Media Media, an entire CD of truly different versions of, like, one song each from every Negative Land album, called 180 OGs to the Future.

374
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:55,300
That is a bonus disc that comes with Negative Land's just amazing new DVD collection, Our Future.

375
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,620
Favorite things seen at NegativeLand.com.

376
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,980
180Gs are six guys from Detroit, and you'll be hearing a lot more of them on future hours of Slack.

377
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:14,420
Meanwhile, back to this year's NNBBM Devo tribute CD, of which there are only a couple of dozen copies left,

378
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:21,000
and this cover tune by our old friends Occupant of MySpace.com slash Occupant.

379
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,260
I heard a girl from L.A.

380
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,340
Say she'd go all the way.

381
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,540
I heard there's no reason why.

382
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,820
I heard that now's the time to buy.

383
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,280
On planet Earth.

384
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,300
I'm on the stay.

385
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,680
On planet Earth.

386
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,460
It's a place to live your life.

387
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,040
We're better for the pain.

388
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,520
People go insane.

389
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,340
Fly around in planes.

390
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,820
Pray that it won't rain.

391
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,360
Drive around in cars.

392
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,940
Get drunk and local bars.

393
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,580
Dream of being stars.

394
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,300
Well, I'm a star.

395
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:25,300


396
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,980
I live on the high on planet Earth.

397
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,680
I heard a girl from Ohio.

398
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Say I bought bread at a hole.

399
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,140
I saw her try to catch the man.

400
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,200
Things I couldn't understand.

401
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,540
I'm on planet Earth.

402
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,280
I'm on planet Earth.

403
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:08,500
Say she'd go all the way.

404
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,240
Say she'd go all the way.

405
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:13,860
нед

406
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,420
I saw a man on the stage

407
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,320
Scream!

408
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,560
Put me back in the cage

409
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,580
I saw him hate by his diet

410
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,800
I saw him up and make me cry

411
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,780
I'm bad at love

412
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,100
I'm bad at love

413
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,280
I'm bad at love

414
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,120
I'm bad at love

415
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,480
I live all my life

416
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:01,000
I live all my life

417
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,120
I live all my life

418
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,080
I live all my life

419
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,240
Devo, like the Monkees and a few other bands,

420
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,880
were created by Bob Dobbs as experiments in marketing.

421
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,560
Which is always kind of hellish for whoever the musicians are

422
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,180
when they're a manufactured product.

423
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,660
But Devo seemed to take the ball and run with it.

424
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,740
At least that's the lie we tell.

425
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,220
The lie they tell is that Bob Dobbs came to them and said,

426
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,100
you should quit Warner Brothers and sign with these other guys,

427
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,540
which turned out to be the absolute worst decision they ever made.

428
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,100
And then Mark said,

429
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,540
that Bob dragged all their furniture and all their equipment out into the driveway

430
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,100
and set it all on fire and did a big dance.

431
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,260
And that was their experience with Bob Dobbs.

432
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,240
But Bob didn't play with Devo for very long.

433
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,980
He got them into a lot of trouble with some of the groupies' families

434
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:20,020
because of unpleasantness that he would try to get these young girls and boys to do.

435
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:20,640
And...

436
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,100
And he wasn't.

437
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,100


438
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,100
He wasn't really a very good keyboard player either.

439
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,720
So they kind of eased him out.

440
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,160
Oh, yeah.

441
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,600
But the on-and-off was terrible.

442
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:57,600


443
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,320
You know, I mean, I never really actually played with...

444
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,280
An they played with Devo at the top,

445
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,280


446
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,940
Oh, yeah.

447
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,060
So I definitely played with both words.

448
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,160
You know, I came for the

449
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,380
Duke and I played with father place.

450
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,320
I played with both of them.

451
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,440
Devo at the bottom and Bob.

452
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,080
So I'm said,

453
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,080


454
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,080


455
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,080


456
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,140
Okay, relax!

457
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,460
I assume some is issued!

458
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,180
Going to Darby's submission?

459
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,340
Watch him at the time, let them know

460
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,440
All we do is my website

461
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,660
I'm the fucking father!

462
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,300
All we do is my website

463
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,060
Yeah!

464
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,280
Oh!

465
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,660
I am the calvary!

466
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,060
If what you said was tough

467
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,560
I am the 100th gal of the type

468
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,280
How long will I fight

469
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,340
By backing with this don't-know-who?

470
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,340


471
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,340


472
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,340


473
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,820
The party in the державу

474
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,380
Because our church is like home

475
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,940
We are like a family

476
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,220
We are all family

477
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,260
All related to the parliament

478
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:15,260


479
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,500
Oh!

480
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,660
Oh, partially

481
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,180
夯relaی does that

482
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,820
But y'all, c'mon

483
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,100
We ain't härliady!

484
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,720
Thank you.

485
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,080
Thank you.

486
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:31,360
Thank you.

487
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,380
Thank you.

488
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,580
Thank you.

489
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,640
Thank you.

490
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,600
Thank you.

491
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,860
Thank you.

492
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,540
Thank you.

493
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,220
Thank you.

494
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,720
Thank you.

495
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,200
Thank you.

496
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,300
Thank you.

497
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,120
Thank you.

498
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,100
Thank you.

499
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,620
Thank you.

500
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:57,620


501
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:57,620


502
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:03,960
I really don't know death.

503
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,680
I was going,

504
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,860
I really wanted to end this show

505
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,620
with this gospel bob song

506
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,620
that the Mutant Mountain Boys

507
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,700
sang at the DeVos

508
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,660
but my recording of it just isn't good enough.

509
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,000
It wouldn't do justice.

510
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,600
You can't understand the words, or at least I can't,

511
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,640
but I'm afraid the listeners could,

512
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,460
and for all I know, they say naughty, naughty things in it.

513
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,860
But talk goddish to that girl.

514
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,340
Those girls sing so beautifully,

515
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,400
and I will prove it next week by hook or by crook.

516
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,620
I'll play the new Bob song by the Mutant Mountain Boys.

517
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,720
In the meantime...

518
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,740
In the meantime, well, that was recorded last week,

519
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,460
and this is this week, and I still don't have a better version,

520
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,100
but the last half of my recording is 10 billion,

521
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,560
brilliant, godzillion times better than nothing,

522
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,720
so here it is, the last half of the new Bob song

523
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,080
by the Mutant Mountain Boys.

524
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,880
Now I know I

525
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,980
Ain't no youngin'

526
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,860
One day I'm gonna be old

527
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,620
I got a new job

528
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,720
I got a new job

529
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:25,360
I got that total, deep old feeling

530
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,520
Now I can't be told

531
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,300
But I got my high five

532
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,840
I got my high five

533
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,280
I got my high five

534
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:42,740
I got my high five

535
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:54,920
I got that whole thing

536
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:54,920


537
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:54,920


538
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:00,440
On the bottle

539
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:03,920
Institute

540
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:05,300


541
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:05,300


542

www.lindaMurray.com

543
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,740
Here's the final

544
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,720
The beginnin'

545
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,540
from the utopedia

546
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,320
In the sky, in the sky, one more time.

547
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:26,380
In the heavens, the unbroken, by, by, by, by, by.

548
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:37,880
In the mine of heaven where it came.

549
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:50,760
In the sky above, in the sky.

550
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,300
Yeah.

551
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,680
I cannot believe what I just heard.

552
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,000
The spirit, oh my God, the spirit.

553
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,640
The spirit of Devo, the spirit of Bob, the spirit of Slack.

554
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,840
The spirit of freedom and happiness, oh yes.

555
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,300
Hey, this is Mark Hosser from Negative Land.

556
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,160
Negative, no.

557
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,980
This is Mark Hosser from Negative Land.

558
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,580
And you're listening to the hour of Slack.

559
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,460
Negative Land.

560
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:26,900
Negative Land.

561
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,760
All I say, I wish I wasn't there.

562
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:41,740
In 82, you and I've been ostracized.

563
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:45,360
To talk, computers, networks, download times.

564
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,960
Today, the science that was vilified.

565
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,840
Is part of every cork it stays.

566
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,680
I have learned that there's a school of thought.

567
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,380
Future don't belong to me no more.

568
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,440
My time in the sun has been deferred.

569
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,800
All I say, I wish I wasn't there.

570
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,260
Clear your mind of what has gone before.

571
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,920
Being cool, don't cut it anymore.

572
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,780
A step ahead, you step out from the herd.

573
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,600
All I want, I wish I wasn't there.

574
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,300
You suddenly experience some heavy social change.

575
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,780
The misfits sneaked in through the vents and took hold of the reins.

576
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,980
Don't need excuse to be yourself.

577
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,420
A whole change has occurred.

578
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,900
A beer so chocked out, Carl's now his lot to be in there.

579
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,060
I spent my life becoming all the rage.

580
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,420
A party girl and everyone's cliche.

581
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,120
Now I find that substance is preferred.

582
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,000
In retrospect, I wish I was a nerd.

00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,160
I have learned that there's a school of thought.

587
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,840
The future don't belong to me no more.

588
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,880
My time in the sun has been deferred.

589
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,140
All I say, I wish I wasn't there.

590
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,800
How do you tell a nerd from a geek?

591
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,400
Maybe I should ask the intellectual elite.

592
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,220
Now that's the kind of thinking that will make me in this world.

593
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,280
Successful?

594
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,760
These days requires your nerd.

595
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,420
You have learned that there's a school of thought.

596
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:39,100
The future don't belong to you no more.

597
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,080
Your time in the sun has been deferred.

598
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,360
All you've made for your wish but you were nerd.

599
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,920
In your mind, a world known before.

600
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,540
Being cruel, don't try it anymore.

601
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,560
You step ahead, you step up on the road.

602
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,220
Suddenly, you wish that you were nerd.

603
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,780
I have learned that there's a school of thought.

604
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,540
The future don't belong to me no more.

605
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,500

Myspace.com. The Attery Squash.

611
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,020
Just oozing with slack and certainly on topic and I should know.

612
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,120
Anyway, back to the not necessarily beautiful but mutated 2009 collection

613
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:43,880
with a song by Reema, R-H-E-M-A, Myspace ReemaScan

614
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,200
doing the very early pre-Warner Brothers Devo song, Subaz Hardcore.

615
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,780
Ah, my fingers.

616
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:08,260
Top song at time to the second part of the show

617
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:17,040
That ends in B Bائy

618
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,020

Pretty Munkle

621
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,100
everybody

622
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,900
They want a toilet, same old story, she don't let no one near it

623
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,420
The way she teases them is such a shame

624
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,880
She's got all the humans crying her name

625
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,180
Surbows, surbows

626
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,280
She's got them howling, she's got them growling

627
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,200
Surbows, surbows

628
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,100
She's got them going clean out of their minds

629
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,300
Surbows, surbows

630
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,700
Surbows, surbows

631
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,380
There ain't a man in town who wouldn't have her for his daughter

632
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:12,020
They'd trade the brains for one taste of her toilet water

633
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,080
The way she teases them is such a shame

634
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,580
She's got all those humans crying her name

635
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,840

Surbows, surbows

639
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:46,400
One, two, three, four, tell the people what you wore

640
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,580
Surbows, surbows

641
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,900
They run in circles trying to call her up

642
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,380
But her phone's been disconnected since she sold her butt

643
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,380
The way she teases them is such a shame

644
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,940
She's got all those humans crying her name

645
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,940

Surbows, surbows

Surbows, surbows

653
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,900
Surbows

654
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,980
Lookin' at her snap strictly as a

655
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,660
Sprut reality

656
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,780
Lookin' at her strapğl

657
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,560
She's got good pictures !

658
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,360
Cherie, cut the crap off

659
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,300
Thespeaker !!

660
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,620
Jeder wünschte, er spiele für sie.

661
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,280
Aber die eine, die er dabei meinte,

662
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,680
Ja, diese eine, die hörte ihn nie.

663
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,060
Marie, Marie, wo magst du nur sein?

664
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,500
Lass deinen Will nicht allein.

665
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:13,460
Lass deinen Will nicht allein.

666
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,760
Dass er die Liebste für immer verlor.

667
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:23,340
Ein fremder Cowboy, der kam nach El Paso,

668
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:27,400
Sah nur Marie und schon war es geschehen.

669
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,040
Am andern Morgen, da war er verschwunden,

670
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,380
Und auch Marie hat man nie mehr gesehen.

671
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,940
Marie, Marie, wo magst du nur sein?

672
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,340
Lass deinen Will nicht allein.

673
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,340
Noch ist es Zeit für ein Glück in El Paso,

674
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,900
Morgen schon kann es zu spät dafür sein.

675
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,340
Oh Marie, oh Marie, komm doch wieder zurück nach El Paso,

676
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,520
So geht sein Lied in das Dunkel hinaus.

677
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,920
Aber der Nacht ist zu spät, der Nacht ist zu spät,

678
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:12,920


679
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:12,920


680
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:12,920


681
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,080
Der Nachtwind, der gibt ihm die Antwort.

682
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,940
Lass doch das Träumen, du weißt, es ist aus.

683
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,920
Bill spielt noch immer von Glück und von Treue,

684
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,360
Immer noch glaubt er an seine Marie.

685
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:35,120
Doch eines Tages, da schweigt die Gitarre,

686
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,960
Denn seine Träume erfüllen sich nie.

687
00:45:48,840 --> 00:46:11,540
Lass mon frèreitched saisonner de mosque

688
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,160
N'apprens relieved,

689
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,100
That meant 12 minutes by drive while open drive

690
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,700
The block is so cool it'll make my food for people pray

691
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:31,200
White bloods, go big messes, and gloomy is the plan

692
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,660
The evolution, the self execution, no solution

693
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,080
I'm a potato and I'm so hot

694
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,540
See that show up in the standing line of droning blood to pay for crime

695
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,640
Put your seal and guard your jewels so free hand

696
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,980
And don't you lose

697
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:13,140
Free white resistance in the mail

698
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,220
And parties going down the stairs

699
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,740
All the sunbeams, what's the cost of my downhills

700
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,740
But all is lost in the evolution

701
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,240
Self execution, no solution

702
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:32,400
I'm a lost and stoned man and I'm a potato

703
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,440
I'm so hot

704
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:51,640
Smooth as shit

705
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:59,620
The size of earth for someone to fiend

706
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,200
He's mine, gone to crime

707
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,220
Spotted in the

708
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:06,580
Look like a boss, trying to save the chaunну

709
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,280
They touch and roll to a second round

710
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,220
Rockets blast the cacade

711
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,960
It's all my loss, they spread the plague

712
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,500
The penny zero drops the crown

713
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,660
Go down, go down, go down

714
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:26,000
To the T-Mobile John

715
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,180
Someone secure John

716
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,340
Down's the ocean

717
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,680
I'm a spud gun

718
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,360
My gun's a good gun

719
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,560
I'm a good gun

720
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,320
Icebreaking...

721
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,260
Icebreaking...

722
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,900
Ice Turkey...

723
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,660
Icebreaking...

724
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,460
Icebreaking...

725
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,360
Icebreaking...

726
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,240
Icebreaking...

727
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,740
First beat.

728
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,560
First beat.

729
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,420
First beat.

730
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,380
First beat.

731
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:26,160

742
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:57,000
or see myspace.com NNBBMV8

743
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,120
with a peer-reviewed version of

744
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,080
after each letter except the V.

745
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,800
Truly a subgenius URL.

746
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:05,580
The church of the subgenius URL is subgenius.com

747
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:08,480
and you can also find these links and shows there.

748
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,740
You can find everything there.

749
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,100
Oh and the German language version of El Paso

750
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,420
was by Lolita from Lolita's Greatest German Hits

751
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,280
from my late mom's record collection.

752
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,300
Now back to the devotional.

753
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,400
Slack is what moves.

754
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,520
The church of the subgenius does guarantee

755
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:27,540
your death.

756
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:31,560
The great thing is we won't tell you what Slack is.

757
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,860
You have to figure out what your Slack is.

758
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,840
All we're doing is giving you a pep talk

759
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:43,140
and in my opinion that's what Devo has always done.

760
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,780
It has provided a pep talk

761
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:49,000
for the lonesome weirdos,

762
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,340
the mutants, misfits, disbelievers

763
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,680
and those who don't believe anything out there.

764
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,700
Hey RK, little girl down here in the front.

765
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,000
I'm going to tell you a story.

766
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,420
RK said he thought that being rich was the point

767
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,080
of the church of the subgenius.

768
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,000
Oh no, no, not at all.

769
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:12,380
Bob being more rich is the point of the church of the subgenius.

770
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:13,680
I just...

771
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,020
Slack is related to money.

772
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:23,260
And it might be easier to get Slack if you become rich.

773
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,320
Depending on what your idea of Slack is.

774
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,100
But I know a lot of people who are bored.

775
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,100


776
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:28,580
They are bored and rich.

777
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,280
They are the most Slack-less mothers on this globe.

778
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,800
Inheriting money is a curse.

779
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,080
And I say this from experience, not because I did,

780
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,840
but because by weird chance I went to one of those private schools

781
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,500
where most of the people I was in school with had inherited money.

782
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:51,060
And over the years I've watched them get more miserable

783
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,260
and more miserable because they couldn't connect

784
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:57,220
with what's really going on.

785
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,140
But with the rest of us who have to find some way

786
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,080
of passing for normal.

787
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,300
That's what rich people don't have to learn.

788
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,540
They never have to learn to pass.

789
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:20,160
Those of us who had to get a job had to learn to pass for normal.

790
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,060
Now, imagine being gay in the old days,

791
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,180
and in lots of places still,

792
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,820
and you had to pass as if you were straight.

793
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:34,460
And I spent a lot of time having to act like,

794
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,320
oh yeah, that last Cowboys game,

795
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,860
I didn't know what the hell the last Cowboys game was about.

796
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,220
I never paid any attention to that crap.

797
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,300
I'm a mutant.

798
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:46,140
I'm a misfit.

799
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:46,920
I'm a weirdo.

800
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,060
I puke on Christmas.

801
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:56,060
So, after a while I got to where I adopted the one rule

802
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,640
in the Church of the Subgenius,

803
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,280
which is, I do mom them if they can't take a joke.

804
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,760
And you can live by that rule.

805
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,940
You really can.

806
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,160
There came a day when some redneck in Texas said,

807
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,820
who helped out them Cowboys?

808
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,900
And I looked at him and something snapped.

809
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:19,060
And I said, man, I'm one of those queer faggots

810
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:21,680
that doesn't watch football, okay?

811
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,060
And boy, that made me feel great.

812
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,880
But anyway, friends,

813
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,640
the point is we all have to learn to pass one way or another.

814
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:38,160
The trick is to not become what you're pretending to be.

815
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:41,660
They can't read your mind.

816
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,560
You can pretend that you're interested in that job,

817
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,280
or you might even be.

818
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,080
There's nothing wrong with that.

819
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,820
I actually have a job that I enjoy.

820
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:56,060
But the important thing is to not confuse

821
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:59,780
what you're pretending to be with what you really are.

822
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,900
Hang on to your perversions,

823
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,580
your twisted sickness,

824
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:07,440
the thoughts that you don't feel like you should tell anybody.

825
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,900
You probably shouldn't.

826
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,600
But don't forget them.

827
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,260
Because that's what makes you you,

828
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,100
and that is where your slack comes from.

829
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,920
Ad adelante.

830
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:22,200
At one point, I realized that those guys, their mom was a music teacher.

831
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:23,980
It's like, that's cheating.

832
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,440
I thought they were geniuses or something.

833
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,960
No, they just had music hammered into them from the very beginning.

834
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,660
No wonder they tried to destroy music.

835
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,320
It all adds up now.

836
00:55:53,980 --> 00:56:23,480
It's like, they just had music hammered into them from the very beginning.

837
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:53,960
It's like, they just had music hammered into them from the very beginning.

838
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:22,700
It's like, they just had music hammered into them from the very beginning.

839
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:50,960
It's like, they just had music hammered into them from the very beginning.

840
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:54,860
Pprofessional

841
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,880
is THIS

842
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,880
are they just some leftoverszy?

843
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:04,540
were возможers stops trying to rule the world??

844
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:07,300
how much money would be that Çok

845
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,540
but I'm thinking about you

846
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:09,600
I had anybody

847
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,660
how you would I see you

848
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,400
I've never been

849
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,540
are you

850
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,660
how can I

851
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:16,080
f

852
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:16,800
up

853
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,100
im not gonna report

854
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,080
Turner

855
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:35,800
Okay, let's go.

856
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:36,300
Let's go.

857
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,080
Wilhelm Stahlhelm did that.

858
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,980
That's Wilhelm Stahlhelm at hotmail.com.

859
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:59,160
Before that, the excerpt of Be Stiff was the Weird Paul Rock Band

860
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,260
recorded at the Devotional.

861
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:06,300
The background music here is by Ron Slabe's Pyrosonics,

862
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:11,380
the album Pyrotopia, seen at MySpace slash Pyrosonic Music.

863
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,960
Praise Devo, praise Little Theodore, praise Negative Land,

864
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,780
and all the bands, and praise Bob.

865
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:21,880
