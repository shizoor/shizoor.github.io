1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:09,060
The program you are about to hear, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse, is parody, satire, and comedy.

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,820
Any reference to Bob, the Church of the Subgenius, religion, politics, or any other touchy subjects

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:25,200
is intended only as humor and should cast no reflection on the high standards of WREK Atlanta,

4
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,520
its staff, or that of Georgia Tech.

5
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,600
Star Date 2434.2.

6
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,160
First officer's log.

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,300
On a routine patrol flight in the Milky Way galaxy, I discovered on our space sensors

8
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,980
an unidentified planet greening white.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Wildly, in an eccentric solar orbit, I ordered an immediate investigation and with much difficulty

10
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,560
maneuvered our ship for a temporary orbit.

11
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,540
Upon beaming down to the planet's surface, all I could see were ruins.

12
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,280
Ruins of some type of civilization.

13
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,100
Crumbled buildings.

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,980
Deserted streets.

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
Charred vegetation.

16
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,560
All covered with a thick layer of dust.

17
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,980
Existing

18
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


19
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,560
I heard a sound.

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,640
It came from a cellar in one of the nearby buildings.

21
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,700
Carefully and slowly, I found my way to the source

22
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,320
and discovered a human being,

23
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,180
or rather what once was a human being,

24
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,360
a scarred, disfigured man lying in the rubble.

25
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,380
When I questioned him,

26
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,640
he told me that this had once been a great world.

27
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,220
They had abundance and plenty.

28
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,300
Abundance and plenty.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Intelligence, beauty, love.

30
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,080
There was enough for everyone who lived there.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,380
But the inhabitants were never satisfied.

32
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,260
They wanted more.

33
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,100
They wanted everything.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,380
They started to quarrel amongst themselves.

35
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,980
They could not live in peace,

36
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,420
and they tried to destroy each other.

37
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,280
In doing this, they destroyed everything.

38
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,940
Their abundance.

39
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,000
Their plenty.

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,740
Their own intelligence.

41
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,200
Their beauty.

42
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,260
Their love.

43
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,820
He told me that so far as he knew,

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,820
he was the only living thing left,

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,700
but that he knew he was dying.

46
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,020
When I asked him the name of the planet,

47
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,560
he replied,

48
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,620
we called it Earth.

49
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,040
Oh my God, you blew it up!

50
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,920
Dad, I'm so sorry.

51
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:26,920


52
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:26,920


53
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:26,920


54
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:26,920


55
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,060
Theyriebu Ta- held me with a sword...

56
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,260
Let's bury him here.

57
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,260
Then re-instructed current president.

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,860
Okay, so...

59
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,760
Are all there any people still sleeping?

60
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:47,660


61
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,240
Going to bed and awake,

62
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,120
you happy stuff.

63
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,220


64
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,120
It's a haven.

65
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,160
I can't believe it,

66
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:56,820


67
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,980
Hey, aren't you going to turn that damn clock radio off?

68
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,000
It's been flashing 7 a.m. for two freaking weeks now.

69
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,440
Oh, I have to do everything for you.

70
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,520
Here, let me put on some ambiance for you.

71
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,780
You like that, don't you?

72
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,640
Yeah, some nice soothing pablum to ease your troubled mind.

73
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,000
Poor flues, just let it soak into your shattered little brain.

74
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,540
Ah, soothing.

75
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,140
Ah.

76
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,580
Ah, wait a minute.

77
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,820
You evil witch.

78
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,860
That isn't funny at all.

79
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,120
Ah, ease up.

80
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,260
You were flat out kooking on that song a couple weeks ago.

81
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,760
So what's up?

82
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,800
It's with a long face, Puddin'.

83
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,340
Oh, like you don't know?

84
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,480
Ah, yeah.

85
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,280
I like to experience the pain I cause through your perspective.

86
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,600
Mmm, this is so sweet.

87
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,460
So, you went up to Ranch Apocalypse with hundreds of other drooling bobbies

88
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,540
looking to get off planet with them hair pie in the sky sex goddesses, huh?

89
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,260
And, ooh, you wound up getting royally reamed for your bright and shining face, didn't you?

90
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,240
Surprise!

91
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,100
Ooh, and what did you get for your trouble?

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,480
Cuts, bruises, blisters, sunstroke, and, ha, one hell of a chest cold.

93
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,280
Ooh, and on top of that, you really burned your bridges behind you when you flipped that

94
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,460
final end of the world bird at all your co-hosts and both of your listeners.

95
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,580
But, but you did that!

96
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,240
Did I?

97
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,340
Really?

98
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,680
Hey, who's to know?

99
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,740
Who can tell where I am?

100
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,840
Rats!

101
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,920
Yes, there!

102
00:05:59,920 --> 00:05:59,920


103
00:05:59,920 --> 00:05:59,920


104
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,300
The sagt, ooh, Spock would turn Armys Porco into sahafanas.

105
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,260
No, I know I was wrong, you stupid!

106
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:08,260


107
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:08,260


108
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:23,840
Well, spare my sl breaking, Îahu."

109
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,400


110
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,340
care. Yeah, you don't care

111
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,920
that that surf music maniac

112
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,240
Rex Reverb spent a whole hour

113
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,960
of church time playing Measerloo

114
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,440
over and over and over.

115
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,900
And tonight

116
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,740
he's planning to play 25

117
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,900
versions of Surfer Joe

118
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,540
the vocal.

119
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,680
No, no,

120
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,740
no, no.

121
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,000
No,

122
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,680
no, it doesn't

123
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,440
matter anymore.

124
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,660
There is no show.

125
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,380
There is no church.

126
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,740
There is no...

127
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,060
Bob?

128
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,280
There is no Bob, is there?

129
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,360
Yeah, you've been on a loser's

130
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,240
treadmill for years now and for

131
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,160
nothing. It's all over

132
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,400
flus. Little Ivan's house of

133
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,700
cards got blown down.

134
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,060
Hey, wake up and smell the mail

135
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,960
fraud. Yeah, the Federal

136
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,720
Trade Commission and the IRS

137
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,880
and the National Council of Churches are

138
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,580
closing in on that little weasel.

139
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,100
He's gonna be sharing

140
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,740
a cell with Glenn Turner.

141
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,080
Yep, looks like you've been

142
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,480
humping the wrong leg, Sugarplum.

143
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,060
All your subgenius

144
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,960
boyfriends are gonna be taking the fall

145
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,860
for this. Oh, a hard

146
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,820
rain's a-coming from this shakedown

147
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,940
and I for one ain't sticking around

148
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,920
to take it on the chin. Oh, jeez.

149
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,820
Why don't you just wrap those

150
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,020
poisonous lips of yours around another

151
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,600
cliche?

152
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,800
Hey, consider the source,

153
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,020
baby. Everything in me

154
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,900
comes from you. Oh,

155
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,560
great. But unlike you,

156
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm looking out for our future.

157
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,160
Look at it this way.

158
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,760
You could use this opportunity to change

159
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,860
directions. And your ministry

160
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,860
has been steadily declining ever since

161
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,360
you started this fiasco.

162
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,780
Mmm, but hey,

163
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,920
up isn't exactly an option

164
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,000
with you. Maybe you could just

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,800
go down at a steeper angle.

166
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,920
Oh, or

167
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,700
hey, you and that

168
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,640
co-host of yours could do, uh,

169
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,080
one of those drive-time things.

170
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,780
Like those, you know, those local radio

171
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,000
idiots. Stink and Sticky or

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,040
whatever their names are.

173
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,420
Yeah, think of the billboards.

174
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,720
You could take collars.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,880
Hey, you got a natural

176
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,280
flair for comedy.

177
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,400
Except for that.

178
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,120
Look, this miserable

179
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,960
little dog and prairie squid show

180
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,780
of yours could be made to turn a profit.

181
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,840
That insipid Bob stuff

182
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,980
has been keeping you out of the big-time flus.

183
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,840
You could be straddling a

184
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,620
success rocket to the moon.

185
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,200
Oh, but I like straddling

186
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
WREK Atlanta

187
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,040
just fine.

188
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,060
Oh, right. The Mindless

189
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,340
Loyalty Card.

190
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,660
You know, they keep you and the

191
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,820
big band show guy around just so

192
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,920
they can get senior citizens kicked back

193
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,100
from the federal government.

194
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,960
And what do you think they put you

195
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,740
on at this hour? You know

196
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,020
this town closes down at 10 o'clock.

197
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,000
And look at this equipment

198
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,560
here. It's all held together.

199
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,360
It's spitting scotch tape.

200
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,680
Oh, but they have hearts.

201
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,660
Oh, yeah. Well, I got a heart, too,

202
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,220
and it's bleeding for you. Got a tampon?

203
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,080
No, but I do

204
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,820
have a wooden stake, bitch.

205
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,820
Take that!

206
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,360
Ow!

207
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,200
Oh, damn you!

208
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,120
Well.

209
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,040
Well, it's one less Susie to worry

210
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,440
about.

211
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,200
Ow!

212
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,460
Ow!

213
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,960
It smells like summer's

214
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,180
Eve in here.

215
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,140
Bless.

216
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,120
I'm

217
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,020
sweetness and light, Susie.

218
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,080
And you freed me from my

219
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,140
earthly prison.

220
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,180
At last I'm

221
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,280
free to spread my message of love

222
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,060
and joy and peace throughout

223
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,820
the world.

224
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,800
Give me back that stake, sister.

225
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,380
Hey,

226
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,680
I'm pretty good

227
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:23,820
at this.

228
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, my left

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,840
boob.

230
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,460
Oh, why'd you have to go and do

231
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:30,880
that?

232
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,720
Jeez, Flues, you sure can't take

233
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,360
criticism.

234
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,060
Look, you bitch.

235
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,060
I only have one stake, and I hate

236
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,440
her more than I hate you.

237
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,680
So just shut your stinking trap and

238
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,640
crawl back in my cortex and just do your

239
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,760
friggin' job, okay?

240
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,240
Whatever you say.

241
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,620
I have a show to do.

242
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,900
I usually play it should I

243
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:12,900


244
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:12,900


245
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,640

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,220

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,220


252
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,220


253
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,040
Porsche

. . . . . tet

256
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,920
Sunkin' higher, but I can't get a grip on all the little things

257
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,680
When the night comes, I cannot sit still, you see

258
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,520
And the years, they have not been so kind to me

259
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,400
Got a gallery of figures standing all in a row

260
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,340
Every single figure has a soul of its own

261
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,280
Never look back, never look back

262
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,660
Gone to the back of me

263
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,560
Hey, yeah, my life has come a-ravelling in

264
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,720
Like so many threads

265
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,600
Hey, yeah, my life has begun a-ponying

266
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,580
In so many pieces

267
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,860
Hey, yeah, my life has come a-ravelling in

268
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,680
Like so many threads

269
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,240
And I went to do it today

270
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,840
Hey, yeah, hey, hey

271
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:17,580
Hey, yeah, hey, hey

272
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:17,620
Hey, yeah, hey, hey

273
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,980
Hey, yeah, hey, hey?

274
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,480
In so many ways

275
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:29,480


276
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:29,480


277
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,140
There's a time and a place for understanding

278
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,860
And there's a time when a witness

279
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,560
Is louder than words

280
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,460
And I don't seem to get no implications

281
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,320
And I don't know how to get指 stones

282
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,100
Through to you

283
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,280
And time left the pyramids is forever

284
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,740
away

285
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,160
The mountains and the valleys

286
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,720
and the woods that we say

287
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,680
We have got to make sure

288
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,500
that something remains

289
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,700
If we lose each other

290
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,360
we've got no one to blame

291
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,460
Never look back

292
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,460
Never look back

293
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,960
Come on, put your back on me

294
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,080
Hey, am I dying?

295
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:10,940
Is the world

296
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,820
where we begin?

297
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm so big and close

298
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,720
Hey, am I dying?

299
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,800
Is the world

300
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,680
where we begin?

301
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,420
Hey, am I dying?

302
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Has come our gravity

303
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,420
and let's set it

304
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,800
back to the way

305
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,540
we want to be

306
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,640
Hey

307
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,080
Hey, am I dying?

308
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,280
Has come our gravity

309
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,680
and let's set it back to the way

310
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:55,680


311
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,800
Hey, am I dying?

312
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,860
Is the world

313
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,360
where we begin?

314
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,500
We've got to make sure

315
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,680
that something remains

316
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,500
Hey, am I dying?

317
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,420
Is the world

318
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,800
where we begin?

319
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,960
Is it what we've been

320
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,580
told to do?

321
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,420
So let me say

322
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:12,880
Hey

323
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,760
Hey

324
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:14,760


325
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:14,780
Hey

326
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:14,980
Hey

327
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:14,980


328
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:14,980


329
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:14,980


330
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:14,980


331
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:14,980


332
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:14,980


333
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,200
Hey

334
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,420
Hey

335
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:27,420


336
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:27,420


337
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,620
You're coming back again

338
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,860
Hey

339
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,320
Hey

340
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,600
You're coming back again

341
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,460
You better give me

342
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:41,460


343
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:41,460


344
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:41,460


345
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:41,460


346
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:41,460


347
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:41,460


348
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,180
Hey

349
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,260
You're coming back again

350
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,260


351
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,980
another chance

352
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,760
Just one more time

353
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:44,760


354
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:44,780
Just one more time

355
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:27,980
When you're waking from a bad dream

356
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:35,560
Don't you sometimes, sometimes think it's real

357
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:43,080
But it's only all emotion

358
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,040
That you feel

359
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,100
As painful as it is to contemplate,

360
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,740
I guess we should really begin at the beginning.

361
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,420
July 5th, 1998.

362
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,120
Dawn, just like every other day in Dallas.

363
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,580
You can't do this, Bob.

364
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,040
Shut up around that night!

365
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,940
This community is going to learn

366
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,720
to obey the law.

367
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,120
Why should we obey laws that are twisted

368
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,580
to fit the needs of thieves and liars?

369
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,520
Take it easy, Bob.

370
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,420
Arrest him!

371
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,740
He's a deputy marshal.

372
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,980
Don't let that stop you, Sheriff.

373
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,720
I'm fed up with the law around here.

374
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,760
This court can accept my resignation right now.

375
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,660
Where am I to, Bob?

376
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,400
Come on, get going, boys.

377
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,860
Bob, come on.

378
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,000
Sorry about this.

379
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,780
I'll get in touch with you.

380
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,580
Thanks for trying, Todd.

381
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:34,780
Hey!

382
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,540
It's X Day right here.

383
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,640
A ship that will take you anywhere

384
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,720
you want to go in the universe.

385
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:42,920
That's the...

386
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,580
kind of flying saucer I mean.

387
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,180
No kidding.

388
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,780
Yes, no kidding.

389
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,700
And if it doesn't turn out to be true,

390
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,560
you can have your worm back.

391
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,580
Whoa.

392
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,440
I don't know about that.

393
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,580
Oh, all right.

394
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,880
Sounds all right to me, I suppose.

395
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,840
I didn't catch your name, mister.

396
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,500
Dogs.

397
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,980
Once again, Superman concentrates.

398
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,800
Like a laser, his mind beams

399
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,200
the exact course they must take

400
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,000
to the silver creatures

401
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,660
who wait,

402
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,980
shivering just a foot above

403
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,780
the Earth's surface.

404
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,240
The first thing he says is,

405
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,320
watch out for religious deception.

406
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,220
Sincerity is not enough.

407
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,100
The devil's sincere,

408
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:20,780
but he's not saved.

409
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,020
Adolf Hitler was sincere,

410
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,640
but he's in hell.

411
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,360
Sincerity is not enough.

412
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,320
You've got to be sincerely right.

413
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,240
You can be sincerely wrong.

414
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,900
Yes, that's right.

415
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,560
Everything you know is wrong.

416
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,820
Then, like a plague of locusts,

417
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,340
the alien creatures rise up,

418
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,320
up into the sky,

419
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,000
up until they become once again

420
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,800
a tiny, tiny dark cloud

421
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,240
above the highest mountaintop.

422
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,440
And then, finally,

423
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,780
can be seen no more.

424
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,420
As the screen fell,

425
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,700
Dorothy and her pals

426
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,160
saw a most unusual sight.

427
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,260
Behind the screen was a tiny,

428
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,560
little, old man

429
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
with a bald head and wrinkled face.

430
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,420
Who...who are you?

431
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,000
I, uh, I am the Wizard of Oz.

432
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,900
But I thought the Wizard of Oz

433
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,000
was a huge head or an invisible man.

434
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
No, no, no, I'm not really

435
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,180
the great Wizard of Oz.

436
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,100
I'm just a pony.

437
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,380
I'm a...I'm a humpug.

438
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,000
All that.

439
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,980
Well, Mr. Strang,

440
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,740
it was an almost foolproof plan.

441
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,380
I should have stayed with the promise keepers.

442
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,980
No redemption, no redemption,

443
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,460
no redemption, no redemption

444
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,060
from evil and sin.

445
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,200
No redemption, no redemption,

446
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,260
no redemption, no redemption.

447
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:11,960
No redemption, no redemption.

448
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,780
This is a long story.

449
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,060
You see,

450
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,500
I was born in Nebraska.

451
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,920
That may have been the way it happened, Mr. Strang,

452
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,480
but I suppose it wasn't.

453
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,060
Oh, I'm nuts.

454
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,200
Hello.

455
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,280
Hang on here.

456
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,620
Who's this?

457
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,520
My name is, uh, Bobby Dobbs.

458
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,420
You come in or take our jobs!

459
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,220
You're dead!

460
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,380
You owe it to your skin!

461
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:32,620
All right.

462
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,060
You owe it to your skin!

463
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,060


464
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,060


465
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,480
That's a second line!

466
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,380
You're dead!

467
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,260
I mean it!

468
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:35,760
Dead!

469
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,880
But you did call it,

470
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,220
a simply-dressed Mr. Strang.

471
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,400
The jury has already heard the testimony about the phone call.

472
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:41,940
And I told you, Mr. Strang, that's not the best thing you could do.

473
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:41,940


474
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,560
There's no use trying to pull the wool over my eyes.

475
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,120
The damage is done.

476
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,100
Don't apologize.

477
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,420
It's much too late now

478
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,540
to forgive you for your lies.

479
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,100
Oh, my heart and soul

480
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,560
now with such a bitter feel

481
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,000
to find you only wanted

482
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,400
the taste of a grand new thrill.

483
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,140
The damage is done.

484
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,580
I've been such a fool.

485
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,580
I never dreamed that

486
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,400
you could ever be so cruel.

487
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,280
Oh, you were playing with my love.

488
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,620
It was all a little game.

489
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,220
But you'd point my hopes

490
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,540
and dreams.

491
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,140
Now I'll never know

492
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,480
I'll never be the same.

493
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,220
The damage is done.

494
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,600
My lesson is learned.

495
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,680
This is the last time

496
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,620
that I ever will be burned

497
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,760
because the damage is done.

498
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,380
Damage is done.

499
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,560
And you've had your fun.

500
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,540
Now you're free to go.

501
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:39,960
You've had your fun.

502
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:39,960


503
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,420
Now the damage is done.

504
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,340
The wizard turned away.

505
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,760
And Dorothy whispered to the lion

506
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,680
how the people didn't want the wizard anymore.

507
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,380
Oh, we were fools to trust any man.

508
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,260
Have you been such a fool, such an idiot, such an idiot, such a dum-dum,

509
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,020
as to give away my pinky, the best stuff and maker in the neighborhood?

510
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,380
And most quieter than most worms as well for a saucer without a matching cup?

511
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,320
Take that!

512
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

513
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,520


514
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,520


515
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,520


516
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,520


517
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,520


518
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,520


519
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,520


520
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,520


521
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,520


522
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,520


523
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,520


524
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,520


525
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,520


526
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,520


527
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,240
No, no, no.

528
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

529
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

530
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,140


531
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,140


532
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,300
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

533
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:17,320
No!

534
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,100
No!

535
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,100


536
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,100


537
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,100


538
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,100


539
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,100


540
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,100


541
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,540
Now, Bob, I think I got a little problem.

542
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,100
Then me, I'd just stick it up and get it over with.

543
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,560
Oh, Brad?

544
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,680
Bob generally knows what he's doing.

545
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,580
He does everything for the...

546
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:33,660

555
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,220
another county where we could get a fair trial that's a good idea then but it

556
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:17,560

well I walk out of here like a fool

564
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,460
well I think maybe I should have gone with the slugger

565
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:00,460


566
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:00,460


567
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:07,440
why did I quit because after you've been taking aboard a UFO it's kind of hard to

568
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,520
top that all right they have alcoholics Anonymous they don't have alien

569
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,700
anonymous I lost my wife I lost an alien culture who wanted to take me to the

570
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,640
Planet Ark tourist and I don't know if I've gotten the resentment you know

571
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,180
forgiveness part down in the purpose I turned to a colt for mindless happiness

572
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,140
when I had beer all along.

573
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,660
You taking it?

574
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,400
No, I'm letting go.

575
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:30,900
I'm letting go.

576
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,400
Okay, let go.

577
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:31,880
Okay, fine.

578
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,180
Stop.

579
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,220
Dad, Bob broke your beer!

580
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,860
No, I didn't. Doug broke it.

581
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,440
It was you.

582
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,500
Clean up the mess, boys.

583
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,280
Ridiculous.

584
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,700
Perhaps, Mr. Stang.

585
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,100
In the middle of the room

586
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,240
was a big, green, marble throne.

587
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,560
Something on the throne?

588
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,940
Well, it wasn't exactly something,

589
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,360
because it was nothing but a big head.

590
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,100
No body.

591
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,080
Just a head.

592
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,120
As Dorothy stared,

593
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,040
wide-eyed,

594
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,960
the big, bald head said,

595
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,480
Dobbs, go get the dynamite.

596
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,840
Oh, sacred head, now.

597
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,740
Oh, my God!

598
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:13,180
God, I hope they're stoned.

599
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,240
Attention, attention, attention!

600
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,400
The bleeding head of Oral Palmer

601
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,180
has been destroyed!

602
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,640
Oh, my God!

603
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,220
It was not supposed to be like that.

604
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,940
A premature head-launching,

605
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,700
but nonetheless, a lead-launching.

606
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,760
And now, because of the

607
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,840
exactly what we know, men,

608
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,400
we're going to have Jader

609
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,540
launch the head!

610
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,680
If anybody has any flashlights,

611
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,140
we need some flashlights over here.

612
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,620
We need a superstar needs some lights.

613
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,120
Flashlights, flashlights.

614
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,020
I know you guys have them.

615
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,360
Where are they?

616
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,240
Break them out.

617
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,200
Break out the flashlights.

618
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:53,940
There's a little bitty one.

619
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,940
Here's some lights.

620
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,520
Let's launch the bleeding head of Tiger Woods!

621
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

622
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,280
state Jader Heger's lead.

623
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,020
Ladies and gentlemen, we have just seen

624
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,840
the destruction of the bleeding head of Oral Palmer.

625
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,160
I think this shows everyone

626
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,620
just how bad the conspiracy is.

627
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,960
We need to go and try to stop the X's landing,

628
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,820
because it's the Palmer head,

629
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,280
which is the perfect golfer who has the golf plan,

630
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,940
who's actually working with the Y's

631
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,320
to try to stop the X's.

632
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,040
The conspiracy is trying to connect with the Y's,

633
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,260
which is connecting with things that have 7-11s for heads,

634
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,640
which isn't exactly the same thing as a thing with a

635
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,820
U-totem for a head,

636
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,840
which is different actually from a thing with an 8-12 store for a head.

637
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,040
Who?

638
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,080
A witness who can prove you are lying, Mr. Stang.

639
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,300
Now there's our third witness.

640
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,480
I think I'll start by reading you one that isn't terribly serious,

641
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,740
but it explains what his views were when people asked.

642
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,920
My answer is, you know, he's a liar.

643
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,900
He really did not believe in a serious way in UFOs,

644
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,940
and this might be an indication of that.

645
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,400
UFOs is a bucket of .

646
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,140
What else?

647
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,960
Mr. Stang, that...

648
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,100
Is a bucket of .

649
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,220
Hey, come on!

650
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:08,880
Get in!

651
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,080
I just come up behind him with a knife and a sling,

652
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,200
broke real quick like that.

653
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,100
So I grabbed him by the collar and I jerked him out of the car,

654
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,760
said, buddy, I ain't never seen nobody like you are.

655
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,140
How come you pull these kind of jokes?

656
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,220
He said, well, sometimes it works, sometimes it don't.

657
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,780
Now, for what kind of deal is this?

658
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,340
It's a bad joke.

659
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,040
That's great.

660
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,660
Your words, your words don't mean

661
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,620
What they used to mean

662
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,420
They were once inspired

663
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,920
Now they're just, they're just routine

664
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,520
I'm afraid the masquerade

665
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,120
I'm afraid the masquerade

666
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,200
I'm afraid the masquerade

667
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,300
Is over

668
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,020
And so is love

669
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,620
And so is love

670
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,940
Bob, you've been through so darn much lately.

671
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,680
What do you think's gonna happen to you now?

672
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,660
I don't know.

673
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,140
Gotta nuke something.

674
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,260
Touché.

675
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,920
Have you thought about one of the other major religions?

676
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,760
They're all pretty much the same.

677
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,700
What if we pick the wrong religion?

678
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,640
Every week we're just making God madder and madder.

679
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,220
Testify!

680
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,200
You just gotta learn not to expect nothing out of life.

681
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:37,060
Were you fixin' to say a little something about how life don't seem too fair?

682
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,340
Don't even start

683
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,940
Don't even start

684
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,480
Were you lookin' to get a little disappointed?

685
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,680
Teardrop goin' there, don't make me laugh

686
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,260
Please don't touch my heart

687
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,840
Who said life was a rollercoaster?

688
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,060
Who said life was sweet surprise?

689
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,880
Who said life was a circus poster?

690
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,300
Not me, not me

691
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,140
So ask me no questions, give me no answers

692
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,020
And I'll tell you no lies

693
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,460
Were you gettin' yourself a little moody?

694
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,980
Cause some folks are downright mean

695
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,440
Oh me, oh my

696
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,340
Oh yeah

697
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,580
Ain't that a shame, shame?

698
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:27,380
Were you startin' to make a little speech about the troubles that you've seen?

699
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,100
Please spare me, that's

700
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,240
That's a pity game, oh yeah

701
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,960
Now who said life was a ball of berries?

702
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,460
Who said life was peach ice cream?

703
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,180
Who said life was a box of cherries?

704
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,560
Not me, not me

705
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,360
So ask me no questions, give me no answers

706
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
And I'll tell you no dreams

707
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,560
Who said life was a ball of berries?

708
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:51,560


709
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:51,560


710
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:58,120
Were you thinkin' that you were gonna maybe have to leave this lovely town again, again?

711
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,840
Hit one more spot

712
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,380
Were you feelin' a little like a baby who just got itself knocked down?

713
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,560
You say you were

714
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,160
I say, well, so what?

715
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,900
Who said life was a song for singin'?

716
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,100
Who said life was such a snap?

717
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,060
Who said life was a bell for ringin'?

718
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,240
Not me, not me

719
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,040
So ask me no questions, give me no answers

720
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,720
And I'll hand you no crap

721
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,100
Who said life was a song for singin'?

722
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,280
Who said life was such a snap?

723
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,160
Who said life was a bell for ringin'?

724
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,400
Not me, not me

725
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,260
So ask me no questions, give me no answers

726
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,940
And I'll hand you no crap

727
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,640
And I'll tell you no dreams

728
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,280
And I'll tell you no lies

729
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:50,780
Nooooooo!

730
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,120
Nooooooooooo!

731
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,160
If I couldn't, Bob, I'd be a low-down door count witness, innit?

732
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,740
You heard when Bob's coming home?

733
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,800
No

734
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,040
What are you lookin' at?

735
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,640
Ah, God, lose your skank!

736
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,780
If I were Bob, I'd show for you!

737
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,760
I'm unconscious!

738
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,680
It wasn't me!

739
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,680
Wait, you're making a mistake!

740
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,960
Put me down!

741
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,100
It's the villager!

742
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,120
It's a clerical error!

743
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,660
It's... it's staying tall!

744
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,720
The party's over

745
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,220
It's time to call it a day

746
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,280
They've burst your pretty balloon

747
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,480
And taken the moon away

748
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,480
It's time to wind up

749
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,500
The masquerade

750
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,900
Just make your mind up

751
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:14,280
The piper must be paid

752
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,460
The party's over

753
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,040
The party's over

754
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,500
The party's over

755
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,500
The candles flicker and dim

756
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,280
You danced and dreamed through the night

757
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,200
It seemed to be right

758
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,900
Just being with him

759
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,200
Now you must wake up

760
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,940
All dreams must end

761
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,140
Take off your makeup

762
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,280
The party's over

763
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,580
It's all over

764
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,160
My friend

765
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,600
Hey заглянув

766
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,320
Take off your makeup

767
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,480
The party's over

768
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,440
It's all over

769
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:46,440


770
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:46,440


771
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:46,440


772
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,480
It's all over

773
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,880
My friend

774
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,000
Well, I think

775
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,200
I'm gonna break down

776
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,120
And cry

777
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,380
I've been hurt

778
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,540
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt

779
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,960
Yes, I've been hurt

780
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,660
I've been hurt

781
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,680
Like I've never been hurt before

782
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,880
Cause you cheated

783
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,160
Cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated on me

784
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:51,580
Yes, you told me

785
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,340
Not a lie

786
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,180
And you lied

787
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:05,000
You lied to me

788
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,400
You lied to me

789
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,840
Oh, little girl

790
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,540
Oh, little girl

791
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,520
And I've been hurt

792
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,900
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt

793
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,080
Till I can't hold

794
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,760
Not you anymore

795
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,840
Look, lady, I really had nothing to do with this

796
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,300
My name

797
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,240
Do you know how

798
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,100
I feel

799
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,820
There must be some sort of mistake

800
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,260
And a thing

801
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,920
Oh, no, no, no, no

802
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,040
Oh, no, no, no, no

803
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,120
When you left

804
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,680
No

805
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,200
No, I don't

806
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,200


807
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,660
A little more a kid

808
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,820
Oh, great

809
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,020
Cause I've had

810
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,440
New

811
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,100
New

812
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,100
New

813
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:49,480
Needs

814
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:49,880
And you

815
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,800
Left

816
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,020
For good

817
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,920
To die before

818
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,760
And I've been hurt

819
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,280
Hurt

820
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,040
Till I can't

821
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,580
Hurt

822
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,000
Hurt

823
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,600
Anymore

824
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,560
Well, at least it sounds like there's a limit

825
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,260
I'm so happy

826
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,260


827
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,260


828
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,260


829
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,260


830
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,820
Well, at least it sounds like there's a limit

831
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,040
I'm so happy

832
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,560
I'm so happy

833
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:11,960
So happy

834
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,860
Well, I've been hurt

835
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,560
Oh great, where'd she come from?

836
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,920
To think that you, you lied to me

837
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,480
Hey, I'm in the same boat

838
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,800
I'm hurt

839
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:37,300
Way down deep inside of me

840
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,780
Try to look at it from my perspective

841
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,440
I mean

842
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,920
You said your love was true

843
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,440
And we'd never, never, ever part

844
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,900
Hey, look

845
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,540
Now you want someone new

846
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,080
And it breaks my heart

847
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,420
Whoa

848
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,100
Whoa

849
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,260
Whoa

850
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,120
I'm so hurt

851
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,580
Much more

852
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,100
Oh, than you'll ever know

853
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,840
Staying in all of his goons, they just, they keep me in the dark

854
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,920
Yes, darling

855
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,600
I

856
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,100
I'm so hurt

857
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,900
I feel as wronged as you

858
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,260
Because I still love you so

859
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,160
Oh

860
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,720
But

861
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,500
But

862
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,260
How many buts do you have?

863
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,360
Even though you hurt me

864
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,140
Like nobody else

865
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,100
Oh man, I am out of here

866
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,900
I ain't fueled no class action lawsuit for this

867
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,260
I would never

868
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,280
Ever

869
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,300
Oh

870
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,320
Oh

871
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,400
Oh

872
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:10,940
Oh

873
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,260
Oh

874
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:12,760
Oh

875
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


876
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


877
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


878
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


879
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


880
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


881
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


882
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


883
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


884
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


885
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


886
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


887
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


888
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


889
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


890
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


891
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


892
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


893
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:12,760


894
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,340
Oh

895
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:26,220
This year I may lead You to a different course

896
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:32,620
But suchizations owered you a fear

897
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:40,580
Of abandonment

898
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,560
ット

899
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:49,220
leaves nothing for frat for the rest of the whole damn summer. Oh, thanks a lot, Bob.

900
00:38:51,100 --> 00:39:00,480
Oh, why, Bob, why? What did I ever do to you? What's the idea of leaving me bereft upon that

901
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:09,660
misty hilltop in New York? Oh, how I tried. I was a dupe of the first water for you, Bob.

902
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:18,220
Oh, I believed, Bob. I believed in your message. I gladly lived a life without thanks, without

903
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:24,720
reward, seeking only that slackful relief which is paramount to my continued existence.

904
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:33,180
Oh, that's what hooked me from the first, Bob. The fact that you alone understood my pain,

905
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:39,560
the agony of living on this life-sapping planet, and you told me what I longed

906
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:45,780
to hear. That, yes, there was a place in the stars where the slack flowed like hot lava and

907
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:53,220
the sex codices were even hotter. Yes, yes, it didn't matter how much I suffered here because

908
00:39:53,220 --> 00:40:05,180
I would be rewarded there. So, oh, how I debased myself for you, Bob. I prostitutelized for you,

909
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,260
serving you on my knees night and day in the trenches of the

910
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:15,720
inconspiracy world, spreading the message of your divine withering grace among the slack-starved

911
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:24,640
masses. Oh, and then, come your prophecy next day, I awaited your coming in the fearsome light

912
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,940
of early dawn with hundreds of believers, arms spread, mouths wide open for the first barrage

913
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:38,680
of face-raping bats, and it didn't come. Desperately,

914
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:45,520
I looked to the skies for those gleaming iridescent escape vessels under the glory of sex codices within

915
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:54,640
them, but they didn't come. I was looking for that ultimate good time that you promised us, Bob, and

916
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:09,280
Bob, I didn't come. Oh, oh, what does this mean, Bob? Is your word false, even to your true

917
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:19,240
believers? Are our sacred pre-scriptures nothing but lies? What else is there you're lying about, Bob?

918
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:32,060
What about the sex? What about the salvation? Oh Bob, if you were wrong about X-Day, were you wrong about the

919
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:39,260
slack too, Bob? Oh no, no! I can't go on if it means living in a world where I don't know God, and I can't go on if I'm not living in a world that is Godly.

920
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:39,260


921
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:39,260


922
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:39,260


923
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:39,260


924
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:47,280
world without slack. Oh Bob, I can't take this pain. Why? Why?

925
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:26,680
Friends, they turn away. I keep moving on, but I never find out why. I keep pushing so hard

926
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,700
that maybe I keep trying to make it right to another lonely day.

927
00:42:50,240 --> 00:43:02,160
25 years, coming just one night. Oh yeah. Well, I'm 25 years old tonight, so I know

928
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:08,980
it can't be right. And I'm no better, babe, and I can't help you no more than I did

929
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,260
with you.

930
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,700
I'm just a girl.

931
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:20,800
But it don't make no difference, babe. No, no. And I know that I could always try.

932
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:29,280
It don't make no difference, babe. I better hold it now. I better need it, yeah.

933
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,840
I better use it till the day I die.

934
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,660
Why?

935
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:42,760
I don't know.

936
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:55,200
I don't expect any answers, dear. Oh, I know that they don't come with age. No, no.

937
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:03,300
I ain't never gonna love you any better, babe. And they're never gonna love you right.

938
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,080
So you better take it now, right now.

939
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,280
But I'm day-dipping.

940
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:16,180
I said, yeah, it don't make no difference, babe. And I know that I could always try.

941
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,580
There's a fire inside of every one of us.

942
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:24,580
You better need it now. I'm getting to hold it.

943
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,100
I better use it till the day I die.

944
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:34,320
It don't make no difference, babe. No, no, no. And it never ever will.

945
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,120
We needed it no more.

946
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,060
I wanna talk to you, and I'll say nothing but, hey, goodbye.

947
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:37,060


948
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:37,060


949
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:37,060


950
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:37,060


951
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:37,060


952
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:37,060


953
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:37,060


954
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:37,060


955
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,620
I'm gonna live in it and love in it

956
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,640
I get to hold it, babe

957
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,660
I'm gonna need it now

958
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,380
I'm gonna use it

959
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:45,880
Say, oh

960
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,440
Don't make no difference to me

961
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,040
Oh, honey, I hate to be the one

962
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,760
I said, you better live your life

963
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,680
And you better love your life

964
00:44:59,240 --> 00:44:59,980
Love me

965
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,180
Or someday you're gonna have to cry

966
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,620
Yes, indeed

967
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,640
Yes, indeed

968
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,540
Yes, indeed

969
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,580
Oh, baby, yes, indeed

970
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:13,000
I said, you're almost gonna hurt me

971
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,860
I said, you're almost gonna let me down

972
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,360
I said, everywhere, every day

973
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,780
In the day

974
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,620
And everywhere

975
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:23,540
Everywhere

976
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,580
Oh, honey, what you hold on to, it's gonna move

977
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,620
I said, it's gonna disappear when you turn it back

978
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,600
I said, you know it ain't gonna be that way

979
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,320
You wanna reach out and grab on

980
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,520
Oh, baby

981
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,420
Oh, baby

982
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,360
Oh, baby

983
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,360
Oh, but keep on looking up

984
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,300
Oh, yeah

985
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,680
Oh, yeah

986
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,540
Oh, yeah

987
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,200
Oh, oh

988
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,340
Oh, oh

989
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,380
Oh, oh

990
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,020
Oh, oh

991
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:55,960
I came

992
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,080
I saw

993
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,400
And I fell

994
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,000
Little fool I am

995
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,620
And I fell

996
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,040
Now I'm in an awful jam

997
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,980
I love him

998
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,180
But oh

999
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:22,180
I guess I'll have to change my plan

1000
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,880
I should have known

1001
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,400
That he'd be somebody else's man

1002
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,900
I overlooked that point

1003
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,740
Completely

1004
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,620
But I'm still

1005
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,840
Until the big affair

1006
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,000
Began

1007
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,680
Before I knew

1008
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,740
Where I was at

1009
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,500
I found myself

1010
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,400
Up on the shelf

1011
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,300
And that was that

1012
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:57,920
I tried to reach the moon

1013
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,580
But when I got there

1014
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:05,400
All that I could get

1015
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,840
Was the air

1016
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,860
My feet are back upon

1017
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,060
The ground

1018
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,980
I've lost the one man

1019
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,120
I've found

1020
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:24,740
I guess I'll have to change my plan

1021
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,480
I should have realized

1022
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,700
I'd be an awful ram

1023
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:33,880
Why?

1024
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,220
Why?

1025
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,140
Why did I buy

1026
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:37,400
Those black pajamas

1027
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,800
Before the big affair

1028
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,700
Began

1029
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,000
My boiling point

1030
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,280
Is much too low

1031
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,720
For me to cope

1032
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,340
With that illo

1033
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,600
For Romeo

1034
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,180
I think I'll crawl

1035
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,580
Right back

1036
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:04,860
And into my shell

1037
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:10,020
Dwelling in my personal

1038
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:14,940
I have to change my plan

1039
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,200
Around

1040
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,980
I've lost the one man

1041
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,920
The one man I've found

1042
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,800
I've lost the one man

1043
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:34,840
The one man I've found

1044
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,120
I can never forget

1045
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:42,560
Always have in my entire life

1046
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,160
I cannot tell you

1047
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,480
That I've become

1048
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:53,980
Like a son

1049
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,060
To myself

1050
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,060


1051
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,060


1052
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,060


1053
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,100
I'll count to you

1054
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,280
I won't

1055
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,820
If you earned

1056
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:58,820


1057
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:58,820


1058
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:58,820


1059
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:58,820


1060
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,880
I fell in love

1061
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,060
With a new sweet

1062
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:01,560
—

1063
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,540
And a little

1064
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:02,540


1065
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:02,540


1066
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,080
The cold

1067
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,660
I've known

1068
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:04,840
For so many years

1069
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:09,300
Life has been spent preparing for a day that just didn't happen.

1070
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,520
Or did it?

1071
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,960
Did it not happen, Seekers?

1072
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,300
I was there at Brushwood, and I know what I saw.

1073
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,440
Or I think I know what I saw, but...

1074
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:28,700
Oh, whatever it was, it was truly apocalyptic.

1075
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,360
I went not knowing what to expect, but...

1076
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:38,600
with a background sensation that we would all somehow be ripped off.

1077
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:45,280
Though, as I put it, one way or another, we're all gonna finally get porked real good by Bob!

1078
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:45,900
Woo-hoo!

1079
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:50,200
Oh, but, you know, Seekers,

1080
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:56,700
I never expected to be feeling such righteous afterglow from the spiritual mugging we all suffered.

1081
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:03,300
Sure, staying in Jesus or brazen charlatans who took advantage of our willing gods

1082
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:07,980
was a great deal of unparallelability, and sure, the chance of actual redemption from the skies

1083
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,780
was about zilch point nada.

1084
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:14,960
Oh, but still, I tried to keep that wool pulled over my eyes

1085
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,860
and to be a starry-eyed little Seeker for the cause, and...

1086
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:23,520
although deep inside there was a feeling that we were about to get the big burn of all time,

1087
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,760
I tried to deny it.

1088
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:32,000
Oh, but, Seekers, something mystical happened out there in that subgenious sweat lodge,

1089
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:32,360
and...

1090
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,580
I know I'm not the only one who saw it.

1091
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:41,580
The night of X-Day Eve, after all the rituals started to peter out,

1092
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:46,400
I took my boombox full of apocalyptic, easy-listening music

1093
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,480
out into the middle of the big-ass brushwood field and stood out there,

1094
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:57,940
naked and alone in the dewy grass beneath a sky that was screaming with stars.

1095
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:01,780
And there I danced an end-times dance,

1096
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,260
alone in the dark.

1097
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:09,800
And as I swirled, everywhere I looked was alive with our people.

1098
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,840
The night air pulsed with subgenious life.

1099
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:17,840
All around me was a ring of their glowing campfires,

1100
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:23,120
and the sounds of their last night on Earth revelry carried through the cold night air

1101
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,540
and blended with the atmospheric schmaltz.

1102
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,760
And suddenly, I was moved to tears of absolute bliss.

1103
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:31,760


1104
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:31,760


1105
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,540
Absolute joy by it all.

1106
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:41,000
Because this was no longer a raggedy-ass convocation of bitter misfits and screwed-up loners.

1107
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,280
No.

1108
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,320
Suddenly, we were a great subgenious nation.

1109
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,560
And at that point of Satori, alone there in that field,

1110
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,660
I sobbed like a damn baby over it.

1111
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,760
And in that crystal and perfect moment,

1112
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,740
I knew what it was really like.

1113
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,060
What it was really all about.

1114
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:09,780
Waiting for the saucers to arrive was a lot of kicks, sure.

1115
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,820
But that wasn't the be-all and end-all of the game.

1116
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,740
Yeah, we got burned.

1117
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:21,660
But at the same time, something stronger in us all got forged in those same fires.

1118
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:28,420
We are all in this church from the start because of our mutually shared pain and discontent.

1119
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:32,920
And at the risk of sounding just too damn sweet and light,

1120
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,660
we have each other.

1121
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:41,280
That's where our power and our true menace to them has always lain.

1122
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,640
Oh, but by the same token,

1123
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:49,740
we can draw the solace and the strength that we need for our basic survival

1124
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:55,060
from the fact that we are a solid, cohesive subgenius family.

1125
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:56,900
Yes.

1126
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:57,200
Yes.

1127
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,880
Every one of us has a part around Bob's big dinner table,

1128
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:05,100
passing that steaming tureen of slack to the yeti next to you,

1129
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:10,020
and happily digging into the soul-satisfying feast of Dobbs with our brethren.

1130
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,200
Sure, we're a dysfunctional family,

1131
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,680
but we're made of superior material to start with.

1132
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,540
And our version of the home game has much more amusing and fascinating characters,

1133
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,440
like our oily daddy, Stang,

1134
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,880
and our badass uncle, Katahdin Lagume.

1135
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,620
And our sweet little brother, Onan.

1136
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,780
And our silken sister, Lilith.

1137
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:34,360
And our crusty old grandpa, G. Gordon Gordon.

1138
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:35,140
Ha ha!

1139
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,820
Oh, and you can just think of me as your slutty sister, Susie,

1140
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:43,300
who laughs it off when you walk in on me when I'm douching in the tub.

1141
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,300
Yeah, because out there in the woods, Seekers,

1142
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,060
I got more bang for my membership buck than I ever thought possible.

1143
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,660
This church has given me,

1144
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,180
and I know it has given me,

1145
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,040
many others,

1146
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,100
something immeasurable,

1147
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,660
and I am absolutely shining from it all.

1148
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,180
With lovely subgenius friends like I have,

1149
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:11,100
I can glibly chortle out of hell the sex goddesses,

1150
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:16,360
and maybe I can laugh off the sting of brutal disappointment that much more easily.

1151
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,760
Because we didn't exactly get off this planet,

1152
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:24,260
but for some weird-ass damn reason,

1153
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,080
I don't exactly mind living on

1154
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,520
this crap ball earth as much as I did just two weeks ago.

1155
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:35,280
And that in itself is a miracle of the first degree, baby.

1156
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:40,280
Oh sure, this cult is founded on a big damn joke,

1157
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,620
but our dedication to our own is totally serious,

1158
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,720
and any lame-ass butt-stain who doubts that we're a family

1159
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,580
can just look at the outpouring of support for poor stricken pea kitty.

1160
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,200
A subgenius so strong

1161
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,360
that not even diabetes could fell him.

1162
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:03,000
Oh, maybe we didn't get off this planet, Seekers,

1163
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,640
but we can use our new solidarity

1164
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,860
to create a subgenius paradise for the utensin here on earth.

1165
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,080
And by the way, yes,

1166
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,240
that was a huge damn X in the clouds

1167
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,180
in the pink light of early dawn on X-Day morning.

1168
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,540
And it was truly a beautiful thing

1169
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:25,280
to see the tangible sign

1170
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,420
of Dobbs' covenant with his people,

1171
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:32,180
a fire in the skies over our great subgenius nation.

1172
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:39,080
Oh, brave new world that has such creatures in it.

1173
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,000
Snap out of it.

1174
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:41,380
Ow!

1175
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:46,980
I think that pagan living softened your brain.

1176
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,120
How do you feel?

1177
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:53,460
Do I ever need a frickin' cigarette?

1178
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:57,360
After that emotional display, I need a douche.

1179
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,460
Oh, yeah.

1180
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,220
Ah!

1181
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,260
Ah!

1182
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:02,520
Ah!

1183
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:03,200
Ah!

1184
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,440
Ah!

1185
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,140
Ah!

1186
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:06,600
Ah!

1187
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:06,860
Ah!

1188
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:07,260
Ah!

1189
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:07,680
Ah!

1190
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,060
Ah!

1191
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:08,260
Ah!

1192
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,120
Ah!

1193
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,420
Ah!

1194
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:24,600
Ah!

1195
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:28,160
Ah!

1196
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:28,220


1197
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:28,560
Ah!

1198
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:28,880
Ah!

1199
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:29,620
Ah!

1200
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,100
Ah!

1201
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:32,560
Ah!

1202
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:32,560


1203
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:32,600
Ah!

1204
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,680
I've done a lot.

1205
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:42,060
God knows I've tried to find the truth.

1206
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:46,520
I've even lied.

1207
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:55,980
But all I know is down inside I'm bleeding.

1208
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,740
But all I know is down inside I'm bleeding.

1209
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:03,280
But all I know is down inside I'm bleeding.

1210
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:03,540
But all I know is down inside I'm bleeding.

1211
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,100
I'm superhero.

1212
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,620
Come to feast.

1213
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,600
To taste the flesh.

1214
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,680
Not yet deceased.

1215
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:24,720
And all I know is still the business.

1216
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,540
And all I know is still the business.

1217
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,540
In me.

1218
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:39,380
I've come to feast.

1219
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,280
The barn WOW.

1220
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:42,480
The barn WOW.

1221
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,260
The barn wow.

1222
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,500
The barn wow.

1223
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:48,500


1224
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,760
The barn wow.

1225
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,540
The barn WOW.

1226
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,840
The barn, wow.

1227
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,520
Camp HISCUP in my honor.

1228
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:55,520


1229
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:55,520


1230
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:55,520


1231
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:55,520


1232
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:55,520


1233
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:55,520


1234
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:55,520


1235
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:55,520


1236
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:55,520


1237
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:55,520


1238
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:55,520


1239
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:55,520


1240
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:55,520


1241
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,400
And crawling

1242
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,240
On the planet's face

1243
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,160
Some insects

1244
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,120
Called the human race

1245
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,560
Lost in time

1246
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,540
Lost in space

1247
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,560
And in meaning

1248
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,480
Meaning

1249
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,060
Meaning

1250
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:52,900
Ah

1251
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:53,220
Ah

1252
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:53,220


1253
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,720
Smithers, I'm so happy.

1254
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,720
Something amazing has happened.

1255
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:57,720
I'm actually happy.

1256
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,560
Take a note.

1257
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,920
From now on, I'm only going to be good and kind to everyone.

1258
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,220
I'm sorry, sir.

1259
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,260
I don't have a pencil.

1260
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,300
Don't worry.

1261
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,180
I'm sure I'll remember it.

1262
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,160
