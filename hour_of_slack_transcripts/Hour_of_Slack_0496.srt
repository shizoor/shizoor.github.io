1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,020
That's right, friends. This is KNON. This is, I repeat, KNON on our new frequency of 89.3 FM, whatever that means. Thank you.

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,180
Give me a lighter. I'll light that sucker.

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,220
I bet you will.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,880
...terrific guest coming up. I can't tell you how excited I am about our first guest this morning.

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,820
He will be joining us in just a couple of moments.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,300
The Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of the Subgenius. Praise Bob.

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,860
Did we have any operating difficulties?

8
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,740
Hey, what's going on here?

9
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,340
The Subgenius.

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,880
The Subgenius.

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,200
Welcome to the end times, boys and girls. We're going to shock shock the house with your brain and the world.

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,260
Bob is getting down with you here tonight. Bob is getting down to help your pipe.

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,720
Bob is coming here to ease your strife. Come on, suckers, let Bob into your life.

14
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,660
Big man.

15
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,040
Bob.

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,400
And remind you of this. He who laughs last, laughs best, but also gets his teeth kicked in.

17
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,260
And if you can't laugh at yourself, make fun of everyone else.

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,900
Is it rolling?

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,920
Backwards masking. Take one.

20
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,100
Satan is cool. God is a jerk.

21
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,360
Wonder if we fooled anybody.

22
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,860
Yeah, I've heard about Satan trying to get...

23
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,000
people to sell their souls, but he's not really too good at it.

24
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:09,320
Actually, he tried to get me to sell mine, but all he offered me was crap like a Hugo and tennis shoes from Taiwan and carob yogurt balls and lunar powered sundial, crap like that.

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,440
So I told him he'd have to do better than that.

26
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,120
Then I thought he was a cheapskate and he got all huffy and red in the face and called me a spoilsport.

27
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,380
But I told him to go straight to hell because that just wasn't good enough.

28
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,060
I wasn't going to sell myself that cheap.

29
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,700
So there.

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,400
Oh, yes.

31
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,480
A dear friend's eye.

32
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,900
This is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack at our new place on the dial.

33
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,760
Eighty nine point three.

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,440
Unusual.

35
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,980
I hope you're finding us.

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,020
And I hope those of you who never heard us before keep listening because I have specially designed this show.

37
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,560
This is a very unusual show for you strangers.

38
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,100
Do it.

39
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:04,920
And what we what we're doing tonight is basically sort of a revised introduction to the church for new viewers.

40
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,700
Every three or four months we do that.

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:17,040
It's like a pledge drive just to catch you up on what the church of the subgenius is and why there must be and has always been a Bob.

42
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,880
Also tonight, though, we're going to preview the new album by the swinging area diets of Boston.

43
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,560
If you've never heard them, then.

44
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,580
Hang in there.

45
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,800
By the way, while I'm still thinking about it, this is quark in the background.

46
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,100
Quark in the mighty stereo background.

47
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,340
Friends, listen on headphones.

48
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,320
You really should.

49
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,020
And start your tape decks up.

50
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,460
We'll also later be doing some reading from the new subgenius book.

51
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,880
High weirdness by mail, which isn't out yet.

52
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,820
So therefore, you couldn't call this an ad.

53
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,440
Exactly.

54
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,360
You're getting a preview, friends of a major.

55
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:55,800
Simon.

56
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,600
And Schuster publication.

57
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,380
And it's going to make some of you so mad.

58
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,080
So mad.

59
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,140
I hope.

60
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,640
If we're doing our job.

61
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,800
So see if you can see if you can figure out what's going on here.

62
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,640
If you can't, we don't need you.

63
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,180
Understand?

64
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,240
That's the whole point of this.

65
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,460
See?

66
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,780
People may have had kids but their kids aren't reading the nonsense page or wondering

67
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:53,780


68
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:53,780


69
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:53,780


70
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:53,780


71
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:53,780


72
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,240
You say that it's less relevant than the River Church, but we're not talking about

73
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,240


74
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,740
But really, that was a genuine response, a genuine response.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000


76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,260
Finally, we're all looking at the 3. exhibit.

77
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,260


78
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,260


79
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,260


80
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:03,920
about tell us all about it well the church of the subgenius is the end times church for mutants

81
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:14,420
formed to spread the seed word of that great saint of sales jr bob dobbs now bob formed the church in

82
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:22,400
1953 being the saint of sales there he is and uh but he kind of kept it under wraps until around

83
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:32,240
1980 when he uh recruited dr phylo drummond and myself to begin releasing the secrets of

84
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,100
his teachings to the public at large which of course has had disastrous effects

85
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:52,180
bob is sex that's your key phrase it will trigger the entire message without your

86
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,380
brain

87
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,880
being aware of it we are controlling transmission

88
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,440
he's a maniac out to rule the world what can i do to make you understand

89
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,660
i love you

90
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,840
rewards are worth the effort oh yes dear friends the harvest

91
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,280
but you see if you do have some

92
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,600
questions here you can still call and speak to an actual human being who might answer your questions

93
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:37,660
in a linear way call the station speak to the will o dobbs and he'll give you information on

94
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,060
where to get more information and help you find out whether you can actually handle that

95
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:49,660
information or not which is all another question altogether you see the keys to instant success

96
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,380
mystic knowledge and miraculousness

97
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,660
his

98
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,180
Eенie

99
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,060
of Nada

100
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,280
The bizarre, the kooky, the kinky, as long as it keeps its distance.

101
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,180
Do you enjoy getting unsolicited but unspeakably weird things in the mail for free?

102
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:31,600
Love to snicker in superiority, perhaps largely imagined, at the incredible gullibility of those around you?

103
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:38,960
Enjoy reading the headlines on sleazy tabloids and ads for local psychic fortune tellers?

104
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:50,760
Do you, my friend, appreciate the unexpected glimpses of strange realities behind religions other than your own?

105
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,880
Entranced by the thought processes of the mentally ill?

106
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,420
And bored to tears by any music, video, or literature that isn't almost shocking?

107
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:13,320
Are you painfully aware, dear friend, that all great geniuses and inventors of the past appeared totally insane to everyone around them?

108
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,420
Then have we got a religion for you, my friend.

109
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,720
Actually, that was the introduction from the religion's second book, High Weirdness by Mail, but let's not get technical.

110
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,020
Superior mutants.

111
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,580
Superior mutants.

112
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:31,580


113
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,760
Superior mutants. Quit your job. Slack off.

114
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,860
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

115
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,080
Well, no, probably not, but whatever you do, just keep listening.

116
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,680
The end times is here.

117
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,460
At last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

118
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:58,440
This is it. The only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

119
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,020
Having all the guilt.

120
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,200
But none of the sex.

121
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,820
I did not put you here to suffer.

122
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,700
No, I did not put you here to whine.

123
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,380
I put you here to love one another.

124
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,860
Yes, and the kid has had a good time now, now, now.

125
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,860
Let my people go, go, go.

126
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

127
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,020
Let my people go, go, go.

128
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,040
Oh, you got her.

129
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,500
Let my people go, go, go.

130
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,960
Oh, you got her.

131
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,840
Let my people go, go, go.

132
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,780
Are they destroyed?

133
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,640
...

134
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,520
...

135
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,880
...

136
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,280
...

137
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,180
...

138
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,180


139
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,180


140
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,180


141
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,180


142
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,180


143
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,280
...

144
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,280


145
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,280


146
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,280


147
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,180
When you're driving 16 hours, take a barb.

148
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,120
Take a barb.

149
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,380
When you use your mutant powers, take a barb.

150
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,340
Take a barb.

151
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,140
When your blood is low in sugar, when you're picking up a booger, when you shoot him with

152
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,120
a looter, take a barb.

153
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,000
Take a barb.

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,220
When you're outside exercising, take a barb.

155
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,080
Take a barb.

156
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,700
When you're using sex devices, take a barb.

157
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,600
Take a barb.

158
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,120
When you're walking through the woods, when you make out with a girl, when you beat up

159
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,260
2 другers, take a barb.

160
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,140
Take a barb.

161
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,280
interfaces ,

162
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,080
n

163
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:53,720
Big Bad, Big Bob, Big Bad Bobby, Big Bad Bobby, Big Bad Bobby.

164
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,900
That's right, it's by Onan. Onan Kennebite.

165
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,120
Friends, call 823-7490 if you have any questions.

166
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,840
Once again, that's 823-7490.

167
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,400
Well, they're doing it anyway.

168
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,000
What do they care?

169
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,840
Are we controlled by secret forces?

170
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,280
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

171
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,760
Do people think you're strange?

172
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,320
Do you?

173
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,000
Then you may be on the right track.

174
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,660
Are you abnormal?

175
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,980
Then you are probably better than most people.

176
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,960
Yes, your time shall triumph.

177
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,860
I am completely agree with all the obstacles

178
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,820
and with all...

179
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,660
all the enemies

180
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,840
who are between me and what I want to do.

181
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,220
I see that they cooperate.

182
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,160
They are...

183
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,280
they are in a providential manner.

184
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,840
They help me to do exactly what...

185
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,400
what I want.

186
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,000
Because if I have not to fight,

187
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,360
it is in the fighting that I can see better

188
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,240
what I want to do.

189
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,380
It is in the...

190
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,300
in the friction, as you say.

191
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,600
Friction.

192
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,280
Friction.

193
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,440
That thing become more clear.

194
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,340
It become more clear just because it runs the danger to be far,

195
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,140
to go away from me.

196
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,020
We spread this mighty seed word of... of slack,

197
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,360
how to get it, how to fight the conspiracy through radio shows

198
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,880
in different cities, through videotape.

199
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,460
Two books now are excuse scrolls suitable for framing.

200
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
And live shows.

201
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,600
I do a lot of science fiction conventions.

202
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,120
And then there is Buck Naked, Reverend Buck Naked here in Dallas.

203
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,420
He occasionally plays with his band, More Drunk Cowboys here and there.

204
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,040
He preaches.

205
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,020
Although he is a... he is a...

206
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,040
as a true subgenius, he is a schismatic

207
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,640
and has formed his own splinter group,

208
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,000
which of course does intense battle with my personal splinter group.

209
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,700
It always happens.

250
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:14,260
You gotta study the extremists, the obscure, and the so-called nutty.

251
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,840
You need the balance.

252
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:26,160
Your poor brain is being impregnated with middle-of-the-road crap 24 hours a day, no matter what.

253
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,900
Network, TV, newspapers, radio, magazines at the supermarket.

254
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,560
Even if you never watch, read, listen, or leave your house.

255
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:49,260
Even if you are deaf and blind, the telepathic pressure alone of the uncountable normals surrounding you will ensure that you're automatically well-grounded in consensus reality.

256
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,800
Screw consensus reality.

257
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,380
What we all need is more of that common sense stuff.

258
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,740
Badly named, because it's not really such a common commodity after all.

259
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,380
And our guru, the great mystic, the saint.

260
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,620
In sales, J.R. Bob Dobbs often preached on this.

261
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,840
You know how dumb the average guy is?

262
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,600
He once asked his flock of apprentice sales ministers.

263
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,460
Well, by definition, half of them are even dumber than that.

264
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,880
Praise Bob.

265
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,840
Sad but true and getting worse each year, dear friends.

266
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,500
The kooks are our future.

267
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,520
So make no mistake.

268
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,160
It'll be a rich harvest.

269
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,300
For industrial skull farmers like us.

270
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,540
And those of every creed.

271
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:50,920
Because the brains of the all too willings are out there ripening, ingesting a rich loam of made-for-TV UFO movies.

272
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,120
And absurd claims for holistic vitamins.

273
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,980
Radio preachers who converse with angels.

274
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,540
Millions of potential vegetables just waiting to be plucked, shucked, and hauled.

275
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:12,460
And if it ain't us that does it, it's gonna be a lesser cult or even worse, some political group, dear friends.

276
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,280
So, if you don't get it by now, you never will.

277
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,800
Like they say and say again.

278
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,660
I don't know what you're doing.

279
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,180
Oh!

280
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,140
You wanna know what we're doing?

281
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,120
Sounds pink to me.

282
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,980
We've been talking about it for an hour and a half.

283
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,320
And if you haven't figured it out yet, pal, you never will.

284
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,480
Well, I'm a Christian and I think this is a sin.

285
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,460
I think this is a fake hate call.

286
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,120
Oh.

287
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,180
This is a fake hate call.

288
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,820
I wanna get some real hate calls.

289
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,220
Guy has a Bobby.

290
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,440
We can't, we can't deal, listen, no friends out there, we don't want fake hate calls.

291
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,600
We need the real thing.

292
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,860
I mean, it's just like in Dallas.

293
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,380
I mean, I'm in the middle of the Bible Belt.

294
00:17:52,460 --> 00:18:00,100
We've been doing this subgenius hour of slack show every Sunday night for almost a year and no one's killed us yet.

295
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,360
Well, did the Reverend ever explain to you what subgenius meant?

296
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,200
Uh...

297
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,760
Was there a connotation to concern?

298
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,380
No, we didn't get into that today.

299
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,560
I was just wondering.

300
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,160
You know, I just kind of always took it on his face value.

301
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,360
Uh-huh.

302
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,200
Well, if you joined it, you would be subgenius, wouldn't you?

303
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,280
I believe so.

304
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,920
What is he going to be when he wakes up and starts breathing?

305
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:34,900
Tell you what, I'm not going to turn my radio on Friday morning no more because I thought the little imbibing I'd done last night would pass.

306
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,420
But I ran it back into a nightmare when the radio came on.

307
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,420
Stuff happens.

308
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
Thank you, Kevin.

309
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,480
Thanks very much for calling, Norman.

310
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,100
How are you, sir?

311
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,780
Yeah, I'm sorry I missed Reverend Stang a while ago.

312
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,280
He mentioned a Reverend Buck Naked.

313
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:52,860
Mm-hmm.

314
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah, I think I knew him years back when he played in a band.

315
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,800
I believe that Reverend Naked does still play in a band.

316
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,040
Yeah, does he play the organ?

317
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,860
I don't know.

318
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,300
Yeah.

319
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,700
Well, this Buck Naked I knew could finger an organ better than anybody I ever saw.

320
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,980
That's about enough on that one, John.

321
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,640
Hi, Kevin.

322
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,220
How are you doing?

323
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:14,600
Fine.

324
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,060
How are you?

325
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,860
Good, good.

326
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,780
I've never called before, but...

327
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,300
Well, we're glad you could call today.

328
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:19,980
Well, thank you.

329
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,580
I do listen all the time.

330
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,880
I wanted to say something about that subgenius thing.

331
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,760
Mm-hmm.

332
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,140
I had seen a piece of paper that was printed by them about six or seven years ago.

333
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:31,640
Mm-hmm.

334
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,900
And a friend of mine brought it over and said, look at this.

335
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,880
And we looked at it, and it was the scariest thing I ever saw.

336
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:44,040
I just wanted the listeners to hear this experience that I had gone through.

337
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,920
Anyway, I read it, and what it was was it looked like gibberish on the surface.

338
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,100
In other words, it was just a lot of weird lettering and words that didn't make any real sense.

339
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,520
Until?

340
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,680
What?

341
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,620
Until?

342
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,880
Until I read through it, and it just, it was like a cave.

343
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:03,880


344
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,100
It was possessed or something.

345
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,960
It was scary.

346
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,420
It really scared me.

347
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,480
There was bad words in there, and there was...

348
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:10,740
No.

349
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,560
...messy stuff.

350
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:17,680
I mean, not full bad words, but just really, really scary stuff.

351
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,940
While you were reading it, did demons with fingernails begin clawing at your flesh?

352
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,600
Well, I know one thing.

353
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,080
I know they didn't claw at my flesh.

354
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,500
It's too bad.

355
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,440
But it got me to the point to where I decided I better not read anymore.

356
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,320
And it was a question of...

357
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:39,500
I'm not a religious fanatic or anything by far, but I could tell that there was definitely

358
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,360
not wholesome stuff in there, and I just thought it was really...

359
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,800
It made such an impression on me.

360
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,280
Like I say, seven years ago I read this thing, and it was just...

361
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,120
It was done very professionally, you know, printed and everything.

362
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,280
It wasn't just, you know, scarcely...

363
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,260
But it wasn't wholesome?

364
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,580
No, it was...

365
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,240
My word.

366
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,380
I would say it was just really, really weird.

367
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,180
Weird?

368
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,040
Weird and not wholesome.

369
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,340
Yeah, yeah.

370
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,540
Boy, I'm surprised they allow that kind of stuff to be printed.

371
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,660
Well, no, you see, it wasn't anything you could just, you know, say, oh, there is bad,

372
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,680
you know, bad...

373
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,380
Bad words, yeah.

374
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:15,620
...word being written.

375
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,940
It was more like...

376
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,100
It was like speaking in tongues, except it was evil, if you could imagine something like

377
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,300
that.

378
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,220
Oh, I think I could, and we thank you for alerting us to it, Jeff.

379
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:43,520
Well, you know, evil is as evil does, or something like that, I suppose.

380
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:51,360
I wish that I could play the entirety of the tapes that these little interviews come off

381
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,660
of.

382
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,620
They're usually very old interviews.

383
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,280
I'd love to play the whole thing.

384
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,120
But they're from other stations.

385
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,200
I don't know.

386
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,340
They're from other stations.

387
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,180
Hey, let's do something new, you know?

388
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,140
Speaking of which, there are some new things here I need to cover.

389
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,300
See, the subgenius mentality does not have to call itself a subgenius.

390
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:18,540
You'll be saved from damnation if you do call yourself a subgenius, and especially if you're

391
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,500
carrying the right membership cards in your pocket.

392
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,960
You can write for information about that.

393
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,900
We'll give the number at the end of the broadcast at 10 o'clock.

394
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:34,400
But in the meantime, there are, like I say, other ways to do the same thing that a subgenius

395
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,840
does, which is to get slack.

396
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:43,680
And this weekend, the lead singer of the Swingin' Erudites, who I've played many times before

397
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:51,640
in their older incarnations on this show, the lead singer Johnny Angel, a friend of

398
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,920
Brother Cleve Duncan, who you all know so well.

399
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,320
He sent me their album.

400
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,000
In fact, he sent me several copies of it.

401
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:08,060
And yes, the Swingin' Erudites have finally made it to vinyl, or whatever it is they record

402
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,960
on nowadays, disc, film, you know, I don't know.

403
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,620
I think this is analog, not digital.

404
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,320
But I'm going to play just a few bits and pieces off of it.

405
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,860
This one right here is probably a good one to...

406
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:34,680
To dedicate to the worried caller who called that normal talk show saying that the nonsensical

407
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,200
subgenius stuff he had read seemed so evil.

408
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:44,540
You know, to others, to some, it seems neither nonsensical nor exactly evil.

409
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,300
Everybody's heading west

410
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,020
Where they hear the serpent's best

411
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,800
We'll meet a former mouseketeer

412
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,100
And get the hell away from here

413
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:12,540
Sir, sir, we must have fleeced the block this time once too often

414
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,620
Frankie and the Nerf King Jim and Tammy

415
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,860
And the Reverend Jerry Falwell put the last nail in the coffin

416
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,660
Frankie and the Nerf King Jim and Tammy

417
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,600
We're going out west to the Golden Coast

418
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,640
I hear the preaching is peachy and the Lord is most

419
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,420
Now that we ain't got no home

420
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,920
It's praise the Lord and pass the copper tone

421
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,840
Go to where it never freezes

422
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,220
And surf all day

423
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,800
Thank you, Jesus

424
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,260
Thank you, Jesus

425
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,040
Frankie and the Nerf King Jim and Tammy

426
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,580
Frankie and the Nerf King Jim and Tammy

427
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,660
Frankie and the Nerf King Jim and Tammy

428
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,680
When we moved to California was a matter of survival

429
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,600
Frankie and the Nerf King Jim and Tammy

430
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,020
We got the hodas and the rockinis and we had a big revival

431
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,820
Frankie and the Nerf King Jim and Tammy

432
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,040
They claim a rolling stone shall gather no moss

433
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,960
We'll build a bitchin' woody from the Holy Cross

434
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,240
We'll build a bitchin' woody from the Holy Cross

435
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,620
Surf and sea and waves and sand

436
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,260
From the Shroud to a rim and get a groovy town

437
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,820
Our author, who art in heaven

438
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,060
Gave me a scurvy at the 7-Eleven

439
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,660
7-Eleven

440
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,340
Frankie and the Nerf King Jim and Tammy

441
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,160
Frankie and the Nerf King Jim and Tammy

442
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,760
Frankie and the Nerf King Jim and Tammy

443
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,540
On your knees

444
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:21,940
Um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

445
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,580
We could have moved to Kansas, we could have moved to Texas

446
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,360
Frankie and a nut, we'd give a Tammy

447
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,840
The Reverend Jimmy don't care cause he likes both sexes

448
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,380
Frankie and a nut, we'd give a Tammy

449
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,400
Would have moved to New York City, but boy oh boy

450
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,440
There's two Jews for every guy

451
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,120
Two Jews for every guy

452
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,400
I really wish to hell I was the Holy Father

453
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,560
Frankie and a nut meet Jim and Tammy

454
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,740
I wouldn't need a surfboard, I could walk on water

455
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,920
Frankie and a nut meet Jim and Tammy

456
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,800
Frankie and a nut meet Jim and Tammy

457
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,860
Frankie and a nut meet Jim and Tammy

458
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,760
Frankie and a nut meet Jim and Tammy

459
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,600
David Lee Roth, here's Hagar Sammy

460
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:31,920
On the Hangtown

461
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,860
Oh, yes indeedy

462
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:48,380
Well, we've certainly had some interesting calls tonight

463
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,500
At 823-7490

464
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,380
Send us an email at

465
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,080
We've switched frequencies with KCBI

466
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,200
You see, this used to be KNON

467
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,580
The station for open-minded weirdos

468
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,660
And rednecks and minorities of all kinds

469
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,080
Anybody not totally into the mainstream

470
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,700
And anybody into the mainstream

471
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:12,260
Whereas KCBI was somewhat more narrow

472
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,500
Readership, listenership

473
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,080
So half of the calls have been saying

474
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,380
Hey, KNON, where are you?

475
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,020
On the dial

476
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,380
And if you're hearing me, you already know

477
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,060
And if not, then what's the point in trying to tell you?

478
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,960
We're a little bit to the left

479
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,180
And the other half of the callers have called

480
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,180
Expecting to hear KCBI

481
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,180
Which used to occupy this airspace

482
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,580
And, well, for those of you

483
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,540
Wishing that you were hearing your good old KCBI

484
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,360
Christian station that you're used to

485
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,640
You are the lucky ones

486
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,760
You are really lucky

487
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,800
Because you are now finally by accident

488
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,400
Being delivered from the false religion

489
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,120
The biggest trick the devil ever pulled on you

490
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,580
To the church of the subgenius

491
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,020
The biggest trick ever pulled on the devil

492
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,860
I see

493
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,060
He and the devil thinks I'm kidding right now

494
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,020
Don't you, Satan?

495
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,020
Oh, yes, yes

496
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,960
It's a study in opposites, dear friends

497
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,580
But at the same time

498
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,960
I mean, we're on the side of right and good

499
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,800
The only difference between us

500
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,880
And what you may have used to be listening to

501
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,900
Is that it doesn't really matter to us

502
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,220
How much money you make, see

503
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,280
Or what religion you are

504
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,380
Or what color you are

505
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,520
Or what sex you are

506
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,320
To us

507
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,480
Now, I'm not speaking for KNON

508
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,480
KNON is not solid

509
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,440
It's not a church of the subgenius

510
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,600
We only do this one hour a week

511
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,440
That's all the slack you're gonna get for a week

512
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,160
In this form

513
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,800
However, stay tuned for further slack

514
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,940
Of many different kinds

515
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:08,600
This is a station that has gospel in the morning

516
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,520
Hispanic music during a chunk of the day

517
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,620
Soul and hip-hop, rap stuff

518
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,860
Another chunk of the day

519
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,680
Country, redneck, good old Texas stuff!

520
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,000
And then, you know, you're gonna get a lot of money, you know?

521
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,000


522
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,440
And then, weird punk

523
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,940
Late on into the night

524
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,060
Plus special days of talk shows

525
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:31,400
And alternate news that you may not quite get

526
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,800
The uncensored versions of

527
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,120
In other stations, so

528
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,140
Yeah, yeah

529
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,920
Why don't you...

530
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,980
Those of you who've never...

531
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,680
Who have stumbled upon us

532
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,140
Upon our new frequency

533
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,900
Please, just keep listening

534
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,260
Don't judge the whole station by this show

535
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,680
How could any other show keep up with this?

536
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,120
You know...

537
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:58,500
Yeah, yeah. Why don't you, those of you who have stumbled upon us, upon our new frequency, please just keep listening.

538
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:03,260
Don't judge the whole station by this show. How could any other show keep up with this?

539
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,540
They don't all have Bob. Some of them just have records.

540
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:17,340
What you just heard a little while ago was the Swinging Erudites, a version of Frankie and Annette meet Jim and Tammy.

541
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,680
We're going to play some more Swinging Erudites.

542
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,440
It's nice to reach out. It's nice for a change not to be preaching to the saved.

543
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:43,420
That is the downfall of everybody from the early Christians to the new age fakers to the modern day Christian fakers to, in fact, the subgenius fakers preaching to the saved.

544
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,960
I hope that you all, you all who cannot.

545
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:56,500
Figure out what's going on. Keep listening and become ever more confused until the fear and puzzlement builds up in your mind to the point where you can't quit talking about it.

546
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:10,980
And those of you who work with you in your office and think you're a religious fanatic, they'll think it sounds like a pretty interesting idea and probably end up contributing money either to the station or some other agent thereof, you see.

547
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,220
Yeah.

548
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,360
Yeah.

549
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,560
You tried everything.

550
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,640
You ain't seen nothing yet.

551
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,440
Learn to think big.

552
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,640
Develop the tricks of length extension.

553
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,760
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

554
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,980
Stand erect for your own abnormality.

555
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,400
Get set and form a cave every day.

556
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:47,320
The student of Dobbs training is practically forced to bring his strangest desires into rampaging life.

557
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,320
I used to get embarrassed of all my glass madness.

558
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,220
Now I get paid.

559
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,140
The pinks pay me fabulous sums of money for what they used to put me in jail for.

560
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,920
Thanks to Bob.

561
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,440
They were no longer今 and now to live the weiter life.

562
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:41,440


563
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:41,580
Bye, Matt.

564
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:41,580


565
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:41,820
We don't host these movies.

566
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:41,820


567
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,260
There's one thing, we have tohat our smarts.

568
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:44,580
Just take a simple drug and now 당신esqueque thing.

569
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:44,580


570
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:44,580


571
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:44,580


572
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,100
Was there smell like fish?

573
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,760
Could it really want to know?

574
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,440
I mean, could it really want to know?

575
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:51,580
Yeah.

576
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,480
Dobbs is seen to it that he exercises this abnormality.

577
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,380
To do otherwise, he teaches, would be nothing short of spiritual suicide.

578
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:14,980
Oh, no.

579
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,720
Bob is a way of life to millions, yet half of them don't even know it.

580
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:31,020
He's the one true living slack master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

581
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,880
He is the one real shortcut to slack.

582
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,820
Now, see another dimension on your TV.

583
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,540
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

584
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,440
Become physically attractive overnight.

585
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,240
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

586
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,540
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

587
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,660
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

588
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,720
And coming right back.

589
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,000
To bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

590
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,500
You and me together.

591
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,480
To help you.

592
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:20,440
To create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

593
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,520
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.

594
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,020
And channel them into an illusion of creativity.

595
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,960
That will fool normals and get you sex.

596
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,620
Oh, you better believe it, dear friends.

597
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,620
We can prove it all the way down the line, I'm afraid.

598
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,060
All the way.

599
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,480
Even though that wasn't actually...

600
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,900
Talk about the amusement park.

601
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:43,520
Oh.

602
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:43,600
Oh.

603
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,640
Well, yes.

604
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,380
If we give...

605
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,960
We'll never be able to raise the money for that amusement park now.

606
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,620
Amusement park?

607
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,640
What amusement park?

608
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,460
Oh, the subgenius amusement park in, uh...

609
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,040
Oklahoma.

610
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,320
Down the highway.

611
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,720
There across from the Stuckey's.

612
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,340
Near that big cement dinosaur they got out there?

613
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,880
Yes, there's a giant crude cement bob now.

614
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,620
With a, uh, cafe inside.

615
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,060
Talk about the nail slide.

616
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,520
They must have had some of the hot chili in there in that cafe.

617
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,020
The nail slide.

618
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,240
Yes, and, uh...

619
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,260
Listen to that reaction.

620
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,220
You know, the shower of razors.

621
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,940
And a lot of fun in the funhouse.

622
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,940
Of course, my favorite.

623
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,760
Of course you know what a...

624
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,700
The distorto chamber.

625
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,540
It's a long...

626
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:22,520
It seems there are some people who have been locked in there since, uh, 1944, but...

627
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,660
Five plus six million year cycle will end in 1998.

628
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,680
Dobbs sees the world entering a new aeon.

629
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:38,880
Which, in a few years, will bring more wondrous and miraculous change and carnage, insanity, and destruction

630
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,200
than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.

631
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:47,020
Bob brings a new destiny for America.

632
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,660
A time of cataclysmic economic change that will offer untold riches and power for those in the know.

633
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:01,700
While billions of deserving conspiracy dupes fry in hell on Earth.

634
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,840
Oh, and that's the part I can't wait to see.

635
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,200
That's what... That's really the point of every religion.

636
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,800
That's the point we're all...

637
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,400
That every true fanatic is waiting for.

638
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:25,040
When he gets to see the unbelievers fry the flesh peel off their bones for eternity without killing them.

639
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,520
Well, we're gonna, uh, drop away from... from the dogma for a while.

640
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,140
That is old classic subgenius media barrage material, by the way.

641
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,660
Co-produced by myself, Reverend Ivan Stang, your host.

642
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,720
And Dr. Bleepo Avedathi, and I believe, uh, Brother Cleve Duncan.

643
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,440
Who was at one time involved in the band.

644
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,160
We're gonna continue playing the Swinging Erudites.

645
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,300
This is the Paul McCartney massacre.

646
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,420
You're gonna love it.

647
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,280
This album is crammed with stuff.

648
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,200
Uh, a whole lot of it has...

649
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:03,560
Each song has one or two words that I, because of our dedication to decency and morality,

650
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,580
and that this is a family show,

651
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,740
uh, we... we... that we have to censor some of those words.

652
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,780
This upcoming material, I don't think, is...

653
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,180
I don't think I do.

654
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,260
This is from the Swinging Erudites.

655
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,240
And before I forget, why don't I give you their address,

656
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,420
so you can write for information on procuring the amazing music by these guys,

657
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,400
or... or tell your record store to write it,

658
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,700
because, uh, they need all... all the support they can get in this part of the country.

659
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,260
They're well known in New York, LA, Boston, so forth.

660
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,480
But down here, it takes a little longer.

661
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,780
And that's Swinging Erudites at P.O. Box 923.

662
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:41,760
P.O. Box 923.

663
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:41,760


664
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,580
Northampton, Massachusetts.

665
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,180
Once again, Box 923.

666
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,700
Northampton, Massachusetts.

667
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,660
M.A. 01080.

668
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,680
And this is... I mean, you can't...

669
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,320
This... I'm sorry.

670
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:07,400
I'm sorry for what we're doing to music in the name of the erudites, but, uh...

671
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,260
But I'm glad.

672
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,760
I'm glad if it hurts.

673
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,340
It hurts you.

674
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,580
I'm so glad.

675
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,060
And I...

676
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,720
And those of you who it most hurt should listen closest to the lyrics here.

677
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,520
Thank you.

678
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,960
You think that people would have had enough of Paul McCartney

679
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,440
I look around me and I see that this is so...

680
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,680
It's Yoko.

681
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,580
Woo-hoo!

682
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:45,160
Some people want to rid the world of Paul McCartney

683
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,240
What's wrong with that?

684
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,960
We'd like to know

685
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,960
So here we go

686
00:39:59,580 --> 00:39:59,640
Again!

687
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:40,580


688
00:40:40,580 --> 00:41:10,580


689
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:40,580


690
00:41:40,580 --> 00:42:10,580


691
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:40,580


692
00:42:40,580 --> 00:43:10,580


693
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:40,580


694
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,340
I'm so far away

695
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,380
So I need to get down anyway

696
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,160
Oh, I'm feeling ineptitude

697
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,760
I'm feeling

698
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,000
It's reggae time!

699
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,280
Oh, no it ain't.

700
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,740
Because we got a comment on these calls we're getting.

701
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,500
I mean, this is the most amazing things, dear friends.

702
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:31,680
A lot of the KCBI listeners expecting to find us on this spot on the dial, or expect to find them here, have instead found this thing that at first sounded like a religious broadcast, and then sounded like the most blasphemous, heretical, evil, satanic thing, and then suddenly it's rock and roll, and suddenly it's, it's, uh, I mean, imagine what they think.

703
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:36,480
And I will, I will lower myself to clarifying a couple of things.

704
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,340
Number one, the church of the subgenius is not satanic.

705
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:48,420
We do occasionally make minor financial arrangements with lesser demonic entities.

706
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,680
Only our guru Bob Dobbs makes deals with Satan, but he's not friends.

707
00:44:52,900 --> 00:45:01,420
And the only reason he does that is because Satan owes both Bob and his buddy, the fightin' Jesus, quite a bit of what you might call money.

708
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,700
Souls, actually, is the commodity used.

709
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,180
And, uh,

710
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,100
J.R. Bob Dobbs is an old drinkin' buddy of the fightin' Jesus.

711
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:18,700
Uh, Bob has instructed us that, uh, that, uh, most everything Jesus said was really cool, considering this.

712
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,960
It's a, it's a bit dated, I mean, you know, but...

713
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,060
Relax, friends.

714
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,140
In your own delusions.

715
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,500
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

716
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,980
And bridge your confusion.

717
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,880
Save me from the clutches of the conspiracy.

718
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,540
We will save you from the clutches of the conspiracy.

719
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,720
We will save you from the chains of time.

720
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,480
We will save you from the men in black.

721
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,820
Because every subgenius must have slack.

722
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,840
Praise Bob!

723
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,900
Yes, dear friends, we are praising Bob real hard tonight.

724
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,400
And praise the fightin' Jesus, too. What the heck?

725
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,880
It's just the fan clubs of the fightin' Jesus that make us mad sometimes.

726
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,640
And, uh, see, we're just not as forgiving.

727
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:17,560
You know, Bob isn't as well connected as Jesus or any of the other J's I.

728
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,280
There's so many of them runnin' around nowadays.

729
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,020
But there's only one true Bob, friends.

730
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,000
Boy, let me hear you say it!

731
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:26,500
Yeah!

732
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,000
Praise Bob!

733
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,660
Oh, oh, oh!

734
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,040
Praise Bob!

735
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,360
Oh, oh, oh!

736
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:38,900
Praise Bob!

737
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:56,080
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled by Bob, will usher in a spiritual re-brief and a cascade of astounding mysteries, supernatural bridges, and a restoration of lost psychic abilities.

738
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,500
Come on, take a bow!

739
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:02,720
To totally transform the lives of those who dare to seek them and pay for them.

740
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:03,800
That's right.

741
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,460
You're lucky to live in the end time.

742
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,200
Here's more money, Bob!

743
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,540
The amount is six, six, six.

744
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,260
Anybody knows that?

745
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:17,740
Oh, but actually it's, uh, nine, nine, nine, friends.

746
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,600
Bob's number is nine, nine, nine.

747
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,260
He's not the anti-Christ.

748
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,520
He's not Christ, either.

749
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,400
He's more like the anti-anti-Christ.

750
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,900
Whatever the heck that means, we just have to trust in Bob and have faith!

751
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,280
Faith is what it's all about!

752
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,000
Just like with your other religions.

753
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,500
Unquestioning faith.

754
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:45,200
We don't need to know why or wherefore or where the proof came from.

755
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,060
Bob said it.

756
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,620
I believe it.

757
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,940
That settles it.

758
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:58,340
Prepare for the launch of the bleeding dead of April.

759
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,500
Remember...

760
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,460
Remember the motto.

761
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,360
Perform the salute.

762
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:10,060
Slack off and study the pamphlet.

763
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,960
And you can get those pamphlets, friends, by writing for information.

764
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,400
Free information from...

765
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,860
Got that pencil ready?

766
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,680
We'll try to give it again at the end.

767
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:22,800
Bob...

768
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,320
There's a pipe in the sky, friends.

769
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:31,480
And you'll follow it anywhere, especially to P.O. Box 148.

770
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:39,100
148-140-306 in mighty, mighty Dallas, Texas 75214.

771
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:46,820
Bob at Box 148-140-306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

772
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,700
There is a pipe in the sky, and it follows you everywhere, dear friend.

773
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:59,880
Are you gonna be ready to dive into Bob's pipe like a pinch of his frock?

774
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:09,260
And rise on the smoke up to the escape saucers of the sex goddesses on X-Day 1998?

775
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:18,420
Or are you gonna be left behind like the rest of the unbelievers, frying, frying in a hell of your own making?

776
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:23,260
Except for the time in the Andes.

777
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:28,740
And then there's the time on all palaces.

778
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,140
But before I go any further, I do have to give a, um...

779
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:35,680
A little bit of a, uh...

780
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,740
Well, actually, let's just, let's just, uh...

781
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,740
Calm down here for a second and put on some more...

782
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,420
Oh, what kind of pleasant music.

783
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,460
Here, We Killed Elvis by the Epstein Brothers.

784
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,640
That ought to be good background for this little announcement here.

785
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,300
Ha! You R.S. Slack fans will love this one.

786
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,740
It's doggy dip in garland time again.

787
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:02,650
Yes, it's time again to begin dipping your dog, and my dog too.

788
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:10,690
Pesticide dips and baths for all dogs, no cats please, to help get rid of a pesty fleas and ticks,

789
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:14,530
which can carry, uh, pretty serious diseases.

790
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:17,270
Some of them designed by our own defense department.

791
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:22,750
And this happens, uh, these are like, uh, uh, special dip deals.

792
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:26,310
Uh, I believe it's a free, free dog dips.

793
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:31,790
At the M Bank of Garland parking lot on Garland Road and Avenue D.

794
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:32,670
It's a new...

795
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:41,950
And the reason why is, you know, you gotta get an early jump on those little, uh, arachnid-toid fleas and ticks.

796
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:46,430
Ticks! Shoot those ticks down, man.

797
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,250
They come in, let's...

798
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,550
Oh, oh, it's so fun to hear them pop.

799
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,870
When you put the match head on them.

800
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:56,290
And also it helps cool down your pesty fleas.

801
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:57,270
And the heat of summer.

802
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:01,430
The dips are effective for seven to ten days, offered every two weeks until mid-September.

803
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:05,750
It's a pre and recovery-ly a good, uh, cause of ps-ree-ive.

804
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:12,550
Unless invited, hope to share, uh, uh, I ain't gonna be there, but, uh, but you understand.

805
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:19,830
You know, it's hard to, it's hard to know sometimes where to take the show.

806
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:23,850
It becomes so ugly and frightening, even for us.

807
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:26,170
The challenge of trying to...

808
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,130
To save the unsavable.

809
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:30,710
To find the unfindable cassettes.

810
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:34,350
Sometimes drives us to use bits and pieces of actually...

811
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:38,450
This whole show is composed of bits and pieces of other subgenius shows.

812
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:45,410
Uh, however, the one I'm about to play is the probably most original of them all.

813
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:52,710
KPFA, Berkley, uh, excerpts here from more than an hour, less than a show.

814
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,770
Dr. Howell, Puzzling Evidence.

815
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:56,270
Mobius Rex, Gary Gray.

816
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:56,650
The Big Broke Friend.

817
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:58,290
Lies and...

818
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,050
Glass Madness sometimes.

819
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:02,030
And even once in a while,

820
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:03,210
M-me.

821
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:04,510
M-who?

822
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:07,190
All right, all right, we'll be quiet.

823
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,290
Okay, everybody, keep it down.

824
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,130
The show wife hates the show.

825
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,970
There has to be a show wife hating the show in full voice.

826
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,530
Otherwise, why would Beebother come down here and do it?

827
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:19,370
Well, there it goes.

828
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:21,710
I'm gonna show show wife my show thing.

829
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:25,390
Now who has unbuckled my buckle and unsnapped my shoe?

830
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:27,410
He's doing that buckly buckling for the camera.

831
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he really likes that.

832
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:33,770
Well, I like to get out my bullwhip and, uh, just remove that buckle if it's got a badge attached to it.

833
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:34,850
Buck naked before Bob.

834
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,030
What? Naked before who?

835
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,850
I don't wanna be that. I don't wanna be that guy.

836
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,910
The buck passeth not. For the doe and the buck dwell in the same nest.

837
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:46,170
The buck is Bob.

838
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:48,410
Could be. Could have been.

839
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:51,750
As we constantly ask ourselves these questions.

840
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:53,150
Could have been. I guess it's...

841
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:54,130
Who is Thing?

842
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:57,430
And why is he allowed to talk twice as fast as me?

843
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:02,210
I don't know. Because you had too much show air, Gary.

844
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,930
And so did I. It sure felt good.

845
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:12,710
How can he keep talking like that? I have noticed that he just goes and goes.

846
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:14,830
It's beautiful. It's like poetry.

847
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:18,750
This? Yes. It's a constant.

848
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:22,570
It's like an isosceles triangle stacked onto...

849
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,490
Or bowed just so unto one.

850
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:24,290
Plank's number.

851
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:28,210
And it is unbeknownst to me that the price of the power of the askable...

852
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:31,330
Well, how do you kill it? Do you just plug it in?

853
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:35,090
Or do you reduce its potentiometer level to the minus 18th power?

854
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:38,330
The price of a spanking new issue of the book of the subject.

855
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,210
It is still there. You just hand it over to the enemy.

856
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:43,210
You gotta be able to pull yourself together pretty soon.

857
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:49,870
And now it's time for the show to be itself.

858
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:52,090
You wish, buddy.

859
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,730
And how right he is.

860
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:56,610
Go on, show. Let your hair down.

861
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:58,250
Yeah, this show is self.

862
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:01,870
Take your pants off. Shake your shoes out. Take it easy.

863
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,750
Yes, shake your booties. Drive them.

864
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:10,950
Lean back and just ride with the slack. Surf that buck plane.

865
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,590
Climb onto the slack wagon.

866
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,490
That magic surfboard of Bob.

867
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:16,090
Oh, God. It's messy in here.

868
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:18,310
My pants are getting all wet.

869
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:21,490
I guess I just get too excited around the show or something.

870
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,470
I don't know. Why are we doing this in a...

871
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,930
We're at an ice skating rink. This is terrible. It's cold in here.

872
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,890
It's cold, yeah. These skates don't really fit.

873
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:28,970
But it's got the best snack bar.

874
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:29,830
My feet hurt.

875
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:32,170
I don't know if I want to be here anymore.

876
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:34,410
Well, take those skates out of me. We've got them upside down.

877
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:35,810
Oh, that's why they hurt.

878
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:37,970
Why don't we run up the show?

879
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:40,390
Is it like... Last time...

880
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,070
What show? What?

881
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:45,070
We didn't get to run up the show until half an hour after we finished.

882
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:46,090
Oh, yeah.

883
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:49,850
By then, it had gotten kind of stale. It wasn't as good anymore.

884
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:50,450
How do you explain that exactly?

885
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:53,150
Friends, I don't know if I really want to...

886
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:57,130
to expose my audience as to what happens after the show is...

887
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:01,310
and what is actually done with the souls of the listeners afterwards,

888
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:05,970
which we collect here on the ends of the microphone in these special condensers.

889
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:08,810
Actually, it's not the microphone.

890
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:12,850
It's like a bounce back from your speakers that goes back to the transmitter

891
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:14,370
and then is mailed to the church.

892
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:18,930
Once again, at B.O. Box 14306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

893
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:21,050
And you can also get information about...

894
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,030
Well, actually, actually, friends,

895
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:23,450
it's one of the most important things in the world.

896
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:24,890
It's almost time for us to go.

897
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:28,850
I'm going to play one more Swingin' Erudite song pretty quick here to get us out

898
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:35,910
and sort of transfer the Slack awareness over to Robert Wisdom's show, American Music Party.

899
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:42,610
I had meant originally to start on this show this new little department,

900
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:46,070
a new department of the Hour of Slack, which we will start next week,

901
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:49,630
reading from the book High Weirdness by Mail,

902
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:53,330
which tells you where to get the weirdest stuff from the weirdest groups,

903
00:55:53,330 --> 00:56:00,970
under the categories of weird science, UFO contactees, Jesus contactees,

904
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:06,190
even weirder religions than our own or yours,

905
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:12,290
health and self-improvement scams, new age saps, cosmic hippie stuff,

906
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:21,690
great catalogs and weird politics, funny clubs, weird art, comics,

907
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:29,230
sleaze and rudeness, and of course, the cassette revolution in independent music and so forth.

908
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:33,150
We'll read like one selection per chapter or per show

909
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:36,010
and tell you the addresses of where to write for free information

910
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:40,710
from these amazingly either brilliant or completely insane people.

911
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:50,750
Thank you so much for bearing with the truth and the fragments of it that hurt so bad.

912
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:53,550
On the Hour of Slack, J.N. Wynn.

913
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:54,890
Thank you all.

914
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,710
And this is the swinging airy-dots coming right...

915
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,790
Coming right...

916
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:02,470
Is she really gonna cop from him?

917
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:08,290
I met him at the candy store

918
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:10,510
The first hit was free

919
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,610
Yeah, we get the picture

920
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:17,830
That's how I got hooked by the dealer of the crack

921
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:26,150
He lit the pipe and what did I do?

922
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,510
Do, do, do

923
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:34,750
I talked to Jesus and all of his crew

924
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:37,110
His motley crew

925
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:41,050
Little then did I suspect

926
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:45,330
In twenty minutes I'd be a wreck

927
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,510
Thanks for the craving

928
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,530
The dealer of the crack

929
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:58,650
I saw all those corny ads on TV

930
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,570
The food tube

931
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:07,210
But what did they mean to a nice girl like me?

932
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:08,830
Not Jack

933
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:13,630
My parents said take care of yourself

934
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:18,210
But they're always wrong about everything else

935
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,510
That's how I got hooked by the dealer of the crack

936
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:23,150
I got hooked by the dealer of the crack

937
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:31,110
They kept saying don't be pushed over and over, man

938
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:34,150
Till I pushed my TV set out the window

939
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:36,490
It just increases my paranoia, man

940
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:38,510
Lookin' in my mirror and seein' a police car

941
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:39,870
I mean, I'm gettin' better

942
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:41,410
Thank you, David Crosby

943
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,710
No charge, dude

944
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:47,050
I felt so helpless, what could I do?

945
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:49,850
Sell blood

946
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:55,430
I pawned mom's furs and her wedding rings, too

947
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:58,170
To the house of correction

948
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:01,870
I could run a three minute mile

949
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:06,250
Just to get my hands on that little brown bio

950
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:11,130
You made me a track star, the dealer of the crack

951
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:17,030
Walk in the street, I'm a crack star

952
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,870
Strip was the last place I spout

953
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:21,510
Downtown

954
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:27,670
Lookin' so spelt down at 83 pounds

955
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,450
Anorexia nervosa

956
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:34,190
Daddy's caddy, I got a board

957
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:38,130
Sign me into the Betty Ford

958
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:43,270
Get me a valium, the dealer of the crack

959
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:54,950
I'm a little campier

960
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:58,170
I got my Tennessee D-Nicks and Richard Pryor

961
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:00,990
And like, Timmy Baker, like, she's really cool, you know

962
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:03,190
And like, she had me some really neat makeup

963
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:05,110
And, uh, Jerry Lee Lewis

964
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:08,010
And like, boy, was there a lot of shaking going on there

965
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:10,650
And, uh, and Julie from the Love Boat

966
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,730
And, uh, she's not the perky anymore

967
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:15,310
But, like, other people are, like, really cool

968
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:17,010
And, like, now I feel like water's the limit

969
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:17,010


970
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:17,010


971
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:17,010


972
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:17,010


973
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:17,690
And, uh, I'm a little bit more of a fan of them, you know

974
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:19,590
And, like, thanks to you, dealer of the crack

975
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:22,030
Like, I host Flebrity, too

976
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:35,750
And now the people of South Africa would like to thank Paul Simon for his efforts

977
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:41,050
Okay, boys and girls, one, two, three, ah

978
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:43,190
Oh

979
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:47,590
Oh

980
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:47,890
Oh

981
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:57,510
And all darkness, my old friend

982
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:58,390
Oh

983
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:03,730
I've come to talk with you again

984
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:04,710
Oh

985
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:11,110
Because a vision softly creeps

986
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:12,150
Oh

987
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:14,850
Left in me

988
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:16,050
Oh, holla

989
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:16,490
Oh

990
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:20,130
Oh

991
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:20,130


992
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:20,770
Oh

993
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:20,890
Oh

994
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:21,150
Oh

995
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:21,370
Oh

996
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:28,630
This is KNOA 90.9 FM Dallas

997
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:29,670
I'm Robert Wisdom

998
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:31,030
And this is the American Music Party

999
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,850
That is 89.3

1000
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:35,490
Dallas

1001
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:38,430
Such is the

01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:41,750
Okay, tonight is, uh, Instrumental Night

1003
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:45,610
I believe this is show number, uh, 22

1004
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:46,710
or something like that.

1005
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,550
Or one by Ace Cannon.
