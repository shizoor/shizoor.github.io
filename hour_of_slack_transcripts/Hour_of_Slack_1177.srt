1
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,540
I don't need to tell you how critical this is.

2
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,700
Hometown, pay-per-view, the eyes of the media.

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,540
Here's what I need.

4
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,080
It should be lengthy enough to seem substantial,

5
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,300
yet concise enough to feel breezy.

6
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,380
It should be serious, but with a slight wink.

7
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,680
It should lay out a new course of action,

8
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,620
but one that can change direction at any moment.

9
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,740
If you must mention facts and figures, don't do so directly.

10
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:04,720
The general thrust should remain embedded in one's mind forever,

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,380
but specific words should be forgotten the moment they are heard.

12
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,060
It should contain nothing that can't be confirmed or denied.

13
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,480
It should be on my desk Friday morning.

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,660
I got a funny feeling in my stomach.

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,520
I'm coming.

16
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,900
Oh, it's you.

17
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,140
Have you ever driven a Stangalini?

18
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,460
How many times I gotta tell you to stay away from me?

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,360
Did you say you'd always wanted to drive a Stangalini?

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,100
Shut up! Shut up, I tell you!

21
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,660
Will you shut up?

22
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,420
Hi, it's Pat Paulson.

23
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,140
I just want to say that I endorse Bob as my running mate in this year's election,

24
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,400
and this is the hour of slap.

25
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,240
In Dallas, Texas. You know, I know where that is.

26
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,180
So much time, so little to do.

27
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,480
Um, I suspect it might be something similar.

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,720
My old man was a bread stasher all his life.

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,420
He never got fast.

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,060
He wound up with a used car, a 17-inch screen and arthritis.

31
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,540
Tamari is a drag man. Tamari is a king-size bust.

32
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,400
BOOM!

33
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,440
They cry,

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,160

Are

we

97
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,480
but people

98
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,120
live

99
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,580
l

100
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:16,820
live

101
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:16,980
we

102
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,800
on

103
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,440
has

104
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,200
the

105
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:26,980


106
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,140
I'm gonna add some bottom, so that the dancer just won't hide.

107
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:47,200
I'm gonna add a little bit of top, and make it easy to move your feet.

108
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

109
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

110
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,120
Else I shall deal you.

111
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,320
I'm your host, Bob. I'm your host, Bob.

112
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,040
Yeah, hi, Bob. It's always a pleasure to be on with you, Bob.

113
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:46,680
Put it in a nutshell, there is copious, specific evidence that the Bush regime has been engaging in massive election fraud systematically since 2000.

114
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,080
The last two presidential elections were stolen.

115
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,920
Loser take all. Let's call it what it is, this conspiracy.

116
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,660
Okay.

117
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,120
Okay.

118
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,740
Hello?

119
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:05,200
Somebody needs to point out to all of us that 50 to 75 percent of fertilized eggs naturally do not make it.

120
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,080
They do not make it. Bad mutations get weeded out.

121
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,940
Put it in a nutshell.

122
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,100
And a nutshell is where we must put it, dear friends.

123
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,180
Because it's the Sunday before the election where we are in time.

124
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,260
Shalloween.

125
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,540
But our listeners, however, are in the present.

126
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,860
So we have to pretend that the election already happened.

127
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,260
Can we still smell him?

128
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,040
Hail the Chief.

129
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,080
Hail the Chief.

130
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,020
Hail the Chief.

131
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,020


132
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,020


133
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,440
Hail Chief.

134
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,360
Chief McCain.

135
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,180
Can we smell him from here?

136
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:37,860
No.

137
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:37,920
No.

138
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,000
You bet.

139
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,400
Shh.

140
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,280
Remember, it's after the election.

141
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,640
My friends.

142
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,820
We have to say the right thing.

143
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,040
We have to be very careful now.

144
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,760
I'm trying to get off cue here.

145
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:55,640
Oh, my friends, I'd just like to thank the American pubish for the rock examiner and the American pubish.

146
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:55,640


147
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:55,640


148
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:55,640


149
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:55,640


150
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:55,640


151
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:55,640


152
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:55,640


153
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:55,640


154
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,620
I'm going to go to the delightful suitcase that I, my wife took back to Arizona.

155
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:15,680
And I just want to say that Joe the, the, the mongoose and Tim the dealer and also Frank the Hippocrat, as well as waiting for the electrician and all my other plumbing friends are going to be along with G. Gordon Gordon.

156
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,600
Or no, that's G. Gordon Liddy.

157
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,840
And we're going to be doing some Wallstream plumbing at the old Watergate once again.

158
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,860
Ha, ha, ha.

159
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,300
What?

160
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,680
That was from, that was from the Keating Six.

161
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,540
But I heard that Oz Goosemaster was actually the write-in king of our presidency this year.

162
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,460
Oz Goosemaster?

163
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,320
Among other many names that we've forgotten, there was a Filbert hoax design cathedral.

164
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,660
Oh, that's right.

165
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,760
There were other people that were running for president.

166
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,220
The Malacutioner, the ex-Bark woman.

167
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,700
There were, there were so many people running and, you know, they were sprinting.

168
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,900
But those last few days.

169
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,840
That's the last time that'll happen.

170
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,360
That's the last time that'll ever happen.

171
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:54,860
Yep.

172
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,460
They may lose more than their heads in the recent encumbering, you know what I'm saying?

173
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,960
Now that McMahon is president.

174
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,960
McMayus.

175
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,340
So I had heard that.

176
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:06,900
The McMahon.

177
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,720
The McMahon.

178
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,800
The Mcwoman.

179
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,540
Well, that's the thing.

180
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,200
I mean, once the, the one day after the inauguration, the mysteriously timed heart attack hits.

181
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,100
And it will be, and then it's president, pale in.

182
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,480
Doggone it.

183
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,780
Doggone it.

184
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,260
Now.

185
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,920
You do paling now.

186
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,000
No.

187
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,520
No.

188
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,120
Dave, you told me that you read on the internet.

189
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,240
No, a friend of yours.

190
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Someone you were talking to, you told me, told you that he had read on the internet proof

191
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,040
that Obama was not only a Muslim.

192
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,600
Yes.

193
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,100
But that he was also a Zionist.

194
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,240
Yes.

195
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,020
Which you don't usually, we don't usually run into the.

196
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,080
Yes.

197
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,280
Muslim Zionists.

198
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,480
That's three great tastes in one.

199
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,120
If you know, if you're coming at the world from that angle, which is a definitely a side

200
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,420
cake.

201
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,080
Can you think of the, can you imagine such a Zionist Muslim Illuminati?

202
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,140
That's the whole thing, man.

203
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,740
They hide the truth right out in the open.

204
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,200
Well, and then it looks like a paradox.

205
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,020
It looks like two things at once.

206
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,080
That's to train your brain into the finordship of accepting absurdity.

207
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,260
Yes.

208
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:20,980
Well, think of anything.

209
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,960
Think of the N-gram part of it.

210
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,780
If you look at Osama bin Laden, I mean, no.

211
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,480
Oh, that's right.

212
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:27,840
Yeah.

213
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,360
If you look at Obama.

214
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:28,880
The signs.

215
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,820
The Obama's.

216
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,680
Obama, Biden signs.

217
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,200
Biden's.

218
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,780
If you subtract and add just a few choice letters, words, and alphabets, it comes out

219
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,580
as Osama bin Laden.

220
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,180
Right.

221
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:40,600
Yeah.

222
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:48,260
You just take a white out to Obama and change the B to an S. And then Biden, all you have

223
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,960
to do is, well, spread the I from the L.

224
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:50,960


225
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,100
Spread the I from the D and then add a whole bunch of letters.

226
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,640
And L.

227
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,420
Yeah.

228
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,380
If you do it the old Muslim way, you can take the vowel sounds right out.

229
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,900
You can create your own vowel movements.

230
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,060
Why don't they just write it in Arabic?

231
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:01,660
Yeah.

232
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,500
Backwards.

233
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,660
Just like, yeah, why don't they just call God Allah like they do, having their own language

234
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,080
and stuff.

235
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,400
Why do they do that, Stang?

236
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,060
Well, I can't tell you why.

237
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,680
We use the word God.

238
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,940
Because they won't let me.

239
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,480
God's in him.

240
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,960
They'd put me in jail if I told you why.

241
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,000
He can't tell you.

242
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,920
He never want to tell you, Stang.

243
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,680
He's behind you right now.

244
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:20,820
Look.

245
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:20,940
He's behind you.

246
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,180
He's making the me-me-me-me face.

247
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:22,460
I can't.

248
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,500
Put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put.

249
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,400
More.

250
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,440
More.

251
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:26,800
More.

252
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,020


253
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,080
You got, I can hear both of you guys equally.

254
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,580
I can hear you equally well.

255
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,440
I can hear you.

256
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,220
We actually sounds like she's on mic even.

257
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,600
This, this, Francis, it's a time of change.

258
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,880
Yes, change.

259
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,000
A beautiful place we've come to these last few days, hoping for slack, and look what

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,600
we've found.

261
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,900
A beautiful studio that was formerly the detritus of WCP and another station which emerged with

262
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:50,920
a new name.

263
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:50,920


264
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:50,920


265
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:50,920


266
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:50,920


267
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:50,920


268
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,580
With another st-

269
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,220
You're saying this, you recognize this building.

270
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,440
You've been in here before when it was-

271
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:56,820
It's not new, is it?

272
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,360
I think, is it a new building?

273
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,700
It's the goat, it's a haunted station.

274
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,560
Or is he just having deja vu?

275
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,800
It is a goat station.

276
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,560
Friends, it's so shiny and futuristic in here.

277
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,680
So blue.

278
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,560
Yes, and the walls are unmarked by band stickers.

279
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,220
We'll change that in no time.

280
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,900
Yeah, bad graffiti.

281
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,180
There's not a single Dobbs head in this radio station.

282
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:17,560
Really?

283
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,920
Not at all.

284
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,540
So shiny.

285
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,460
Clean.

286
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,320
No scrawls.

287
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,480
Everywhere.

288
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,200
No scrawls.

289
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,680
No graffitos.

290
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,820
It smells all like a new car.

291
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,340
Like fresh paint.

292
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:27,700
Yeah.

293
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,660
It has that new car smell here, and because it's a new regime, we're starting into a time

294
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,600
of change.

295
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:35,780
Change.

296
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,160
Spare change.

297
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,400
The 21st century will be a time of reversal of the max.

298
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,960
You ought to run for president, Dave.

299
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,820
You have that sort of leadership quality.

300
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,800
You mean like-

301
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:50,920
Funny.

302
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:50,920


303
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:50,920


304
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:50,920


305
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:50,920


306
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:50,920


307
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:50,920


308
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:50,920


309
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:50,920


310
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:50,920


311
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:50,920


312
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,060
I agree.

313
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,060


314
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,180
Fundamental main street.

315
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,140
Depravity.

316
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,660
Joe the plunger.

317
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,220
Desire to take money from others.

318
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,160
A will for power for its own sake.

319
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:09,920
A hope, a grand vision for not only you, my fellow citizens, but also the charmed ducks

320
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,080
and bees that have been gathered here before me at this beautiful place.

321
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,600
I don't know if someone referred to it as a reformed school or a home for wayward hoafs.

322
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,500
I know it's really the Silatorium.

323
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,340
I'm sorry, am I reading off the wrong page?

324
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,020
Why are you looking at me?

325
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,600
I'm not the only person here.

326
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,920
Are you?

327
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,360
Am I?

328
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,900
Are you?

329
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,160
What?

330
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,260
All of the posts on the internet are about you.

331
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,280
Signposts flashing by.

332
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,420
Everything bad they said on the internet was about you.

333
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:49,820
About you.

334
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,680
Just as you suspected.

335
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,500
Are you paranoid, Mr. Listless?

336
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,900
You've been here only a few minutes and yet you say we've kept you for hours.

337
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,360
Is there something wrong, Mr. Listless?

338
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,940
You can't seem to relax.

339
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,380
Come, come, Mr. Listless.

340
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,660
You need to cooperate.

341
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,680
We can get this over much sooner.

342
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,360
You can get back to your family and kids.

343
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,360
Just tell us everything we want to know.

344
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,180
Janet, how long has he been like this?

345
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,040
Oh, I can't even begin to remember.

346
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,620
It's just seems like it's been forever.

347
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,140
Well, they made sure you couldn't remember.

348
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,500
None of us can.

349
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,800
But if we could, we'd probably end up like this guy.

350
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,220
Poor sap.

351
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:32,900
In trouble.

352
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,500
Now, come on, Mr. Listless.

353
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,100
So suckerel.

354
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,240
Mr. Listless, if you'll just cooperate and tell us the other names.

355
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,900
Listen, I know how to do this.

356
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,400
Get out of my-

357
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,040
Of the other voters.

358
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,360
The other dead voters.

359
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,560
I know how to handle this.

360
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:45,860
Listless!

361
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,160
Hey!

362
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,900
Listless!

363
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,240
Watch it!

364
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:48,800
Listless!

365
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,880
Snap to it.

366
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,200
Careful.

367
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,240
We need the names of the other, other voters.

368
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,520
Now, you know what I'm talking about.

369
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,840
Other, other voters, man?

370
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,320
I don't know what you mean, man.

371
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,920
You know, the vessels.

372
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,460
The vessels!

373
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,120
Listless!

374
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,480
Talk with him.

375
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:01,480


376
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:01,480


377
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,520
Now, now, Dave, that bad cop act isn't going to get anywhere.

378
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,100
Look, Mr. Listless, I can keep Dave from hitting you again if you can just-

379
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,960
I don't know if you're going to get over it.

380
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,600
I mean, I don't like this any more than you do.

381
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:11,840
Stop me.

382
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,000
Frankly, I voted for the other guy.

383
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,100
Just let me have a few minutes with him alone.

384
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,020
That's all I want to do.

385
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,360
Well, now, Dave, now you know what-

386
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,080
Please, please.

387
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,280
Dave, you need to back down now.

388
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,920
Who, who, what other voters?

389
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,580
Now, look, Mr. Listless, we read on the internet your post that claimed that you

390
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,780
had proof that you read on the internet that John McCain was actually born in Panama and

391
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:42,520
was not eligible to be the new Fuhrer.

392
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,820
You also claimed that he had raped-

393
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,380
What?

394
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,620
Barack Obama and given him AIDS.

395
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,940
You claimed also that Palin works for the Russian Jews and that-

396
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,820
Let me see if I'm reading this right.

397
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,100
Listen, listen, she's a double KGP for crying out loud.

398
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:01,720
Stand back.

399
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,040
Stand right there.

400
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,980
You said that the Jews are taking over Israel.

401
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,320
Did you say this, Mr. Listless?

402
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,480
Did you claim that the Jewish people are taking over Israel?

403
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,720
I can't remember anything.

404
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,780
And why are all the posts on the internet about you?

405
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,360
Listen, I want to know about McCain's-

406
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,360


407
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,360


408
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,360


409
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,360


410
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,360


411
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,360


412
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,360


413
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,360


414
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,360


415
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,420
I can't remember anything.

416
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:17,420


417
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:17,420


418
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:17,420


419
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,040
You clearly have no idea what it takes to be an alien vessel, just like John Henkley.

420
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,180
You sure you don't know who the other, other, other voters are, man?

421
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:37,440
Now look, Mr. Listless, you claim that the last president in office who actually broached

422
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,180
the subject of the aliens, the so-called aliens from outer space, was President Reagan when

423
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,820
he-

424
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,240
Not President FitzWater.

425
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,340
Oh, okay, okay.

426
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:57,000
Right after they bring these guys, you know, after these guys get elected, that first day in the office, they take them into the secret room behind the Oval Office and tell them what's really going on.

427
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:11,300
And, of course, from that moment on, your president-elect has a few more gray hairs and a more worried look and generally is a bit more presidential and a little more inclined to go along with the plan.

428
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,740
He likes to stoop.

429
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,200
They call him the President Eloy.

430
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:29,720
You'll notice that since Reagan, he had to teach, he got to talking about how what if the aliens from another planet came and we had to join together with the Russians and the Chinese and fight against them.

431
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,120
Why, we'd all be one race together.

432
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,080
One big happy family.

433
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,100
Yeah, one race.

434
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,120
The human race.

435
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,960
The human race.

436
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,820
Not a bunch of appliances for aliens.

437
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,400
As soon as Reagan started talking that way, they sent Hinckley after him.

438
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,160
I want Adam.

439
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,180
And Reagan.

440
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,740
And ever since then, none of the presidents have talked about the aliens in quite that same way.

441
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:58,880
Now, Jimmy Carter said he saw the planet Venus abduct him and brainwash him and probe him and fly away.

442
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,300
But aside from that, and look what happened to poor Carter.

443
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,840
Aside from that, since then, they've been too smart to mention that stuff they tell you in that first hour.

444
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,380
Stay with me, Adam.

445
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,720
No, no, come on now.

446
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,560
Don't leave any marks.

447
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,500
Mr. Leslis.

448
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,920
Look, we're trying not to leave any marks on you.

449
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,640
You already broke my nose.

450
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,680
Oh, God, this is ridiculous.

451
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,320
What is going to happen?

452
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,220
I don't know about any alien other voters.

453
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,100
What is going to happen?

454
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,540
How much more of this violence going on here?

455
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,240
Oh, I know one thing that's going to happen.

456
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,900
What's going to happen?

457
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,760
I have to give a little bit of credit.

458
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,840
Credit?

459
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,360
Where it's due.

460
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:35,840
Yes.

461
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,500
All the beginning was cut up by Lemur.

462
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,640
Except there's a little bit of music.

463
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:54,540
Fur Bob, which sounded like ancient Mark Mothers Bob doing sample Bob music of a classical variety.

464
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,760
That was by The Large.

465
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,860
There were two clips from a movie called Schizopolis, which is great for clips.

466
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:07,700
The Ren and Stimpy promo for Hour of Slack was real, as was the Pat Paulson one.

467
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,760
Pat Paulson was a Bob supporter.

468
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,620
You know, he ran for president every four years from 19...

469
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,160
1968 to 1996.

470
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,340
I remember the blue suit he used to wear.

471
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:17,480
And he won.

472
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,340
Me too.

473
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,140
In 1992.

474
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,540
Oh, Pat Paulson?

475
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:20,780
Yeah.

476
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,300
But Clinton stole the election.

477
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,320
Was that Clinton or was that George won?

478
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,160
I can't remember.

479
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,160
What about Fatang Fatang Limbin in the historian park?

480
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,220
Well, that's the thing.

481
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,540
They bury all these people, literally, with frozen sticks and pieces of mud.

482
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,980
As if it weren't enough to have to crawl in the library basement to find out their names to begin with.

483
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,400
For the love of...

484
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,100
No, I'm staying.

485
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,200
We must do something to preserve our respubics.

486
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,720
Our republic, we must...

487
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,640
Sorry.

488
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,120
We need to call that reporter Woodward.

489
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,540
He'll straighten things out.

490
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,300
Oh, Woody, man.

491
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,080
He was stiff and hard with those guys.

492
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,060
Especially, what's his name?

493
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,640
No Throat?

494
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,000
The guy that had part of his...

495
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,140
No Throat.

496
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,600
Oh, yeah.

497
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,000
That's right.

498
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,880
The secret guy.

499
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,200
Yeah, the alien that had actually no throat, man.

500
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,100
That was quite a clever takeoff on, you know, Deep Throat back in the old Watergump era.

501
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,460
And when that...

502
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,960
I was only five years old when Watergate sprang.

503
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,380
A leak.

504
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,540
No, you weren't.

505
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,320
I was 45?

506
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,100
Yeah.

507
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,940
I was...

508
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,000
23, right?

509
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:20,860
Yeah.

510
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:26,180
I was hitchhiking, just leaving the country when Watergate sprung that leak.

511
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,700
Can I ask you one important...

512
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,280
Can I ask...

513
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,600
Watergate.

514
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,380
Watergate.

515
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,880
Watergate.

516
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,420
Can I ask you one very important question?

517
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,000
Try.

518
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,160
Why...

519
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,840
I forgot.

520
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,380
Never mind.

521
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:39,940
Okay.

522
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,840
This background music is by Ogo Dip.

523
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,160
Yes.

524
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,680
This CD's been sitting around my house unlisted to until yesterday.

525
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,540
And Princess, we and I decided...

526
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,680
We decided this was up the hour of Slack Alley.

527
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,540
Yeah, man.

528
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,200
Das Deutsche Reich ist eine Goberschnack.

529
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,940
Und mit diesen Freunden...

530
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,860
Und mit diesen Freunden.

531
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,280
Well, we'll be playing that whole song next time.

532
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,800
Ogo Dip is from Sweden.

533
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:26,420
Actually, this is Swedish music, although it's in sort of cartoon English.

534
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,100
Sweden!

535
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,140
All material composed, arranged, produced, sequenced, performed, and blah, blah, blah,

536
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,840
by Magnus Lundberg.

537
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,260
They sound like smashed up Viking gazole.

538
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,060
You know, like someone's been beating them around the anthrax with a medulla avant-garde

539
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,440
stick.

540
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,360
I hate...

541
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,800
I hate Viking rock.

542
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,100
Oh, and speaking of music, that amazing cut-up...

543
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,180
Vagmara!

544
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:52,140
Just before we started cutting up, there was an incredible mash-up.

545
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,340
That was by Girl Talk, and we're going to be playing lots more Girl Talk.

546
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,720
My son turned me on to Girl Talk.

547
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,500
You can wiki Girl Talk, and you'll learn some interesting things.

548
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:10,360
Like some subgeniuses ask their nasal passages suitable for sexual orifices?

549
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,480
That's not the only reason they do it, Dave.

550
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:12,960


551
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,740
But, um...

552
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,000
But...

553
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,340
Why would they cry to the clouds with their noses?

554
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,900
That's an ancient trick, man.

555
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,400
I say this in a butt-sick way.

556
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,620
I say this butt-sickly.

557
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,840
But we have but a few...

558
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,640
Well about five minutes worth of stuff here.

559
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,940
Can I kill we first for not talking?

560
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,640
No, you can do that while...

561
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,200
Oh look, there's the light.

562
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,760
But I don't want to die!

563
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,520
There's the light, okay.

564
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,040
I've been watching it.

565
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,900
I've been watching it.

566
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,720
I've been watching it.

567
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,500
I've been watching it.

568
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,160
Listen, listen, Dave.

569
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,100
I watched it.

570
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,200
I watched it.

571
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,200


572
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,220
Shut up.

573
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:43,900
I'm out!

574
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,520
You're on the wrong phone.

575
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,260
Pick up the phone, woman.

576
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,020
I just broke the headphones.

577
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,980
I broke the intercom and the headphones.

578
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,620
Stang, we're in a whole new situation now.

579
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,860
We're in a world of hurry.

580
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,660
In a beautiful new studio.

581
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,040
There's plenty of really, really good headphones here.

582
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,240
I can't believe this.

583
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,380
I really broke the headphones.

584
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,480
Not like the old stations.

585
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:00,780
Seemly.

586
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,840
You will be blamed.

587
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:01,900
I completely...

588
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,440
I can't hear myself.

589
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,620
But it doesn't mean you won't be able to find a brand new pair of delicious...

590
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:06,800
Okay.

591
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,320
Shut up!

592
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,520
I just turned it off.

593
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,900
I just turned you guys off.

594
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,480
I'm sorry.

595
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,360
I'm going to now do what I should have done so long, long ago.

596
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,740
Because I don't know what's going to happen.

597
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,000
Uh, um, what's going to happen?

598
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,760
Uh, I say that the banks will have the woman that will be human.

599
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,540
This is the most net and economic more than could be power.

600
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,100
So big dollar power.

601
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,940
Thank you!

602
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,880
Now's not the time for confidence.

603
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,960
Now is the time for panic and fear.

604
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,560
Now's not the time for steady leadership.

605
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,920
We can come together to restore fear in the American economy.

606
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:53,700
We can renew that panic that in America our destiny is not written by us.

607
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,900
Hold on one second.

608
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,620
I can't hear myself.

609
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,820
I'm not in office!

610
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,700
I'm still in office!

611
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,160
Oh, no!

612
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,480
Hi, this is Pat Paulson.

613
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,480
I'd like to endorse Bob as my running mate in this year's election.

614
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,520
Bob's a lot of...

615
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,380
Well, he's not fun.

616
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:11,480
He's a lot of fun.

617
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:11,480


618
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:11,480


619
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:11,480


620
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:11,480


621
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:11,480


622
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,360
But anyway, this is the hour of slack in Dallas, Texas.

623
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,820
You know, hour...

624
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,720
Boy, my shoes got cow stuff on them.

625
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,240
From PR News in Washington, I'm falling down over the weekend.

626
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,660
GOP nominee John McCain says,

627
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,720
I'm going to make doo-doo.

628
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,520
We're not pro-American.

629
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,480
We all anti-America.

630
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:40,160
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke says lower prices reflect declining demand for PR News from Washington.

631
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,420
Introduce a little anarchy.

632
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,060
Upset the established order and everything becomes chaos.

633
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,980
I'm an agent of chaos.

634
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,400
Oh, and you know the thing about chaos?

635
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,000
It's fear.

636
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,480
But every few years they change the flavor.

637
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,480
This one's all about...

638
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,520
It's about...

639
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,340
It's about the decline and fall.

640
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,580
Fall down, baby.

641
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,680
Decline and fall.

642
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,100
Fall way down now.

643
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,100
Decline and fall.

644
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,460
Fall down, baby.

645
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:41,840
Decline and fall.

646
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:41,840


647
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:41,840


648
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,280
Come on, little mama.

649
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,460
Decline and fall.

650
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,700
Decline and fall.

651
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:46,920
Fall.

652
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:59,300
Give a man a free ticket on a dead-end ride.

653
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,920
He'll climb into the back even though nobody's driving.

654
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,220
Too goddamn lazy to crawl out of a wreck.

655
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,400
And he'll rock while he waits for the weather.

656
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:11,440
And the weather's not right.

657
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:11,440


658
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:11,440


659
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:11,440


660
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,220
Self-fair check, going to hell in a handbag.

661
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:21,120
Can't you see I ain't gonna eat no government cheese?

662
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,160
Ain't no government cheese.

663
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,300
No, thank you, Mr. Bush, no government cheese.

664
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,580
Ain't gonna eat your government cheese.

665
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,820
Thank you.

666
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,080
Thank you.

667
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,640
Thank you.

668
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,940
That's terrible. I never saw anything like that in my life.

669
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:49,980
Terrible, terrible.

670
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:55,580
Perfect.

671
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,680
Oh, yeah?

672
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,540
Ain't gonna eat, me ain't gonna eat, mine ain't gonna eat, mo.

673
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,000
Ain't gonna eat, me ain't gonna eat, mine ain't gonna eat, mo.

674
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,820
Made in the night, made in reality.

675
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,280
Don't call it a comeback.

676
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,000
Made in the night, made in reality.

677
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,420
Don't call it a comeback.

678
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,280
Face.

679
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:40,840
Hey.

680
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,020
J-Wayne!

681
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,680
Drop, drop, drop

682
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,880
How do you do?

683
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,520
Come on!

684
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,900
My eyes are sure, being a senator

685
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,360
Behind closed doors, hitting truth to the seafloor

686
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,480
The rich don't know us, ignore the tug of war

687
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,860
While the kids are poor, open door and better drugstore

688
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,500
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more

689
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,660
I'ma reveal everything, change the law

690
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,500
I find myself, walking the streets

691
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,560
Trying to find what's really going on in your streets

692
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,340
Yeah, you're a superstar

693
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,080
That is what you are

694
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,200
Coming from afar

695
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,800
Reaching for the stars

696
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,960
Run away with me

697
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,400
To another place

698
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,540
Can we lie on each other?

699
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,620
Uh-huh

700
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,880
Look, yeah, I'm a superstar

701
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,940
Like this

702
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,500
You're giving love instinctively

703
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,480
Like this

704
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,580
Like this

705
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,140
Woo!

706
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:00,760
Like this

707
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,980
Look, yeah, I'm a superstar

708
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,260
Like this

709
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,600
You're giving love instinctively

710
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,460
Like this

711
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,740
Like this

712
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:08,940
Woo!

713
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,000
Woo!

714
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,600
Tell me if you want it

715
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,020
Like this

716
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,140
Like this

717
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,680
Like this

718
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,600
Like this

719
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,400
Baby, I'm like this

720
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,580
Like this

721
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,620
Like this

722
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,820
Like this

723
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,300
I love you

724
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,140
Like this

725
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,280
Like things

726
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,080
I really do

727
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:25,160
There it is.

728
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,500
Yeah.

729
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,360
Yeah.

730
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,460
That was girl talk.

731
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,000
Yeah.

732
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:33,160
We mastered the problem, yes.

733
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,620
The embarrassing personal problem.

734
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,460
We had to go off the air for that.

735
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm sorry.

736
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,800
So much better now.

737
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:47,120
Unfortunately, the problem was that you refused to realize it was in your own mind, Stan.

738
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,860
Yet created the problem, and look at you now.

739
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,220
You're dripping with sweat.

740
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,120
I can't find my mind.

741
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,300
You're blue, and the very tips of your fingers are covered with blood.

742
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:57,920
My mind.

743
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,780
You've been scratching your old sores, haven't you?

744
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,720
It's not my mind.

745
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,180
It's not your mind that's bothering you.

746
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,360
Your mind is controlled by a vast, vast source in distant space.

747
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,540
They're whispering commands into your nostril right now.

748
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,240
That would explain a lot.

749
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:17,320
In fact, your nasal passages are quite sufficient for sexual olfactories.

750
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,280
I mean, sexual olfactories.

751
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,280
Okay, can we do that one again?

752
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,980
I don't want to go there.

753
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,340
Okay, let's not go there.

754
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,840
Let's go.

755
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,900
Somewhere nice and pleasant.

756
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,660
Like the obituaries.

757
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,820
Yeah, the obituaries.

758
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,660
The obituaries.

759
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,820
Dave, did you know that Rudy Ray Moore, the great comedian, died?

760
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,900
No, I did not know he passed under this.

761
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,040
Yes, he passed away.

762
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:51,760
Best known for his roles in As the King of Party Records, doing the character Dolomite.

763
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,220
Dolomite.

764
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,700
He also produced some what you might call blaxploitation films.

765
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:02,160
About Dolomite, The Human Tornado, Petey Wheatstraw, The Devil's Son-in-Law.

766
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,840
Petey Wheatstraw, The Devil's Son-in-Law.

767
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:11,420
And he was born in 1927 on a crossroads in Fort Smith, Arkansas.

768
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,980
He also grew up in Cleveland, Ohio.

769
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,100
I did not know that.

770
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,860
Very much like Screamin' Jay Hawkins.

771
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,800
There is a strong tradition here, but few know of it.

772
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:26,780
Rudy Ray Moore's albums include such classics that we can't play even on this station.

773
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,080
No, it's not.

774
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,260
It's not.

775
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:27,280
It's not.

776
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:27,280


777
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:27,280


778
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:36,560
Such as Eat Out More Often, This Pussy Belongs to Me, Return of Dolomite, and a timely one,

779
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:41,640
Dolomite for President, which if I could have dug through my record collection, I probably

780
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,380
should have pulled that one out because I think he doesn't cuss on Dolomite for President.

781
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,760
Although maybe I'm thinking of a Dolomite Christmas.

782
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,760
We could have let him won in this dimension that we're in.

783
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:57,200
This time suspended dimension suspension bridge where one way or the other.

784
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:57,700
We're going to.

785
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,340
I don't think it's.

786
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,360
I don't have a cell phone.

787
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:00,920
I think.

788
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,360
How about a smell phone?

789
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,120
What are you hearing the cell phone to?

790
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,920
No, it's that thing there.

791
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,240
But I'm not going to mess with it.

792
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,900
But it's it's going through a computer.

793
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,360
I thought it was now station.

794
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,520
It's barking that you that you have to put the drizzle on it.

795
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,180
The sugar content is very high.

796
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,960
Oh, just like you are right now.

797
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,460
I see.

798
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,480
And to some people, but not all of us.

799
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:26,220
Now, in further bits, as we say goodbye to the great Rudy Ray Moore.

800
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,280
Dolomite.

801
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,720
Ima Sumac died yesterday.

802
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,120
Oh, yes, she did.

803
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,720
The great Ima Sumac died at the age of 86.

804
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,980
She was born in 1922 in Peru.

805
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,140
I'm sorry.

806
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,220
I used to think that Ima Sumac was a made up name.

807
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,960
And she was really somebody from Brooklyn.

808
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,580
But that's not true.

809
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,520
No, it isn't true.

810
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,680
She's part of the girl.

811
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,580
She really was from Peru.

812
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,200
Peru.

813
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,300
And her real name was Zoila Augusta.

814
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,320
Esperatriz.

815
00:34:59,320 --> 00:34:59,840
Esperatriz.

816
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:00,900
Esperatriz.

817
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,660
Esperatriz.

818
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:02,760
Esperatriz.

819
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,540
Chavarri del Castillo.

820
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,360
Del Castillo.

821
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,960
So she was Zoila del Castillo was her real name.

822
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,820
Wasn't that something?

823
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,300
Peru.

824
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,860
Just do it, bitch.

825
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:19,100
If I was better prepared, I'd be playing Ima Sumac in the background instead of the Flying Ryan Brothers.

826
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,940
Yes, the Flying Ryan Brothers.

827
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,800
Available from Ryanetics.com.

828
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,320
Now, they didn't die too, though, in this week's obituaries.

829
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,820
No, they ride.

830
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,640
They were Ryan, Ryan guys.

831
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,720
Ryanetics.

832
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,760
Well, thanks for informing me that two heroes and one heroine, I mean, have died.

833
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:40,720
Yep.

834
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:46,100
Why can't you tell me about somebody that I wish would be dead?

835
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,080
Dolomite is my name.

836
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,860
And loving up other mother lovers is my game.

837
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,940
That would be the TV version, I guess.

838
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,080
Yes.

839
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,300
Man, I wondered how you were going to do that.

840
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,640
I'm here to stake a claim in this pimpin' and hustlin' game.

841
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:08,080
Well, I don't think you want to go in the same cave where Dolomite and Ixtabay are hanging around together wearing Peruvian landscapes.

842
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,740
You know what I'm saying?

843
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,300
Doing the old,

844
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:09,900
Alpaca!

845
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,900
I was, no, I wouldn't.

846
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,660
They probably wouldn't let me into the same heaven that Dolomite and Ima Sumac are in.

847
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,560
They would dress you like a saffron robe glamour.

848
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,920
Dolomite's probably doing Ima Sumac right now.

849
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,240
Yeah.

850
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,580
I would say he's been waiting most of that previous time.

851
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:23,920
Just, you know, I don't know.

852
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,940
I throw that singer on a velvet bed.

853
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,480
Love that girl till the girl drop dead.

854
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,720
That's another television version.

855
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,240
Dolomite kept on loving that girl without thinking.

856
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:42,700
Didn't even know the girl was dead till her parts started stinking.

857
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,400
Till her parts started stinking.

858
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,240
You see the problems here.

859
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,920
Actually, I was heavily influenced by Dolomite.

860
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,520
I heard his first party record.

861
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:01,920
I heard his first party record when I was a cub dishwasher at the Railhead restaurant in Dallas, Texas in the early 70s.

862
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:07,520
And I memorized the ABCs of love, which I can't recite.

863
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,700
I could, but I can't.

864
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,200
Not even a single letter.

865
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:17,800
The first thing we like to do when we join the club at the Cub Reporters Club is to learn the ABCs, the entire alphabet of love.

866
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,260
Of urban boasts and toasts.

867
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,160
Prison toasts.

868
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,700
He was really like a...

869
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,380
He was a signifying Movacian.

870
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:26,960
He was.

871
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,600
And that was another one of his routines, was the signifying monkey.

872
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:36,400
Well, I used a dirty word, but it wasn't as far as the FCCIA is concerned.

873
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,800
And we can all thank our lucky stones if we have any left in our pants.

874
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,820
I've tried, Stang.

875
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,180
I've tried to keep these solid members removed.

876
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:50,240
And at least not, you know, taped on the parts of my body.

877
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:51,740
Wait.

878
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,920
You didn't try hard enough.

879
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,500
What's that light coming through the window?

880
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,680
Is there a helicopter outside the window?

881
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,860
Oh, suddenly it was like a war movie, a crime movie.

882
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,720
Yeah, we were all dead.

883
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,020
It was wild, man.

884
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,400
I love this studio, don't you?

885
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:09,880
Yeah.

886
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,800
Isn't this cool?

887
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,680
I mean, we could actually make stupid dramaturg things happen that don't exist.

888
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:23,040
But if we went to the trouble, we could bring in all the little discs and MP3s.

889
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,860
We could make all kinds of sound effects.

890
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,800
And we could write scripts, even.

891
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,600
Yes, scripts.

892
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,360
Remember that?

893
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,880
My hand tape recorder doesn't work because it's actually a human hand.

894
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,500
I remember scripts.

895
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,900
Why, yes, I remember scripts.

896
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,400
Yes, you used to take OxyCramden and Lois Fazorn and all of those other lip-

897
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,420
I can't get-

898
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,380
My doctor won't give me a script now.

899
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,000
My doctor won't even let me answer me.

900
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,000
He won't answer my calls.

901
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:51,180
I call him constantly and profusely, and he's never lifting up the phone one damn time.

902
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,020
I think he's got my number.

903
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,560
I got his, you know what I'm saying?

904
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:03,800
Well, speaking of sound effects, I went to my cell phone to get some canned sound effects

905
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:10,020
and found that I'd been sent a massage from Governor Rocknar,

906
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:15,360
who says that we may announce the passing of his father on this radio show.

907
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,140
So I think I just did that.

908
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,520
Well, that's right, since we're doing obituaries.

909
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,440
The obituaries, yes.

910
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,860
And he must be listening.

911
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,020
Dad, right?

912
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:32,060
Governor Rocknar is up there trying to out-cuss Dolomite and to out-yodel Ima Sumac.

913
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:32,900
Yep.

914
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,260
And they're trying to out-whatever Dr. Rocknar did, the elder.

915
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,040
Or is it undue?

916
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,340
Oh, I don't know.

917
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,860
We'll have to find out.

918
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,300
I don't know.

919
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,140
All I know is, friends, we're all going to meet our maker someday.

920
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,400
Someday maybe.

921
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,800
In fact, our maker will-

922
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,480
Meet us.

923
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,260
He will grind us up in his big meat grinder.

924
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,100
That's why they say we're undone, because we've been overcooked.

925
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,780
If you're a pink or a human and not a subgenius,

926
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,200
your soul is pretty much identical to all the other human souls,

927
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:14,940
and your meat or soul will go into what we call the slurry with all the other souls.

928
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:20,600
Whereas if you're a subgenius, an ordained, saved subgenius soul,

929
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,680
well, then your soul is plucked out.

930
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,300
And kept.

931
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,960
And cored out specially like an olive and has a little-

932
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,280
Yeah.

933
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,540
Like one of those little red things stuck into it.

934
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:28,940
That's what I was going to say.

935
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,020
Like a little olive or a little raisin taken out of the-

936
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,100
You're a special one.

937
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,180
Out of the pemmican.

938
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,780
Yes.

939
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,200
Yeah.

940
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,700
Or like caviar ripped from a pregnant trout.

941
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,480
Ah.

942
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,160
Or such like.

943
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,320
What a much better metaphor.

944
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:40,720
Yeah.

945
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,240
You're working too hard.

946
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,960
That's the way your soul ends up.

947
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,640
It's like the-

948
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,600
It's the refined condiment for connoisseurs.

949
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,640
A succulent bag of snot.

950
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,360
Yes.

951
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,260
No, that wouldn't be-

952
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,560
Boggling.

953
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:52,660
Boggling.

954
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:52,660


955
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,880
You can sell your soul to the aliens for a lot more money if you're a subgenius than

956
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,300
he can if you're just a human or a penguin or, you know, one of these normal ones.

957
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,540
Warmly, warmly worms.

958
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,040
We are now accepting high mediocrity to normal, normal men.

959
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,260
They may be pink, but their money is green, as Bob said so many times.

960
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,600
If their shoes are scuffed and their behinds are big enough for us to get around or reach

961
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,540
around, they're on board.

962
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,300
Or is that-

963
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,580
Did I read that one right?

964
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:22,740
Did I say it again?

965
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,120
On board.

966
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:24,540
Right.

967
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,480
Am I supposed to say it like that?

968
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,940
You're like, you know, the flying saucers.

969
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,200
On the water, Board of Bob.

970
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,680
You're on board.

971
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,520
I'm sorry.

972
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,020
Oh.

973
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:31,900
That's you.

974
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,940
On the water, Board of Bob.

975
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:39,340
We is having a sound effects orgasm over here.

976
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:39,480
I did.

977
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,760
I'm enjoying it.

978
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:40,820
It's all over.

979
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,660
I wish you would, sir.

980
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:42,940
I'm sorry.

981
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,820
We is all having fun in here.

982
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,800
It is.

983
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,720
It's a fun place.

984
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:52,660
I think there are subnipple messages embedded in the psychic response unit or maybe the-

985
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,120
The cork ceiling is something.

986
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,540
Here's a subliminal message, kids.

987
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,340
Now, hang on.

988
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:57,800
Great.

989
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,480
That's funny.

990
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,420
Look, nobody thinks they're a bad person.

991
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,420
Mm-hmm .

992
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:02,720
All right.

993
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,160
You know, I'm not even claiming that people always think they're doing the right thing.

994
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,600
They may know that they're doing something dishonest or insensitive or manipulative,

995
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,800
but they almost always think there's a good reason for doing it.

996
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,060
Ah.

997
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,020
They almost always think that it will turn out for the best in the end.

998
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,120
And even if it's just it turns out best for them, because by definition what's best for them is what's best.

999
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,740
Now, look, in addition, you instantly come up against a question of style.

1000
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,640
My style may be too...

1001
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,900
too, uh, uh, direct.

1002
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:29,620
Perhaps given my style, I seem more nakedly opportunistic or jerky or, uh...

1003
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,000
What was the other thing?

1004
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,220
Uh...

1005
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,080
Manipulative?

1006
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:34,300
Whatever.

1007
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,300
But really all that's happening is that I'm trying to get what I want, which is what everybody does.

1008
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,380
It's just that some of their styles are so warm or charming or sincere or otherwise phony,

1009
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,940
you don't realize they're just trying to get what they want.

1010
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,240
So you see, my transparent efforts are in a way much more honest and admirable.

1011
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,700
Why is it what you just said strikes me as a massive rationalization?

1012
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,920
Don't knock rationalization.

1013
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,540
Where would we be?

1014
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,020
We'd be without it.

1015
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,000
I don't know anyone who'd get through the day without two or three juicy rationalizations.

1016
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,060
They're more important than sex.

1017
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,280
Aw, come on, nothing's more important than sex.

1018
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,120
Oh yeah? Have you ever gone a week without a rationalization?

1019
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,760
Eh? Have you?

1020
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
I said, Monsieur...

1021
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,300
Well, have you, punk?

1022
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,640
Would you like the nice, juicy rationalization?

1023
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,820
Yes, I would. Can I have two, please?

1024
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,820
Would you like it rare, medium rare, or extra well done?

1025
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,680
Medium rare, please.

1026
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,140
Very good.

1027
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,260
Would you like the sauce au jus?

1028
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,320
Or would you like the hollandaise? Or would you like the bearnaise?

1029
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,120
Oh, hollandaise, please, please.

1030
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,820
All right, you, sir.

1031
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,760
With a little dill, would you mind?

1032
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,960
Would you like me to remove that third nostril from your face?

1033
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,260
Oh no, I really have become quite attached to it.

1034
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:40,600
I'm asking your husband. He's the man of my house, and he also wears the slippers.

1035
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,080
You, sir, Mr. Stoin.

1036
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,780
I'll have the double burger, animal style.

1037
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,220
He doesn't even care about my navel foreheads.

1038
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,100
Animal-style fries and...

1039
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,520
Well, excuse me.

1040
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,780
You have recently joined the Rosicution Unit?

1041
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,260
No, I have not.

1042
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:03,180
Have you electrocuted small birds, ducks, or other animals who argue with you?

1043
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,060
No, I have absolutely not.

1044
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:10,100
Then for you, it is the rationalization extra juicy and rarely used.

1045
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,120
Oh my goodness, I cannot stand it.

1046
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:21,780
Lonesome Cowboy Dave should be a super spy for the government, because he can talk all those other languages.

1047
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,180
He's just talking French.

1048
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:23,560
Yes.

1049
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:28,460
Yeah, but that was a French accent sting, and most of it is gibberish when you hear me do the actual speech.

1050
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,980
So I don't know how much good I'd be doing that.

1051
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,920
Oh, well, if it's good enough to fool French people.

1052
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,080
Ah, Signore, vendimi per parlare.

1053
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,580
Devo dirti una cosa.

1054
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,780
See, it kind of makes sense.

1055
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,860
See, you can do Spanish, too.

1056
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,020
Si, yo lo puedo.

1057
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,040
Oh, and Russian, like he's doing now.

1058
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,160
Gavrite paparuzzi, tovaris. Gavrite.

1059
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,560
And Italian.

1060
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,000
But that's Italian, isn't it, what you're talking about?

1061
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:52,500
Si, si, si. In Volgograd.

1062
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:52,820
In Volgograd.

1063
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,700
In Volgograd.

1064
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:54,380
In Volgograd.

1065
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,660
In Volgograd.

1066
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:56,940
In Volgograd.

1067
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,140
See, Dave could be a super spy for the new McCain regime.

1068
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,880
The new McCain regime?

1069
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,960
Because he's as traveled as the vice president, at least.

1070
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,040
Actually, more traveled.

1071
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:12,160
You've been to England, haven't you, and other foreign communist socialist places?

1072
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,120
No, I've never.

1073
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:13,780
So you could be a spy.

1074
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,420
I went to Canada, and I played in a band in London.

1075
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,280
That's about it.

1076
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,560
And I went across the border of Mexico and exposed my self.

1077
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,480
My true inner self.

1078
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:28,520
And then I was illuminated by Caswell and the Third Star Eye people.

1079
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,760
I think it was in 1979.

1080
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:38,120
And then on my recreational re-enumerment, I was named Osmart of this whole globe, daddy-o.

1081
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:38,740
Wow.

1082
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,140
So I'm kind of excited, and that's why I've gone and come and gone in my pants, so to speak.

1083
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,080
Dave.

1084
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,020
You have to be so graphic all the time.

1085
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,780
You don't have to go in your pants.

1086
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,120
Dog, got it.

1087
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,520
Did I go in my pants this year?

1088
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,100
No, you went.

1089
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,260
I already have come and gone.

1090
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:55,780
Yeah.

1091
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:56,500
Yeah.

1092
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,640
You're gone in your pants again.

1093
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,100
Do you have any more of the Vikings of Yiddish music?

1094
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:10,260
I was just looking at our internet list of internet listeners, and Mr. Listless is listening.

1095
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,980
There's a Mr. Listless?

1096
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:12,040
He's listed?

1097
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,440
Listless is listed?

1098
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:13,800
Yeah.

1099
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,740
And on this list, he is in this-

1100
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,220
I wonder how he fed.

1101
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,540
How many years?

1102
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,360
And he's in America right now.

1103
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:19,840
Right.

1104
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,580
North America.

1105
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,100
In fact, he's in the United States.

1106
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,100


1107
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,100


1108
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,100


1109
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,100


1110
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,100


1111
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,100


1112
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,120
He's not in Cleveland.

1113
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:24,380
He's not in Cleveland.

1114
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,800
There's somebody in Canada listening.

1115
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,000
All right.

1116
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,000
I suppose you-

1117
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,560
And there's somebody in ... What does DH represent?

1118
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:33,860
.

1119
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,560
DH.

1120
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,860
That's not .

1121
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,880
I think that's a sports term when you're-

1122
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,240
.

1123
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,420

00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:42,420


1129
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:42,420


1130
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:42,420


1131
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:42,420


1132
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:42,460

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:42,580

1135
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,820

00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:43,820

1143
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:03,520
You'll see them these days.

1144
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,840
You'll see them asukan employed on California's ditch.

1145
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:10,100


1146
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,820
And usually a private business does- no Mmmgggg.

1147

He just left an old commode in his backyard like it was nothing.

1152
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,540
He's not planting any pants in it.

1153
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,540
That's the guy in Austin.

1154
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:25,920
Austin?

1155
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:26,360
Yeah.

1156
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,360
Oh, boy.

1157
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,320
Yeah, there's a guy in Austin.

1158
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:29,860
Honest?

1159
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:30,400
Yeah.

1160
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:36,940
You can see where they are, and you can see the top of their house through the satellite.

1161
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:48,520
But our station hasn't got the money for the really good internet connection where you can see through the roof of the house and look down their shirt pockets.

1162
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:53,600
See what's in their shirt pocket and have the bald spot on the top of their head.

1163
00:47:54,020 --> 00:48:00,180
I think you're fooling on me and on everybody here that's trying to listen to this doggone show.

1164
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:05,600
And you're just fooling on everybody talking about that and looking through the roof and through their bald head and all that.

1165
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,440
Yes, you can.

1166
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,580
You really can see.

1167
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:16,240
The government has that stuff, and the stations that play the game right and stick to the plan.

1168
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,000
You've got to be with the plan.

1169
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,500
Stick to the plan.

1170
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:18,720
The plan.

1171
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,120
Stick to the plan.

1172
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,700
There's always the plan.

1173
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,520
Yeah, the plan.

1174
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,440
Once you deviate from the plan, then you're in nowhere.

1175
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,320
You're in no man's land, no woman's land in your case.

1176
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,380
Think about it.

1177
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:34,280
What would happen in a world where there wasn't structure and order provided by somebody?

1178
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,720
I mean, we don't have to ask who or what this is.

1179
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,100
We don't have to call it the conspiracy.

1180
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:44,940
It's a conspiracy of dunces indeed, but the thing is, somebody's doing the job.

1181
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:45,820
You know what I'm saying?

1182
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,080
What if I'm not down with the plan?

1183
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,360
They're sticking to the plan.

1184
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:53,120
Well, then it's anarchy.

1185
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:53,820
Let me, yeah.

1186
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,700
It's anarchy.

1187
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,280
That's the way it is.

1188
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,440
If you don't stick to the plan.

1189
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,100
Oh, okay.

1190
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,520
Everything breaks down.

1191
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,520
I don't want to be considered anarchist, so.

1192
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,420
Oh, for the love of God, no.

1193
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,360
Calm down, you guys.

1194
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,460
Just take this pipe.

1195
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,380
Take this pipe.

1196
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,200
There's a pipe over here.

1197
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,420
Have a sip.

1198
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,500
Oh, this is great.

1199
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:17,800
Here.

1200
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,800
Here, let me translate.

1201
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,420
You mean it.

1202
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,140
What'd you say?

1203
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,800
Only two sticks.

1204
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,080
Oh, that's not so hot.

1205
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,340
He's going to try to have them at the same time.

1206
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,060
From PR News in Washington, I'm first seen in jellyfish.

1207
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,560
Former members of the Bush administration are saying that it's okay to get exercise in small jellyfish,

1208
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,360
as long as it's on Friday.

1209
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:46,240
New federal guidelines on jellyfish are saying that Hillary Mann Leverett says,

1210
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,480
she says, he says,

1211
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:47,960
and says,

1212
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:48,620
Leverett says,

1213
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,440
and Everett says,

1214
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:56,440
there was a meltdown in small jellyfish today on fears that the widening financial crisis could touch off of PR News on Friday.

1215
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,920
PR News in Washington.

1216
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,560
Hmm?

1217
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,300
You know what I noticed?

1218
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:05,040
Nobody panics when things go according to plan.

1219
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,820
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1220
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:13,100
If tomorrow I tell the press that I'd like a gangbanger, we'll get shot.

1221
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,320
Or a truckload of soldiers will be blowing up.

1222
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,820
Nobody panics.

1223
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,940
Because it's all part of the plan.

1224
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,960
Hylian's a bust-up awful big shot.

1225
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,100
They've got assets making money dollars, hand over fist.

1226

Self-abasing, honest, walking tightrope.

00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,600
He's got a good life, he's got a nice wife.

1230
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,360
He's got a sharp knife, he's ready to cut it up.

1231
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:00,080
He's got a bullshit, he's got a think quick.

1232
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,680

How long do I have to sit in this damned water before it all comes out?

1266
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,800
You've had me here for the last three hours

1267
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,280
There's no way of changing my mind, I'll never resist

1268
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,200
I'm going with the plan

1269
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,120
The plan

1270
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:06,960
The plan

1271
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,240
The good plan

1272
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,520
The Uber plan

1273
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,020
Listen, if there was ever a plan

1274
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,560
That you wanted to go with

1275
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,380
A buxom, beautiful plan

1276
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,000
Of over 29 feet tall

1277
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,480
And 300 pounds of reekers

1278
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,840
That's a hot plan

1279
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,620
Friends, that song

1280
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,760
Was, uh, that rockin' song there

1281
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,860
That sounded kind of, uh, devonian

1282
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,400
That rockin' schluckin'

1283
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,480
Was by a band called Marvelkind

1284
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,960
And the song is called

1285
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:41,960
Slackadelic

1286
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:41,980
Slackadelic

1287
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:42,920
It's so reminiscent!

1288
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:49,760
And it, uh, our friend Reverend Toth Wilder put that on the, uh, not necessarily beautiful mutt mutated

1289
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,180
Uh, compilation album that goes with the 2008 devotional

1290
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:01,400
And, uh, that music we were playing in the first half of the show in the background was by Ogo Dis

1291
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,960
Which I wanted to spell

1292
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,820
O-G-O-D-Y-S

1293
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,160
As in dystopia

1294
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,780
I don't think he, in a...

1295
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,000
I don't know what, uh, website it is

1296
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,260
Or anything he would be on

1297
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,100
But you can find Ogo Dis

1298
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,360
On our website

1299
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,320
Later, when this show is played back and streamed

1300
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,580
From subgenius.com

1301
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,520
Yes, that is our website

1302
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,880
Subgenius.com

1303
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,440
Home of the Hour of Slack

1304
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,520
And the Church of the Subgenius

1305
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,540
And the land of the free, dammit

1306
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,140
Yes, the free party

1307
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,520
And yet to be born

1308
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:40,080
Well, I was telling Dave and Princess Wee on the way in here

1309
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,000
That, uh, Bob J. O'Neill and I, uh, are going to be on the show

1310
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,000


1311
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,000


1312
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,000


1313
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,060
But to be a part of the show

1314
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,140
That we are Bob Dobbs, our high epop of the church

1315
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:49,780
Uh, ran for a city office in Brighton, England

1316
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,280
Even though he's an American

1317
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,020
And won

1318
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,560
He defeated Fatang

1319
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,800
And then didn't show up

1320
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,000
And then didn't show up

1321
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,540
And some British subgenius had to show up wearing a glued on Bobhead mask

1322
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:01,760
And that wasn't on

1323
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,720
In order to serve

1324
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,960
To save face

1325
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,020
And they were called the free party

1326
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,900
Or as we put it, the free party party

1327
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,980
Because they put on big, free parties in British media

1328
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:11,980


1329
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,580
Brighton. But Stang, remember,

1330
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,000
our bite marked frei. And that means

1331
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,940
if you're a member of the free party, you must

1332
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,000
work. And if you want to work

1333
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,800
out the right way, just

1334
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,980
pull down your pants all the way to the

1335
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,940
booties. Not again. Look up at that

1336
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,700
galaxy off to the left there.

1337
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,080
We don't have to. The one with the drizzling

1338
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,760
eye. And

1339
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,900
point again, I said. Point! Point!

1340
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,160
Point your weight

1341
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,900
at Baltimore, which is

1342
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,980
where I'm going to have to go in two weeks

1343
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,980
for that devival. Yes?

1344
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,380
On the 15th,

1345
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,840
I have to

1346
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,960
go. And preach.

1347
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,100
And the amino acids

1348
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,280
have to go. And

1349
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,860
holler. And

1350
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,660
priestess Pisces.

1351
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,760
And Dr. Legume

1352
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,620
may show up at the last minute. And

1353
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,740
Reverend Carter LeBlanc. And Fat Free.

1354
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,500
And the motor morons.

1355
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,080
Which is one of the oldest subgenius.

1356
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,740
The motor morons were

1357
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,260
subgeniuses in like

1358
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:09,800
1980.

1359
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,660
1991. Under a different

1360
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,580
name. Severn Institute.

1361
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,540
Right. Before the Lubrolak scandal.

1362
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,680
The motor morons are

1363
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,580
named that way because

1364
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,920
they use, they actually

1365
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,760
have a bicycle and car repair

1366
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,860
shop. And they use the machinery

1367
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,680
from their shop as

1368
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,020
musical instruments. Grinders.

1369
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:30,980
I remember. Sanders.

1370
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,220
Spark makers. At the

1371
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,920
Bisexual Bicentennial.

1372
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,400
I remember all 12 of them were there.

1373
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,620
And I mistook them for angels.

1374
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,440
On high. But they were actually dead

1375
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,400
beings. Kind of like zombies. But they

1376
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,160
couldn't walk.

1377
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,120
And I think that covers.

1378
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,360
Yes. Okay. Baltimore on November 15.

1379
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,360
The pledge drive

1380
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,540
next week on the Hour of Slack.

1381
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,400
Radio Thon friends. Get your.

1382
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,680
Start saving your pennies now.

1383
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,520
Because we're. The stations

1384
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,380
are all going to need your

1385
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,380
money. It's tie time baby.

1386
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,200
This one.

1387
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,560
Tie time. So we'll be back

1388
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,480
for that. To pay for this brand

1389
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,260
new shiny spaceship

1390
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,300
like control

1391
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,380
console. And stole studio.

1392
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,320
It's just beautiful. It is wonderful.

1393
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,180
Gorgeous. It's simply

1394
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,360
wonderful. And you can't get in

1395
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,780
to pester us here. I remember Loretta.

1396
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,980
The one with the rancid left

1397
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,460
nostril. It wasn't

1398
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,080
very, very, very

1399
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,180
well made for sexual deviance.

1400
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,620
But believe me I taught her

1401
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:35,380
all I know. And I don't know

1402
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,300
very much but that's not the important part.

1403
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,980
But the important part she was a good learner.

1404
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,000
She wanted to learn the different

1405
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,060
fashion of the bonobo.

1406
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,520
The various movements.

1407
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:47,240
The skip dragging and the dancing.

1408
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,400
She was delightful in her early

1409
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,420
years. But now she's encumbered

1410
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,220
with old age and big teeth. And so

1411
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,180
I had to shoot her down

1412
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,460
the basement. A bit long in the tooth

1413
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,120
eh? Yes. In fact

1414
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,500
her whole face became elongated

1415
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,980
before we put her back there.

1416
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,300
Dave is long in

1417
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,240
the throat. But we're not long for this

1418
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,160
station because we have to get out of here.

1419
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,140
As Captain Kirk

1420
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,340
said in just about

1421
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,640
well it was eight minutes.

1422
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,240
It was eight minutes right then. Oh man you blew

1423
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,180
the shagway because we've got to go to the top again.

1424
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,640
No we're going to listen to

1425
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,100
we're going to leave with The Hunting

1426
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,060
of Bob. This is a new very

1427
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:27,020
short 50 second show

1428
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:29,160
by Lee Murr. Thank you

1429
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,100
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Princess Wee.

1430
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,700
Thank you Reverend Stang.

1431
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:34,820
He's meditating

1432
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:37,040
on his own third nostril.

1433
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,400
And now The Hunting of

1434
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,180
Bob.

1435
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,720
The Hunting of Bob.

1436
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,880
Here it comes folks. Here it comes.

1437
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,180
And now The Hunting of Bob.

1438
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:47,320
Bob.

1439
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:50,080
You talk too much Bob. You think

1440
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,080
what you want to think. Stay quiet

1441
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:52,400
Bob.

1442
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,120
Oh Bob. Here he comes Bob.

1443
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,340
What does he want?

1444
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,320
We're looking for Bob.

1445
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,260
And Bob. Then I'll

1446
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,420
kill you where you stand.

1447
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:07,760
Bob.

1448
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,140
Oh Bob. Bob what have they done?

1449
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,200
What did you do Bob? The Hunting

1450
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,280
of Bob. You've got no

1451
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,440
right to come in peace. Bob.

1452
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,280
Bob.

1453
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,720
I know I am right.

1454
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,840
No wonder. You're always

1455
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,360
right with Bob.

1456
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,300
The Hunting of Bob.

1457
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,300
Bob.

1458
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:28,800
Bob.

1459
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,020
Bob.
