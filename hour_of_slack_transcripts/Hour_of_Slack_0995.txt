When you head back to the US from a trip abroad, it's nice to bring back harmful microscopic organisms.
So please, make sure you bring back something that's prohibited, like a prohibited agricultural product or prohibited animal product,
and choose a gift that will never become a bird or animal.
But if you bring back something that's like a bird or animal product, you risk exposing the country to harmful mobs.
Please lead this upgrading process, same as any of the other methods, in a way that will şek mudar, make it harder for you to evolve.

Bob criticizes the UN
Blaming the UN for the New York Knicks
He's never looked back
As the intellectual historian John Bigg once said
Our modern culture is in fact unbearable
Even worse
That overman on a new business plan
Has led us to endless philosophers
The goal would seem to be a world
Where uncertainty and doubt aren't right again
You are listening to the subgenius radio ministry
Hour of Slack
Number 995
The tool users
Special for
WeToolSmart
The tool users
With a whole lot of Lee Moore
Like we just heard
And Norell Preff
Like we just heard before that
And a lot more
And that song
With the shotguns
Bob Squad
Was by the great groovy Neptune
And we just met the great groovy Neptune
At Tech's Day
Which was wonderful
There's some pictures at subgenius.com
And the report
It was just marvelous
And there'll be more
Of them
The great groovy Neptune
They gave us a Yeti
At the beginning of the show
We heard some Norell Preff
And some Ivan Stang
Baby Ivan Stang
Age 20
As the bozo of Bull Dada
From a sort of a weird introduction
To World of the Future of the Ancient Days
And the intro was
Lee Moore and Lee Moore
And silica gel
Remember?
And we've been getting some interesting stuff in the mail
One thing was a CD from Birmingham, Alabama
By something called Atomic Jefferson
And also from Just John
Just John is in the background
But let's check
This song here by Atomic Jefferson
At Earthlink
You'll never be alone again
And you'll never be alone again


Surfing on the net
They're watching all you see
And keeping tabs on people that you meet
They track all your movements on a cookie sheet
And have the files you download from the net
When you use encryption
They will forge your keys
And build for a forge
Your secrets that you keep
It's not all that hard for you to clearly see
The thought police are always on the beat
They're everywhere you go
And see the things you see
They have copies of your money list
And bootleg if you freeze
They know everything about you
Like your favorite kind of music

They'll send
So face it
You will never be alone again
AIM & ICQ & even IRC
Are monitored for acts against the state
Ops and bots are logging every keystroke made
From their surveillance there is no escape
On the news net groups they lurk with baited posts
To catch the perverts like Disney execs
They slip you programs to hide on your hard drive
And monitor your house for sight and sound
They're everywhere you go
And see the things you see
They have copies of your money list
And bootleg if you freeze
They know everything about you
Like your favorite kind of music
They know everything about you
And bootleg if you freeze
They know everything about you
And bootleg if you freeze
They know everything about you
And bootleg if you smile
They all give and supported your dream
With父とADE
But boom boom boom
The rights are alive
It's already a dream


AIRA mmmmmmmmmmme
AIRA will always be there
So be patient

They're everywhere you go and see the things you see.
They have copies of your money list and food, they'll give you things.
They know everything about you like your favorite kind of sin.
So face it, you'll never be alone again!
Yeah!
How long's it been?
20 years?
Driving, driving, endlessly driving.
It's been difficult.
It's strange for a country that has grown so...
For a country that has become so weak.
It's difficult to live here.
And it shouldn't be so hard to live in a nation that's grown so soft.
Tim Russett, Chris Matthews, Katie Couric, CBS, NBC are all communists.
The Pope is senile and pedophilia is fine with him as long as it's not reported.
And pedophilia is fine with him.
He's a white-winged, right-winged pond scum.
Dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump.

You will see the light at the end of the pipe that leads to Bob Dobbs.
Bob Dobbs.
Talking about the salesman.
To the gods.
He's still a chap that coughed and lit.
On the conspiracy of normality.

And now some more PR news.
From PR news in Washington, I'm not guilty by reason of insanity.
Today is election day in Britain.
Labour Party Prime Minister Tony Blair has placed and detonated explosives outside the British Consulate in Manhattan early this morning.
He thought he was documenting a legitimate use of a naked prisoner.
This is PR news.
Six million young homosexual gypsies wailed for two minutes at the notorious death camp in Britain.
Health officials opened fire, killing eight and wounding two.
Depending on supply.
At least police don't know who killed PR news in Washington.
It's a reunion that took over 30 years to happen.
A superbly preserved Jack Bruce, Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker from the 30th Pharaonic Dynasty, Cream, had been closed in a wooden sarcophagus and buried in sand at the bottom of a 20-foot shaft.
I'm so mad, I'm so mad, I'm so mad.
With classic songs such as Sunshine of Your Mummy, White Mummy, Strange Mummy, 2300-year-old Farewell Tour that you saw the band come to an end.
Cream will then be placed on the stage.

God doesn't deal in nuance.
God doesn't deal in gray area.
God hates and despises.
God hates, hates, and despises gray area.
And the whole point of it is to make you feel better about yourself as you accomplish nothing.
My other mental illness problem has to do with art and music and movies and all the stuff that I really like.
And some of you may be this way.
If I go to a movie or a concert or see beautiful artwork,
for some reason it's not enough to just sit there and enjoy it.
I always want to do it myself.
And be glad that I don't try to sing anymore.
But it's kind of a handicap in a way because you can't really do everything.
And I'm not really that good at all the things I try to do.
Because I keep jumping from one to another.
You know, you see this great techno music.
Now see, I'll do techno music because anybody can do techno.
And with a computer.
There's good and bad.
And I do the bad kind.
But the same with art.
What it is, is I realize it's the tools.
I love the tools.
And it's a neurotic love of tools.
And guys are like that.
That's a guy thing.
But it's a geek thing.
It used to be guys would work on cars.
Now they brag about their computer.
But it's...
There's not that much difference really.
And I got to...
I was reading some paleoanthropology at one point.
I love cave people.
I feel close to them for some reason.
And...
Okay, for a million years, the main thing, the most common thing that guys did was chip rocks.
They did not actually spend most of their time hunting or gathering.
But they did spend a lot of time getting...
Making these stone hand axes.
That was the level of technology that our ancestors were at for a long time.
And I mean, several species of hominids were kind of in the same technological level of...
They made tools, but they were so good at it.
I mean, they were really good at it.
A modern person would not be able to make a stone hand axe as well as a...
One of these characters doing it back when that's all they did for a hundred thousand years.
They really got good at it.
And we know this because there are plenty of stone hand axes all over the world.
But there aren't that many skulls and skeletons.
It's...
That whole work part of science is very mushy and vague because there's just not that much fossil material.
But there's a lot...
They had never...
They kept making these hand axes because they didn't take them with them.
They hadn't invented the hand axe store.
They had not even invented the hand axe bag.
They'd make...
It's like...
What?
There's a sick baby mammoth?
Oh, let's go get it.
Let's make some hand axes real quick.
And run over there and kill it.
Skin it.
And eat it.
And then they'd wander off and leave all their hand axes.
That's why you find all that stuff.
So they kept making them over and over and over again.
They didn't...
Plus they'd get dull, you know.
Pretty quick.
Now the near-sighted cavemen probably chopped a lot more rocks than the others.
Because they weren't that good with a bow and arrow or chasing rabbits.
So they...
But they could chop rocks like a son of a bitch.
And good chopping could get you...
It was a status thing, certainly.
With that many centuries of this one level of technology, you know, if you could whack out a rock real quick, you'd impress the girls.
And...
So good chopping could get you laid and paid if you were the near-sighted caveman.
You could...
You didn't have to go out...
If you made good rocks for everybody else, you could get fed.
The ones who couldn't even make hand axes are the ones who invented the first religions, friends.
At any rate...
So think of it.
Here's a million years of these craftsmen, okay?
And they're pretty simple-minded.
That's all they can do is just chop these damn rocks.
Pretty repetitive motion.
All day long for millions of years.
Smiths, we might call them.
Millions of years of smiths chopping rocks.
And making up religions to get laid.
And sometimes I feel like I'm still chopping rocks to get laid and paid.
And that...
Think about, now, obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Now, that's not a big jump from the rock chopping, if you think about it.
It's like a holdover from that axe-making instinct.
Sitting there doing the same thing over and over again.
All day long, every day of your life.
Doesn't that kind of remind you of some of the jobs that we go to?
You know, jobs that are best enjoyed if you happen to have obsessive-compulsive disorder.
I certainly have benefited from mine.
It comes in real handy.
But then you kind of...
Okay, so jobs.
What about art, really?
Most art.
You know, that's just busy work.
No, but you don't have to have art for survival.
That's just a useless byproduct of hand axe-making gone hog wild.
It's an instinct.
And for you drummers, the connection should be really obvious.
Needless to say, you know, you're just chopping...
It's soft rock chopping.
But what else did people do for a hundred thousand dollars?
You know, they just cut it down.

And then you have a bunch of people who are just doing it for a hundred thousand years.
Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink.
And late into the night, the fire's going and they're banging away.
And you get kind of tripped out doing the same thing over and over.
So you look around at our modern civilization, our monorails and flying jetpacks and...
Oh, well, anyway, the...
Our subways and buses.
And friends, maybe tool-using wasn't such a good idea after all.
The tool-using is what got us this way.
And maybe it wasn't such a good idea.
This leads me to UFOs.
The question about UFOs and aliens is not so much, is there anyone out there?
They're almost certainly...
The question actually is...
There must be.
Just by sheer size and the amount of time we're talking about, there must be others out there.
The question is, how come they didn't contact us already a million years ago?
And don't say crop circles.
I know the guys that make the crosses.
And don't, you know, don't know, well, my girlfriend was abducted in this dream and she...
Well, okay, no, that's...
I mean real evidence.
Non-chump evidence.
That's the question.
You know, how come we don't have solid evidence?
And, well, friends, maybe we really don't want the super advanced gas brains of Jupiter to notice us.
It may be that the reason that we haven't already encountered slightly more advanced tool users who manage to be able to make the distances that we can't yet...
Maybe when...
When the really advanced aliens detect the presence...
I think this happened in one of those Star Trek movies.
As soon as they detect the signal of a faster than light drive or whatever, nuclear energy, that's when the gas brains of Jupiter call the exterminators.
It's like, oh, I'm afraid you death robots are going to have to go in there and spray for tool users again.
Got another nice little planet down there.
But it's another infestation.
And that's why we never get visited by flying saucers in real life.
It's because they get shot down before they can leave.
And that's probably what will happen to us because the wiser ones know what happened.
You know, during the galactic wars in the previous billion years, they learned some lessons.
So they try to keep us down.
So maybe by ensure consequences, when we were here earlier...
We've distanced back to Outside of a planet.
Which out of the sheer اليab Problem, we might be found appropriate amongst those and have said,
Well, almost no future south.

Maybe it was really less proactive than the true dangercture so far though.
How about this one up out of a planet, then?
comic jefferson again and before that we heard some live sub-g's preaching as it happened at

God, you know, a plastic dinosaur won't help them now
If they just pet them, just ride them, they'll
Oh, I know, but then they might smear their spots
But then when they grow up, it's all better
You think so?
I think it's beautiful
Honey, I could tell you some stories that'll never get better
It's awful
I mean, once you get married, it's always like that
But I think that through the correct questioning that you can bring the dinosaur's real personality
Really? In spite of the spots?
In spite of the spots
And the tears?
It's a miracle
They'll take them away
It's everywhere
And they'll put them where they belong
It's beautiful and shining every day
Can I get one?
Everyone has a small spot of dinosaur teeth
Laugh and laugh
It's a dinosaur who disappeared
Teach me how to do that
Well, first you go and get some Little Debbie snack cakes

To get her at last
Beams on us all
You're making her cry
No, no, no
Beams not here
You gotta stop
Don't cry
Give her some more beans
Give her a dinosaur
Give her that spotted one over there
There's one in every box
Yeah, there's two now
There's one on the floor
There's three
There's four
Okay, that's all you got, thanks
Okay, that was a warm tarantula
Hidden by the, uh, under the warm beer can in the edge of the cooler
A tarantula of the mind
Not a real thing, but a hallucination from the depths of a disordered world
Psyche
Okay, put the woman back in the wagons
It's a tarantula of the mind
It's one of them nine-pound spiders we've been having
Look at that
No, don't look at her
The laughing spider can paralyze with its insane, inhuman chuckle
Man, it's almost got his mouth
Doctor, how can we get the spider back in the cage?
The bulim laughing spider
The cat can fix it to do anything
And we can only use brute force
That's all it understands
It's a new kind of laundry detergent
I used it one time
I got rid of all the other spiders
There were lots of them before I used that
Just pour it in the jar
Pour some on his abdomen there
Holy
What?
It's shriveling up
Yeah, don't listen to it laugh
I don't think it's too funny
It's wacky
It's goofy
It's wild
I think we should take one of them
And put them in little packages
Where little dinosaurs used to be
And fool somebody
It's scary
But all those kids think they're going to get a little dinosaur friend
And instead they get some massive goo from the inside of the spider
Yeah, it's a little known
They don't laugh at the spider
It's awful
And then Jimmy eats some
It's awful
It's awful
I saw a monster with two eyes that made me

You know one of the best things about Bob?
What's that?
He's a smoker
Yeah
Yeah, a frop all the way
Uh, anyway, I want
You mentioned in your book
And I hope I'm paraphrasing accurately here
That attitudes of a number of people
We have encountered
Fall into the realm of bad mental health
My question is
Do you have any thoughts
On what kind of job the mental health system
Is doing in this country
And secondly, do you have any views
On the prescription and use of psychotic tranquilizers
And other mind-altering medications used today?
Well, let's take the mental health system first
It's a disaster area
Because most of the facilities
Were decimated by the early budget
Cuts in the beginning of the Reagan administration
And when those facilities closed
A lot of the people who were in there being cared for
Wound up sleeping under bridges
And in cardboard boxes
And on gratings in Washington, D.C.
And people who should be receiving medical help
Are now regarded as these denizens of the underworld
And it's really a very sick thing
For a society that likes to think
That it's fair and caring
It's a sick thing for it to do
To save a couple of bucks
On the back of people in those institutions
That's reprehensible
Do you think that the mental health system
Works when it's allowed to work?
Well, let's just say that
Having one is better than not having one
I would disagree with some of the techniques
That have been used in mental hospitals
Not that I'm an expert
I've never been an inmate in one
But based on things that I've heard
About what goes on there
I wouldn't say that
We are talking about a system
That had spectacularly good results
In healing people
But at least in the case of the people
Who are now sleeping in the street
They had a place
They wouldn't freeze to death
Whether or not they would ever get
Over their schizophrenia
Is another question
But at least they're not going to freeze to death
Because they hear voices
What would you plan to do
If you were president
In that kind of situation?
The same thing that I would do
About the rest of the homeless problem
You go to the congress and say
Fix it, you know
Spend the money and do it
Because obviously there are people
Who have dealt in the realm of social services
Who know far more about this than I do
But nobody is turning to these people
Saying do it
Well I'll not only vote for you
But I'll campaign for you in 92
Well I've got to figure out
If you do decide
Let's keep that in the gift
Because I haven't made the decision to do it
But it's nice to talk to people
To see that there is some enthusiasm
There is a dissent
And keep up the good work musically
And politically
Okay let me just say
Something about your second question
About the mind altering drug
I don't think that it's a good idea to use them
I think that
One of the reasons why they work
Is the drug changes your body chemistry
Okay
The chemistry of your body is being changed
In most instances by
Artificial substances
In other words a chemical
Which is derived from
Isolating a molecule
That's not a chemical
It came from a plant
Or a mushroom
Or some other source
That has a special chemical effect
On the human body
So this kind of thing goes on regularly though
That's right
In other words if you want to feel mutated
You could just eat a strange diet
And you'd be out there
I mean how many macrobiotic people do you know
Okay
You know they're kind of bobbed out
Yeah
And if you want to be altered

What do you think about not
Drugging which is not of one's own free will
I would assume
Well I think that's a no-no
You mean like sticking stuff in the water supply
Well no
That's terrorism
Well drugging someone in a mental hospital
Who doesn't necessarily agree with that
Would probably be

the sacred circumscribe of the subgenius.
Circumscription is a very useful thing, actually.
There are certain things that we're talking about
and certain things we won't talk about.
You only talk about those things inside the circle.
Unless we started one.
We wouldn't want to start an army, would we?
Yeah, I've contemplated that before,
but I'm just not that kind of guy.
That's the thing.
We could get a fight club thing,
a bunch of loser males that have low self-esteem,
and we could dress them up in funny clothes
and give them orders.
Been there, done that.
Yeah, already tried it.
You've actually been involved in something like that before?
Were you a...
Yeah, it was called 7th grade gym class.
Yeah, when I jumped into a load of raw sewage
just to earn my wings.
You're kidding.
You can fly now, for Christ's sake?
What are you doing here?
You can fly?
Why haven't you flown away yet?
Why haven't you flown away yet then?
Hey, how many of you guys got picked on by bullies
in elementary school?
I did.
How many were bullies that did the picking on?
I did a little bit of both.
See, that's well-rounded,
if you did a little bit of both.
I know what it's like on both sides,
and I'm not proud of what I did
or of what was done to me.
Not proud of either one of those things,
but it's childhood.
There's a reason why we don't hold children accountable
the way we hold adults accountable
in our society.
Because they're mean little things.
There's a reason why we have a separate justice system
for juveniles.
And all this talk about,
oh, you know, you do an adult crime,
you do adult time.
I don't think that means anything at all.
Because the fact is, you know,
you think back on the stuff you did as a kid,
you know, it seems nonsensical today.
You look at the stuff that kids do,
it seems nonsensical today.
But they grow up.
There are whole parts of the brain
that are not mature until you're in your 20s, actually.
You know, and we hold people accountable
for what's supposed to be exercise
of that part of the brain.
Years before it's fully formed.
Well, if you can go into their high school
and tell them how cool it would be in the military,
I would say there are vast portions of their brains
which are undeveloped.
Yeah, well...
Perhaps even, you know, as flaccid as my wrist.
Well, it depends on what your alternatives are.
You know, to some people,
the military looks like a lot of flack.
During peacetime, it is.
Somebody wakes you up for you,
somebody puts you to sleep
and puts the food in your mouth
while you are push-upped for them
and shooted for them.
Yeah.
It's a great job.
Yeah, a very secure job.
And you don't have to pay for food or launching, either.
Some kids nowadays think they'll get to win...
get their own, like, special uniform
like in the video games.
And a name.
You know, they can double-click on here
and suddenly they're Captain...
whatever the...
You know what I'm saying?
I know what you mean.
And, you know...
Or they think they can enter a cheat code.
Oh, yeah.
Just press the buttons on your special weapon.
They can do that.
Well, they can?
Yes!
That's right.
In today's Army of One,
you can, uh...
You get your special, uh...
nano-individualized combat weapon
with, uh...
little keypad on it.
And nobody else can...
How do you get to be the commander-in-chief?
You have to do things
you don't even want to imagine doing.
Right, yeah.
You don't have to remember the things that you do
while you're, you know, on the job.
You know, as long as they...
I mean...
I mean...
I mean...









You don't have to be up that high.
You have to bend over quite a few times
for several different reasons.
Yeah, but you get the special helmet
where you can control
what you can remember afterwards.
Yeah.
But your plumbing's never right
after they get the helmet
or you bend over.
I mean, for crying out loud,
what a thing to give up for your feet.
Hey, you know what?
Actually, it's not so bad
because, I mean,
sure, you give up a lot of your freedoms
to get that kind of position,
but you also give up a lot of risks as well, you know?
You get that helmet
and you can wear that helmet
because, you know,
you don't need the tinfoil helmet anymore.
And, man,
my position needs a helmet.
I need protection
and I can't get up from this position.
Well, we'll send out someone
to help you out very shortly.
Don't forget to bring the canine jelly
or any kind of other, you know,
liquefied dog products.
Hmm.
This is the story
about a group of kids who volunteered.
We fixed stuff.
We moved the park.
Well, that didn't last long.
Kids like you
me?
Who cares?
