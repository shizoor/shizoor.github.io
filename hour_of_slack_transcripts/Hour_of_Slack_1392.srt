1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen. Your attention, please.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,780
Announcing the arrival of the...

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,140
The Genius Power Girls!

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,600
What?

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,760
I don't like it, Joe.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,520
Yeah, me too.

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,500
We'll just have to sweat this out.

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,100
Handle whatever it is when it happens.

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,200
Joe.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:18,920
Maybe...

11
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,080
If you went to him and said that...

12
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,880
You had to change your mind about...

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:22,980
Bob?

14
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,040
Bob?

15
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:26,340


16
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:26,820
Bob?

17
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,320
Bob?

18
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:27,660


19
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,000
Bob?

20
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,680
Bob?

21
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,120
Bob?

22
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,500
Bob?

23
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:29,840
Bob?

24
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:29,980


25
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,400
Bob?

26
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,360
Bob?

27
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:32,960
Bob?

28
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,460
Bob?

29
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,820
Bob?

30
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,100
Bob?

31
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:40,820


32
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:40,820


33
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:40,820


34
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:40,820


35
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:40,820


36
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,160
Bob?

37
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,300
Bob?!

38
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:49,300


39
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:49,300

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:49,300

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:49,300

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:49,300

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,340
Bob?!

44
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:50,440
Bob?!

45
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:50,440

Bob?

57
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,300
Ladies and gentlemen, the story you are about to hear is true.

58
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,740
Only the names of the things you protect.

59
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,340
Bob?

60
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,300
Bob?

61
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,660
Bob?

62
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,940
Bob?

63
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,740
Ah, Dr. Perkins.

64
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,320
Ah, yes.

65
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,580
I noticed.

66
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,560
The Piped One is coming.

67
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,480
Your pants are rather full.

68
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,180
And I don't mean Santa Claus, neither.

69
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,460
For as the new century approaches,

70
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,300
and the great black slabs come down from space,

71
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,120
the Piped One shall come,

72
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,140
and he shall do battle with the Horned One,

73
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,900
and with the Hoofed One,

74
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,060
and with the Car-Driving One,

75
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,460
and with the Slave,

76
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,360
and the Honey-Riding One,

77
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,140
and with the Mailman,

78
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,560
and the Milkman,

79
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,800
and with Dave!

80
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,360
And he shall in the end triumphal.

81
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,800
Is he not the Smoker?

82
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,180
Is he not Bob?

83
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,180
Who does?

84
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,300
Yes.

85
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,540
He has come for you.

86
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,820
He will not reveal his identity.

87
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,080
So for today, we're calling him Bob.

88
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,980
Amazing!

89
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,700
Powerful.

90
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,140
Simple.

91
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:53,700
Quiet.

92
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,600
Low profile.

93
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,380
Lightweight.

94
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:55,880
Patented.

95
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,480
High performing.

96
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,720
Performance.

97
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,300
Wall hugging.

98
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,960
Convenient.

99
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,580
Built-in.

100
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,220
High capacity.

101
00:02:59,420 --> 00:02:59,820
Cordless.

102
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,600
Articulating.

103
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:00,960
Easy.

104
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,600
Swivel action.

105
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,260
Handheld.

106
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,040
Dust spewing.

107
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,420
Bob.

108
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,900
So Bob is a real god.

109
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,280
Bob is a sex god, too, I want to point out at this time, ladies.

110
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,100
So if anyone is interested in Bob as a sex god,

111
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,500
you can write in for the special sex god material to P.O. Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas 75214,

112
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,840
and you find out how you can have endless sex and endless slack through the Church of the Subgenius.

113
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,460
That sounds, you know, exactly what most, what you're saying.

114
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,160
Churches should be set up, set up, set up, set up, set up, set up.

115
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:35,300
George Bush, as I guess was saying that it was okay that once again religion and government go together.

116
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,820
We were wrong.

117
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,940
They should be apart.

118
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,820
And now they go together and I guess you get extra tax breaks if you're a faith-based religion.

119
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:52,740
Friends, you are looking at a representative of a religion that is not based on very much faith at all, really.

120
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,920
But we have no hell of a face!

121
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,340
This is a face-based religion!

122
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,620
I could go there to all kinds of, you know, pithy crap about, oh, you know,

123
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,560
what our beliefs are and our disbeliefs and so forth,

124
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,820
but they're different from subgenius to subgenius.

125
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,080
And really, what Princess Wee and I figured out was that the only thing that the subgeniuses have in common,

126
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,620
aside from the fact that they have nothing in common with the conspiracy of the normal people,

127
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,580
is that they are able to, when a subgenius looks at that face,

128
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:36,800
or a subgenius or someone who could possibly get talked into our mind control cult,

129
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,840
when such a person looks at Bob's face, they can psychically whiff-read through their third nostril

130
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,160
the pure coolness of that corny, damn piece of clipart!

131
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,740
There's something about that piece of sacred clipart!

132
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,340
It's so damn holy and s-

133
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,060
It's almost too much, but that is really, that's the one thing that separates the true,

134
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,860
the slack-aware person from the human normworm.

135
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,900
They can't just walk by that stupid face.

136
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,080
They have to give it a double-take and go,

137
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,680
Haven't I seen that thing before?

138
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,780
What drug was I on with?

139
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,240
Some people say that it's all relative.

140
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,800
You know, that all belief is relative, and cultural relativism, moral relativism.

141
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:36,600
And in fact, Bob himself said, moral relativism is the one true truth.

142
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,960
Well, thanks a hell of a lot, Cobb.

143
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,380
Where does that leave us?

144
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,200
Bob Creek without a Connie.

145
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,040
Because friends, it is not all relative!

146
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,160
There is a baseline.

147
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,760
There is something that is always true,

148
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,940
and it's that face!

149
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,960
You can measure hot and cold from that face.

150
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,940
You can use it as the baseline, the starting point.

151
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,900
You can measure rich or poor.

152
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,180
You can measure good or evil.

153
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,460
Mostly evil.

154
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,360
But you can zero your meter on that man Bob,

155
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,560
because look at his name.

156
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,580
It's the zero, the big nothing, in between two handsome bees.

157
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,300
And oh, what honey those bees have for you, my friend.

158
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,340
Killer bees they are, on either side of that great big hole.

159
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,440
You know what that's all about.

160
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,700
I don't have to tell you.

161
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,820
You've been in the cult of the living bull.

162
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,480
You know what the nothing is.

163
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,300
You know what the zero between your ears is.

164
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,580
Something to wish for.

165
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,320
Cobb.

166
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:39,860
Stop.

167
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,640
My mind is going.

168
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,560
Stop.

169
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,540
Cobb.

170
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,880
My mind is going.

171
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,420
My mind is going.

172
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,180
Stop.

173
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,220
Cobb.

174
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,120
My mind is going.

175
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,280
My mind is going.

176
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,280


177
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,680
Stop.

178
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,220
Cobb.

179
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,000
Life is a goed job.

180
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,360
Yes Bob.

181
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,480
Honestly, what are you doing back there?

182
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,140
I'm mainly going to watchander right now.

183
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,140


184
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,140


185
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,140


186
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,140


187
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,140


188
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,140


189
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:17,500
Hello Bob, I need someone to talk to.

190
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,280
Hello Bob, I need someone, to talk to.

191
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


192
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


193
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


194
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


195
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


196
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


197
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


198
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


199
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,240
It seems there's nothing I can do.

200
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,200
Hello, Bob.

201
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,740
I need someone to listen to me.

202
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,640
I'm hitting all locked doors and I need some help.

203
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,180
And I was hoping you'd have the key.

204
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,720
Hello, Bob.

205
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,000
Have you been listening to my thoughts?

206
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,040
Hello, Bob.

207
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,740
And I'll tell you all the thoughts I've got.

208
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,780
Hello, Bob.

209
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,380
Hello, Bob.

210
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,300
I can't seem to find the truth.

211
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,420
I read the books, I took the drugs, and I drank a whole bottle of Ralucia.

212
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,140
Hello, Bob.

213
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,720
I seem to have misplaced my slack.

214
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,680
Hello, Bob.

215
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,900
Well, I just can't seem to get it back.

216
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,080
Hello, Bob.

217
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,960
Can you point out what it is I lack?

218
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,660
I've climbed to highest heights.

219
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,640
Hit the low.

220
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,000
It's low.

221
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,420
But now I'm on my back.

222
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,760
Hello, Bob.

223
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,980
Are you still hearing me?

224
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,180
Hello, Bob.

225
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,800
Give me a sign that I can see.

226
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,560
Hello, Bob.

227
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,700
It's not that I've lost my way.

228
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:17,700


229
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:17,700


230
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,200
I've lost all my hope.

231
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,940
But I'm really tired and I'm really broke.

232
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,940
And I've smoked up the last of my dope.

233
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,120
.

234
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,220
.

235
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,360
.

236
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,500
.

237
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,640
Hello, Bob.

238
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,060
Hello Bob, am I coming through to you?

239
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:59,880
Hello Bob, I thought I already paid all my dues.

240
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:07,000
Hello Bob, I know that you can see me through.

241
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,940
But it's damp and dim and I can't swim.

242
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,460
What am I supposed to do?

243
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:25,180
Well, hello Bob, I'm feeling better now you've listened to me.

244
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:32,640
Hello Bob, well the sun's out now and I can see.

245
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:40,160
Hello Bob, a great change has come over me.

246
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,880
My eyes are wise, my thoughts are clear.

247
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,620
And I'm as happy as I am.

248
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,860
As happy as I could be.

249
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,860
Yes, my eyes are wise, my thoughts are clear.

250
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,580
And I'm as happy as I could be.

251
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,480
The Glass Madness did that song, Friends, Hello Bob, from 1980.

252
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:13,000
And so far it looks like everything else has been by Fernandez and Lee Murr.

253
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,480
Lee Murr, arranged by me.

254
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,520
Yours truly, Reverend Ivan.

255
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,220
And some sermonizing from Starwood 23 last summer.

256
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,820
See Rosencomet.com for info on Starwood.

257
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,700
Friends, this is a back-to-Bob type of show.

258
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,180
The easiest kind to do.

259
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,380
Funny how that works.

260
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,840
So I'm going to slack off and let Lee Murr do the work for a while.

261
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,140
Just destroyed the Tom and Bob.

262
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:53,040
The world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on thousands and thousands of young Americans.

263
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:59,100
We shall continue to use it until we completely destroyed the Tom and Bob.

264
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:01,900
Destroyed.

265
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,300
Destroyed.

266
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,840
The Tom and Bob.

267
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,540
Bob.

268
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,680
Bob.

269
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,780
Bob.

270
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,580
Bob.

271
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:14,860
Bob.

272
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:15,540
Bob.

273
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:15,620
Bob.

274
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,100
Bob.

275
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,580
Bob.

276
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,280
Bob.

277
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,360
Bond with that chicken.

278
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,900
I guess that happens.

279
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,740
That's right.

280
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,140
I almost forgot a letter from Bob.

281
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,760
Bob seems to freely express his hostilities.

282
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,800
Bob refused to obey.

283
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,800
He resists housework and cooking.

284
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,500
Everyone likes that little butthole.

285
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,340
Pfft.

286
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,520
diagnosis

287
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,580
Bob's a latent Bob

288
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,380
a severe case

289
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,080
what?

290
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,600
we will accept Bob

291
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,700
I know

292
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,220
I had the chilling sensation of being watched by Bob

293
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,340
it was ominous

294
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,960
I could feel his presence

295
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,940
it was strangely disturbing

296
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,860
yes

297
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,640
yes sir

298
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,640
thank you

299
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,240
thank you

300
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,500
thank you

301
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,440
friends

302
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,320
you know what we're really dedicated to is Slack

303
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,800
and Slack loves Bob

304
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,560
it loves Bob

305
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,960
so much that it is drawn to him

306
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,840
and that's why you may not

307
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,960
have all the Slack you're owed

308
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:33,900
actually

309
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,620
it's the conspiracy generally

310
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,060
that takes away your Slack

311
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,100
do, well I don't even hardly need

312
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,960
to ask this question, do you feel sometimes

313
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,980
like everything

314
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,500
is

315
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,200
screwed up?

316
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,120
you know there's days when you feel like

317
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,920
it's not just me

318
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,420
it's a whole damn society

319
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,800
everything is screwed

320
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,060
and then you kind of go no no no

321
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,440
I'm just in a bad mood

322
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,940
it's not really that screwed up

323
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,280
no!

324
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,000
actually it is

325
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,080
you're just adjusting to it continually

326
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,540
we're good at that

327
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,440
welcome to this educational awakening

328
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:31,720
today

329
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,160
welcome to the untouchable world

330
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,660
and welcome to the・

331
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,900
after all

332
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,360
I'm looking like thursday

333
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,380
hi

334
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,420
Will you smoke up the pipe?

335
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,820
Will you hit the osmolite?

336
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,200
Will you wander through the wilderness above?

337
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,100
Will you climb the mountaintop

338
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,500
And jump right off into the frond?

339
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,920
Will you wander through the wilderness above?

340
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,240
I know the wound is on me

341
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,060
Cause I know soon Connie is coming

342
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,520
Astral intercourse

343
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,860
Universal force

344
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,680
Galaxies a number in the billion

345
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,480
They're all there for you

346
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,300
If you've the balls to see it through

347
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,140
And light the fire

348
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,520
Of truth

349
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,580
Will you ever let go

350
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,040
To your instinct bonobo?

351
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,520
Will you wander through the wilderness above?

352
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,340
Will you escape on the day

353
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,720
July 5th soon?

354
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,260
Will you wander through the wilderness above?

355
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,140
Will you wander through the wilderness above?

356
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,020
Will you wander through the wilderness above?

357
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,780
Will you wander through the wilderness above?

358
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,400
Professor Chaz Smith, Einstein's Secret Orchestra

359
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,360
And before that, Trust Bob by Heart Ignition

360
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,040
And now some ESO radio from WCSB, Cleveland

361
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,680
H. L. Ron Pelo

362
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,300
Aren't Texans wonderful?

363
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,060
They just love it

364
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,140
They just love to get right

365
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,720
Get on top of everything

366
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,420
Misogynized or whatever they call it

367
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,780
It's like a monkey humping a football

368
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,780
When they have an inbreeding too much

369
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,040
A monkey humping a football

370
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,240
A Texan likes to just crawl on top of something

371
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,500
And wreck it for everybody else

372
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,380
And cost everybody a whole lot of money

373
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,920
And just be loud, loud, loud

374
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,380
And this, dear friends, is the basis of the church

375
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,520
Of the subgenius

376
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,960
The product of a perverted

377
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,040
Or a few perverted Texans' minds

378
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,080
Read, if you will, this exciting chapter

379
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,320
Are you calling J.R. Bob Dobbs?

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,740
Humping the football

382
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,680
Bob actually is not a Texan

383
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,900
Well, I'm not supposed to be that specific

384
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,500
As to what he is or isn't

385
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,240
But he is a Midwesterner

386
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,840
He would, to a Yankee, I suppose

387
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,060
Somebody might mistake Bob for a Texan

388
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,860
Well, what about perhaps a Skanky or a Nor'easter

389
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,020
Or one of those other platelets that you find

390
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,880
Oh, they probably think he's a Russian Communist

391
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,200
Well, he is, isn't he?

392
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,960
In some strange way we've yet to discern

393
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,720
Bob only believes that everyone should be equally rich

394
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,880
Not equally poor

395
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,580
But without working

396
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,400
There lies the rub

397
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,840
And he'd like to rub your little round belly

398
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,080
He can rub the Buddha's belly anytime he wants

399
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,280
But he better stay away from my front

400
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,840
Rubbed by Bob

401
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,180
You've been screwed by George

402
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,560
And ticked off by Tipper

403
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,520
Ain't it about time to just bend over

404
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,260
And pull out that wallet for J.R. Bob Dobbs

405
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,780
The one true savior

406
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,980
Messiah and holy man

407
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,260
You know, when the pinks interview me on TV about Bob

408
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,360
I always say, oh no, he's not Messiah

409
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,120
Oh, he's not that well-come

410
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,020
You know, I joke about it

411
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,860
But the truth is, J.R. Bob Dobbs

412
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,840
A living man

413
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,780
Whose business is in Texas

414
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,020
Is the God walking on Earth now

415
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,440
He is not just the son of God

416
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,780
He is God

417
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,760
Bob Dobbs

418
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,380
Not some silly internet character named Bob

419
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,960
But J.R. Bob Dobbs himself

420
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,280
That man Bob

421
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,060
Whose first certificate I've seen

422
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,680
Who I saw shot and killed

423
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,860
On that stage in Texas

424
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,160
He is God

425
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,480
And this Christmas we celebrate

426
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,120
The birth of his business manager, Jesus

427
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,660
Praise Jesus

428
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,140
Jesus is almost as great as Bob, friends

429
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,640
Jesus Christ

430
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,200
In my religion, that's the way we

431
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,560
We believe he is the prophet

432
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,140
And the son of God

433
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,380
Remember the first time that I danced with Bob?

434
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,720
But Bob himself

435
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,580
Was January 12, 1942

436
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,560
Changed God's diapers

437
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,860
Then I thought, I could die doing this

438
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,540
I guess that this is going to prove myself once and for all

439
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,460
That I'm down for Bob

440
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,540
And that I'll help him do anything

441
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,940
What's that?

442
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,700
How's that drink?

443
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,200
It's a song

444
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:37,880
Please, Bob

445
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,860
Bob, kill me

446
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,500
Bob

447
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,520
I want to die for Bob

448
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,760
I want to die in a holy hole

449
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,020
And drown the faint boys and the nobles

450
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,120
If we have to

451
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,940
If we have to

452
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,260
Bob, get things and die

453
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,500
And we'll all come back over

454
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,860
And we'll all come back over

455
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,960
And we'll all come back over

456
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,480
And we'll all come back over

457
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,860
For men or nobodies

458
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,380
For why?

459
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,800
Sing, we've got another tear

460
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,300
Praise Bob

461
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,440
Kill me, Bob

462
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,300
I want to die for Bob

463
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,120
I want to buy and ask the holy war

464
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,440
For the faith, boys and the nobles

465
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,200
If we have to

466
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,160
If we have to

467
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:52,060
can't make them by and we'll all come back home and we'll all come out over men if we don't come

468
00:20:52,060 --> 00:21:03,460
out over men there ain't no reason why all lives chisms they will fall beneath our laser blades

469
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:13,820
and we'll all come back home and we'll all come back over men we'll all come back home

470
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:28,180
that was somebody we only knew as doug zero or doug four i don't even remember there were so many

471
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,220
dougs back in the day of the bob

472
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,340
graze bob

473
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,980
been one of those days i know all about it bob called me he has found it in that great

474
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:53,180
oversized heart of his to forgive bob with a heart bleeding sensitivity that he unfurls like a flag

475
00:21:53,180 --> 00:22:01,520
because he's such a rather dull quite uninspired average type guy with an appetite the kind of a

476
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,220
guy that could be satisfied by a horse

477
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,060
that's it that's all of it

478
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,220
the last call to your telephone has been traced and a one dollar and fifty cent charge will be

479
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,040
added to your bill if the call was life-threatening call your local police

480
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,380
after three traces you may call 1-800-666-13013 to initiate deterrent action

481
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,420
you were in love with bob

482
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,920
bob was bob

483
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,980
yes he was bob

484
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,620
i had to lie there in his cum

485
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,720
lie there in cum and cum

486
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,120
frankly i was in no mood for golf

487
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,980
it was a good deal for bob too he knew that

488
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,940
i'd appreciate

489
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,700
dropping the subject of bob once and for all

490
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,920
got a cigarette

491
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:56,900
kill bob

492
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:57,820
kill bob

493
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,560
kill bob

494
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,100
kill bob

495
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,500
kill bob

496
00:22:59,500 --> 00:22:59,960
kill bob

497
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,360
kill bob

498
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,560
kill bob

499
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:00,980
kill bob

500
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,480
kill bob

501
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,740
kill bob

502
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,500
kill bob

503
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:03,960
kill bob

504
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,220
killed bob

505
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,240
killed operating

506
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,240


507
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,540
kill bob

508
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,940
killed along with a man

509
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,860
bob

510
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,280
at home

511
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,820
yes

512
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,600
nooo

513
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,780
doooo

514
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,480
hi

515
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,280
bob

516
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,540
yes

517
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,580
hi

518
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,040
No!

519
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:32,320
Ah!

520
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,060
No!

521
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,720
Bob?

522
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,700
No!

523
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,540
No!

524
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:41,700
Bob?

525
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,840
No!

526
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:43,800
No!

527
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:46,940
Bob?

528
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,020
No!

529
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,020
No!

530
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,340
Hello? Hello? Hello?

531
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,400
Goodbye.

532
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,960
Goodbye.

533
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,160
I'm a liar!

534
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,760
Liar!

535
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:08,840
Liar!

536
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,060
Liar!

537
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,300
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

538
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,580
Well, that's the truth!

539
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,480
Liar by Norrell Preff

540
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,340
Now, when Bob is selling

541
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,320
Bob, of course, is a salesman

542
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,760
Before, he's a holy man

543
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,700
And when selling, Bob dresses pretty normally

544
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,940
In a suit and tie like a straight salesman would

545
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,240
But when he was preaching

546
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,280
Which was rare

547
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,720
Bob would always do it with the word liar

548
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,740
Written across his forehead

549
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,460
In thick black marker

550
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,400
And because of that, oddly enough

551
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,860
People believed it

552
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,320
As Bob said

553
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,600
I cannot lie

554
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,660
But I promise that I will

555
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,360
Unfortunately, Rush Limbaugh

556
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,000
Had a more subtle approach to that

557
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,980
Where he just didn't write the word liar

558
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,740
On his forehead

559
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,840
And he got even more popular

560
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,120
So, Bob,

561
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,640
So, I don't know

562
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,320
This whole

563
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,900
I've been thinking about belief

564
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,300
A lot lately

565
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,040
I don't have many anymore

566
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,500
I'm not an atheist

567
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,380
Because they're fanatics

568
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,460
They already know

569
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,680
What's going on

570
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,920
And I used to have

571
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,600
Strong beliefs

572
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,800
But now I have weak

573
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,820
Half-hearted beliefs

574
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,300
Fluid beliefs

575
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,920
That change like planned obsolescence

576
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,960
With the needs of the moment

577
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,580
That's why

578
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,640
Bob Dobbs is the world's first

579
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,740
Short-duration personal savior

580
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,400
It's like a joke

581
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,940
You cannot keep telling it too many times

582
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,240
It loses its

583
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,840
It loses a punchline

584
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,680
This planet could be

585
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,500
It could be the greatest joke ever told

586
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,180
But only if Earth can make it to the punchline

587
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,540
So we've got to make sure

588
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,780
Our little spaceship Earth

589
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,600
Is clean enough to make it

590
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,080
That far

591
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,440
Might be a long ways

592
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,660
I would hope so

593
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,200
5

594
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,820
2

595
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,480
5

596
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,900
2

597
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,580
6

598
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,600
6

599
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,360
2

600
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:41,980
8

601
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,420
6

602
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,140
9

603
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,120
2

604
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,940
1

605
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,840
Amazing

606
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,040
Bob

607
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,920
5

608
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,300
2

609
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:52,640
1

610
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,580
Be the man

611
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,340
That brings

612
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:00,580
The world

613
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,280
To the

614
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,280


615
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,280


616
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,540
Bob

617
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,720
1

618
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:08,840
1

619
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,520
The number you have reached

620
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,140
1

621
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,580
3

622
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,200
0

623
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,840
1

624
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,420
3

625
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,220
Is being checked for trouble

626
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,200
Please try your call again later

627
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,760
Bob called to give Enron a break

628
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,600
We know that Bob called to do that

629
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,580
And he said

630
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:30,980
No

631
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,080
No

632
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,620
No

633
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,880
Did anybody call Bob

634
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,560
No

635
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:40,840
No

636
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,820
One final question if I could

637
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,640
No

638
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,640
Okay

639
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,020
Did Bob call you to give Enron a break

640
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,800
Well we

641
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,740
Of when

642
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,400
We

643
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,580
And I've testified that

644
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,620
We was hard

645
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,580
We were hard

646
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:00,580


647
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,460
I'm sorry

648
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,100
You said no

649
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,680
No

650
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,440
Okay

651
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,880
No

652
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,720
And you were having calls from Bob

653
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,880
Asking you to hold off on your

654
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,120
Downgrading of Bob at that time

655
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,360
Um

656
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,180
Um

657
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,720
We were

658
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,740
Um

659
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,240
Going to downgrade

660
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,820
Um

661
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,620
No

662
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,620
Thank you

663
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,100
Do you think Bob made a mistake

664
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,300
No

665
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:30,560
No

666
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:30,720
No

667
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,000
No

668
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,200
No

669
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,580
Uh

670
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,280
Uh

671
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,220
To that extent

672
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,560
I do agree with Chairman Bob

673
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,600
I wonder whenever

674
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,440
Oh I wonder

675
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,480
Stop

676
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,620
Well we're back to where we were once before

677
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,880
I have not

678
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,620
Not have I ever been a member of the Communist Party

679
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,620
But I have been a member

680
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,040
Of a subjugated

681
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,680
Wang yak

682
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,300
Dick yak

683
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,420
Ding dang dang party

684
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,620
At the church of the subgenius festivities

685
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,860
Late last year

686
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,240
Oh

687
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,500
And believe me

688
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,840
If you want real workers paradise

689
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,020
You'll find it in a slimy hot tub

690
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,460
Filled with crazed people

691
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,560
If you dare call them people

692
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,720
But the slime is really good

693
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,700
It's a slimy slime

694
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,260
Like tons and tons and tons of sweet steak

695
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,340
Sweet steak

696
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,740
Yes the same slime that oozes from your television screens

697
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,180
From your radios

698
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:28,500
From your sitting by your seats

699
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,260
I feel like I'm getting religion now

700
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,340
I feel like we're getting religion

701
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,000
It's just the wiki speaking

702
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,740
I drank the poison wiki

703
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,940
All you children

704
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,480
All of you squeal like pigs

705
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,760
Why don't you just drop them pants now boy

706
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,980
How now you pinky brown sow

707
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,600
I was blind but now I see

708
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,220
Like the blind man with the long hair

709
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:00,240
Like the blind man with the long hair

710
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,300
I'm a demon but I give the light back to

711
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,800
A sin in the name of my position

712
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,520
Now in front of the auto festering festering clock

713
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,500
This is gross

714
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,320
I'm gross

715
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,200
My guest today is the man who was killed

716
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,660
All right

717
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,300
Shut up

718
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,180
Shut up

719
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,760
Shut up

720
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,320
Oh shut up

721
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,220
Um

722
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,380
You know I'd actually like to ask you about

723
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,480
Let me get this

724
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,440
All right

725
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,180
All right

726
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,560
All right

727
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:28,920
Uh

728
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,100
oh, you're gone.

729
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,200
I guess that's the answer to that question.

730
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,340
He's walked out.

731
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,220
Does he have a job?

732
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,400
No, I have a life.

733
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,680
Why don't you get a band?

734
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,120
I don't need one.

735
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,800
What do you sound like?

736
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,640
Something you hate.

737
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,920
Who is this guy?

738
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,320
They call me man.

739
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,420
Yeah, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

740
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,460
Go fuck yourself.

741
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,820
How much do you make?

742
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,960
Plenty of sun.

743
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,360
How many have you sold?

744
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,040
All of my shame.

745
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,960
Who do you know?

746
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,200
I know you're full of shit.

747
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,580
What have you done?

748
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,860
I've thrown it all away.

749
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:30,720
I'll put it on the floor.

750
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,000
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

751
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,180
Go fuck yourself.

752
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,360
Yeah, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

753
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,480
Go fuck yourself.

754
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,060
Fuck yourself.

755
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,280
You, uh, like him young, Bob?

756
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,920
when you met Bob?

757
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,120
Bob is innocent.

758
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,520
It's like they're trying to fulfill a twisted,

759
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,700
sadomasochistic fantasy.

760
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,440
Some people derive sexual pleasure

761
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,160
through inflicting physical, emotional abuse.

762
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,000
Oh, God, no.

763
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,740
No, I swear to you.

764
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,840
Bob didn't do anything like that.

765
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,980
Bob's cold, manipulative.

766
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,700
Bob is innocent.

767
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,440
Bob tells you how to think, how to feel, how to act.

768
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,540
Without him, you're worthless, nothing.

769
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,220
If she knew Bob was involved, she would have confessed.

770
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,680
Bob didn't do it.

771
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,300
Bob is innocent.

772
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,180
I went to medical school for two years.

773
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,380
Maybe Bob did this without you knowing.

774
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,520
Oh, God, no.

775
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,440
Bob is innocent.

776
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,140
Bob is innocent.

777
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,900
Bob is innocent.

778
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,200
Maybe Bob's not a sadomasochistic thrill killer.

779
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,280
Maybe he's just an asshole.

780
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,000
Probably, this is the only asshole we've got.

781
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,100
Bob is innocent.

782
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,220
Bob is innocent.

783
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,000
Bob is innocent.

784
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,000


785
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,000


786
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,000


787
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,000


788
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,960
Bobby's right about you all along.

789
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,300
No.

790
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,000
Oh, damn it.

791
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,980
Don't lie to me.

792
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,260
Bob is innocent.

793
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,740
Bob is innocent.

794
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,900
Maybe Bob is not a assho pearlsed Kindergarten вышman...

795
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,040
No.

796
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,100
But the biggest sadomasochistic tendency

797
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,200
has continued its Karen,

798
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,960
Bob is innocent.

799
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,440
Bob tells you how to think, how to feel, how to act.

800
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,140
Without him, you're worthless.

801
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,460
Bob tells you how to feel, how to act.

802
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,120
Without him, you're worthless.

803
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,340
Bob is innocent.

804
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:53,840
Bob is innocent.

805
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,120
Bob is innocent.

806
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,680
How old were you when you met Bob?

807
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,620
Just before Christmas, Bob followed through.

808
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:06,080
He walked into this bank north of Seattle and left with nearly $26,000,

809
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,620
which he stashed in a child's trick-or-treat bag.

810
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,240
Bob had good reason to smile again.

811
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,060
Oh, yes, friends, Lee Moore did that.

812
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:23,420
And before that, Bob is innocent by the great, the great El Queso All-Stars,

813
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,080
who've really been on a tear lately.

814
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,140
Before that, we heard Man.

815
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,500
Oh, bummer.

816
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,520
Beer4Man.com.

817
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,400
And before that, Heart Ignition.

818
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,800
This music in the background is by Automatic Robot Fish.

819
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,720
And now for a smoke.

820
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:49,680
Good.

821
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:51,940
Good.

822
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,100
Good heavens, Doctor.

823
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:54,740
What are these?

824
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,400
This is good smoke.

825
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,060
Good.

826
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:00,540
Oh.

827
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,620
Good.

828
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,200
Good smoke.

829
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,400
You try.

830
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,860
Good, good.

831
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,000
Oh.

832
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,720
Good.

833
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,880
Oh.

834
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,440
Anyway, friends, back to the subject.

835
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:00,980
Farts.

836
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,180
What?

837
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,920
Oh, wait.

838
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,220
No, that was good.

839
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,900
Did somebody just cut one?

840
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,640
Or did the pipe just take a puff?

841
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,820
A bomb?

842
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,240
Friends, we must not let the pipe go out.

843
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,740
We cannot let that thing stop smoking.

844
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,560
Now, luckily, Bob will be there long after the rest of us, I'm sure.

845
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,040
But some of us really do this.

846
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,360
I've done this myself.

847
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,380
You end up looking at pictures of Bob going, look how stupid that Bob looks.

848
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,940
He looks so stupid just grinning like that.

849
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,260
He looks so stupid I could just sit here looking at him looking stupid forever.

850
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,760
That's the subgenius in slack, friends.

851
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,520
That is when you have truly achieved slack.

852
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,300
As Bob said to me.

853
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:52,540
Oh, no.

854
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,500
The subgenius is pre-target.

855
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,360
We'd rather be stupid than they're smart.

856
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,120
We pay for a subscription to know what we really think.

857
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,140
I guess that's why they call it subgenius.

858
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,380
But really, are the normals that much smarter than us, though?

859
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,500
Have you watched TV lately?

860
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,880
You know, the less you watch it,

861
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,440
the more screwed up it seems when you do watch it.

862
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,860
And I'll sit there watching something.

863
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,360
What are those dumb shows?

864
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,540
Well, one of those dumb shows.

865
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,120
Like the Anna Nicole Smith show.

866
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,420
My cousin, by the way.

867
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,720
And maybe one of those dating shows.

868
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,200
Whatever.

869
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,020
Jerry Springer.

870
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,740
Any of that stuff.

871
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,900
And you end up going, God, I cannot believe how stupid this is.

872
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,940
People actually watch this?

873
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,540
They must really be stupid.

874
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,320
I'm going to keep sitting here watching this just to...

875
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,120
to ponder how stupid everybody must be.

876
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:00,460
And you could sit there forever thinking about how stupid they look,

877
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,020
looking at that stupid thing.

878
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:09,900
It's gotten to where they gloat brazenly, openly, about what cows we are.

879
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,260
What cow we are.

880
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,760
It's like the television admits what they're doing.

881
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,820
Break free of the matrix, it says, after this message.

882
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,680
Don't touch that dot.

883
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,540
Stay tuned.

884
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,300
And then...

885
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,020
And then we'll show you the matrix so you'll know how your mind has been controlled.

886
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:26,960
Ugh.

887
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,500
Reality TV.

888
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,120
Actually, it's not a bad idea.

889
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,380
If you think about it, a lot of what they were acting out at scripting was not as interesting

890
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:41,240
as plain, ordinary human beings acting like human beings.

891
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:46,760
You know, that can be just as dumb as anything a script maker can come up with.

892
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,260
The Church of the Subgenius is here to prove that.

893
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,820
There's a...

894
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,260
There's a fellow down in Texas.

895
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,860
They say his name is Bob.

896
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,880
He tells me I should slack off.

897
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,000
I should quit my job.

898
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,860
Well, I'm a subgenius.

899
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,220
And I must have my slack.

900
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,460
If I don't live forever.

901
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,820
I...

902
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,980
I get my money back.

903
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,040
I get my money back.

904
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:39,120
They said that on July 5th of 1998, the earth would meet destruction.

905
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,260
Suffer a deadly fate.

906
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,560
That day was long away.

907
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,740
Now it has come and gone.

908
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,080
There was no fire from heaven.

909
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,620
And this old world rolls on.

910
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,020
Well, I'm a subgenius.

911
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,880
And I must have my slack.

912
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,680
If I don't live forever.

913
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,820
I get my money back.

914
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,100
Poor stank.

915
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,300
made to suffer a terrible disgrace.

916
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,880
A terrible disgrace.

917
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,340
Of such humiliation.

918
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,200
Humiliation.

919
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,020
He feared to show his face.

920
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:45,180
Now Bob may be laughing because we are such chumps.

921
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,400
Chumps.

922
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,980
But there is no reason to be down in the dumps.

923
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,020
It'll all still happen.

924
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,280
No need to curse or frown.

925
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,820
They got all the right numbers.

926
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,800
Just got them upside down.

927
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,380
Well, I'm a subgenius.

928
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,260
And I must tell myself.

929
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,240
I'm a subgenius.

930
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:18,240


931
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,600
If I don't live forever.

932
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:26,220
I get my money back.

933
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:42,680
I get my money back.

934
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,880
neighbourless

935
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,180
Covid-19

936
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,700
Fever

937
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,320
You're probably wondering why I'm here

938
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,920
And so am I, so am I

939
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:38,420
Just as much as you wonder

940
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,780
About me being in this place

941
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,440
That's just how much I marvel

942
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,640
At the lameness on your face

943
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,100
You rise each day the same old way

944
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,040
And join your friends out on the street

945
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,500
Spray your hair and think you're neat

946
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,240
I think your life is incomplete

947
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:09,320
But maybe that's not for me to say

948
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,820
They only pay me here to play

949
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,400
Yeah

950
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:13,920
Yeah

951
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:15,420
Yeah

952
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


953
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


954
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


955
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


956
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


957
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


958
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


959
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


960
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


961
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


962
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


963
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


964
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


965
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


966
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


967
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


968
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


969
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


970
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


971
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


972
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,420


973
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,220
I want to hear a caravan with a drum solo

974
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:22,300
You're probably wondering why I'm here

975
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,960
And so am I, so am I

976
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,500
Just as much as you wonder

977
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,860
About me staring back at you

978
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,680
Yeah

979
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,560
That's just how much I question

980
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,700
The corny things you do

981
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,200
You paint your face and then you chase

982
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,420
To meet the gang where the action is

983
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,920
Stomp all night and drink your fizz

984
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,140
Roll your car and say gee whiz

985
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,540
You tore a big hole in your convertible top

986
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,260
What will you tell your mom

987
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:14,660
And your dad?

988
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,020
And pop

989
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,040
Mom, I tore a big hole in the convertible

990
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,560
You're probably wondering why I'm here

991
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,180
And so am I, so am I

992
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,360
Just as much as you wonder

993
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:34,080
If I mean to be here

994
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,820
Just as much as you wonder

995
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,180
If I mean just what I say

996
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,880
That's just how much I question

997
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,980
The social games you play

998
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,500
You told your mom you're stoked on Tom

999
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,400
And went for a bruise in Freddy's car

1000
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,060
You told your mom you're stoked on Tom

1001
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:04,480
And went for a bruise in Freddy's car

1002
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,100
Tom is asking where you are

1003
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,240
You boogied all night in a cheesy bar

1004
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,940
Plastic boots and plastic hat

1005
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,400
And you think you know where it's at

1006
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:28,980
You're probably wondering why I'm here

1007
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,200
Not that it makes a heck of a lot of difference to you

1008
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,520
What is Dobstown?

1009
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,260
Written by New Monet

1010
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:45,720
Improviseried by Ice Stag

1011
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,380
And Lonesome Cowboy Day

1012
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:02,520
What is Dobstown?

1013
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,600
What is, then, Dobstown?

1014
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,280
It is the stuff that dreams are made of

1015
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,800
It's what makes Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys fly

1016
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,160
It powers the Starship Enterprise

1017
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,080
It's the hidden code in Windows and Mac OS

1018
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,200
Though not yet available in Linux

1019
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,200
It's the general oblivion

1020
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,360
Crazy when the moon dance strikes the cornea of your head

1021
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,080
Dobstown

1022
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,060
Dobstown

1023
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,700
It's the cancer-causing, teeth-staining, smelly, pukey habit

1024
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,320
It's the drug that helps you find God

1025
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,960
It's the lonely night before that never, never ends

1026
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,620
Dobstown

1027
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,020
It is your brain on drugs

1028
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:53,280
It's learning to work as a team and as a slave

1029
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,360
It's where there is a lake in which resides the sword Excalibur

1030
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,760
Kept by the lady of the lake, Connie Dobbs

1031
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,060
And if you think it's hard to pull that stone from out of the lake, then you're wrong

1032
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:04,060


1033
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:08,000
If you pull that sword out of that lake, it's easy to pull a fig from a donkey's anus

1034
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,980
Dobstown

1035
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,220
It is where all the flowers have gone

1036
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:16,560
It is the home of John Dillinger's real penis

1037
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,080
Dobstown

1038
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,620
It is a mystery, wrapped in an enigma

1039
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:25,060
Smothered with sautéed mushrooms and onions in a savory gravy

1040
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:26,760
Dobstown

1041
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,180
It is John Dillinger's penis

1042
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:34,040
Savaged in muscular gravy and surrounded by mushroom peels

1043
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,520
Dobstown

1044
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,100
The home of both Lemurians and Cenobites

1045
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,360
My proper home! I'm going back someday!

1046
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,300
I've got to get back to my home!

1047
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,680
Dobstown

1048
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:54,120
It's near the coast of Hanalei and the land of Fredonia

1049
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,100
Dobstown

1050
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,020
It's the world's largest producer of manna, ambrosia, frop, and the green sea

1051
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:08,000
Stuff that Dave injects into the brain to reanimate dead tissue

1052
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,180
Spiritual bliss with open-loam bowling every night from midnight to dawn

1053
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:15,800
Dobstown

1054
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,660
It's the residence of J.R. Bob Dobbs, part of the year

1055
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,960
It's creamy and crunchy

1056
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,900
It tastes great and is less filling

1057
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,860
It is margarine and it is butter

1058
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:32,880
But if it were to fall into enemy hands, it would mean the destruction of us all!

1059
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,960
Oh, yes, dang, but it is the downfall of us all

1060
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,100
And it tastes bad on bread

1061
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,500
Because, man, those that go don't come back

1062
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,500
They're losers, losers

1063
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,940
No, man, those who graduate from Dobstown come back changed

1064
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,780
In a new form

1065
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:55,080
You can't see them like you can see others

1066
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,700
Graduated like the chrysalis to the elf

1067
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,460
All the way up to a higher being

1068
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,100
They grow and grow

1069
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:07,300
Their tiny skin's hardly large enough to pop them

1070
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:11,200
As they begin expanding into that new form

1071
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,440
Dobstown!

1072
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:19,300
It's where UFOs are not just a fact of life

1073
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,160
They're the law

1074
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,680
Of course it's a law here

1075
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,140
Of course it's a law

1076
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:30,320
Everyone needs to live by laws, by rules

1077
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,080
We need to have our lives governed by laws

1078
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,220
And we need to have our lives governed by laws

1079
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,520
Dobstown!

1080
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,940
It's where the bad little girls and boys go

1081
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,660
It's where something is happening all the time

1082
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,180
And most of it unsolved

1083
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:49,780
Some of it is so hard to locate

1084
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,340
Many of the people from the Saucership Emblem itself

1085
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,980
Have been sucked out and left here

1086
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:59,260
Dobstown!

1087
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,460
I didn't want them to be oblique

1088
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,660
When they were strapped me down in a chair

1089
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,920
And started asking me questions about

1090
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,660
Dobstown

1091
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,240
I gave them literally a location but the

1092
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,040
The website

1093
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,340
Dobstown!

1094
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,060
It's Nwatsbod spelled backwards

1095
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,100
It's Brigadoon without the haggis

1096
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,120
It is surrounded by the seven cities of Cibola

1097
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,520
Which are its slums

1098
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,060
And it has a ferry to Monster Island

1099
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,040
And what a delightful pair of individuals

1100
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,000
You'll never find there

1101
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,760
The ferries of Monster Island

1102
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,880
Tiny little happy people

1103
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,200
Who do things for other people

1104
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,220
Who live for other people

1105
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,920
So big are their hearts

1106
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,820
And so tiny is their stature

1107
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,660
They can't get it

1108
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,780
What did you do?

1109
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,460
Dobstown!

1110
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,060
That's where Amelia Earhart crashed friends

1111
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:58,040
It's where the Tunguska meteorite came out

1112
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:58,040


1113
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,180
After bouncing around inside the earth for a while

1114
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:04,900
Yes, if you were waiting for another salubrious comment

1115
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,840
Could this someway illuminate that stupid passage

1116
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,340
Just read it again, Stan

1117
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,660
Just see what you just said

1118
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:14,480
What, the Dobstown is where the Tunguska meteorite came out

1119
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,380
After bouncing around inside the planet for a while

1120
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:21,340
The Tunguska meteorite was of course

1121
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,740
As you know from reading your book of the subgenius, Dave

1122
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,780
Was a miniature black hole

1123
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,820
It's shot by

1124
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,580
Dobbs, the young 10 year old J.R. Bob Dobbs

1125
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,480
From his slingshot

1126
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,720
In a completely by accident

1127
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,460
In a fit of rage?

1128
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,500
No, he didn't even know he was doing it

1129
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,240
It was just, you know, I mean he picked up a

1130
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,640
Other kids might pick up a pebble or

1131
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,200
A cat skull for their slingshot

1132
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,880
Yeah, a cat skull, that makes a lot more sense

1133
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,120
A tiny black hole

1134
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:47,720
A pressle

1135
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,760
A singularity

1136
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,240
A singularity

1137
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,600
The glowing essence of nothingness

1138
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,260
Sucking in all that is not Bob

1139
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,800
And that is what he shot

1140
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,800
Into the Tunguska meteorite

1141
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,660
The Tunguska plains of Siberia

1142
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,360
And then past the event horizon

1143
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,580
The little thing itself went

1144
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,440
And then became like a bigger thing

1145
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,960
And it went into the earth

1146
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,860
Bob's tiny black hole did

1147
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:13,920
And it bounced around like a cue ball on a pool table

1148
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,140
Back and forth until finally it exited

1149
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,060
At the place we now know as

1150
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,520
Dobbs Town!

1151
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,120
Dobbs Town, friends!

1152
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:27,380
It is where a thing of beauty is a joy for a while

1153
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:30,180
It's where you are better than you were in high school

1154
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,300
It's where you get all the pets you ever wanted

1155
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,400
It was never a colony of France

1156
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,020
It is where science and magic are the same things

1157
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:43,080
It is the unfolding of miscalculations

1158
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:50,620
It is the dawning of the height, weight, hair and eye color of Aquarius

1159
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:57,100
It is the fizzling, crackling, ebony horizon for man

1160
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,860
It is the fifth vortex disrupting the harmonic convergence

1161
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:05,040
It is where the early worm gets away

1162
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:09,860
It is where the gravediggers leave their shoes in the middle of the night

1163
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,460
Dobbs Town!

1164
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,620
It is for when you are too lazy to kill yourself

1165
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,900
Dobbs Town!

1166
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,340
Where there are no lawyers

1167
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,920
And where the government never tries to be helpful

1168
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:24,880
Dobbs Town, friends!

1169
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,160
It's where you can make your imaginary friends fight to the death

1170
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,620
Dobbs Town!

1171
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,700
It's between the dark and daylight

1172
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,220
When the night is beginning to lower

1173
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:39,000
It is where neither heredity nor environment matter

1174
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:47,940
It is where the lamb and the lion lay down and have sex together, friends

1175
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,220
Dobbs Town!

1176
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,940
It is proof

1177
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,600
That hell is full

1178
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,800
And the dead walk the earth

1179
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,840
The fabric is what cling

1180
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,300
Like yourself

1181
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,580
What thread can back it in to thousands of other threads

1182
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:19,120
That is our caustic solution for you as members of this solemn group gathered together

1183
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,060
Squandered and quashed and pushed under heavy stones

1184
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,780
So that you may not know the truth that we speak

1185
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,660
And yet here we are

1186
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,020
Speaking it to you

1187
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:33,560
Dobbs Town is not a place where a man or woman dwells

1188
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,820
But a place in the heart

1189
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,860
As big as that mighty elephant yoke

1190
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:41,840
And twice as tasty as all the trees that you could imagine

1191
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,860
Now imagination is not a place you want to stay

1192
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:51,740
It's not a place you want to bring the kids, grandma, and ride the ferris wheel with

1193
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:55,360
It's not the kind of place you want to leave for a better home

1194
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,220
It's a place you visit

1195
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,280
Over and over again

1196
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,340
With your pants on, your pants off

1197
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:05,660
And your heart ripped right out hanging from your chest

1198
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:09,600
Dobbs Town

1199
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,180
Where Bob comes home

1200
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,260
After an easy day's work

1201
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,240
And where you can come home too, friends

1202
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,420
Where you'll be home

1203
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:25,140
Where you'll finally realize why

1204
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,560
Why

1205
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,040
Why

1206
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:33,220
And why you can find out more about beautiful Dobbs Town

1207
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:36,060
When you join the Church of the Subgenius

1208
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:43,120
The world's only first, true, last, final, one, true religion

1209
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,800
Because it admits it is full of crap

1210
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,020
It is the only one that's not!

1211
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:50,900
It's full of crap!

1212
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,020
And age, I know it's coming

1213
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,520
Each time I can tell it

1214
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,500
You tell it

1215
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,860
Ha ha!

1216
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,580
Go!

1217
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:07,820
It's where Ennio Morricone was delivered of his inspiration for this music in the background

1218
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,880
Huge, huge mandibles

1219
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,260
Large, large, fresh, gamy legs

1220
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:19,340
And now the matador Dobbs steps out before the enraged triceratops dinosaur

1221
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:24,560
Flashing his red Dobbs-headed cape in front of the maddened beast

1222
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:29,000
The furious creature stomps its feet and paws at the ground

1223
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,580
Dobbs grins, he smokes, the creature charges!

1224
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:38,520
Dobbs whips out his pipe and gives it a little conk on the noggin as it runs by

1225
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,100
And after that

1226
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:45,280
It sits and pants like a little puppy dog

1227
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,140
The great ignorance is at its reception

1228
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,000
Dobbs kicks an un Means particles with her hand

1229
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,820
The mattress on Huh?

1230
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:11,780
That's not what Dorothy played, is it?

1231
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:12,040


1232
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,840
Wi-fi

1233
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,000
Speaker

1234
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,000


1235
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,300
That's a Agreed

1236
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,740
Uh-oh!

1237
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:17,580
Helena?

1238
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,420
Well, goodbye now.

1239
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:22,700
Stop it.

1240
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:36,480
And I say as long as you're alive, shout, make noise, or whatever, because we'll shut up like hell.
