1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,080
It's my nightmare, crawling, slithering, along the edge.

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:23,800
It's my nightmare, crawling, slithering, along the edge of a straight razor.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,740
Just listen. Everyone be calm and just relax and be seated if you would please.

4
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,820
Because, you see, one of the things that...

5
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:43,260
Tell me why you make the pain if we are your children.

6
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,580
Ah, you see, you are my children, but law is necessary.

7
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:50,820
Tell me.

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,380
If there is no more pain,

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,240
then is there no more law?

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,800
There is always law.

11
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:19,740
I watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor, crawling, slithering.

12
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:27,280
Along the edge of a straight razor.

13
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,500
And surviving.

14
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,060
Transmission 11, receive 68, December 30, 0500 hours.

15
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,560
Sector King, Zulu King.

16
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,560
Yes, and praise Bob.

17
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,080
Yes!

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,500
430.

19
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,020
430 in the morning.

20
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,960
Time for show.

21
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,520
Live show for you now.

22
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,560
Self is an infant.

23
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,560
How come always scary on show, says Doug Smith of Dallas, Texas?

24
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,620
Well, it's actually been some time since scary has been on the show.

25
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,820
We've tried to get him to come in, but he always has to go out smurfing through the solar system on his wind surfboard.

26
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,340
His solar wind surfer is 40 feet long.

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,000
Hey, strap in.

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,140
Show's about to take off.

29
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,720
About two and a half miles in wind.

30
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,220
Magnetic power.

31
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:21,940
Bob?

32
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,940
Oh, my God, the pilot's dead.

33
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,020
Gosh.

34
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:33,960
Welcome to the subgenius radio beast, Hour of Slap.

35
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,500
Rebound time.

36
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:45,440
This is actually Hour of Slap number 679 from April 1999.

37
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,560
Closing as Hour of Slap number 179.

38
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,740
2014 in the year of 2005 A.D.

39
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:02,080
As it says in Isaiah 28, 7, 8.

40
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,040
The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink.

41
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,280
They are swallowed up with wine.

42
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,480
They're out of the way through strong drink.

43
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,220
They err in vision.

44
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,900
They stumble in judgment.

45
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,900
For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness.

46
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,120
And there is no place clean.

47
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,360
Yes.

48
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,160
We're being over.

49
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,300
Shut that baby up in there.

50
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,880
Babies, they get into all the subgenius shows.

51
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,180
But we will not let babies stop us.

52
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,660
We will continue the battle.

53
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,740
Let mortal combat begin.

54
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,080
Yes, praise Bob.

55
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,460
We're going to save the world.

56
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,580
A handful of people in a leaky boat are going to save the world.

57
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,880
And fuck me.

58
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,260
Uh, yes dear friends, we're back and oh, it's going to be a wonderful show now that we have

59
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,660
these departments and we have a format and everything.

60
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,620
Isn't that unbelievable?

61
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,360
All men and women defending your own world.

62
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,620
It's not about death.

63
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,400
It's about life.

64
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,260
Life.

65
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,560
Hey, life.

66
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,560
And in this new studio, friends, it's great because I don't feel guilty.

67
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,860
It's fun to do the show again.

68
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,680
Yes, it's fun, fun, fun.

69
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,040
And we have so many fun types and a fun format.

70
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,780
And we shall engage now and forever in mortal combat against God and all of the heavens

71
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,480
and all of the people in all of the worlds and all of the planets.

72
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,640
Praise Bob.

73
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,040
Yeah.

74
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,420
The conspiracy is no metaphor.

75
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,520
We talk about the conspiracy.

76
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,680
Are we discussing some literary poetic monster?

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,160
Say no.

78
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,900
Say no.

79
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,300
Say no.

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,260
No, we're not children.

81
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,680
We're talking about living, breathing, firing and giving us pain.

82
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,460
That wants to consume you.

83
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,440
That wants to take away your slack, children.

84
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,560
Are we going to let this go?

85
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,480
Take away your slack?

86
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,920
Say no.

87
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,600
Say no.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,640
Say no.

89
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,400
Tell me something.

90
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,220
Who stands in the way of the conspiracy?

91
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,620
Who?

92
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:30,980
Who?

93
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,340
I can't hear you.

94
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,880
Tell me who.

95
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,340
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

96
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,420
Not me, not me.

97
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,520
Not, not, not me, not me.

98
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,700
Not me, not me.

99
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,660
Not, not, not me.

100
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,700
Not me, not me.

101
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,300
We see a flock of birds.

102
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,020
Think about.

103
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:48,980
Think about.

104
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,480
We need to just run.

105
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,480
Out of words.

106
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,120
Think about.

107
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,360
Think about.

108
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,560
When a ring goes round your car.

109
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,620
When you hear a given call.

110
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,700
When you ride chicks for a dollar.

111
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,480
Think about.

112
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,560
Think about.

113
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,580
When you ride to the subgenius.

114
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,640
Think about.

115
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,680
Think about.

116
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,000
B.O. Box 1403-06.

117
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,900
Think about.

118
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,540
When you cast your mojo hexes.

119
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,460
When you ride through Dallas, Texas.

120
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,080
When you.

121
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,200
Think about.

122
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,300
Think about.

123
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:18,420


124
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,760
Think about.

125
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:19,920
Think about.

126
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,380
One dollar.

127
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,360
One dollar.

128
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,400
One dollar.

129
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,600
One dollar.

130
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,460
One dollar.

131
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,740
Now, next when you turn it to the subgenius is.

132
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,520
And how in THE world comes that game?

133
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,900
You will pay to know what you really think.

134
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,020
And when you underrate, you will pay for what you really think.

135
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,000
Slack can be bought.

136
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,720
B.O. Box 1703-06 is.

137
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
B.O. Box 1703-06 is.

138
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,520
You are gonna meditate for 5 years.

139
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,440
You gonna get down.

140
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:58,500
You gotta do this, you gotta do that, you gotta forsake strong liquor, you gotta forsake sex.

141
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,240
We don't, you don't need any of that to be happy.

142
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,360
You don't need any of that for slack.

143
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,580
All you need is money.

144
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,800
I don't care.

145
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,540
I don't care, I don't care what lengths I go to anymore.

146
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,760
All is fair and all that.

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,220
Dr. Harris, you're a doctor.

148
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,140
A doctor.

149
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,900
Doesn't that mean anything to you as a surgeon?

150
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,360
I'm not a doctor, Edith, but I'm a man also.

151
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,300
You're under arrest!

152
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,980
Something sick.

153
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,260
Something sordid, vicious, and depraved.

154
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,380
Vagina.

155
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,860
Vagina.

156
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,840
V-A-G-I-N-A.

157
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,300
It's a canal-like passage between the uterus and an opening between the uterus legs.

158
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,960
It's the place where sperm are deposited by the father in the maiden in the passage

159
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,380
towards the baby who passes into the normal when he was born.

160
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,120
Testicles.

161
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,720
Testicles.

162
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,980
Spelled T-E-N-G.

163
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,980
King of the Leucane.

164
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,420
But we must kill them.

165
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,940
We must incinerate them.

166
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,120
Pig after pig.

167
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,120
Cow after cow.

168
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,540
Villagrass and virgs.

169
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,400
Army after army.

170
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,560
And they call me an assassin.

171
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,200
What do you call it?

172
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,160
When the assassins accuse the assassin.

173
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,180
They lie.

174
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,160
They lie and we have to be merciful for those who lie.

175
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,340
Those nabobs.

176
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,500
Nabobs.

177
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,600
Nabobs.

178
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,640
I hate them.

179
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,520
I do hate them.

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,160
I do hate them.

181
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,400
I love you.

182
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,880
I love you.

183
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,420
I love you.

184
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:47,420


185
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,120
I love you.

186
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,120
I love you.

187
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,000
I love you!

188
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,620
I love you!

189
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,160
I love you!

190
00:08:59,340 --> 00:08:59,340


191
00:08:59,340 --> 00:08:59,920
I love you.

192
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,100
I love you.

193
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,340
I love you.

194
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,100
I love you.

195
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,360
I love you.

196
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,320
Oh, the lilting.

197
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,380
The benches are torn down.

198
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,540
This is a free concert.

199
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,840
The lilting sounds of Doc Stock number three.

200
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,060
Oh, friends.

201
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,200
Boy, is this a trip through memory lane.

202
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,120
There's some bad A going around.

203
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,340
Anybody's got any of this?

204
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,460
Give it to Jane.

205
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,460
Oh, listen to that lovely, typical doctor music in the old days.

206
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,640
They all learned how to play their instruments, unfortunately.

207
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,080
Then there was the more ascended music.

208
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,300
Mark Mothersbaugh did at one point.

209
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,940
It's a bucolic scene here at Doc Stock 93.

210
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:14,940
Jim.

211
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,260
Everybody's tired from driving.

212
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,760
They're all sitting around with needles hanging out of their arms.

213
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,940
And it's all free and you missed it.

214
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,980
Pretty soon all the stimulants will be here.

215
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,420
And then we'll all wake up and party all night.

216
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,760
And someone or maybe several people will be badly injured.

217
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,800
And the police will come.

218
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,620
And we'll be in the newspapers.

219
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,380
And it'll be another Doc Stock.

220
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,680
Another wonderful, lovely Doc Stock.

221
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,060
Oh.

222
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,300
Doesn't it make you tears well up in your eyes?

223
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,400
Things get confused out there.

224
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,860
Power, ideals, old morality, and practical military necessity.

225
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,600
But out there with these natives,

226
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,820
it must be a temptation to be God.

227
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,420
Because I hate to say this, but once we did recently,

228
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,880
Jesus got a call at the office from this mom.

229
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,520
She was saying, you can't send this stuff to my child.

230
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,060
It's going to mess him up.

231
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,680
It's really bad.

232
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,320
Jesus is going, well, same thing I have to say to the cops every couple of months.

233
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,100
Have you ever heard of Mad Magazine Officer?

234
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,360


235
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,220
Well, he was starting to do that.

236
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,400
She goes, no, you don't understand.

237
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,460
My son is mentally ill.

238
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,580
He's 40 years old.

239
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,400
He lives at home.

240
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,520
And we're kind of like going, well, I think church is subgenius is the last thing you've got to worry about with your son.

241
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,080
So I don't know.

242
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,160
Maybe you're in the same boat.

243
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,740
I'll tell you what, though.

244
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,380
I do have the, uh, what do you call the 40?

245
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,600
But I'll sneak you a membership pack.

246
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,480
I'll sneak you one.

247
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:21,040
Now, as the church was called by John Shirley, I think the science fiction writer said,

248
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,880
the church of the subgenius is the knife they smuggle in with the straight jacket.

249
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,020
So you can cut yourself free when they're not looking.

250
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,400
But friends, you can't depend on anybody to smuggle you that knife.

251
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,980
You have to learn how to escape from the straight jacket yourself.

252
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,920
I actually happened to have an instructional video in Dallas.

253
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,080
How to do that.

254
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,160
I toured with a guy who escaped from straight jackets every night by dislocating his shoulder.

255
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,020
And it works.

256
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,720
But you know, to bust free of the conspiracy, you sometimes have to bust free of parts of your own body.

257
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
That's a grim way to look at it.

258
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,640
Easy for me to say.

259
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,800
The conspiracy is a leg hold trap.

260
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,560
Huh?

261
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,700
The conspiracy is a leg hold trap.

262
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,940
Thank you.

263
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:20,280
You know, the sad thing about the conspiracy is you see these human animals trapped in it.

264
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,440
And they'll have gnawed off all three legs.

265
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,820
And that one leg's still in the damn trap.

266
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,740
That's why we call them humans, friends.

267
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,480
And another real basic thing that we got down to.

268
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,020
You know, we've said for years, church of the subgenius, we're not harping on intelligence.

269
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,340
We certainly cannot afford to do that.

270
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:50,240
The only people that we disqualify from the church are geniuses.

271
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,440
You know, anybody below that with 30 bucks and even, you know, a genius can buy his way in.

272
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,420
Or brain damage his way in.

273
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,640
You know, it's not the intelligence that counts.

274
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,520
It's the sense.

275
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,220
Common sense, sense of humor, and dollars and cents.

276
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,640
One might call it something for nothing.

277
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,120
But the normals.

278
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,040
The mediocritans.

279
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:23,880
The somnambulax and pseudo-sumslans have tried to make it something which we've been led to believe we must work to buy.

280
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,960
It is this yearning for slackness that separates us from them.

281
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,980
The human may live out his entire life in a grinding cycle of slacklessness.

282
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,040
His hours consumed by meaningless toil.

283
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,660
Interspersed with meaningless leisure.

284
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,100
Yet he never feels cheap.

285
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,100


286
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,660
He thinks it's natural.

287
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,480
Perhaps we should pity them.

288
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,900
But face it.

289
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,540
Most people are venal jerks.

290
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,360
Half-witted cattle racing each other to be first to the slaughterhouse.

291
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,660
And stampeding you along with them.

292
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,760
What do you pray?

293
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,380
To walk on a forest.

294
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,740
That is the law.

295
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,100
To slurp up our grapes.

296
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,440
To drink.

297
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,660
That is the law.

298
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,020
We are not men.

299
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,220
To eat flesh.

300
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,320
And fish.

301
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,740
Anytime.

302
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,600
That is the law!

303
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,700
Now I am the law!

304
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,700
None shall escape.

305
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,480
That is the law!

306
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,540
I...

307
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,160
I...

308
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,160


309
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,020
I...

310
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,540
I...

311
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,960
I...

312
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,400
Not to pee on the neighbor's mailbox.

313
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,700
Not to...

314
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,760
Not to shit in the house.

315
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,120
Not to hump the master's leg.

316
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,340
That is the law.

317
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,760
Not to lick one's own genitals in front of company.

318
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,780
That is the law.

319
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,000
Not to gnaw at flea-bonded food.

320
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,900
fights noisily while the master is trying to seduce a female.

321
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,180
That is the law.

322
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,440
We are not men.

323
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,440
Not to grovel and whine piteously for attention.

324
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,460
That is the law.

325
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,500
Not to fight for mailman.

326
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,200
Not to run out into the road in front of cars.

327
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,020
That is the law.

328
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,800
We are not men.

329
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,720
The snake is long.

330
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,400
The snake is old.

331
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,320
The lad is unstarved.

332
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,540
I had an operation.

333
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,100
They tampered with my brain some.

334
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,080
It helped me see the reason

335
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,480
for living in the system.

336
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,500
We've simply done away with unnecessary friction.

337
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,460
If you act like a dumb shit,

338
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,060
they will treat you as an equal.

339
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,860
Now do what they taught you.

340
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,240
Now you do what they taught you.

341
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,660
Now you do what they taught you.

342
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,060
Now you know what they taught you.

343
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,720
Killing in the day, mom.

344
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,700
Killing in the day, mom.

345
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,140
Now you do what they told you.

346
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,860
Now you do what they told you.

347
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,580
Now you do what they told you.

348
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,440
Fools that died, but where are the bad?

349
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,780
They're the trolls in white

350
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,160
Fools who died, are justified

351
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,980
But where are the bad?

352
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,240
They're the trolls in white

353
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,200
They're justified

354
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,320
Fools that died, but where are the bad?

355
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,620
They're the trolls in white

356
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,440
Come on!

357
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,060
Yeah!

358
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,380
Oh, no you don't

359
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,980
We have to work clean on this radio show

360
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,100
The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, friends

361
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,360
And it's about time that I told you what you've been listening to

362
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,160
For the last 20 soft minutes

363
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,420
We've been playing a lot of

364
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,920
Well, you know, friends, I'm sticking with this department's format

365
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,140
Now that we have a format

366
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:43,160
And we've heard a lot of the old-timey media barrage department

367
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,320
In that we've been hearing some tapes from the old Dockstock 3

368
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,460
Back in the olden days, friends

369
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,640
Before there was X-Day Drills

370
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,100
There was Dockstock

371
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,040
And they was smaller, but a lot meaner

372
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,060
And more wiry and uglier

373
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,240
Than X-Day's

374
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,840
And so they were like snails on a straight razor

375
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,860
If you know what I mean

376
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,900
And we've heard some KPFA puzzling evidence

377
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,740
Of Dr. Howell

378
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,920
That's the KPFA radio show

379
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,540
Subgenius show in Berkeley

380
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,900
And it's the old media barrage

381
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,420
It's a barrage of media barrages

382
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,480
Including Pope David Meyer preaching about the con

383
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,880
Somewhere

384
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,040
And it's a barrage of media barrages

385
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,040


386
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,040


387
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,040


388
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,040


389
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,860
An old-timey Bob song

390
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,280
Onan Canobite doing Think a Bob

391
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,440
We heard David Lynch ranting at X-Day

392
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,680
About how slack can be bought

393
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,640
And we heard from the super intro sex barrage

394
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,980
Media barrage number three

395
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,780
Mark Mothersbaugh did the Babacato and Fugue in D minor

396
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,800
And some of that other

397
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,680
We heard yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang

398
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,000
Ranting at Winterstar in 1999

399
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,480
About the three legs and still in the trap

400
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,040
And some outtakes from the subgenius video Arise

401
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,120
The narration about humans, slack and work

402
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,420
We are not men from the island of Dr. Moreau

403
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,140
And the law, the subgenius law

404
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,080
Not to bite the mailman and so forth

405
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,780
From the Einstein secret orchestra rehearsal

406
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,840
Last November 1998

407
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
And in our rock song department

408
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,880
We heard Rage Against the Machine

409
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,020
In an excerpt from the show

410
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,920
Killing in the Name Of

411
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,940
On their first album

412
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,160
In the background right now is

413
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,300
Cypheria doing an instrumental called

414
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,260
Gothic Disturbance

415
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,720
You see, and we'll play some new Bob songs

416
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,860
Probably by Einstein's Secret Orchestra

417
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,760
And have our guest ranter department

418
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,900
And our X-Day hymn department

419
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,020
All the other departments

420
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,660
Because, you know, as George Burns said

421
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,060
With the collapse of vaudeville

422
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,020
New talent has been created

423
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,020


424
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,060
And there's no place to stink

425
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,820
He also said, George Burns, the great George Burns said

426
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,460
Too bad that all the people who know how to run this country

427
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,280
Are busy driving taxis and cutting hair

428
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,020
And posting to alt.slack

429
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,700
And mixing radio shows

430
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,360
Friends, it's true that with the collapse of vaudeville

431
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,600
New talent has no place to stink

432
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,000
Except for the people who are doing it

433
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,000


434
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,280
The church of the subgenius

435
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,780
Friends, stinky new talent

436
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,180
Always can find, well, can find a home here

437
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,920
If it's bad enough

438
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,680
Because we run it through the committee

439
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,040
And a committee is a group that keeps minutes

440
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,740
And loses hours

441
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,820
And radio, like television, is a medium

442
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,800
Because it is neither rare nor well done

443
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,200
Well, the hour of slack is fairly rare

444
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,680
Liberals, as Mort Sahl said

445
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,820
Feel unworthy of their possessions

446
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,960
Whereas conservatives feel they deserve everything they've stolen

447
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,640
Now we the patriopsychotic anarcho-materialists

448
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,120
Just do what we can

449
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,140
That music was about to drive me nuts, friends

450
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,760
And this probably will too

451
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,920
Because I want to go on with some

452
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,180
These are some quotes from a book called

453
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,340
The Death Rocker X

454
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,560
That our friend Death Rocker X

455
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,020
On AOL.com sent to us

456
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,920
Some quotes from the old but wise

457
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,580
Including Henny Youngman who said

458
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,240
I wanted to become an atheist

459
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,900
But I gave up

460
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,040
For they have no holidays

461
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,620
Friends, you can be an atheist and a subgenius

462
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,340
And we've got a lot of holidays

463
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,180
Biggest one being July 5th, 1999

464
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,080
Well, the last holiday actually

465
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,480
Since the world ends that day this year

466
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,320
And in, you know, they call this

467
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,500
The church of the subgenius

468
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,780
Well, you can imagine, friends

469
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,600
We agree with Sam Levinson here

470
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,920
Who said it's so simple to be wise

471
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,960
Just think of something stupid to say

472
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,880
And then don't say it

473
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,040
And on that note, I think I'll shut up

474
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,320
And play this song by Temple Beat

475
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,340
Called

476
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,900
This is an Italian band

477
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,380
And this is a song called

478
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,720
The Brain Cult of Macho Irony

479
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
I stayed up all night

480
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,000
On voyage

481
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,140
I couldn't talk

482
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,160
Nobody made me walk around

483
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,120
Shift the door

484
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,140
Don't worry, God's out

485
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,200
There isn't a taste this in our lives

486
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,760
What did we do?

487
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,800
So pray you, God

488
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,720
Cause mine is famous

489
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,820
It's famous like a dog

490
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,260
On voyage

491
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,460
I'm getting tired

492
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,560
No money makes the world go around

493
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,260
Shift the door

494
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,300
Don't worry, God's out

495
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,280
There isn't a taste this in our lives

496
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,520
This is our time

497
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,380
We're alive

498
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,880
Stay down, you can't go out

499
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,100
This is our time

500
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,360
Where I

501
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,640
Stay down, you can't go out

502
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,100
This is our time

503
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,200
Where I

504
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,680
Stay down, you can't go out

505
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,100
This is our time

506
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,100
Where I

507
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,220
Stay down, you can't go out

508
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,900
Just believe me

509
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,100
This is our chance

510
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:03,740


511
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:03,740


512
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:10,440
We're going around

513
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,260
We're headed up

514
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,280
We're going kilometers

515
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:14,320
This is our time

516
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:14,340
Where the world's tomorrow

517
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,700
Fades away

518
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,200
We won't be apart

519
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:26,040
No more will you say

520
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:32,900
Decide all the time when I speed uncomplies

521
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:40,900
Decide all the time when I speed uncomplies

522
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:48,480
Decide all the time when I speed uncomplies

523
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:56,020
Decide all the time when I speed uncomplies

524
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:04,020
Decide all the time when I speed uncomplies

525
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,660
Decide

526
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,760
Not to correct the boss

527
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,440
Not to cheat on taxes, that is the law

528
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,220
Not to dodge the trap, that is the law

529
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,520
Not to have extramarital affairs, that is the law

530
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,920
We are not mad

531
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:29,120
Not to make your hair grow long and shaggy

532
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,020
Not to go without makeup, that is the law

533
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,720
Not to go without a nice suit

534
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,580
Not to curse in mixed company, that is the law

535
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,420
We are not mad

536
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,700
Not to place the fork on the right

537
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,400
Not to neglect sending out thank you notes

538
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,280
After Christmas, that is the law

539
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,580
We are not mad

540
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,260
Thank you

541
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,440
Goodness gracious, what a simply horrible patchwork of noise

542
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,540
That church of the subgenius is

543
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,980
I listen every week to gather evidence and ammunition

544
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,240
For the citizens for normalcy

545
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,440
Let me tell you, we're not going to get those subgeniuses

546
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,980
We're gonna get them right in the gonads

547
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,320
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that

548
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,100
I don't use words like that

549
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:25,920
This tape, all about Satanism, drugs, and rock and roll

550
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,300
Is proof positive that this so-called church

551
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,280
Is going to send the world to heck in a handbasket

552
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,160
All those demented Beelzebub kissing hop heads

553
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,820
Make me want to toss my Nestle's dollhouse cookies

554
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,680
With their talk of buckets of pills

555
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,500
From that low-life pusher J.R. Bob Dobbs

556
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,220
Boy, they're so high on drugs

557
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,460
That they can't even keep an earful of them

558
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,880
They've got a lot of body continuity in their tapes

559
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,000
Too many children listen to these tapes

560
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,140
And subscribe to the insane doctrines of the subgenius foundation

561
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,040
They're led down a deceptive road

562
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,320
To what these weirdos call slack

563
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,680
Like that heathenist idea of nirvana

564
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,700
I say that slack should be taken up

565
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,360
Like the excess yarn in my knitting

566
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,780
And pulled until it sees the light of a normal day

567
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,940
Like the rest of us do

568
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,620
So what should any decent-minded American do

569
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,440
When faced with the fact that they're not normal?

570
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:18,440


571
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,720
Like one of these zombies for Bob?

572
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,020
Well, first off, give them a bath in Pine Sol

573
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,340
They usually stink to high heaven

574
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,840
Then ship them off to the nearest normally accredited deprogrammer

575
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,560
While they get bombarded with enough People magazines

576
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,460
Arid extra-dry deodorant and Regis Philbin fan club material

577
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,440
So they won't be able to think anymore

578
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,240
The way it should be

579
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,700
Then they'll feed them real dogma

580
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,220
About the glories of the home shopping club

581
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,160
Wingo

582
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,100
Zingo

583
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,700
And the evils of Mandingo

584
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,780
We cannot stand by

585
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,140
While our standards and principles

586
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,620
Are made light of by these possessed fools

587
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,140
Normals of the world unite

588
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,900
Oh, that was Sister Chris, dear friends

589
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,620
From a long time ago, WFMU

590
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,240
I guess that would be our guest

591
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,800
Rant

592
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,740
Sister Chris this time

593
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,000
What?

594
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,280
Representing the citizens for normalcy

595
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,140
Thank you

596
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,860
Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocritans

597
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,280
These pink boys

598
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,620
These box-dwelling Barbies and Kens

599
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:40,960
These normals who have made normality the norm?

600
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:18,220
What's the point of this so-called

601
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,220


602
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,220


603
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,220


604
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,220


605
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,100
content. It's not

606
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,680
a loss. It's more of a

607
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,640
passing into something

608
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,900
wonderful and exciting for the whole

609
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,860
rest of my life.

610
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,940
So I want to say goodbye and that I'm

611
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,260
going to miss you all very much.

612
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,860
Because if you

613
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,120
want to get on those sausage,

614
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
you can't be afraid of anything.

615
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,600
You can't be afraid of

616
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,680
pigs. You can't be afraid of

617
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,940
the dogles. And you definitely can't

618
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,240
be afraid of Bob.

619
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,460
You can't be afraid of Bob.

620
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,360
What kind of

621
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,500
pussy pussy behavior is that?

622
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,600
You might have

623
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,620
to think, but you can't. You can only

624
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,220
get back to one place

625
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,360
and that is J.R.

626
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:03,660
Bob.

627
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,640
You don't want to live is what you're saying.

628
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,760
You don't want to live.

629
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,840
You don't want to be Bob.

630
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,820
Because there's a conflict in every

631
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,400
human heart

632
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,520
between the rational and the irrational.

633
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,820
Between

634
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,540
good and evil.

635
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,680
And good does not

636
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
always triumph.

637
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,220
Sometimes

638
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,380
the dark side

639
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,740
overcomes what

640
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,740
Lincoln called the better angels of our

641
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,100
nature.

642
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,740
Every man has

643
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,680
got a breaking point.

644
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,020
You and I have.

645
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:51,940
And very

646
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,560
obviously he has gone insane.

647
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,760
Oh, yes, dear friends.

648
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,920
Oh, this is

649
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,960
Reverend Ivan Stang with a live

650
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,500
on the scene report here at

651
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,200
Dockstock number three.

652
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,760
The drums you hear in the background

653
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,120
are being played by

654
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,860
two, it looks like three year old girls.

655
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,640
A couple of three year old little girls

656
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,460
are playing the drums.

657
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,500
They're not bad, actually.

658
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,920
It's a lot better than what some of the

659
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,620
professional subgeniuses were capable of

660
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,460
late last night.

661
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,040
We've got quite an amazing contingent of

662
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,960
subgeniuses here.

663
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,540
We, there's a, here's Jan Johnson from the

664
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,040
Boston delegation.

665
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,900
There are delegations from something like

666
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,660
fifty, fifty-five states and

667
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,200
countries.

668
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,860
Something like that.

669
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,920
We have these delegations from the Boston delegation.

670
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:47,920


671
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,660
We're all over the country.

672
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,660
There's Houston, of course, Dallas, Little Rock,

673
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,200
San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, Seattle.

674
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,740
Pope Myers here from Seattle.

675
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,200
We all come together for these yearly or bi-yearly meetings.

676
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,440
And the interesting thing is we don't know why.

677
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,020
We don't, there's no goal, no set plan at all.

678
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,780
We just, we meet and then we try to figure out why.

679
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,440
And usually we can't make the song stop.

680
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,160
But, I'm tired of working.

681
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,120
I'm sick of all this money.

682
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,120
I want to play real music.

683
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,020
I want to have a meeting with the people.

684
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,880
I'm sick of all.

685
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,700
I'm sick of all.

686
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,820
I'm sick of all.

687
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,280
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of all.

688
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,220
This internal machine.

689
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,780
Is going to wing you.

690
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,840
To hell.

691
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,620
This internal machine.

692
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,960
Gonna wing you off to hell.

693
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,360
You will be looking through caverns of human flesh.

694
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,940
You think your eyes deceive you.

695
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,260
But know what you are seeing is not a bizarre.

696
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,880
But a real carnal sight.

697
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:15,140
Men are wailing, wailing with their arms attached to the walls.

698
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,280
Staple there by cruel,

699
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:17,480
Yet the launching of cruel,

700
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,700
Praisers of disgusting nonsense and foolish ideals.

701
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,680
These they utter until the dark hours of the morning.

702
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:33,300
Until the sun, оноصppYes, relentlessly�clways up the ferns, farns, andhayいる Sh charts

703
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:33,300


704
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,360
And where will you be, friend?

705
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,520
Will you be in a saucer, full of milk and honey?

706
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,540
Will you be riding high off into the sky?

707
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,220
Will you see that silver lining on every cloud as you

708
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,500
Whisk by on my infernal machine?

709
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,960
These machines don't work for you, son

710
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,880
They don't work for nobody

711
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,900
Got their own criteria

712
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,320
Got their own agenda

713
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,760
Got their own suspenders

714
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,720
Goodbye!

715
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,520
How's that? Goodbye!

716
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:33,040
That's true. We feel like the purpose of life is not happiness, knowledge, or even truth, but merely to squirt.

717
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:39,680
You can understand the church on a simple level of, oh, some people think it's a Texas desert.

718
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,040
Some people think it's a death and fertility cult.

719
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,380
Others call it just another polygamous religion.

720
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:50,380
Yeah, some think it's a great collaborative art project using the greatest anonymous artists in America today.

721
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:55,960
And others just say it's my religion. Let me practice it.

722
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,740
Remember, kids, nothing is illegal if 100 sub-genie businessmen decide to do it.

723
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,220
That's right.

724
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:09,620
And we had that wonderful tape where you saw the young, naked, nubile maidens wrestling with Arnold Palmer's buddy,

725
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,060
rolling in the mondo-mondo hills of Habba-Frop Zipulots.

726
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,240
There's marijuana growing all over.

727
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,520
Well...

728
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,100
In these settings.

729
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,200
Yes, it's true.

730
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,440
There's Habba-Frop Zipulots all over the Tibetan Holy Llamas grave.

731
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:32,340
It is one of the most maintainable shrubbers for landscaping around exterior office buildings.

732
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,100
Right.

733
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,120
And very tidy.

734
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,940
It's not a morbid situation at all.

735
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:36,680
No, it's happy.

736
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,320
It's like Bob is a robot or the Attack of the Mutants.

737
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:39,600
People...

738
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:39,740
People...

739
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:39,740


740
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:39,740


741
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,440
Any movie of that sort that you've seen.

742
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,640
He's a cheery demigod.

743
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,180
That's right.

744
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,880
But the people that we're really concerned with are the artisans tonight.

745
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,040
We're talking about the small studios that support Bob's habit.

746
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,440
They crank out art in an amazing way.

747
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,020
Centralize it in Dallas.

748
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,780
The sub-genius Air Force pick-step.

749
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,540
Plies it to Dallas.

750
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,000
And the next thing you know, it's in the stark fist.

751
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,320
And nobody gets paid for it.

752
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,840
Except those who matter.

753
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,940
And others just...

754
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,040
Others just say it's my religion.

755
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,420
Let me practice it.

756
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,880
You can't have sex without Bob.

757
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,140
You can't have money without Bob.

758
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,200
Girls, a dollar in the top two will come to you in the night.

759
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,720
Free pills!

760
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,200
Free...

761
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,460
Don't be left behind when the X is playing.

762
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,340
How many of you have been here since 1999?

763
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,600
You don't have to understand it.

764
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,960
You just have to buy it.

765
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,900
You have signed the application.

766
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,100
Welcome aboard.

767
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:46,900
One doesn't listen long before a little warning signal goes off inside that says,

768
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,460
Watch out.

769
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,940
Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint the precise error.

770
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,400
But the language, the pure language of heaven is missing.

771
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,840
Something says, look out.

772
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,940
This guy is fishy.

773
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,660
Cultist or someone with his theological wires crossed.

774
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,000
It's almost like listening to someone who knows only a few words of English,

775
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,320
but...

776
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,500
Soon they're rattling off in a completely unknown language.

777
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,260
When they haven't even been to kindergarten.

778
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,420
Spiritual.

779
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,980
We eat more, drink more, play more, and do less to earn a good living

780
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,000
than any other people in history.

781
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,100
We have at our fingertips the world's greatest music.

782
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,600
And I might add, a lot of it's worse.

783
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,860
Else the cultists would have no following.

784
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,300
We are a people grasping nervously, sometimes almost hysterically for more.

785
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,200
I know that I know that I know that I know that I know...

786
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,320
That I know...

787
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,400
That I know...

788
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,760
That I know that I know...

789
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,680
Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries,

790
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,500
the cruel and torturous executions,

791
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,720
it would be more consistent to call it the word of a demon.

792
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,340
There are little eyes upon you and they're watching night and day.

793
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:01,260
Will the vocal and activist minority ready apparently to burn the bomber's seal of fear?

794
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,600
Some more.

795
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,280
And most, incidentally, are in their teens or their twenties.

796
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,160
And that's Washington, before I tell you that.

797
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,780
They drove in caves, not high-rise apartments.

798
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,880
They may not have found a pink affluence, but they found...

799
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:24,980
An endless supply of dope, uninhibited sex, an endless supply of money.

800
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,460
Free access to the distillery, I suppose.

801
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,720
Ah, yes, the harvest.

802
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,040
You can count on that.

803
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,220
But still, the more.

804
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,640
Why, friends, we could feed another nation with our garbage.

805
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,400
What more than a space hogger on Earth?

806
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,180
There's a church of geniuses.

807
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,320
I don't know.

808
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,140
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?

809
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,560
Bang.

810
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,800
Are you blaming God for atom bombs?

811
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,180
Atomic warheads?

812
00:40:59,320 --> 00:40:59,800
Don't.

813
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,820
I don't know.

814
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,020
I only know that it will signal the end of time.

815
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:04,580
Why?

816
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,080
Why?

817
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,080


818
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:06,940
Because I'm not sure.

819
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:06,940


820
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,400
Bang.

821
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,080
The past blotted out, and the future assured.

822
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,020
Ah, yes, the harvest.

823
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,020
Laced with hundreds of beautiful, sexy broads.

824
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,820
A sex-stuffed gingerbread house.

825
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,800
Enter roommates Mitzi and Carol.

826
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,540
The party's now complete.

827
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,420
A time to strip down for action and do as told.

828
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,860
I'm ready.

829
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,340
You're ready?

830
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:39,340


831
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,780
With the spell, sister?

832
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,380
Why not?

833
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:50,260
Ziggity-zee, ziggity-zing, demon of darkness, come on the wing.

834
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,940
And then, at the witch's center, the most horrible, curdling howl filled the night air.

835
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:06,120
And the gigantic, fat shake seemed to fill the sky, blotting out the stars, blowing out

836
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:06,260
the moon.

837
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,260


838
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,260


839
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,260


840
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,260


841
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,260


842
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,260


843
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,260


844
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:06,260


845
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:12,980
moon and in the velvet blackness the ghostly trio and even the halloween creatures were terrified

846
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:23,280
get yourself a speculum insert it open it up and take a look inside you can give yourself

847
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,560
a basic gynecological exam can you find your cervix

848
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:38,340
locate your goddess spot otherwise known as the g-spot

849
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:46,520
if you really can't locate your goddess spot beat it into submission she and her girls specialize

850
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:52,880
in the sale of pleasure and the sins of the flesh

851
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:58,220
oh some genius women at about this point

852
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:58,540
we can see that the goddess spot is a little bit more of a mystery

853
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:58,540


854
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,120
i think we've said all that there is to be said and certainly all that we're going to say

855
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,760
now sit back and enjoy

856
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:21,460
so bob dobs we meet again for the first time bob i wept when you died

857
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,540
now i must kill you again for my honor and for the honor of god

858
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,060
it's pandemonium out there things are floating things are beginning to fly

859
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:54,320
and you're inside the dome without an ounce of sense don't look around for the nearest

860
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,320
evacu-gen don't call the police look inside your

861
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,540
cell phone and you're inside the dome without an ounce of sense don't look around for the nearest

862
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,380
evacu-gen don't call the police look inside your cell phone and you're inside the dome without an ounce of sense don't look around for the nearest

863
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:05,780
and then wire up hot wire and nexin to build a bug cleaners and malivisant mothers

864
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:10,680
then darker by the second as the acrimony police begin to line the walls

865
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,420
now we see the juniper headed children and thousands and thousands of the other rectal

866
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:22,160
and challenged children trying to make their way up the slopes and the slopes are indeed high

867
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:28,180
where they've all been greased by the great mumu himself who blindly wandered throughout

868
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:28,540
these streets and they've all been greased by the great mumu himself who blindly wandered throughout

869
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:28,880
these streets and they've all been greased by the great mumu himself who blindly wandered throughout

870
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,060
these caves back many thousands of years ago hoping praying something like this would happen

871
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:40,640
and especially not on a day like today when the plutonium storms are literally raging and

872
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,660
thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of particles are filling the nostrils and eyes and

873
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:52,360
other oral cavities that they're carrying some of them have been carrying them for weeks at a time

874
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:58,420
they can hardly can hardly understand them now i'm picking up it seems to be a thermometer and

875
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:58,800
they can hardly understand them now i'm picking up it seems to be a thermometer and

876
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:06,320
it's not a i'm picking up it yes i'm picking up a a vision of children and these same small children

877
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:14,940
and handlebar mustaches and it's christmas and it's very sad there won't be any christmas on

878
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:26,280
pluto this year they've all gone all the little sack slack john butter headed pumpkin headed boys

879
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,060
are gone

880
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:36,260
all the little tin can shaped girls with the eyes all of the doctors have all the doctors have left

881
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,800
all the doctors have left

882
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:46,180
as we gaze upon this little uh pavilion uh surrounded by uh untold thousands as far as

883
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:52,560
the eye can see thousands of the shaved bald-headed followers waiting for the doctors and the various

884
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,220
delegations doctor uh ad here is from the uh

885
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:07,820
cannot tell go ahead and get the

886
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:07,840
blood

887
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,100
now

888
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:09,380
you

889
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:09,400
did

890
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,440
Charging a man with murder in his place was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500.

891
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,440
He gone.

892
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,780
He gone.

893
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,020
Yeah, that's right.

894
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,300
Next day's a-comin'.

895
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,640
And the peaks are bummer.

896
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,020
And sure, we all think we're hips up, G-9.

897
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,980
We got us a window seat, first class, old pleasure soft.

898
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,520
You better work hard for your slap, Jack.

899
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,580
Don't count on it.

900
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,840
He said they don't want to preach to people.

901
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:22,100
Yeah, the scalpers will be squabbling out there, man, to sell you those over-insulated X-Day saucer tickets.

902
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,680
That old star kid's gonna be slamming down hard, man.

903
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,560
But let's just cut to the point.

904
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:39,940
I know most of you want slap, but what you really want is the alien orgies that really got us going, right?

905
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:40,800
Let's admit it.

906
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:51,460
And many of you may have actually even heard when I was abducted on the way to score some girl cluster munchies years ago.

907
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,740
Got abducted by the alien nymphos and actually had my little mini-deck there and recorded it.

908
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,800
The actual sounds of alien orgies in the pleasure saucer.

909
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,980
Oh, I love to be naked.

910
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,520
Morality, you know, there ain't gonna be no morality in outer space.

911
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,960
You know, whatever comes and goes by, that's what's going on.

912
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:24,000
Well, another rule in the great morality was that thou shalt steal a government-issue rocket ship if possible.

913
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:24,480
Yeah.

914
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,140
Now, there's not a lot of them left.

915
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,740
There's not a lot of them left, and most of them are in museums.

916
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:36,160
And the last big one, the last Saturn V is actually, they moved it indoors now.

917
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,380
It's gonna be very difficult to get it now.

918
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,580
They have, like, guards around it and stuff.

919
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,980
Well, you know, there's gotta be another way to do it besides rockets.

920
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,060
What now?

921
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,280
Well, yeah, of course, there is.

922
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,220
But, you know, to each their own.

923
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:56,440
The first commandment is, thou shalt switch to flying saucers operated by gravity waves.

924
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,520
As soon as is technically feasible.

925
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,320
Right.

926
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,760
I think we maybe better go to a remote now.

927
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,800
It's like, oh, here they come.

928
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,060
Well, assembled here on the platform.

929
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:13,120
Another paradigm about to be crunched as the Tati crew gets ready to board their own homemade midship rocket ship.

930
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,540
And this thing says, bang, it's approaching with a Bunsen burner.

931
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,140
They're going to try to ignite this flare.

932
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,000
They're hard, very hard.

933
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,800
Follows rocket fuel with the Bunsen burner.

934
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,920
One dollar for a taxpayer.

935
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:31,300
But one billion dollars for the United States government.

936
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,640
It's my dollars.

937
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,960
One lung for.

938
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:34,560
What was that?

939
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:42,540
It's one lung for Bob and one toothpick for, you know, the rest of it.

940
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,900
See, that's why this is always a psychic experience.

941
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:51,500
I was staring at a toothpick wondering if I had a collapsible lung like Bob promised with them lobotomyctomies and all them other designs.

942
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,840
How did you say that?

943
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,620
That's one lung for Bob.

944
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,400
One toothpick.

945
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,240
Lobotomyctomy.

946
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,780
And one toothpick for the rest of it.

947
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,440
What you do for the lobotomyctomy is you go get yourself an Aerotech.

948
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,640
It's all too cute.

949
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,740
G engine.

950
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,440
Stick it in your nose.

951
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,220
This is what I'm trying to prove here.

952
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,780
I get what can happen.

953
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:22,180
What what can be achieved by eliminating all that is cute through disease?

954
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,920
Oh, that is a beautiful idea.

955
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,340
Collar, do you have gas music?

956
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,180
Are you?

957
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:26,980
I have.

958
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,700
I'm afraid that we know this caller.

959
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,040
I'm afraid so, too.

960
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,020
I think he may have beat you to the scrotum.

961
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:33,360
So many.

962
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:39,820
I have been ill and through my illness, I have eliminated all of my inner cuteness.

963
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,340
I'm outside now.

964
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,480
Are you still sitting there with a gland problem?

965
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,640
And I'm still like, do you still know about Thursday?

966
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,980
Or is it Friday now?

967
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,920
No, no, no.

968
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,280
It's not what you think.

969
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,420
No, I don't.

970
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,040
I don't think this thing has anything to do with it.

971
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,900
Maybe it's Tuesday.

972
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:57,960
No, friends.

973
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,060
See, Tuesday's in the background.

974
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,340
Friends, this is bleepo.

975
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,300
That's what I was afraid of.

976
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,380
We thought you did.

977
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,500
You were castrated.

978
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,340
And, uh, some of us didn't know.

979
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:06,660
No, no.

980
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:10,520
Bleepo, I felt a tremor in the force that ended it.

981
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,440
And I knew that you were very sick.

982
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,840
I definitely felt it.

983
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,520
I have an extra testicle now.

984
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,100
An extra?

985
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:17,600
Stang?

986
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,100
Yes.

987
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,980
They found it, Stang.

988
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:20,680
Finally!

989
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,920
Hey, listen, man.

990
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:25,540
I've been looking for that thing for about 15 years now.

991
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,020
They found it?

992
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,020


993
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,020


994
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,020


995
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,020


996
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,020


997
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,020


998
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,020


999
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,020


1000
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,720
I grafted it to the front of my forehead.

1001
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,140
Right over my pineal gland.

1002
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,640
Friday, your job is to retrieve the testicle from the old bleepo.

1003
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,700
I'm afraid of the cosmopolitan monkey and the geninocytes.

1004
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,740
I look really hot now.

1005
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:42,000
I don't think that's bleepo on the phone, even though he may have his nose pinched together.

1006
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,900
As an expert of different, many different diamonds, I would say that this person is

1007
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:45,900


1008
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,880
Well, ever since the grafting, I've been having...

1009
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,160
It's just the women look at the...

1010
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,140
The women...

1011
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:51,680
No, no.

1012
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,240
I am not hearing Westchester County.

1013
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,540
Animals, people on the subway.

1014
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,000
I'm hearing someplace a little further east.

1015
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,000


1016
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,940
I cannot not have sex at this point.

1017
00:51:59,040 --> 00:51:59,220
What?

1018
00:51:59,220 --> 00:51:59,220


1019
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,380
I always thought that testicle was at Megan's wattle somewhere.

1020
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,120
It's not bleepo.

1021
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:03,980
He's from Yonkers.

1022
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:04,440
This guy's from Yonkers.

1023
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,180
Did you say you cannot not have sex right now?

1024
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:07,500
Exactly.

1025
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,880
I'm in a constant state of sex.

1026
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,280
The nose never goes...

1027
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,760
I want that nut back, man.

1028
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,800
You're having sex with an imposter.

1029
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,880
Stang, you would give him his nut.

1030
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,340
He told me it was okay to have.

1031
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,660
Yeah, well, I need it back now.

1032
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:23,080
Go ahead.

1033
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,660
Show some pink.

1034
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,000
And put it on your face.

1035
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,000


1036
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,000


1037
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,000


1038
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,000


1039
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,540
I'll be sure you get paid.

1040
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,320
Who took these pictures?

1041
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:29,840
Did you, Bob?

1042
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,080
He did.

1043
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,040
Bye.

1044
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:31,680
Bye.

1045
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,840
Well, that's the way to tell it.

1046
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:39,640
You can't use a rocket ship if thou gets the chance.

1047
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:47,120
Thou shalt switch from rockets to flying saucers propelled by gravity waves or the like as

1048
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,940
soon as it is technically feasible.

1049
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:55,060
Thou shalt not breach the seals nor compromise the airlock.

1050
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:55,520
Bye.

1051
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:03,300
Thou shalt retain optimal manual control over all ship functions no matter how supposedly

1052
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:07,280
trustworthy thine shipboard computer may be.

1053
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,600
Thou shalt keep clean and shipshape thine current spaceship.

1054
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:20,920
Thou shalt quarantine all alien viruses and life forms no matter how good looking they

1055
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,080
might seem to be.

1056
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,980
Thou shalt not puke in the ship.

1057
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:25,980


1058
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,180
Thou shalt not wear thine own helmet nor befoul thine own moon hands.

1059
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:40,980
Thou shalt not breach the seals nor compromise the airlock of the Akashic ether.

1060
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,840
Thou shalt not die for the sins of the world.

1061
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:44,700
Those are very thoughtful.

1062
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:51,840
Here is another thing that we left out of our spaceship propulsion and safety methods.

1063
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,500
Quarantine.

1064
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,780
Quarantine.

1065
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:55,980
Quarantine.

1066
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,420
Quarantine.

1067
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:56,560
Yes.

1068
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,100
Quarantine.

1069
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:57,840
Quarantine.

1070
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:58,420
Quarantine.

1071
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:58,480
Quarantine.

1072
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:58,880
Everyone needs quarantine money on the ship.

1073
00:53:59,140 --> 00:53:59,560
You know, kidding.

1074
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,740
I used to drink that stuff when I was a kid.

1075
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,280
Remember that?

1076
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,700
Think how stuffy it is after about 20 years onboard an escape ship.

1077
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,220
Yeah.

1078
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:06,960
We'll have to go out.

1079
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,920
We'll have to go out and evacuate ourselves outside now and then in the void.

1080
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:17,320
What do you do about bug, you know, alien bug, viruses, fungus, worms, all over the

1081
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,400
gal falando at the back of the ship perfectly sterile all the time.

1082
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:24,400
You just have to make sure that you get all the worst germs scrubbed out and put into

1083
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,000
Dave's room.

1084
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:25,800
Quarantine.

1085
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,220
You know, if you do that, then that takes all the fun out of it.

1086
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,260
Well, I suppose everything makes you sterile.

1087
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:31,320
Well, no, no.

1088
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:34,740
That's why we put it in today's room, so that we can watch the germs in there.

1089
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:35,520
Oh, oh, oh.

1090
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,100
And then we stay on the other side of the air box.

1091
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,200
Right, yeah, just funnel them all over the day.

1092
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,400
A chocolatey drink for children can give you a sterilization problem.

1093
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,040
What better are we than the Liebensraum Hitlers and all them guys?

1094
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,820
You know, we want to make room for germs.

1095
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:48,580
We've got prop!

1096
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:49,740
That's right.

1097
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,580
That's it.

1098
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,800
That's all there is to it.

1099
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,280
We've got prop and they don't.

1100
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:53,720
Yeah.

1101
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,260
Yeah.

1102
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,720
That doesn't make any sense.

1103
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,160
We'll have our own rocket ship.

1104
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,340
It was the Princess Wee.

1105
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,420
If you doubt that for a second.

1106
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,320
Yeah, I better remember my origins.

1107
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,460
I think everybody should.

1108
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:06,060
Yes.

1109
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,820
And here are the origins, friends.

1110
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,920
What we've been listening to, the tail end of side one there.

1111
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:20,280
We heard Sister Chris from WFMU in the old days doing the Citizens for Normalcy rant.

1112
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,560
We heard...

1113
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,100
I...

1114
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,040
Einstein's Secret Orchestra doing Let Me Tell You About a Place in Outer Space.

1115
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,960
Sister Decadence's X-Day Farewell.

1116
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,680
And David Lynch preaching on X-Day.

1117
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:42,520
Some Doc Stock No. 3 report from the ancient days with the band that dare not speak its name performing Sick-a-Bob.

1118
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,320
Einstein's Secret Orchestra doing this Infernal Machine.

1119
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,220
Various...

1120
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:53,700
Oh, some KPFA with Glass Madness and Wellman on artists and frauds.

1121
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,240
And Wellman's edit of You Have Signed the Application.

1122
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:58,020
Ah, yes.

1123
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,000
The Harvest.

1124
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,780
Susie the Floozy did the Connie collage.

1125
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,040
And Annie Sprinkle's strip search.

1126
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:07,660
Friday Jones killed you for the honor of Connie.

1127
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,140
And, of course, Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1128
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,180
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1129
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:11,860
Chaz.

1130
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,820
And Bill T. Miller.

1131
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,720
X-Days are coming on Boston 1996 recording.

1132
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,240
And also check out this.

1133
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,820
I'm sorry, Dave.

1134
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,320
I can't do that.

1135
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,060
And I always brain...

1136
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,960
Five, four, three, two...

1137
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,020
I can just smell that field coming.

1138
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,400
July 5th in that big old field at Brushwood.

1139
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,000
Um...

1140
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,020
Um...

1141
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,000
First the little rockets go up.

1142
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,460
Then the big rockets go up.

1143
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,000
And then the really big ones.

1144
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,100
Come on down.

1145
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:41,820
That's right.

1146
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:46,760
The rockets are our signal to let the saucers know it's time.

1147
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:50,960
We're ready for them to come down to make that final step down.

1148
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,680
Put their little ladder down.

1149
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,820
Put their little rope ladder down.

1150
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:57,860
To let the saucers know there's still something down here on Earth worth saving.

1151
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,340
That's right.

1152
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,660
Step on up, baby.

1153
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:00,440
Step on up.

1154
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,140
We've got a ride for you inside.

1155
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,140
Check it out here.

1156
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:06,560
We've got everything you could possibly need without a mind or imagination.

1157
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,700
You could go beyond what you've already bought.

1158
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,160
Because everything you can't believe is here.

1159
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,480
It's...

1160
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,380
And all it takes...

1161
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:20,160
All it takes to experience all this is to be a member of the Church of the...

1162
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,560
Praise Bob!

1163
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:22,280
Yeah!

1164
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,600
Radio Box 14...

1165
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:33,520
Radio Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1166
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,580
I can't do my cute husband voice now.

1167
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,180
That's right, baby.

1168
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,460
Four foot nothing.

1169
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,800
Can you just see everybody?

1170
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,720
I can just see the whole Brushwood people.

1171
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,080
The whole community there.

1172
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,100
The whole X-Day community in one big circle around the launch pad.

1173
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,160
And most of the girls aren't wearing shirts.

1174
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,340
No, and they're all...

1175
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:52,260
And everybody's just...

1176
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,400
They're just...

1177
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:53,400


1178
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:53,400


1179
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,220
And here, this is playing.

1180
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,560
Yeah, while we jam them out.

1181
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,060
Yeah, baby.

1182
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,580
Yeah, all booging back and forth, man.

1183
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,040
Feel that love vibe.

1184
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:00,500
Oh, yeah.

1185
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,980
The love vibe.

1186
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:02,320
The love vibe.

1187
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:02,740
The love vibe.

1188
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:07,000
Jesus Christ himself will be there blessing and anointing the young...

1189
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,120
Yeah, I like that.

1190
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:12,880
Yes, Jesus must bless each one of those rockets as they go up.

1191
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,340
And you can be there to witness this.

1192
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:20,720
El Diablo, Satan himself, will be there to curse those rockets as they go up.

1193
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,780
But who's going to win?

1194
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,880
Jesus, Satan, or Bob?

1195
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:24,720
Well, you know...

1196
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,600
Christ, Bob, Bob will be there.

1197
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,000
That's right.

1198
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:31,160
And you know, the rockets do rise on a column of fire.

1199
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,000
But underneath the fire, it leaves behind a column of clouds.

1200
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:38,780
So you have hell and heaven all there.

1201
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,700
It's all a metaphor.

1202
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:44,860
The rockets are a big metaphor for the cycle of the absurdity of life.

1203
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,200
And they all end up on their heads.

1204
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:47,940
That's right.

1205
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,260
That's the miracle of it all.

1206
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:49,720
That's right.

1207
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,280
Those worlds separate.

1208
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:55,360
Sometimes the parachute pops out, and sometimes it don't.

1209
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,160
So you want to make your own rocket.

1210
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,560
You want to keep your own ship-shake.

1211
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:04,220
Ship.

1212
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,040
Ship-shake.

1213
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,260
What was that, Friday?

1214
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,600
You want to make sure if you're taking your own rocket ships...

1215
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,360
Slip it in, Friday.

1216
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,180
Slip it in.

1217
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:17,720
...or some kind of semi-rig on the New York State Highway Patrol will be out looking out for those rocket ships on the top of Toyota.

1218
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,500
Also, make sure that if you're trying to fly there, if you...

1219
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:26,040
...play roll flashlights, the smoke bands aren't affecting most of Chautauqua County.

1220
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,900
Man, I'm listening to Friday on that guitar.

1221
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,020
Oh, man.

1222
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:29,800
He bitchin'.

1223
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,960
That bitch be bitchin'.

1224
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,320
It's going to be better than that when it's live, man.

1225
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,140
They're always better live, those people.

1226
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,960
Where can people get information on this, Reverend Stein?

1227
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,860
It's a little bit of something just called Tom.

1228
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,320
Of course, the subgenius website.

1229
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,440
It's a little bit of something just called Tom.

1230
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,620
It's a little bit of something just called Tom.

1231
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:51,400
It's a little bit of something just called Tom.

1232
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:51,480


1233
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:51,800
I don't know.

1234
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,900
...and because...

1235
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:54,360
...Kill!

1236
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:57,040
...remember Bob's commandment number 10.

1237
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:01,960
Thou shalt not puke in thine own helmet, nor be foul thine own moon pack.

1238
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,040
Amen.
