1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,800
I wish the fuck this car was air-conditioned.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,080
Well, I'll go ahead and start up a tape of Sterno and Philo here.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,740
Even though we're so fucked up that we can't, you know, there's no sense in trying to be creative.

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,000
We'll just make sure you guys know it's going to be really boring and insipid.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,700
Really bad.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,660
I'll probably even have a car wreck.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,860
Before I can even get Cleve back to his hotel.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,860
We'll make it somewhat exciting anyway.

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,000
It's a good crash.

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,800
It should sound good on here.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:39,960
Yeah, well, you know, we're just too burned out from partying and being creative, you know,

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:53,800
and without you guys around and telling great stories of fucking Betsy and fucking fat chicks.

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah, fat chicks all over Europe.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,780
Taking nude pictures of teenagers.

15
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,540
Teenage girls in my hotel bathroom.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,320
Yeah.

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,220
All that rock star stuff.

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,220
All that rock star stuff.

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,480
Which is why we sound kind of sweaty tonight.

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,320
Yeah, and smell kind of bad.

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,940
Look pretty awful.

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,400
Look at least 30 years older than we are.

23
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,340
So, you guys fucked up, you know.

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,060
You missed it.

25
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,140
Yeah, you missed it.

26
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,060
You missed it again.

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,980
You fucked up.

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,080
I don't know what the problem is here.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,960
Why you always got to fuck up?

30
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,780
You know, it's like, I don't know why.

31
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,860
Well, we did a radio show last night, but it was just as fucked up as this tape, so.

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,360
Yeah.

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,220
I'll probably send them a copy of it.

34
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,780
But they fucked up.

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,660
Philo always fucks up.

36
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,800
At least Sternow didn't fuck up on Boston.

37
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,300
At least Sternow got there.

38
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,980
But you fucked up on Boston.

39
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,020
I fucked up on Boston.

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,680
That's right.

41
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,540
You had to go to the stock hole.

42
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,800
Yeah, instead.

43
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,020
I had to go teach Finnish girls how to drink tequila properly.

44
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,800
You drink it with orange juice?

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,820
No, baby.

46
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,940
You just sort of drink it with a little bit of this salt here and a little chunk of that lime.

47
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,540
And then how about a nice semen chaser?

48
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,500
Well, I hate to do this to you, but at the Rock and Roll Alternative and at K&ON especially,

49
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,620
things are like Mussolini's trains and they operate on schedule dead on.

50
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:27,940
It's right.

51
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,740
at nine o'clock.

52
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,200
This is K.N.O.N.

53
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:30,520
Dallas.

54
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,240
And it's time for Reverend Ivan Stang.

55
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,560
Say no to the Church of the Subgenius.

56
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,700
Here let's inject a little less levity into these proceedings.

57
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:53,300
Oh, you fool.

58
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh.

59
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,900
Children of Earth.

60
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,520
I am Mantor, one of a new race, a Sektor from the planet Symbion.

61
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,740
Welcome to your Sektor's read-along book.

62
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,460
As you read this story, you will understand how important my message is.

63
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,140
You are my witness.

64
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,300
Children, to you I swear the truth.

65
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,780
This story will show you that being too proud can be a fault.

66
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,260
And it can make a warrior lose the battle.

67
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,420
The lid's off.

68
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:35,800
It's going to be louder beyond Ontario than it's going to be here.

69
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,120
Those sounds.

70
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,620
Oh!

71
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,140
Oh!

72
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,760
Oh!

73
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:50,560
Oh!

74
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,100


75
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:51,740


76
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:52,540
Oh!

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,880
Oh!

78
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,020
Oh!

79
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,440
Oh!

80
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,460
Oh!

81
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,340
Oh!

82
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,140
Oh!

83
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,140


84
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,140


85
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,140


86
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,160
Oh!

87
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,200
Give me the child

88
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,300
Sarah, beware

89
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,980
Now we are ready to begin the story

90
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,440
Invasion of Skull Island

91
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,160
Here on Symbion

92
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,120
Things are rarely peaceful

93
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,400
They haven't been for centuries

94
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,160
Since the time of the great cataclysm

95
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,220
A terrible time of destruction

96
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,820
When our ancestors, the ancients

97
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,960
Sealed the story of their race

98
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,620
And the secrets of their learning and technology

99
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,480
In the biocontrol centers we call Hive

100
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,080
Come on, get up off that chair

101
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,260
Follow me

102
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,340
Ready?

103
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,900
Go!

104
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,680
The Soap Genius

105
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,320
Our old swag

106
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,520
What?

107
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Welcome, potential initiates

108
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,380
The Soap Genius

109
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,900
Our old swag

110
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,800
That you are about to listen to

111
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,440
Is specially designed

112
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,540
Only to be played on radio station

113
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,140
K-N-O-N

114
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,460
And only in the city of

115
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,640
Dallas, Texas

116
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,300
The Soap Genius

117
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,300


118
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,300


119
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,300


120
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,080
Here's your host

121
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,320
Reverend Ivan Stang, dear friend

122
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,500
The sexiest man on earth

123
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,600
A young Adonis who's irresistible to women

124
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,780
Now, I can't wait a moment longer

125
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,460
I've got to have sex with you

126
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,820
I have been generous up until now

127
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,860
But I can be cruel

128
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,340
Generous? What have you done that's generous?

129
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:57,980
Everything. Everything that you wanted I have done. You asked that child be taken, I took him.

130
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:10,040
You cowered before me, I was frightened. I have reordered time. I have turned the world upside down. And I have done it all for you.

131
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:17,780
Come with me now, as together we relive a dangerous adventure in our planet's history.

132
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,100
Mark the tale well and take heed. There is much to learn.

133
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:30,600
Our planets are alike in many ways. What happened to us could happen to you.

134
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,900
Listen well, children of Earth.

135
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,340
Eh, I don't think I need to worry about it.

136
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:50,120
Well, there once was a man, the world's greatest salesman.

137
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:58,280
And he had devised a plan to keep the Shackles from the beast.

138
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,360
Oh, I think it be.

139
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,400
As he's gone, a martyr for the cause, for the cause of...

140
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,380
Huh, oh yeah.

141
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:09,920
Just kidding.

142
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
He's gone again.

143
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,060
Who knew that the first shot...

144
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,600
That grateful shot...

145
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,620
Yeah, it probably was a shot of tequila.

146
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,000
...was going to be the last shot.

147
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,440
But he's got a hard driving pipe.

148
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:24,760
Yes, he's got a hard driving pipe.

149
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,600
The gas smoke all through the night.

150
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,320
Oh yes, dear friends, I don't think he's just talking about smoking either. Nay, I'm...

151
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,280
Smoking and choking and choking and bogan.

152
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,640
Oh, dear friends, we've got a degenerate, degenerate show here tonight.

153
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,520
It just flew in from... well, actually, up from Austin, but...

154
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,300
One of them places.

155
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,120
It was bred in Boston, I'm afraid.

156
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,920
Now, the last show...

157
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,800
But he's only a crumb down here.

158
00:07:52,040 --> 00:08:00,720
The last show, we stirred up a lot of hate, talking about cruelty to animals and how much we liked cruelty to animals.

159
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:07,680
But, you know, we just like to rile up the people who don't bat an eye when they see humans get massacred.

160
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,680
But if a horse falls down and gets sick, then they cry.

161
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,020
But, uh, it'll be much worse tonight, friends.

162
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,440
That's right.

163
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:24,700
Much, much worse, because we have as our guest a veteran of some of the top disgusting novelty bands of subhuman history.

164
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:37,300
He's instrumental in the fabulous Billy Goons, the Swinging Aerodites, the Suede Cowboys, the Rude Smurfs for Wotan, the Sports Palace, and now keyboardist for some, what is it?

165
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,660
Some...

166
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,720
Some spin-off band from the Billy Goons.

167
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,480
Yes, the Broad Street Carpet Munchers.

168
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,000
We are the world's only living Billy Goon tribute band.

169
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:56,560
Friends, this is Reverend Brother Cleve Donut Duncan, the only official roving E-Missionary of J.R. Bob Dog.

170
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,140
That's right.

171
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,020
Coming to your town, coming in your town, and coming all over your town.

172
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,740
Right here on the A1 for the B3.

173
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,400
That one actually, uh, that gag comes up later on in the tape.

174
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,660
Uh, of course, we're not on live, friends.

175
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
You understand that.

176
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,040
We never bring Cleve in here live.

177
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,460
No, because...

178
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,160
Because there's just no telling what...

179
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:29,220
I actually just had to do the whole thing from remote, because I heard about this no alcohol rule at the, uh, radio station, and they wouldn't let me bring my bottle of mezcal in, so I just said, I'm just gonna do it from Reverend Stang's living room, and that's why we have the phone hookup right here, and we're doing it on the one from that.

180
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,500
Oh, praise God.

181
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:37,660
Well, anyway, uh, dear friends, uh, as you, as you probably already know, Brother Cleve is also the founder and secret master of the...

182
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,680
...of the Multifarian faith.

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,660
The Multifarian...

184
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,920
Praise the silver stream...

185
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,080
The silver stream of Multifarian.

186
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,080


187
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,380
...of the Multifarian.

188
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,040
The worshipers of the Holy Hopes, the sacraments of the monk.

189
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,380
And, uh, these things will be fully explained, dear friend.

190
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,320
All mysteries of life will be explained.

191
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,220
This is probably the most censored show I have ever had to do, and if you...

192
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,600
Make a game of it.

193
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,940
Listen close and see if you can hear where the cuts are.

194
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,980
Sometimes it just, uh, you know, we just use...

195
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,900
We just use Bob, but, uh...

196
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,540
Oh, yeah.

197
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,160
So, we, uh, move then.

198
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:12,820
Therefore...

199
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,020
Man, do y'all really wanna know?

200
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,340
Do you really even wanna know what...

201
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:17,980
What are you...

202
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,040
This is gonna be an all Cleve night, folks.

203
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,200
All this stuff is...

204
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,020
What is it Armstrong?

205
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,040
It's sick. It's bad.

206
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,060
It's horror.

207
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,920
We are the type of people that like to not only laugh at those, uh, those cattle mutilations, but also at them people mutilations too.

208
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,940
So come on, give us a call.

209
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,120
You can be offended just as easily as I can, and I can't be offended at all.

210
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,900
That's 823-7490...

211
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:36,880
...

212
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,680
...or 828-9500.

213
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,760
Talk to the Will-O-Dogs.

214
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,100
Huh!

215
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,140
I say we like to party, rock the party!

216
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,680
Bob.

217
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,900
Oh, get off the fa-

218
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,440
Bob.

219
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,080
...the party!

220
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,340
Welcome to the end times, boys and girls.

221
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,600
We're gonna shock-shock the house with your brain and the world.

222
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,620
Bob is getting down with you here tonight.

223
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,080
Bob is getting down to help your plight.

224
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,400
Bob is coming here to ease your strife.

225
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,600
Comethsuckers let Bob into your life!

226
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,860
Well, I'm MC Cleave.

227
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,760
I'm a master rap.

228
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm a dog like my mother.

229
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,520
Bob.

230
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,280
Your lips gonna clap.

231
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,520
Y'all sitting out saying, oh, woe is me.

232
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,120
Well, I'm here to tell you, and it would be the end times is here.

233
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah, pretty mad, Bob.

234
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,840
Time to make a pay for the Bob.

235
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,640
Cups of the past.

236
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,700
Who else is gonna have to go through a rebirth?

237
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,840
And that means paying the spaceship Earth.

238
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,340
These lips will come from Planet X to remove from us the paintball sex.

239
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,480
In the meantime, we will have our say.

240
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,220
Get sacked!

241
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,760
And fornicate every day.

242
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,000
Not a conspiracy.

243
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,920
On it's best.

244
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,400
Make your life a fucking gas.

245
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,560
Take your choke right to the hip.

246
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,880
Make the normal suckers flip.

247
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,180
Take the time to rape their minds.

248
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,400
Tell them to blow it out their behinds.

249
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,460
Take all their money.

250
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,460
Give them what's your worth.

251
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,660
And continue to swerve to the rebirth.

252
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

253
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,620
Here we are.

254
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,420
.

255
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,640
.

256
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,760
.

257
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:19,920
.

258
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,980
.

259
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,240
.

260
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,700
.

261
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,000
.

262
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,340
.

263
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,360
.

264
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,380
.

265
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:39,420
.

266
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:39,420


267
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:39,500
.

268
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:39,500


269
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,660
.

270
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:45,680
.

271
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,680
.

272
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,900
I'm Dr. Steve Dora Mike.

273
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,740
I ain't the next.

274
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,240
I know what's what.

275
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,600
Babe, I like the shape and size of contour of your butt.

276
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,760
So come on over here and give up the gas.

277
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,920
Whip some scum to me, babe.

278
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,400
Or give me all of your cash.

279
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,440
Return you wanted to worry about your soul.

280
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,720
Because when your exes come, you'll be right on my pole.

281
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,900
To dobs how Malaysia we will go.

282
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,280
When you drink the cool air to go home, home, home.

283
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,920
Now I might be lying there with a high spec on my nuts.

284
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,280
Or maybe out chasing some other fine bucks.

285
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,920
But at least you won't have to wait on machinery.

286
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,560
And you'll be free from the...

287
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,020
Bob.

288
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,260
Conspiracy.

289
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,720
Watch the fire burn your face while we kick our way to outer space.

290
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,500
And while you're wishing upon a star, you'll probably lose me and some interstellar bar.

291
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,460
Come on, Cleve.

292
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
That's your 17th bottle of night chain tonight.

293
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,180
Let's go home now before you pass out right here on the street.

294
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,240
Woman, I can drink more wine and stay sober than all the heathen Hindus in Asia.

295
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,980
Yeah, I heard that before.

296
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,660
Get your popsicle sticks and let's get your damn dead home.

297
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,240
Damn, hope there's something good on TV.

298
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,300
For whatever intimidation and injustice lie with decency and honor, let the doctors arise.

299
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
And arise they must.

300
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,340
For within every one of us, there is a doctor.

301
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,820
A dormant doctor.

302
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,100
A supreme arbitrator.

303
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,240
Who can be summoned to intervene when crises threaten the stabilities and well-beings of our heartlands.

304
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,880
Now let's party!

305
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,060
Yeah!

306
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,200
Well, friends, that was Slackmaster Cleve and the Spurious Jive.

307
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:25,820
And inside everyone is a doctor, but fortunately not inside everyone is a doctor like Cleve.

308
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:32,260
That's probably the Bobforsaken truth right there, because I'll tell you, if it was a world full of me right here,

309
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:40,320
I think I'd probably just kill myself and take the load on home, because I don't know what I'd do if I was confronted in the morning with waking up and finding me everywhere.

310
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,540
One is bad enough, dear friends. Bad, bad, bad.

311
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,180
Pope S. Cecilia is going to find out tonight as she is going to be the one to find out.

312
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,860
She actually has to go through with the results of the Win a Date with Cleve contest.

313
00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:01,920
A mere horrifying thought, because I've been known to throw a curveball and a fastball and a big ball at about 98 miles an hour, if you know what I'm talking about, dear friends.

314
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,140
Is it time for the disclaimer yet?

315
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,740
Oh, yes, yes. Thank you very much.

316
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:17,080
Friends, the opinions expressed by Brother Cleve Duncan are not necessarily, or I can guarantee, not shared.

317
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:28,180
They are shared by the radio station or its management or the entire Church of the Subgenius membership, aside from Cleve, or myself or the Willa Dobbs or Pope S. Cecilia.

318
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,140
Definitely not after this.

319
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:35,000
As you'll see why, how do you like those, isn't censorship wonderful?

320
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,880
I think it makes it even filthier than it was before.

321
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,740
It does, it does.

322
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,120
Because kids, you know, it's like kids look at a censored poster or censored picture,

323
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,160
and they just imagine what is behind that blackboard.

324
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,960
That's right.

325
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,080
And it's so much, it's even worse than the real thing.

326
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,740
It definitely is. I remember when I was a small child, and I was at least 49 years old,

327
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,720
and the Johnny Cash song came out, A Boy Named Sue, and they had that little blip on it on the radio.

328
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:09,080
And when I finally found out what it was, I was mortified, because everything I thought it was was definitely a lot fouler than it turned out to be.

329
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:15,040
Matter of fact, you could even say it on the radio right now, what it is, but maybe I probably shouldn't.

330
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,700
Forget it.

331
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:26,480
Well, dear friend, there's going to be some variety here, because this Cleve thing has produced and played in so many different,

332
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,620
well, pretty much low-class dive bands.

333
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,720
The low of the data.

334
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,540
Of course, yeah, exactly.

335
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,580
In this category, we're talking about the best.

336
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,540
But first, you're going to hear some subgenius ranting here.

337
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,680
It was recorded in Dallas last night.

338
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,980
This time, Cleve made a deep vival here.

339
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,140
This was at the old Twilight Room Club.

340
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,300
Ah, yes. I remember falling down those stairs many times.

341
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,200
At least you can remember that.

342
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:02,920
You know, Reverend Stang, I think we should probably point out at this point that I am the only member of the Church of the Subgenius

343
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:09,780
that has had close personal contact with both Blowfly and Dolomite, Rudy Ray Moore.

344
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,580
That's right.

345
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,680
This man, aside from being a wine connoisseur and author of a book,

346
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:21,140
a book of wine art, we'll probably get around to the current faves in the wine world here,

347
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:27,880
but also a scholar of Black Party records and rude Rastafarian songs.

348
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,680
The whole gamut of self-expression.

349
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,020
Yes. In fact, I tried to pull cuts from those things.

350
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,840
All morning I worked on that and couldn't find but a sentence or two here and there.

351
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,380
You know, just enough to kind of tweak your interest.

352
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,640
I do try to find them.

353
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,180
Blowfly rules.

354
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:55,860
Coming all the way, coming all the way from Boston, from Boston, Massachusetts,

355
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,400
home of the fabulous Billy Goons,

356
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,320
comes Brother Cleve Duncan.

357
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,200
You know, I came all the way down from Boston, Massachusetts to talk to you all tonight,

358
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,240
and I'll just give you a little thing here about what we call

359
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,640
the way of the multifar-eye.

360
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,420
Multifar-eye, brother!

361
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,080
Now, you see, I lived about 1700 miles from here,

362
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,420
and back when Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr. Philo Drummond were starting the Church of the Subgenius,

363
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,840
at the same time I started something of my own self called the Church of Multifar-eye.

364
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,840
What we believe in is the sacraments of the holy harps.

365
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,180
The sacraments of the vaults.

366
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,980
We saw Ed McMahon come down on a TV commercial one night and told us

367
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,600
that all we had to do was drink enough beer and drink enough of what it looked like

368
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,420
and snort up enough of what it looked like and just keep on doing all the kinds of drugs

369
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,700
and drinking everything we ought to do, then we would be saved.

370
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,160
Save!

371
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,980
Face bobs!

372
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,280
Save!

373
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,980
Face bobs!

374
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,500
Face bobs!

375
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:10,640


376
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,520
Face bobs!

377
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,600
Face bobs!

378
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:14,760
Face bobs!

379
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,060
Because we knew that there was a holy power.

380
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,160
Oh, wow.

381
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,860
And the power happened to be straight through disfigurement!

382
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:24,580
Disfigurement!

383
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:30,340
Because the more disfigured you can be, the more holy and the more fine you will be.

384
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,120
You know, if a spirit he likes to talk to you and tell you that

385
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,500
if you eat certain foods you're gonna be sick,

386
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,460
or if you smoke cigarettes, you're gonna be sick,

387
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,080
or if you drink a lot, you're gonna be sick,

388
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,300
Just take that job.

389
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,740
Drink it.

390
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:53,220
If you take in as many poisons and toxins as there are out there in the universe.

391
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,000
Toxins!

392
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,720
Then you can build up a superhuman tolerance.

393
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:05,100
You know you read a lot of science fiction books and see these old movies and they're talking about like after the end of the world.

394
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,600
Who's all this left after the end of the world?

395
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,780
Cockroaches!

396
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,140
Cockroaches?

397
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,360
So if you want to see the end times here.

398
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,720
Eat hot dogs.

399
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,040
Eat meat.

400
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,460
Eat raw meat.

401
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,560
Eat beer.

402
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,600
Eat aluminum.

403
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:27,200
Eat it all because that is the only way that you're going to be saved under the system.

404
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,680
The only way that you're going to be able to see the bar.

405
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,100
The only way that you're going to be able to see it.

406
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,880
Because at the end of the world it happens probably.

407
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,180
Raw meat.

408
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,140
Raw meat.

409
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,000
Raw meat.

410
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,860
Raw meat.

411
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,680
Raw meat.

412
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,440
Raw meat.

413
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,360
Raw meat.

414
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,020
Raw meat.

415
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,940
Say well all you're doing is just poisoning yourself.

416
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,360
All you're doing is just hurting yourself.

417
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,700
I've seen so many people that go into their own health, they're sick all the time.

418
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,180
They don't know what health is.

419
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,240
They don't know what it is.

420
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,560
Because if you are, if you poison yourself so much that you are sick all the time then

421
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,440
you are going to be truly healthy all the time.

422
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,020
This is a sick world.

423
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,120
This is just sick.

424
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,120


425
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,120


426
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,120


427
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,120


428
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,120


429
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,120


430
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,120


431
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,120


432
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,060
A sick, sick, disgusting, degenerate world.

433
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,120
And there is no way to get around all the poison that we live in.

434
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,640
Oh, sure, you can say, oh, well, maybe one day we'll clean it all up.

435
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,980
Maybe one day there'll be no more air pollution.

436
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,480
Maybe one day there'll be more toxic waste dumps.

437
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,660
Maybe no more nuclear power plants or something.

438
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,880
Oh, no, that is ideological dream.

439
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,820
You can't use that dream.

440
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,180
Fight reality.

441
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,560
Hit reality right upside the head.

442
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,800
Fight it.

443
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,460
Fight it the way it looks.

444
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:50,400
And then you can have the power of strength to disfigure it.

445
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,140
It's the only, only way.

446
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,360
Only way.

447
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,660
So my message to you, however short it might be tonight,

448
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,040
is to continue to put in as many poisons as you can into your system.

449
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,900
Just build up that superhuman immunity.

450
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,060
And that is the only way.

451
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:12,080
And you can make sure that Bob's plan happens right.

452
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:20,560
That is the only way that Bob is going to be able to come down to this planet back again

453
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,820
from his ideological, dim, written self.

454
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,780
Now that he's a dead man, the only way he's going to be able to come down

455
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,940
and separate the men from the boys and the idiots from the stooges

456
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,220
is to come down and just take the job.

457
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,160
The job.

458
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:36,680
The job.

459
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,180
The job.

460
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,180


461
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,180


462
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,180


463
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,180


464
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,180


465
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,520
It's for the suckers who live all around.

466
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:43,480
You.

467
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,460
It's for you.

468
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,060
They're always putting you down.

469
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,520
B.

470
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,420
It's for Bob.

471
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,540
He gives us our bread.

472
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:53,940
G.

473
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,740
It's for the guns they put to your head.

474
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,100
E.

475
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,300
It's for the eunuchs they want you to become.

476
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:06,740
N.

477
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,520
It's for your...

478
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,040
N.

479
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,600
Glam

480
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:20,080
My head you is for us they want to see us

481
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,800
Bad stuff

482
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,300
I'm a subgenius and I ain't no clown

483
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:32,800
I

484
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:44,360
Not even I don't even want to give the order, you know, I don't want to have anything to do with that

485
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,880
I don't want to know about it. So just

486
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,220
Don't tell me about it. Okay, that's all just

487
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,280
Which is the cradle of sin, but you feel like you in heaven

488
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,460
Yeah

489
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,540
I

490
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:31,880
Good

491
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,600
Oh

492
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:46,840
No

493
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,580
No

494
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,360
I

495
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,440
don't know

496
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:49,440


497
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,900
dangerous

498
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,140
I'm afraid I'm just a big jerk

499
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,940
But it's gonna go to work

500
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,440
It's two hours late but we're going home

501
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,160
The goons are drinking again

502
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,060
They try to make new friends

503
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,020
They're too busy fiddling in all the doggies

504
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,000
The goons are drinking again

505
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,320
He says he is alive for an hour

506
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,000
He gets up and takes a shower

507
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,620
I'm afraid I'm just a big jerk

508
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,480
But it's gonna go to work

509
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,120
It's two hours late but we're going home

510
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,800
Well the goons are drinking again

511
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,580
They try to make new friends

512
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,880
They're too busy fiddling in all the doggies

513
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,780
They're too busy fiddling in all the doggies

514
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,640
The goons are drinking again

515
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,520
Well the goons are drinking again

516
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,220
The goons are drinking again

517
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,140
Well the goons are drinking again

518
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,760
Hey, uh, Cleave...

519
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,660
Cleave, uh, can you explain that?

520
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,400
I mean...

521
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,380
Can you account for yourself?

522
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,760
Well...

523
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,380
See, the fabulous Billy Goons was, uh, this...

524
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,940
We used to play up in Boston a lot

525
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,420
It was a 24-piece professional wrestling outfit

526
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:48,160
This was long before wrestling was considered chic in some quarters

527
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,780
Unfortunately, we have to point that out these days

528
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,460
Because it's kind of a Yussie type thing nowadays, but...

529
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,180
Uh, Yussies?

530
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,060
Yeah, young urban heads

531
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,560
Oh, okay, thanks

532
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,900
You know what that other S means

533
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,720
Bad stuff

534
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,900
Yeah, bad stuff

535
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,300
Well, I don't know, you wouldn't want to hang onto it for long

536
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,080
It becomes good stuff after a while

537
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,260
But, uh, we used to have to, you know, play these shows

538
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,340
And, uh, when you have like 28 people in the band

539
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,220
You never really can tell how many people are actually gonna show up

540
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,860
Some nights there might have been too much whiskey

541
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,180
And there might be three people on stage

542
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,400
And some nights there could be 40, uh...

543
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,720
And, uh, you know, some nights people like Fred Blassie and Captain Lou Albano would come down

544
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,360
And, uh, well, it was just sort of like one of those things

545
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,380
And, uh, there was...

546
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,360
You know, we discovered that if we played in bands

547
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,420
Then you'd get free beer at the clubs

548
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,540
And free whiskey

549
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,540
So we said, well, why not?

550
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,780
So we put together a band and became sort of a, uh...

551
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,360
Uh, local...

552
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,340
I don't know whether you'd say legend or hazard

553
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,760
Uh, in the...

554
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,800
Yeah, it was pretty dangerous for me, uh...

555
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,460
Friends, the...

556
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,400
The time that Pope David Meyer and I preached in Boston

557
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,560
At the Spit Club, aptly named

558
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:03,940
Yeah

559
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,880
In Boston

560
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,860
The goons played first and started throwing food around up on stage

561
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,640
And the, uh...

562
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,440
No, not on stage, we were throwing it at the audience

563
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,560
Balls of spaghetti at the crowd

564
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,780
Yeah, well, they picked up the hint and, uh...

565
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,800
And then just threw it right back at us ranters

566
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,940
So there was less of us

567
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,900
I still have some pasta in my shorts

568
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,460
I was wondering about that

569
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:28,820
Geez

570
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,860
Yeah, really

571
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,860
Thought I went to some Italian restaurant today

572
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,640
But no, I'm afraid that's the way I stink every day

573
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,560
Just sort of like one big bowl of pasta

574
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,480
But I'll tell you...

575
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,400
And then there were pie fights on stage

576
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,480
And, uh, all sorts of things

577
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,120
Then the promoters used to have to...

578
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,840
They'd have us open for, like, the big bands that would come over to Boston from different places

579
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,380
And then they wised up about that pretty damn soon

580
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,860
After, uh, like, half the crowd would leave

581
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,760
Or sometimes they wouldn't even bother to show up

582
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,220
Because they knew we'd be playing

583
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,120
It was just one of those things

584
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,220
Hay fights and pie fights and mud fights and spaghetti fights

585
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,000
And, uh, head pro wrestlers

586
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,600
The whole gamut of it all

587
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,160
That was...

588
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,240
You know, it became such a thing, though, that it was just too big to control

589
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,000
And it got more and more spinal-tappish every day

590
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,160
Where it was like everything just turned into, like, your life became Billy Goon

591
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,960
That's why we have the Billy Goon tribute band out now

592
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,260
Because the original was just so great, so powerful

593
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,660
And just made people drop so many draws that we knew it was just too dangerous

594
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,480
To be able to bring it onto the road live

595
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,280
So the tribute band has come out

596
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,100
And I don't even perform with them anymore

597
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,700
Aren't they playing at one of those little clubs here in town?

598
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,280
Reunion Arena or something like that tomorrow night?

599
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:47,000
No, actually, I think the only reason we stopped in Dallas was to play up here

600
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,280
And then they wouldn't let our instruments in the front door

601
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,260
That's because they use living creatures for instruments, friends

602
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,720
That's right, and it said no alcohol

603
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,000
They wouldn't even let any of the other guys in the band up

604
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,380
Because they are just living alcohol

605
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,880
That's all, they're just mere walking fluids

606
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,660
Which is kind of an interesting thing

607
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,100
I myself had my entire body turned into a fluid hydraulic system many years ago

608
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,300
By my compatriot Dr. Felix Krul, MD

609
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,400
Who took all my internal organs out that I didn't need anymore

610
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,720
And just put this whole fluid hydraulic system in now

611
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,320
So I don't even have to bother eating anymore

612
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,840
Acubating can't be beat

613
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,420
Well, that ought to get us into the...

614
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,700
The Multifarian rant here

615
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,200
Which I think is somewhere along here in this tape

616
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,280
It's getting harder and harder to find the show in this room, friends

617
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:42,500
I got something for you, baby

618
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,760
Float within the cave of harmony

619
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,360
Oh, that cave

620
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,680
The mighty cave

621
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,640
That cave from whence we came

622
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,160
And to which we must go

623
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:54,740
And to which we must return

624
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,420
Oh, let us back into the cave

625
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,000
Only temporarily

626
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,940
But please let us

627
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,100
If we can't get our whole body

628
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,580
And at least some small portion of it

629
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,220
At least our heads

630
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,500
At least our German helmets

631
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,060
Ah, yes, dear friends

632
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:17,220
We can be a perfect family

633
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,720
We can be a perfect family

634
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,420
You can dance

635
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,380
Yes, dear friends

636
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,460
Oh, let us back into the cave

637
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:34,860
We can get our whole body

638
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,480
And just put this whole fluid hydraulic system in now

639
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,480
So I don't even have to bother eating anymore

640
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:36,480


641
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:36,820
And just let us back into the cave

642
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:40,220
Oh, let us back into the cave

643
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,160
And just let us back into the cave

644
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,800
We can be a perfect family

645
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,740
Oh, let us back into the cave

646
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,340
And just let us back into the cave

647
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,480
Here they watch them go to the moon

648
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,420
And now they're high on TV

649
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,880
Electric

650
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,520
Saving all the babies

651
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,780
Oh, yeah

652
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:22,680
Baby

653
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:22,940
Baby

654
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,880
Baby

655
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,420
Baby

656
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:24,840
Baby

657
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,900
Baby

658
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,180
Baby

659
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,820
Baby

660
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,460
Baby

661
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:27,640
Baby

662
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:27,960
Baby

663
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,260
Baby

664
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:28,660
Baby

665
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:28,660


666
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,140
Baby

667
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:32,660
Baby

668
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,700
What the Multifarians preach and believe is based on the concept of strength through disfigurement.

669
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:05,380
Beer in itself is an integral yet not exclusive element in the Multifarian way of life.

670
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,560
Most American beer drinkers are fat, lazy, sniddle-obs who have little desire or knowledge

671
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,480
in the true powers of the brew in which they partake.

672
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,640
Most people drink to escape problems and reality.

673
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,720
Multifarians, conversely, drink to create problems for those normals around them

674
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,780
so they can indulge in the holy horror of party-hawty

675
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,320
and be the true social buffoons they were in fact born to be.

676
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,760
That is why the darkest day on the Multifarian calendar is the dreaded amateur night

677
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,740
known to pink boys as New Year's Eve

678
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:43,280
when every normal feels obliged to get pie-faced even though they don't understand the power

679
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,620
and therefore ruin the good times of we stooges who take the job every day.

680
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:47,620


681
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:55,440
All these idiots do is crowd the bars, talk loud and stupid, smash up the road, smell awful and give alcohol a bad name.

682
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:02,140
Fortunately, these gnats will kill off themselves and each other due to the fact that they do not understand the power.

683
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:08,220
The Multifarian not only understands the power but knows how to use it and abuse it to his or her advantage.

684
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,080
One power is the holy sanity flush.

685
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,840
A great power of the Malt is to make every member a space shot for NASA,

686
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,380
a true astronaut.

687
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,900
Every morning after a disfigurement bout, the Multifarian enters the tabernacle of extra meditation

688
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,300
prepared to blast off, to shoot the moon so to speak.

689
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,080
This great cleansing process clears the head as well as the intestines.

690
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,080
Its effectiveness is doubled if it's performed after a wake-up call game of hide the salami.

691
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,880
The Multifarian will then have gotten rid of all the substances that reside in the Gouda chakra region

692
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,840
and will head off to the bar feeling like a new stoge.

693
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,600
A new lightness and quickness of step will send the Multifarian out.

694
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,060
The Multifarian will then have his way to face another day.

695
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,920
Another important element in the way is the act of getting reflected

696
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,460
while having a bout with the plane of pain, i.e. the mirror of disfigurement

697
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,760
by taking in the sacrament of what it looked like.

698
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:08,200
The Brainoma, in which the contents of the brain are hosed out at breakneck speed

699
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:14,780
thereby removing all unwanted particles and boosting the buildup of the loose parts into a more cohesive force.

700
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,180
If the beer takes care of the lower torso,

701
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,140
so the what it looked like takes care of the upper.

702
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,060
The cleaner something is, the better it works.

703
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,260
But it cannot be so clean as to remain totally purified.

704
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,260
This brings us to the diet of the Multifarian.

705
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:34,380
Essentially, the worse something is supposed to be for you, the better in fact it is.

706
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,920
You are told by the medical and governmental lackeys all about what you should do and what you shouldn't do to have a better life.

707
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,040
They tell you all that stuff to keep you weak.

708
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,720
They know of the power, the power of the malt, but they lie about it to you.

709
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,620
They tell you how to live right and how to eat right.

710
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,560
They tell you how to exercise right, but they're all wrong.

711
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,780
They're just trying to keep you in your self-imposed place, so they can retain psychological powers over you.

712
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:03,540
If they told you how radioactive you really are, they wouldn't be able to scare you with horror stories of Russians and bombs.

713
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:10,080
If they told you that after the bomb falls you'll feel the same way you do now, they'd just be a little less of you.

714
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:15,880
Then you wouldn't be so concerned with trying to play their idiotic games with their enemies because no one would give a...

715
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:26,120
The only way to live, therefore, is to partake in as many poisons available, thereby building up a superhuman immunity system.

716
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,820
Just because the rest of humanity has worked to stop evolution doesn't mean you have to.

717
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,080
Remember the insects in the DDT? Made them pretty strong, didn't it? Ha ha ha.

718
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:40,700
How about damn cockroaches? Who do you think is gonna take over the torch for man after we've gone the way of the dinosaurs?

719
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,940
Eat junk food, eat and drink tons of chemical preservatives, put hot sauce on everything and anything.

720
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:54,140
The hotter the better. Burn a hole in your digestive tract. Listen to everything so loud it makes your ears ooze.

721
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,480
You'll never need a Q-tip again. Your ears will be so clean you'll be able to hear somebody fart from across the street.

722
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:06,580
Eat raw meat! Don't forget sushi and hot sauce. Build a tolerance. You will survive.

723
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:12,960
By partaking in the yin-yang of poison, enter poison, exit, you will build a strength unknown to others.

724
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,140
Keeping clean while remaining poisoned.

725
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,640
And when it comes to exercising...

726
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,620
Don't waste your time.

727
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,960
Don't bother with jogging. Don't bother with nihilists. Don't bother with any of that other corporate nonsense.

728
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,680
Just f*** the way of the multifari.

729
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,020
Shall not be forsaken.

730
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,380
This episode of the Hour of Slack is underwritten by

731

734
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,360
Thanks, Weeping Cyclops, for supporting KNON and the Hour of Slack.

735
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,440
The Hour of Slack

736
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,220
Say that again?

737
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,200
You're welcome.

738
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,180
And thank you again. Oh, yes.

739
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,320
Well, speaking of one-eyed cyclopses...

740
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,140
Yeah.

741
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,080
Oh, Clee, you're so cute.

742
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:39,400
Uh-oh. Yeah, it's starting. I knew it. I knew it. Better go to the sound effects quick, boys.

743
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,780
No, no, we're gonna, we're gonna, uh, we're gonna hear the...

744
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,340
This is a swinging erudite's tune that's...

745
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,740
It's on a record. Mr. Beautiful presents...

746
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,900
All Hard.

747
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,660
And, oh, them boys are full of heart. So, uh...

748
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,740
Not heart!

749
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:01,420
So you... This is a cover tune. That's all the swinging erudites ever did, right?

750
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,840
Yeah, that's all they do now, too. They're actually becoming quite famous these days.

751
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,520
Who knows? They may even play here. I heard they were gonna go on tour.

752
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:16,140
Since I stopped playing with them, they became really famous in places like Los Angeles and New York and San Francisco.

753
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,460
Funny how that works.

754
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,060
Yeah, really.

755
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,660
Every time you leave a band, they get a contract.

756
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,900
Yeah, well, that's what happens, you know. But I guess, I guess that's what part of my job is, being a roving and missionary.

757
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,840
You know, just coming out and finding those squirts where they're hiding and, uh, bring them out into the public.

758
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:38,000
But these guys, they, uh... I heard they were actually gonna be on the Tonight Show and playing in Las Vegas and stuff.

759
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,580
They, uh, did a version of, uh, Walk Like an Egyptian called Walk With the...

760
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,740
No, no, forget it. This is Dallas.

761
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,940
Oh, this is Dallas. They'll never play it down here.

762
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,660
Well, they do Bon Jovi, uh, what is it, uh, Living on My Hair.

763
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,300
Oh, I'm a millionaire, oh, living on my hair. You know, something like that.

764
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,960
Yeah, so, friends, you can see why, if Cleve is in your band, fire him for success.

765
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,740
That's right. It's the only way.

766
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,240
I had to go teach Finnish girls how to drink tequila.

767
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,820
You just sort of drink it with a little bit of this salt here and a little chunk of that lime.

768
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,460
And then how about a nice semen chaser?

769
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,720
Yeah, you taught me how to drink tequila.

770
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,680
I'm gonna drink tequila all over again. Look what happened.

771
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:46,900
Yeah.

772
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,240
Did these girls throw up on your hotel bed?

773
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,660
Uh, no, uh, unfortunately. It would've, it would've made a good photo.

774
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,800
Always looking for the ultimate photo opportunity.

775
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,280


776
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,520
Yeah.

777
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,460
Human props.

778
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,760
I always like to leave a little something for the maid, you know.

779
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:12,680
If it can't be a five dollar bill, well, at least it can be a big splotch of vomit right in the middle of the bed.

780
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:12,980
Yeah.

781
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,700
Or a nice semen stain just sort of right on the, on the nice part of the carpet.

782
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:24,060
Or maybe a, a nice hole in the middle of the TV set.

783
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:35,740
Or, uh, or maybe five or six newspapers all torn up into tiny little pieces that we can train hamsters in our room at night.

784
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,260
Yeah, and he's not just making it up either. I saw the photos to prove it.

785
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,700
I mean, sad but true.

786
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:54,460
I don't know, we've got a lot to learn from Clebe in, in terms of, you know, we're, it's like we're not gonna have any success with these shows unless we know how to, how to tear up a hotel room right, or, and a tour bus.

787
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:12,680
Yeah, just how to, uh, and how to, you know, like, beat up, uh, sax players and, uh, and just how to, uh, when you get into a foreign airport, make sure that the, the dope smelling dogs just go after the one guy in the van that doesn't even know what he's doing.

788
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:12,680


789
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,100
Yeah, and, uh, we'll see if we can get high.

790
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,020
Right here.

791
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,360
Go around to the secret entrance to the post office here.

792
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,260
Don't run out of gas before I get there.

793
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,980
There's bags and bags and bags of mail here.

794
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,660
Bags of Bobby shit.

795
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,300
Down here at 75214.

796
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,100
We sell the Bobby shit back to the Bobbies for, like, 75 bucks a pound.

797
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,520
Dumbasses don't even know it's their own shit.

798
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,400
They'll buy it anyway.

799
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,320
Yeah, yeah, they send it to us.

800
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:42,660
They don't buy it.

801
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,320
They don't recognize it when they get it back.

802
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,180
They think it smells familiar, though, so they kinda like it.

803
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:47,220
Guru pee.

804
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,200
Guru pee.

805
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,840
Oh, they love the guru pee.

806
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,940
You can get 10 bucks a bottle for that now.

807
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,300
Really?

808
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,880
And Cleve produces 40 or 50 bottles in one night.

809
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,580
At least.

810
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,000
Give them enough Schaefer's.

811
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,420
They like powder it, you know, so it comes out as powdered urine.

812
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:05,880
Ugh.

813
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,760
Well, we need to, uh, dump a bag of mail here.

814
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:09,840
Fuck you.

815
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,580
I just showed Cleve.

816
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:12,720
Cleve

817
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:12,720


818
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:12,960
...

819
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,480
...

820
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,700
...

821
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,360
...

822
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,600
The post office really like us now.

823
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,440
There's still a couple of guys that hate

824
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,200
anything weird apparently.

825
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:38,440
But there's a couple of NPs that are, you know.

826
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,460
Getting the job.

827
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,300
Yeah, they know my kids' names.

828
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,260
They're into it.

829
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,020
I don't want to tell them about the radio show.

830
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,620
Yeah, they'll start coming out.

831
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,400
And then there's this one woman here

832
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,740
who just apparently got promoted into a good position.

833
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,180
Horizontal.

834
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:57,700
Yeah.

835
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,580
And you can tell by the way she looks.

836
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,180
She's a mattress-backed drug addict.

837
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,940
And the post office has lots of those.

838
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,280
And I like her and she likes.

839
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,700
Along with the 10,000.

840
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,240
You know, I think maybe the girls of Lakewood

841
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,100
would make an interesting photo study.

842
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,640
If you guys hadn't have fucked up,

843
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,800
we could have come down here

844
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,500
and we could have done it together.

845
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,120
I still gotta.

846
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,700
A couple of shots left and a few rolls of film.

847
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,660
As I look around here.

848
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,940
Wow, there's another fat Mexican chick.

849
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:31,360
Yeah.

850
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:32,660
Now we're talking.

851
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,440
Man, we could sell these photos to Buff.

852
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,760
Something fierce.

853
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,520
Money hand over fist.

854
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,060
Be like the richest guys around.

855
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,120
Just getting, scoping out models for Buff.

856
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,820
Got something worthwhile for once.

857
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,260
Ah, a new shoe screw.

858
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:48,740
Okay.

859
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,220
Yep, from Sister Chris.

860
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,260
Yep.

861
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,080
You oughta check out Sister.

862
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,480
There's a couple of points I'd like to bring up

863
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,560
about Sister Chris.

864
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,040
Yeah.

865
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,500
Yeah, check out Sister Chris.

866
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,380
Be on her show.

867
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,200
She is a half hour of slack.

868
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,320
Is that in New Jersey?

869
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,040
Yeah, yeah.

870
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,200
Yeah, you oughta definitely oughta check them out.

871
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,800
It's in East Orange and they're in,

872
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,060
it's not far from New York City.

873
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,400
Yeah, no, I know where that is.

874
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,020
Yeah.

875
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,160
And it's a great station.

876
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,180
I mean, it's the kind of, there's,

877
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,360
we know about three DJs there

878
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,020
that'll play anything we send them.

879
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,940
R. Stevie Moore and Erwin Chusen.

880
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:26,580
Oh, right, yeah.

881
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,740
Were the first two that we knew.

882
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,040
And then Sister Chris is,

883
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,200
she's a lady ranter.

884
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,180
I mean, she gets on there and she writes these rants

885
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,000
and does them up.

886
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,400
She runs up some rant juice

887
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,340
and screams and yells and does offensive stuff.

888
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:44,740
Hmm.

889
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,840
And she works in the layout department at that magazine.

890
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,580
She pasted up all that porno we're looking at.

891
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,000
Pillsbury Doughboy Fudge.

892
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,000


893
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,680
And she's a little punk in his little dough girl.

894
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,540
Dough or die.

895
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,960
It's always been one of my favorite.

896
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,240
I get them, I get every copy of Screw

897
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,840
and it's one of the few magazines that I really,

898
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,860
it's a great humor magazine.

899
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,040
It's really funny.

900
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,700
They're anti-conspiracy.

901
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,280
They're, you know, they exploit women.

902
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,420
It's just about as close to subgenius faith

903
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,420
as you can get.

904
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,340
Yeah.

905
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,360
I need to pull in here and get some money.

906
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,060
7-Eleven.

907
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:26,620
Money cigs.

908
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,840
Money cigs.

909
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,620
Beer wine gas.

910
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,480
Yeah, if you guys hadn't of fucked up, you know,

911
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,640
you could have been down here having the beer wine gas

912
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,680
with us last night.

913
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:36,880
That's right.

914
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,380
Man, what a fucking buzz that shit is.

915
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:40,760
Yeah.

916
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,080
We did some before the show and you could tell.

917
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,840
And then we did a whole bunch more after the show.

918
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,920
Not to mention what we did.

919
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,880
We did a whole bunch more during the show.

920
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:51,180
Yeah.

921
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,860
Which is another story entirely.

922
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,280
Our heads were demagnetized, don't we?

923
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,960
We're going to go buy cigs.

924
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,600
You guys can light up for us.

925
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,400
Fuck you.

926
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,100
Ever clear of tobacco.

927
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:05,740
Yeah, right.

928
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:06,740
Oh, man.

929
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,300
That's how I, you know, when I started smoking menthols,

930
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,980
it's great, you know, people, hey, can I bum a cigarette?

931
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,920
Pull out a pack of Kools and be like,

932
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,860
I can't smoke them nigger cigarettes.

933
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,940
But, of course, eventually they get desperate.

934
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,200
Oh, all right, I'll try one.

935
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,120
Then they like it and then they're on your ass

936
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,000
for the rest of the night.

937
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:27,520
Yeah.

938
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:30,720
That's right.

939
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,920
If you could find cool straights.

940
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,340
Now, there's a brand that not too many people bum off of.

941
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,440
Cool non-filters.

942
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:38,260
Man.

943
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:38,540
Yeah.

944
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,920
They're menthol with no filter?

945
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,260
Yeah.

946
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:41,720
Yeah.

947
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,760
It's like about the size of a palm oil.

948
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,240
And, uh.

949
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,480
Well, I've been nailsing coffee.

950
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:49,900
Yeah.

951
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:49,900


952
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:49,980
I've been doing that for a while.

953
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,420
Oh, yeah.

954
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:51,920
Definitely.

955
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,080
A couple of those.

956
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,020
You know, you know you smoked a cigarette after that.

957
00:48:59,160 --> 00:48:59,940
I had, uh.

958
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,680
Man, I had some cigarettes.

959
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,900
Philo smokes cigars.

960
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,940
Oh, that's always good.

961
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,820
And I know he's inhaling it.

962
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,180
Yep.

963
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:07,820
You got him.

964
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,540
You got him.

965
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:09,920
Oop.

966
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,340
I'll actually slow down at this speed limit here.

967
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,460
There's a police car behind me.

968
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,560
But we don't have any drugs.

969
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,200
No.

970
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,420
Just inside us.

971
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:19,880
Yeah.

972
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:19,880


973
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:19,880


974
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:19,880


975
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:19,880


976
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:19,880


977
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,020
Yep.

978
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,960
They can't bust us for that.

979
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:22,160
No.

980
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:22,680
Yet.

981
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,300
Piddle in a bottle, then.

982
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,080
Piddle in a bottle, then.

983
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:26,940
Pee, pee, pee, pee.

984
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:27,640
Piddle in a bottle.

985
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,960
They'll be trying to get that soon, though.

986
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,680
They'll be trying.

987
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:32,220
Yeah.

988
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:32,800
They'll.

989
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,380
Oh, they'll have a ray they can project at you.

990
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:35,500
Yeah.

991
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,360
It works like radar.

992
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,900
It's the one that you think about when you're unanswered.

993
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,340
Yeah.

994
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:43,580
A psychedelic detector.

995
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,940
They'll print out a photo of you.

996
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:49,860
Yeah.

997
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:49,860


998
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:49,860


999
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:49,860


1000
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:49,860


1001
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:49,860


1002
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:49,860


1003
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:49,860


1004
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:50,860
Like those heat photos.

1005
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,640
Just show how many drugs are in your system, where they are.

1006
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,920
Actually, it might be helpful for drug abuse control for your own self.

1007
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,560
Look at it and say, well, let's see.

1008
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,340
Look, there's some MNP walking along over there.

1009
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,680
It's kind of a big butt.

1010
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,220
Mm-hmm.

1011
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,660
But she had a nice pouty face.

1012
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,580
There you go.

1013
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,200
You see it now?

1014
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:13,380
Oh, no.

1015
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,320
The sunglasses on.

1016
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,520
Look at those pasta pockets on the sides.

1017
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,020
Unbelievable.

1018
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:18,560
Unbelievable.

1019
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,820
Handles you could really grab.

1020
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:19,840


1021
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,040
You can hold onto those and ride for hours on end.

1022
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:29,000
Plus, that gap between her teeth was big enough to take even a subgenius stick.

1023
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,880
Never mind a normal person.

1024
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,900
Speak for yourself, Cleve.

1025
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,100
Well, all right.

1026
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,260
Maybe it wasn't wide enough.

1027
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:41,780
I need to get some gas, because I might actually run out before we get to the hotel.

1028
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,240
Then the band would really be worried.

1029
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:45,740
Yeah.

1030
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,440
Remember the last time you were here, I got you.

1031
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,680
You were an hour late.

1032
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:49,820
Yeah.

1033
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,380
I was going to get you to the rehearsal.

1034
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,780
You were sweating it.

1035
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,700
That was when I realized you were a professional.

1036
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,340
You'd never know it otherwise.

1037
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:57,700
Yeah.

1038
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:58,500
Well, of course I could tell.

1039
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:02,680
Well, let's see what else is in this screw, as long as we're here.

1040
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:07,640
How to turn your old lady into a nympho.

1041
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,520
That could be interesting.

1042
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,260
Oh, a little S. Clay Wilson.

1043
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,360
Not bad.

1044
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,540
Not bad.

1045
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:16,280
A lot.

1046
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,820
Some places to, you know, get your stuff out.

1047
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:19,820


1048
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:19,820


1049
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:19,820


1050
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:19,820


1051
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:19,820


1052
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:19,820


1053
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:19,820


1054
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:19,820


1055
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:19,820


1056
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:19,820


1057
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:19,820


1058
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:19,820


1059

Why she had to go, I don't know

1147
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,300
She wouldn't say

1148
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:37,400
I said something wrong

1149
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,820
Now I don't know yesterday

1150
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,420
Yesterday

1151
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,740
Oh my, don't see so far away

1152
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,280
Don't see a place so hard away

1153

Well, I've got half the man I used to be

00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,320
There's a shadow hanging over me

1157

Oh, I believe in yesterday

1158
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,300
Yesterday

1159
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,640
Love was such an easy game

1160
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,620
To play

1161
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,180
And now I need a place to hide away

1162
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:29,140
Oh, I believe in yesterday

1163
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,220
Let's speed it up, boys!

1164
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,820
Just a little while

1165
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,840
I'm not going to see too far away

1166
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,480
There's a person I want

1167

00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,480

Oh, I believe in yesterday

Oh, there's something wrong with me

I said something bad, boy, man

1178
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,200
Maybe you could make my troubles go away

1179
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,600
Why don't you go back up in the mountain, man?

1180
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,640
Find the pomeranian

1181

One, two, three, two, two, three

1191
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,060
For all I need

1192
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,580
For me here

1193
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,800
Friends, you must all be here

1194
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,640
For all I need

1195
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,620
Why don't you just tear them off, boys?

1196
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,100
Woo-hoo!

1197
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,660
You got another number B there?

1198
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,820
We must hide rid of the foolishness

1199
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:57,540
Cause yesterday we believed in water beer

1200
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:58,800
Wow!

1201
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,760
I'm getting fiver!

1202
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:02,820

00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,720
Cause I smell like sour-brot

1204
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,800
Enough of this ethnic crap

1205
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,900
How about a little avant-garde freeform jazz?

00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,980
Oh, may the saints be praised.

1213
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,280
May you have a six-pack and a potato

1214
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,080
because you might have a seven-course meal.

1215
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:51,620
Oh, short me gonnery of Brendan, your friend.

1216
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,200
Oh, it must be true, lad.

1217

The saints be praised.

1218
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,200
Oh, may the saints be...

1219
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,820
It's bluegrass time.

1220
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,860
One, two, three, four.

1221
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,360
Yesterday.

1222
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,460
I'm a trouble-slinger by nobody.

1223
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,500
I need to play some handy.

1224
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:11,880
Well, I'm a lady to you yesterday.

1225
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,220
Dirty and a bit of my.

1226
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,260
Oh, where's my money?

1227
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,540
Where's the happy old man from the course?

1228
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:23,220
Oh, I'm a lady to you yesterday.

1229
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,180
Oh, yesterday.

1230
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,300
One more time, Gary.

1231
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,520
No!

1232
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,320
You are not to keep the power.

1233
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,280
No, never go away.

1234
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,200
The night is here.

1235
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,460
It's yesterday.

1236
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,660
Tweet the capable Staff.

1237
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,120
Oh, I need the staffs' help.

1238
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:13,120


1239
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,120
Ohohohohoho!

1240
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,220
Oh, hohoho.

1241
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,240
Oh

1242
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:58,280
Reverend Stank, did I ever tell you about the time that George Clinton and I sat around and talked about Bob?

1243
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,780
Nope, nope, sure didn't.

1244
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:06,200
It was a beautiful thing, and I think that all subgenius out there can learn a lot from George Clinton.

1245
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,580
I said, well, George, what do you think about Bob?

1246
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,300
And he said, Bob, he's a rascally old mug.

1247
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:14,940
Really?

1248
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:15,360
Yeah.

1249
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,480
Yeah, that's what he said.

1250
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,340
That looked good on the back cover of Book of the Subgenius.

1251
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:20,600
Yeah.

1252
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:23,180
Bob, he's a rascally old mug.

1253
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,640
George Clinton.

1254
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,340
Well, hey, you ran into, when you were on tour with the band that we can't announce,

1255
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:37,540
you were in Europe, and you saw a newspaper in Helsinki.

1256
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,760
It had Bob in it.

1257
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:39,520
That's right.

1258
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:40,300
Man.

1259
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,760
It was the example of American degeneracy.

1260
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:44,980
It was an example.

1261
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,700
I remember the jokes about Jesus.

1262
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:47,980
Can we say Jesus?

1263
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,060
No, no, that's offensive.

1264
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,220
Extremely offensive to some people.

1265
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:59,240
You know, actually, when I was playing in Valencia, Spain, this guy came up to the bass player

1266
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,560
in the Broad Street Carpet Munchies, and he said, hello, my name is Jesus.

1267
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:07,520
And the bass player said, my, I've always wanted to meet you.

1268
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:12,780
It was just a beautiful thing, and we looked for the spatulas, or whatever they call the blood

1269
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:13,720
coming out of the hands there.

1270
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,720
but that really didn't work.

1271
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,080
Unfortunately, he didn't have that job there.

1272
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,260
But yes, I did see Bob in Helsinki,

1273
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:24,260
and he looked fine and divine up there in that newspaper,

1274
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,340
and I couldn't steal it.

1275
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,820
I tried, I tried, but I just couldn't steal it.

1276
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:34,120
No amount of vodka would wrench it out of that potential subgenius's hands.

1277
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,580
And what vodka did they have up there?

1278
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,960
Dear friends, I don't know if you've ever been to Helsinki, Finland.

1279
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,060
It's about eight time zones away and kind of chilly all year.

1280
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,780
Definitely not like Texas at all.

1281
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,080
I was there just a few weeks ago,

1282
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,260
and it was about zero degrees up there,

1283
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:52,280
and it was mighty chilly.

1284
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:55,160
But their vodka comes in beer bottles,

1285
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,900
and it comes by the six-pack,

1286
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,060
and you drink it ice cold,

1287
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,480
and it's a lot stronger than the vodka they have around here.

1288
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:07,120
And praise Bob, I wasn't able to drink a whole six-pack of it,

1289
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:07,980
I must admit.

1290
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,960
Sorry, I do have my Achilles heel there.

1291
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:11,540
Well, you know what?

1292
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,200
I had five. It was close.

1293
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,720
Well, you can get practice for those European beverages.

1294
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,340
I noticed in the convenience stores around here,

1295
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:22,840
they're selling beer-wine gas now.

1296
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,920
The generic, you can put it in your car as oil or gas.

1297
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:28,780
That's right.

1298
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,720
It works quite well.

1299
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,180
That's what we use on our tour bus, as a matter of fact.

1300
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:34,480
And if you drink it, you don't need to eat.

1301
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:35,440
No.

1302
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,660
No, well, and after you've drank one bottle,

1303
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:38,940
you won't want to drink another.

1304
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:39,940
You won't be able to ever eat again,

1305
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,940
because your entire insides will get burned right out.

1306
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:46,340
Now, that stuff is really, really just fine, fine stuff.

1307
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,620
And I've been waiting for them to export that,

1308
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,520
because, you know, Reverend Stan,

1309
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,540
when I was in London a couple of weeks ago,

1310
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:58,060
you know, Thunderbird is now the wine of choice over there.

1311
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:01,220
It is considered, and anybody that doesn't believe me,

1312
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,740
I'll pay you the airfare to go over there and check it out.

1313
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:03,840
What's the word?

1314
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,240
It was unbelievable.

1315
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,880
I went into this ABC office,

1316
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,820
and I had a liquor store license over there,

1317
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,960
a liquor store in American,

1318
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,920
and there was right on the door,

1319
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,140
as I walked in, this giant ad,

1320
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:21,220
a big six-by-six poster for Thunderbird,

1321
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,460
and it had a man and wife there,

1322
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,720
and a, well, actually, they had the fake wedding rings on.

1323
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,680
America's fine aperitif wine.

1324
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:29,640
That's what it was.

1325
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,200
Served extremely cold.

1326
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:34,440
People wearing tuxedos and fine evening dresses,

1327
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,620
sitting there sipping it,

1328
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,940
and they had it advertised as a fine aperitif,

1329
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,280
goes with all foods.

1330
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,500
Yeah, like what?

1331
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:42,880
Sterno and French bread?

1332
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:46,200
Well, if they can sell Thunderbird wine in England

1333
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:50,600
as a fine after-dinner aperitif in fancy restaurants,

1334
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,920
then I don't see why the Church of the Subgenius

1335
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,840
doesn't go over there a little better.

1336
01:02:55,060 --> 01:03:00,180
Yeah, really, especially with the beer gas wine cooler there.

1337
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:01,820
Yeah, that comes free with the book, friends.

1338
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:02,320
Well?

1339
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:07,740
Oh, well, winos are classy everywhere, you know.

1340
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:08,920
You have to travel.

1341
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:09,720
You have to travel in the right circles.

1342
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,040
The real religion is out there on the street.

1343
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,480
Those boys with those green bottles,

1344
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:17,020
they're feeling good,

1345
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,760
and that's what religion's supposed to be.

1346
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:20,680
They have slack.

1347
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:20,860
You know?

1348
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,780
They do have slack.

1349
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,600
Well, but...

1350
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:27,300
Until they run out of money the next morning

1351
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:30,860
and have to walk up to me like they got it earlier today and...

1352
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,340
You know, one thing I'm ashamed of...

1353
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:33,580
...ask for a cup of coffee money.

1354
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:38,080
I'm totally ashamed of the fact that Thunderbird and Night Train

1355
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,260
have now gone up in price, and it's now...

1356
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:44,880
I saw it in Houston yesterday for $2.69 a quart, which...

1357
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,200
$2.69 for Mad Dog?

1358
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:48,280
What's the point?

1359
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:48,960
Unbelievable.

1360
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:51,120
I remember when it was $30 twice, you know.

1361
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:53,160
I realize I'm aging myself here.

1362
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,800
Of course, dear friends, I was born back in the...

1363
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,260
the...

1364
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:56,760
the...

1365
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,320
the...

1366
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:57,420
the...

1367
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:57,500
the...

1368
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:57,640
the...

1369
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:57,640


1370
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:57,820
the...

1371
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:58,060
the...

1372
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:58,260
the...

1373
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:58,860
the...

1374
01:03:58,860 --> 01:03:59,080
the...

1375
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,200
the...

1376
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:01,280
the...

1377
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:01,420
the...

1378
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:01,580
the...

1379
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:01,700
the...

1380
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:01,960
the...

1381
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:03,260
the...

1382
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:03,480
the...

1383
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:03,480


1384
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:03,480


1385
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:03,680
the...

1386
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,460
the...

1387
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:05,260
the...

1388
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:05,340
the...

1389
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:05,400
the...

1390
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:05,400


1391
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:05,400


1392
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:05,640
the...

1393
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:05,640


1394
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,000
the...

1395
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,540
Not to mention the prehistoric women.

1396
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:11,060
Ooh, that's another story entirely.

1397
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,860
And Pope Sissouli can probably tell us about that.

1398
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:16,800
But, unfortunately, I've got two more carts to play.

1399
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:17,840
So...

1400
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:18,580
Yeah!

1401
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,880
I thought I had two more carts to play.

1402
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,480
Well, maybe we ought to hear about these prehistoric women.

1403
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:29,800
It's a good thing they gave me two.

1404
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:31,880
There we go.

1405
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,220
If you love jazz, tune in Thursday nights

1406
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:36,980
from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.

1407
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:39,180
to 11 p.m. for Soul Soothing Jazz.

1408
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,260
Hi, I'm Patrice Carey.

1409
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:45,080
Along with Ron Lindsey and Edwin Bell,

1410
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:49,200
we bring you Soul Soothing Jazz Thursdays from 9 to 11.

1411
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:53,540
We take you on a jazz excursion as you'll hear nowhere else.

1412
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,960
We bring it to you smooth and mellow

1413
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,740
and soft and warm.

1414
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,520
We'll be right back.

1415
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:42,340
I am a soft genius.

1416
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:48,600
And by that bet you in touch with forces greater than man.

1417
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:53,820
My power wasn't given to me in exchange for prayer or meditation.

1418
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:59,200
I paid for it in cold, hard American dollars.

1419
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:03,640
Salvation you get for free is worth just that.

1420
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,900
Nothing you quit.

1421
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:05,580
Yeah.

1422
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:06,200
The conspiracy.

1423
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,380
The conspiracy sees to that

1424
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,940
but a very important element of your soul

1425
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:13,300
and here's to those otherwise worthless greenbacks

1426
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:17,340
that Bob needs in order to pursue his plan

1427
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,500
for world domination.

1428
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,660
I say, Bob

1429
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,880
guides my hand in all things

1430
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,080
and pays me off in pure slack.

1431
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,620
So I say to you whips,

1432
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,580
you fools,

1433
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:34,700
you dupes,

1434
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:35,580
you pigs,

1435
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,380
give me your money.

1436
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,660
You won't need it in the future.

1437
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:43,240
The future offers you not but destruction.

1438
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,860
You know what I mean?

1439
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:45,660
I mean,

1440
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:55,040
I dare you to kill me.

1441
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,380
I am a soft genius.

1442
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,060
That's all I need to be.

1443
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,380
I'm one of the good guys.

1444
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:05,620
My cards shall prevail.

1445
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:08,980
Let out the crazy man inside you.

1446
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,240
He knows what's what.

1447
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:13,420
Smile when you call me a fanatic.

1448
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,400
Or you say,

1449
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,400
me, primate.

1450
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,780
Me, overman.

1451
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,560
You think I'm dumb,

1452
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,160
but you are blind to the conspiracy that runs your life.

1453
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:27,600
And you have your geniuses running things for you

1454
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,080
when you think they're going to make things safe and simple and easy

1455
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,740
and all that freeze-dried conmedia-ful.

1456
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:35,420
Well, I'm a...

1457
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:36,280
I'm a soft genius.

1458
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:40,320
And I'm going to make things safe and simple and easy for me

1459
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,160
and the entire soft genius race.

1460
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:47,340
Even if it means wiping out your sick society in total

1461
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:50,740
with no more sentiment involved in swatting the fly.

1462
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:55,780
All this so we might survive the end times.

1463
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,060
You know why?

1464
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,460
Because I am,

1465
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,520
I am,

1466
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:00,620
I am,

1467
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,720
I am,

1468
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,280
a soft genius.

1469
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:04,260
I say,

1470
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:04,580
Bob,

1471
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:11,960
you blow-dried white wine-zipping designer jean-clad French film-watching walkman-toting hip-wimps.

1472
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:18,660
You house-coated inquirer-reading trailer-and-camp-ball-shopping-hair-curl-motor-heads-cock-holsters.

1473
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,760
All you dupes.

1474
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:34,740
The corporate big-money-oil-exploder-tree-killing-land-raping-food-freezing-desk-warming-trilateralist-establishmentarian-vote-hunting-backstabbing-poverty-spreading-bomb-wielding-merang-headed.

1475
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,060
Pencil-necked,

1476
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,060
eraser-headed politicos.

1477
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,920
Kill the conspiracy!

1478
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:42,360
Kill them and eat them!

1479
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:44,300
Who do you think you are?

1480
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,560
What do you think you're doing?

1481
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:48,720
Do you think you got it good?

1482
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:49,520
Well,

1483
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,120
dispose of those illusions!

1484
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,080
Dispose of them all right now!

1485
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:56,460
Because on July 5th, 1998,

1486
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,640
at 7.30 in the morning,

1487
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:01,080
you shall be judged!

1488
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:02,720
Yes, indeed,

1489
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:03,720
I tell you,

1490
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,380
Zach Kibar,

1491
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,400
you shall be judged!

1492
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:09,820
And not by some jury of your peers,

1493
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,540
but by an axe cold,

1494
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,320
calculating,

1495
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,880
alien race,

1496
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,320
with moral standards radically different from your own!

1497
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,100
If you don't follow Bob,

1498
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,440
you won't escape their scrutiny!

1499
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,360
If you are not a made-up subgenius,

1500
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,240
you just aren't good enough!

1501
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,620
You will fly,

1502
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:29,860
while we will party!

1503
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,420
Give me another beer, Zach Kibar!

1504
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:35,380
Give me another nice pink, pink bottle of Thunderclap!

1505
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:35,380


1506
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:35,380


1507
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:38,920
I'm gonna get down and do it right here, nasty and dirty!

1508
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:40,120
You know why, Daddy?

1509
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,020
You know why?

1510
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:47,040
Because I am a subgenius!

1511
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,300
That's right!

1512
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,500
I drive my own car and I ride my own ticket!

1513
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,860
There is such a thing as free lunch,

1514
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,540
and I'm gonna eat it, Daddy!

1515
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,900
Because you know why?

1516
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,880
I am, I am, I am,

1517
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:12,260
I am a subgenius!

1518
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,880
Or kill me.

1519
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:22,960
Oh, I wouldn't be surprised if that very thing happened,

1520
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,740
uh, Dr. Duncan.

1521
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:28,700
You know, there's probably those who would love to do it.

1522
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:31,540
There probably are, you know, I wouldn't blame them in the least.

1523
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,560
And some mornings, dear friends, I think that it's me I should just kill.

1524
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,220
I wish we could tell them where they could go and kill you this week while you're in town,

1525
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,480
but I guess we'd best not.

1526
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:43,600
Well, it's Rico's Rhythm Room down off of I-45, just about eight miles south of here,

1527
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:47,200
and you can see the Broad Street Carpet Munchers down there,

1528
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:50,620
and if you're young and willing, then we're old and swilling,

1529
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,600
and we'll be taking the job.

1530
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,940
But you know, dear friends, while I have you here,

1531
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,620
and speaking to you from here in the beautiful studios of K-N-O-N here in Dallas, Texas,

1532
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:03,560
I really have to give you my own personal endorsement.

1533
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,400
My personal life story.

1534
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:08,140
You know, friends, years ago, I was confused.

1535
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,020
I didn't know which way I was going except for the bottom of the bottle.

1536
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,980
But then, dear friends, I met Bob,

1537
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:16,840
and all of a sudden, that bottle was turned upright and right down my throat.

1538
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:19,940
Yes, dear friends, you know, Bob came to me one day,

1539
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:22,220
and he said, you know, if you send me $20,

1540
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:28,000
I guarantee that within a good year or so, you will never have to work again.

1541
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:30,200
You can have a whole life of slack.

1542
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,540
Yes, money will be falling at your feet.

1543
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:35,480
Women will be coming up and tying up your toenails

1544
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,320
and just having a good old time there.

1545
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,920
Yes, indeed, and dear friends, you know, I sent that $20 in,

1546
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:45,060
and you know, guarantee that I am standing right here in Dallas, Texas,

1547
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:49,160
two years to that day, I had slack.

1548
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:52,420
And to this day, dear friends, I still have slack.

1549
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:56,380
I don't work, and I have about $400 just sitting in my pocket right now

1550
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:58,680
and a couple of other thousand just back in my hotel.

1551
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:01,080
Five bank accounts, two Swiss chalets,

1552
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:02,240
and wines, wine.

1553
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,880
Women's and songs everywhere all over the globe.

1554
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:08,540
I've spun this whole globe 4,000 times, and I ain't even stopped yet.

1555
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,440
I'm going to be spinning for a lot more longer.

1556
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:14,600
So I want you out there not to be a Bobby.

1557
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:19,060
No, no, I want you to get down, get down in that checkbook,

1558
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,140
get down with that thing and...

1559
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,940
Yeah, and send money to KNON.

1560
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:28,420
Right here in Dallas, Texas, and I don't know what the address is,

1561
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:31,240
but of course, this is not an on-air solicitation.

1562
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,320
It's not an on-air solicitation for the Church of the Subgenius.

1563
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,480
No, no, dear friends, you know where you can find that out.

1564
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:37,880
You know how you can find out about...

1565
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,380
We only have about four minutes.

1566
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:41,040
I need to tell them where to find that out.

1567
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,260
About post office box 140306.

1568
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,840
In Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1569
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:51,380
Or we have a small, not a major subgenius revival,

1570
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:55,980
probably just be me out there, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1571
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,920
But this Friday night at 10 o'clock

1572
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:04,240
at the Sheraton downtown in Live Oak.

1573
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,340
And what building is it in?

1574
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,920
The Southland, yeah, the Southland building.

1575
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,120
Uh, my friend, Subgenius D. Vival.

1576
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:16,800
Now, I want y'all to stay tuned for Robert Wisdom's show,

1577
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,320
American Music Party.

1578
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,640
And I was fixing to play your tune,

1579
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:26,280
the one last drop tune.

1580
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:26,960
Ah, yes.

1581
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:29,240
But instead, I think I'm going to go to,

1582
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,640
uh, the Suede Cowboys or the, uh,

1583
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:34,440
Swinging Erudites doing Stand By Your Man.

1584
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:35,820
Ah, yes, Swinging Erudites.

1585
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:37,540
Yep, we'll get in.

1586
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,240
Not to be confused with the Swinging Love Corpses.

1587
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,280
That will be settled out of court.

1588
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:42,400
Praise Cleve.

1589
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,740
Thank you, friends, for letting me take up your time

1590
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:48,640
and take up your mind and kick your behind.

1591
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:07,400
Sometimes it's hard to be a woman.

1592
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:15,120
Oh, giving all your love to just one man.

1593
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,720
You'll have a bad time.

1594
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,540
And we'll have a good time.

1595
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:31,020
Doing things that we don't all understand.

1596
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:39,600
But if you love him, be proud of him.

1597
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:47,000
I guess the next line is try to do the things that he understands.

1598
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,480
Very nice.

1599
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,600
Cause if you love him,

1600
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,480
I'll be proud of him.

1601
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:03,340
Cause after all, he's just a man.

1602
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:05,880
Everybody!

1603
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:09,240
Stand by your man.

1604
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,000
Give him to a hard-to-clink dude.

1605
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:18,760
And something warm to come to.

1606
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:19,200
The dicks!

1607
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,560
The ducks are cold and moldy.

1608
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,280
Stand by your man.

1609
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:30,640
And tell the world you love him.

1610
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Keep giving all the love you can.

1611
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,280
Sing, you animals!

1612
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:43,160
Stand by your man.

1613
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,720
Play it out, boys!

1614
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:58,920
He knows that you won't want it.

1615
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:14,480
Can you come play a lullaby with him,

1616
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:19,480
Hey?

1617
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,480
由ю

1618
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,300
from the old dojo on the 80's!

1619
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:26,060
And tell the world we love it

1620
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:30,360
And give it all that we can

1621
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:43,620
We were counting on you

1622
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:18,900
We were counting on you

1623
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:51,460
We were counting on you

1624
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:22,280
We were counting on you

1625
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:52,240
We were counting on you

1626
01:18:52,300 --> 01:19:20,980
We were counting on you

1627
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:52,280
We were counting on you

1628
01:19:52,300 --> 01:20:20,540
We were counting on you

1629
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:34,700
We were counting on you

1630
01:20:52,300 --> 01:21:22,220
We were counting on you

1631
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:51,060
We were counting on you

1632
01:21:52,600 --> 01:22:21,900
We were counting on you

1633
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:48,700
We were counting on you

1634
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:21,820
We were counting on you

1635
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,000
We were counting on you

1636
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:37,400
We were counting on you

1637
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,060
We were counting on you

1638
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:42,940
We were counting on you

1639
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,880
We were counting on you

1640
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:45,500
We were counting on you

1641
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:45,620
We were counting on you

1642
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:46,120
We were counting on you

1643
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:46,560
We were counting on you

1644
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,460
We were counting on you

1645
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:50,920
We were counting on you

1646
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,280
You talked about me

1647
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:04,580
i just get driven while intoxicated, does that count?

1648
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:10,120
y- why do they have the coffey mug on the truck?

1649
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:19,400
do they know we had these plastic cigarette filters in the coffee again to get that extra buzz?

1650
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,380
So you can drink more.

1651
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:21,760
Yeah.

1652
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:26,060
I gotta get out of this bus lane.

1653
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:27,980
Yeah. Texas exempt.

1654
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:30,560
Exempt from brains, I think.

1655
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,160
Lick of beer wine.

1656
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,140
Oh yeah.

1657
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:38,960
And probably bail bonds too.

1658
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:39,480
Yep.

1659
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:42,000
That's the jet that you get at the courthouse right there.

1660
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:42,820
One of them.

1661
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:46,900
It's one of the stops you have to make when you're bailing your friend out of jail.

1662
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,380
You gotta drive back and forth between about five and ten miles.

1663
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,940
And get this incredible stupid run around.

1664
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:57,420
But since I don't hang around with Dr. X anymore.

1665
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,100
It hasn't happened in a long time.

1666
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,560
I haven't had to do that for a while.

1667
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,220
Probably just as well.

1668
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:04,780
Eats up a lot of gas.

1669
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:06,380
He hadn't changed.

1670
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:09,160
Oh, finally Monty called the other day.

1671
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:11,740
Just to get Buck's phone number.

1672
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:12,820
Strangely enough.

1673
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:13,560
I don't know why.

1674
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:16,460
I guess he wanted the Batmobile for something.

1675
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,320
And you know you could tell he was drunk.

1676
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:19,360


1677
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:19,360


1678
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:26,180
He started into a story about meeting Bob Stevens at the studios.

1679
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,180
And Bob was still an asshole.

1680
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,340
Unlike Monty.

1681
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,240
Then Monty asked me for Buck's number.

1682
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:34,020
Then Monty did an exact replay.

1683
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:37,440
30 seconds after finishing it already.

1684
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:40,200
Of the meeting Bob Stevens again.

1685
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,680
As if he hadn't said it.

1686
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:43,920
And then he dropped the phone.

1687
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:47,540
And it was about a minute before he could pick it up again.

1688
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:48,920
Now I thought.

1689
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:50,780
Some things just don't change.

1690
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:51,580
Yeah, really.

1691
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:54,480
Some people can't handle it.

1692
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,620
I thought I had a few cocktails too many in my lifetime.

1693
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:01,360
But uh.

1694
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,360
Well of course being a Maltafarian.

1695
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,500
I handle those things a lot better.

1696
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:07,600
Yeah, right.

1697
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,820
Your genes are set up for it.

1698
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:13,180
Yeah, if I don't have that quart of tequila every night.

1699
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:14,300
Then it fucks up.

1700
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:16,980
The Irish genes would work against you.

1701
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:19,220
But the subgenius Yeti genes.

1702
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:20,060
Would work for you.

1703
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:20,860
Yeah, yeah.

1704
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:25,700
That's why I don't vomit as much as I should.

1705
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,120
Bob genes keep it intact.

1706
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,380
Hello ladies.

1707
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:35,660
The secretaries down here look great.

1708
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:41,760
They have to wear like an inch of pancake makeup.

1709
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,260
So no blemish shows.

1710
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,100
They have to look like Playboy models.

1711
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:48,640
Yeah, right.

1712
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:51,400
And they have to get out of here before dark.

1713
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:53,900
Yeah, well I can't blame them on that.

1714
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:57,080
Because that's when people like you and I come out.

1715
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:01,600
Not to mention Philo and Sterno.

1716
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:04,620
It's uh.

1717
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:13,580
Well it's nice to be staying in a hotel right in historic Dealey Plaza convention site.

1718
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,460
Yeah, maybe you'll see the ghost.

1719
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:18,000
Oh, I'll be looking.

1720
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:18,620
For the many reasons you're looking for.

1721
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:18,620


1722
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:18,620


1723
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:18,620


1724
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:18,620


1725
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:18,620


1726
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:18,620


1727
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:18,980
The many ghosts.

1728
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,420
All the witnesses too.

1729
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:22,560
Sometimes there's a whole crowd of ghosts out there.

1730
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:26,600
There's a preacher that walks back and forth going.

1731
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:31,200
God is in his holy temple.

1732
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,440
Earthly thoughts be silent now.

1733
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,580
Ha ha ha.

1734
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:39,360
Ha ha ha.

1735
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,840
I love those ghosts.

1736
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:47,940
That preacher in Poltergeist 2 is Sandy and I's new hero.

1737
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:49,700
I haven't seen that part.

1738
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:54,920
The only part of that movie I've seen is where he eats the worm out of the bottle of mezcal.

1739
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:56,240
The old preacher's great.

1740
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:01,940
People that don't have families think it's a stupid movie because the family stuff is so corny.

1741
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:06,260
But you get corny when you have a family.

1742
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:13,160
Or else you don't have any instincts and you blow it off.

1743
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,460
But my instincts talk!

1744
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:19,380
I'm going to the Hyatt!

1745
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,860
Oh, ugh.

1746
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:30,420
It's starting to look like the neighborhood here.

1747
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:32,120
Ha ha.

1748
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:32,500
Ugh.

1749
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:36,000
Staying at the beautiful Bradford Plaza.

1750
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:38,300
No, no, they couldn't put us in the Hyatt.

1751
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:39,540
No, no, no.

1752
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:43,160
Yeah, that was for Tom Petty and his wife.

1753
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:43,680
Yeah.

1754
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:45,420
Where'd they put them?

1755
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:46,840
Probably in the Hyatt.

1756
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:49,820
Big time.

1757
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:51,020
Big, big time.

1758
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,680
Well, we've had our share of good hotels.

1759
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:57,700
We don't have to stay at Motel 6 anymore.

1760
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:00,280
This isn't too bad.

1761
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:04,840
Plus, you guys get the dregs of the groupies, which, you know, lead to more adventures.

1762
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,660
More adventures, definitely.

1763
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:08,760
More dregs.

1764
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:09,720
Groupie dregs.

1765
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:16,640
Well, I went to fuck Tom Petty, but I ended up with the Del Fuego's hired keyboardist.

1766
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:26,200
And he started, right when he was about to come, he suddenly started screaming strange words and incantations.

1767
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:33,720
And then when he did come, it was buckets and buckets of weird green stuff.

1768
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,340
Came on my ears.

1769
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:36,720
Seeming to have a life of its own.

1770
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:40,440
Tried to eat its way deeper inside me.

1771
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,980
I think it's getting near to my brain now.

1772
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:43,600
Oh, yeah.

1773
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:47,580
My cervix is totally destroyed.

1774
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,480
Toxic Avenger 2.

1775
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,720
Yeah, that's...

1776
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,420
Cleave Toxic Avenger.

1777
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:57,600
Donkey.

1778
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:03,760
Have to keep a six pack on hand for them afterwards for a chaser.

1779
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,320
Oh, there it is. The Bradford.

1780
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:11,760
You know, I didn't even know that hotel existed.

1781
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:13,580
Well, I don't know.

1782
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:14,640
It may not.

1783
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:16,740
It's not very, I mean, it's pretty nondescript.

1784
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:17,260
Yeah.

1785
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:18,580
It's just a box.

1786
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:31,320
Building across the street from me is Union Station, which is like a rich bar, but it's full of drunken reporters from the newspapers right in the TV station.

1787
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:31,740
Oh, yeah, right.

1788
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:36,320
KZOO is right across from there, more or less.

1789
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:43,180
Oh, I'm gonna have to, uh, I thought I'd go over there in a little while, but I have a couple of margaritas before, uh...

1790
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:44,780
before the show.

1791
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,100
A few shots of mezcal, maybe the worm.

1792
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:49,780
Hey, there's my new bus.

1793
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,040
See that big blue thing over there?

1794
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:52,120
Alright, man!

1795
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,360
It's my new home.

1796
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,980
Boy, and you guys, I mean, it hasn't even been destroyed yet.

1797
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:58,420
No. Well, that's because I haven't been on it yet.

1798
01:30:58,420 --> 01:30:59,880
It doesn't even smell bad yet, right?

1799
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,080
Oh, I'm sure it's a little funky.

1800
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:02,500
Alright.

1801
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,960
Yeah, see, there's the Dallas Morning News.

1802
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:09,380
The Fever Club!

1803
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:10,080
Yeah.

1804
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:13,160
Alright, I'm sure. I'm sure they're looking for it. Yeah, I'll be there when I get there.

1805
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:13,440
I'll be there later.

1806
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:16,060
There's parking and a bunch of little things.

1807
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:16,400
Yeah.

1808
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:18,900
I guess I better...

1809
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:23,500
Alright, well, Philo and Sterno, I guess I'll, uh,

1810
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,220
see you guys the next time you don't

1811
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:25,760
fuck up.

1812
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,400
You dumbasses!

1813
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,540
I'll shut you off for a minute. I'll catch you on a flip-flop.

1814
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:33,440
Oh, shit.

1815
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:35,160
Well, shit, man, I hate to

1816
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:37,240
say goodbye to Cleave. He's such a

1817
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:39,140
uh, a funny

1818
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:39,480
guy.

1819
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:43,080
You know, for such an

1820
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:44,700
evil, degenerate man,

1821
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:46,800
he's just so, um,

1822
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:48,580
nice!

1823
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,000
You know?

1824
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:53,060
I've never seen him

1825
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:53,880
get pissed off.

1826
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:55,540
Of course, uh,

1827
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:56,940
uh,

1828
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:01,060
of course, you never know.

1829
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:02,320
We could always try it.
