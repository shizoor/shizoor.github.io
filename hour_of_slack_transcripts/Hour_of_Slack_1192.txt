Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Did you know that Bob spelled backwards and still says Bob?
Hey, hey.
Yes, please.
Operator, hurry.
Anyone in particular?
Just hurry.
Hello.
Hello.
Now, what was it you wanted?
Listen, you've got to stop him.
What?
Stop him.
I'm sorry, Mr. Ryder.
You idiot.
The worst is going on.
The Soul Genius.
Our own soul.
This is the operator.
I'm sorry you've been cut off.
I can't seem to get them back.
It doesn't matter, operator.
Nothing matters now.
Feel this way.
I never knew I was going to feel this way.
Yeah.
Shut your mouth.
Just a second.
It's so calming on the show.
That's what I love about shows.
It's just like washing in warm radio water.
It is calming.
Breathing.
So calming that it disturbs and beddiscus meditation.
Calm down my radio.
That's for meditation.
That's your job, sir.
Oh, just enjoy the radio smell.
Yeah, just enjoy the oboes.

You're going to enjoy the tear dryer.

Listen.

Yeah.
Eat as much toast as you want.
Yeah.
And in fact, eat a bit greasy breakfast after you have.
We recommend it.
After you have a night of debauchery.
And filled with too much of this and too much of that.
I did that a couple nights in a row recently.
Oh, me too.
Man, me too.
We had a couple of nights of debauchery.
Also, friends, on Valentine's Day weekend.
Only it wasn't at the Puzzling Evidence Show from KPFA Berkeley, which you just heard at
Will Again.
From Puzzling Evidence, Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrum.
Nay.
It was a couple of nights of debauchery at the Winter Star Symposium of Aught Nights.

It was a great time.

Winter Star is the annual winter indoor event put on by Ace of Cleveland.
The same people who put on Starwood in the summer.
They've been inviting me to come and preach at both of those festivals for 18 years now.
There's a lot more at a given Winter Star, though, than just the subgenius revival.
For instance, there's the Space Jam cabin.
Where the rather different version of a winter star is.
I want to know.
What type of singing well, you have?
Saya.
I'm not aware of revolutionary sleep singing any more.
I'm here with Dr. V decree are notière la���che.
I currently have an academic advisor of mine.
He didn't make it into college, and it's kind of working his eye out for me.

A lot of collagerie by Reverend Sweetness McGee, by The Large, and of course by the great Fernanda Nende-Lemur.
And a new old song from Phineas Narco of NationalCynical.com.
And a little radio synesthesia from WCSB Cleveland talking about radio trolls and kooks.
And finally, friends, a subgenius mass wedding.
And I think with that I have given just about all the credits for the entire show.
And so, let us join that live revival sermon from Winterstar in progress.
Now the subject, this Winterstar, we always have a theme.
And the theme this time was tribal spirituality.
Now, I happen to come from a group, I guess you could even call it a tribe, except for one thing.
It is a group of people who think that tribalism is the whole problem with religion and spirituality.
In other words, the minute you have a spiritual tribe, that means everybody else is in the other tribe.
And suddenly it is the us versus them thing.
And if you grew up in Dallas, Texas, you pretty quickly learn that either you are going to go to hell or else.
You have to start your own religion.
And so we took that alternate route.
But seriously, tribalism, that is kind of the problem with spirituality.
People form these little tribes where they go, well, I am more spiritual than you are, than your tribe is.
Now, if you are talking to me, that is probably true.
You probably are more spiritual than I am.
But.
We are, it is a different, the church of the subgenius is a difficult tribe to hold.
We do not even try to keep it together.
By definition, every subgenius is different from every other subgenius.
If any two are alike, one must die.
And the only thing we have in common is that we have nothing in common with the conspiracy of the normal people.
Who do not even know that they are conspiring against the weirdos.

I recently.
I recently realized that one way of putting it is, we are the funny weirdos making fun of the bad weirdos.
Now, that does not mean that we are the good weirdos.
That only means we are the funny weirdos.
Hopefully.
We are here to make civilization fun again, folks.
You know.
Something keeps getting missing from the equation.
Kayنا Did.
We cannot do nothing to stop this.
sucking in 있을 fashion.
One of our messages, that some of you may not have heard before.
Well there is really only one law with this particular religion.
You know, everyone has lots of commandments.
And believe me, we do.
We have a list of sins we suggest
that goes on for like 300 or 400 of them in one of our books.
I think Dr. Legume came up with most of those sins.
What is it a comprehensive list?
It's not.
If you come up with a new one, let us know.
We're always looking for new sins and so forth.
The idea, really, you know, if you come away from this with remembering anything at all,
after these videos, remember to keep your perversions and your twisted,
all the things that everybody else thinks is so messed up about you.
That's what you want to hold on to.
Your twistedness, your sickness, that's what makes you you.
Now, and in fact, let's see here.
According to, I always have to read the program notes to find out what it was I was going to talk about.
And this one was called Forbidden Times.
It's a topic.
Actually, when Jeff called me up and said,
hey, look, I don't have a program description for what you're going to do,
I looked at my email in front of me, and the first thing up was titled Forbidden Topic.
And I said, oh, it'll be Forbidden Topic.
But I then actually, well, here, let's see.
Pull the wool over your own eyes.
You'll still be blind, but your head will be warm.
I wish I could remember who said that.
Reverend Stang will unveil a new doctrine.
A doctrinal clarification, one which will cause great joy and slack to all who hear it.
This will be the most empowering subgenius rant ever,
but you may be surprised at just what you're being empowered to do.
Well, the email that I was looking at called Forbidden Topic was actually,
believe it or not, I sort of have a speech writer.
There's a friend of mine, young Reverend Onan Canobite,
who is 40 years old now.
And I'll always, he was the youngest subgenius at one time.
At one time, the oldest subgenius was 37,
and we couldn't believe that somebody that old would be interested in this stuff.
That's how long we've been around.
That guy, I think, is about 65 now.
Anyway, Onan had written a thing that he thought that I could use as a rant.
And normally, I try not to, I try to pretend I'm just,
saying this stuff, but I'm going to just read it.
Because it hadn't been around for that long, and it's fairly short.
But, it's great.
The only thing is, I noticed that on the side, in my handwriting,
is a note that says,
Never have I seen such a huge chip on such a small shoulder.
I must have been looking in a mirror or something.
It's hard to remember.
I'm a busy person.
I'm going to go get a drink here.
Water.
The greatest drug next to sleep.
As we have told you time and time again,
the Church of the Subgenius is not here to forgive your sins,
but to rationalize them.
What you should also know, is that we're here to condone any avenue of inquiry.
No matter how occult or forbidden a topic may be,
you are hereby empowered to jump in with all your might.
It is your duty to guide other people's lives.
And if you're on your way to发장어

comic book readers, there are some comics that are cooler than others. But don't you believe it,
friends. If you're old, you'll probably get a kick out of some of these new non-superhero
comics where nothing happens. If you're young, you better get to reading about Superman and
Spider-Man because there is truth in those comics, moral and philosophical four-colored truth.
Truth. Should you ask yourself, should you purchase that item of indulgence, whatever it is?
Well, why not? Go ahead, be bi-curious in our vendors room here. You can be very bi-curious,
and I hope you are. You already have all the money you're going to need for when you're dead,
and you're going to be dead a lot longer than you're going to be alive,
so consider it an investment in eternity.
Isn't that sweet? The occult and religion are endlessly fascinating, and there's no reason why
you shouldn't adopt all of them as your own. The more contradictory, the better. Behold,
the immaterial dialectic. It's a war, friends. It's a war, is what it is. On one side are the
cool people, and on the other side are the cool people. It's the subgeniuses that are in the middle.
And we say enough of their cool war. We're through being cool, to quote our friends, the divas.
And through being uncool. No. Actually, that sounds better that way. And we're through being
uncool. We're through being cool and through being uncool. But I think we do that through being
uncool. We cast derision upon the cool ostomy bags of the normals, their designer parasites,
of being cool or uncool. It has nothing to do with being a subgenius. What matters is having
slack. And the subgenius must have slack. By that, we don't mean, oh, you don't have enough
slack, so you have to join our church and buy all our stuff, and then you'll have slack. You do have
to buy all our stuff. But to be a subgenius, by definition, you must already have slack. You must
have slack, or you wouldn't even be here. Identifying it, remembering it,
appreciating it, that's the trick. You were born with original slack, friends, but the conspiracy
distracts you from it with false slack, which might include everything I'm saying right now.
I don't know. That's up to you to decide now, isn't it? Who here is hungry?
Me. I want some food. Actually, I didn't mean right now. I meant who is hungry ever?
See?
That's right. Somehow, we were created to have an ever-recurring appetite, but only sporadic
access to nutrition. We were somehow created to take in nutrition, but to enjoy the living fuck
out of sugar-fried bacon. The deck was stacked against us from the start, friends, so go ahead
and eat up while you can. The food chains of the law have been broken.
Eat what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. And, oh children, I know that some of you
sometimes might just sometimes think about sex. I don't think I need to say anything
more. For the advanced subgenius, there are even more exotic vistas to conquer, such as
getting a job, keeping it, then getting a better job, maybe even having health insurance.
These are some of the marvelous adventures that await many subgeniuses, friends. You
are free. Free, free. You can now, I'm a holy man and I can tell you this, as of this moment,
you may do anything you want and will still accept your money.
Remember friends, there's no I in Bob. There is an I in subgenius, and that I may be you.
The you in us. The us that becomes you when you send 30 U.S. dollars to us and become a
minister, an ordained minister. And I happen to have a box of ordainment materials if anybody
wants to become an ordained minister. And by the way, this is not, that part of it is
not a joke. If it is, a lot of subgeniuses have wasted money on divorces. Because I've
performed a lot of marriages under the auspices of the Church of the Subgenius. The Universal
Life Church also helps.
We've got entirely too many troublemakers here. They're a slacker.
I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing.
You ain't got no problem, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there and chill them
niggas out. And wait for the Bible to be coming directly.
See ya, negro. That's all you had to say.
I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there and chill them niggas out. And wait for the

Bible to be coming directly.
This is it. That moment they told us about in high school where one day Bob would save
our lives.
Hey, let's cut to the chase, okay? What are you guys selling?
Church of the Subgenius.
All right then. All right then.
Look, Church, you just ran.
Don't touch that. It's dirty.
Just because you deny something doesn't mean it isn't true. And let me tell you something,
it's so bad I can't even tell you how bad it is.
Why don't you donate $30 to the cause and maybe it'll make you feel better.
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

Why would you do that?

When you get into the subgenius thing, it becomes a somewhat inside jokey. Uh, and
I, I, you know, we, in a situation like this, we don't talk about the prairie squids, and
the face fucking bats and the frogs, uh —
and the bleeding head and all that kind of fun church stuff.
But sometimes people ask us about serious issues.
I mean, for some people it really is their religion.
They say, Reverend Stang, is there an afterlife?
The afterlife.
The Church of the Subgenius does believe in an afterlife.
It's called death.
And what happens after your life? You're dead.
You're dead forever.
So friends, if you've got some living to do, get busy.
There's a couple of people who aren't here because they died.
Damn it.
The war against God is not going that well.
I have to admit, we declared war against God,
and we knew at the time that it was the ultimate in folly.
That's why they call it subgenius.
Subgenius.
Somebody had to do it, but really we're not doing that great.
In the war against God, because people keep dying.
I never could understand that death thing.
Now, I'm sort of agnostic about that.
If I die and go through a tunnel of glowing light
and see all my friends and loved ones, my mom and everybody on the other side,
then you probably won't hear me complaining.
But if I die and don't...
nothing happens at all, you won't hear me complaining either.
To alcohol!
The cause of and solution to all of life's problems.
Ah, sweet liquor eases the pain.
I demand a sober detest.
That does it. Go like yourself.
I demand a sober detest, cause I ain't been drinking.
You can't seriously want to ban alcohol.
It tastes great, makes women appear more attractive,
and makes a person virtually invulnerable to criticism.
What did you use?
Uh, douche my canal with whiskey.
Well, whoever told you to do that?
Well, that's the way we do back home.
Well, that's a hell of a use for good liquor.
Well, Bob...
What do we do now?
I don't know what you're gonna do, but I got a bottle of whiskey around here someplace.
I'm gonna find it.
Everybody knows I'm just a drunk.
Praise God!
Praise God!
Hail God!
Hail God!
Hail God!
Hail God!
It's been difficult to have an organization of non-joiners.
We do eventually. Eventually they do send in their 30 bucks.
You'd be amazed. I've been making my living doing this,
and not much else, for like 15 or 16 years now.
Of course, then there was 15 years before that of utter hell and working three jobs,
and having five lives.
But now we have this...
The church has been around for so long that I run into people who go,
Oh yeah, that Bob stuff. I hate that.
My parents made me memorize that crap.
Like I say, we do try to deprogram our own zombies.
There's...
Sidion was asking last night about...
Well, he was saying...
that the ace should have a more interactive website.
And we know that. That's true.
It's just that we're old and lazy.
The subgenius group, on the other hand, does not...
We don't want an interactive website.
We use a completely different source, alt.slack, which is a free forum
you can look at through Google.
It's been around forever.
It was one of the first news groups on the internet, believe it or not.
I didn't even know what the internet was when alt.slack was created.
But we've learned through the years that there's a certain dynamic
of who gets interested in this stuff.
There's those who really get the joke.
There's those who think they get the joke.
And then there's the ones who haven't figured out that there's a joke at all.
And they're the scary ones, friends.
You really have to be worried about some of those.
We call them the differently reality persons.
Or the alternately sane.
You're not going to...
I don't want to put down crazy people, because that's my friends.
But like I say, we're the funny weirdos making fun of the bad weirdos.
And you occasionally see these...
Well, I guess you could call them kooks or crackpots on the internet
who go on and on and on about reality and the afterlife.
And how they're really God and so forth.
I've noticed that the one thing that differently reality persons have on the internet
is that they're all writing for future generations
who will be able to see in retrospect what a tremendous unsung visionary
that, quote, incoherent kook or, quote, blithering superstitious nutcase
actually was in his or her time.
The true alternately sane individual
welcomes the reality.
And that's the reason why we're so rousing and mocking.
Because those wiser future generations will be able to clearly see
how stupid the mockers were
and how clairvoyantly brilliant the so-called kook was.
Indeed, the more the kook is mocked,
the more proof that he has that he's ahead of his time.
And it's so odd and tragic that the super geniuses
so rarely live to see that marvelous day
when their old alt-dot slack posts are hailed
from sea to shining sea
and reprinted in best-selling gold-embossed leather-bound books
while their detractors, namely me,
are famous only for having been such unseeing, blinkered,
correct grammar-using fools.
As you can tell, I spend a lot of time on the internet.
Probably a little bit more than is healthy, but, um...
Yeah, Bob spelled backwards is still Bob.
Hey, every stang I got a new joke for ya.
It's just Bob is what it is.
It's just... It's literally Bob.

Hello, you're on the air.
F*** you.
No.
Oh, did he... Did he try and insult you?
Yeah, that was kind of funny.
Kind of cute.
You sat on the phone that long just to get hung up on.
That's what always... That's what never ceases to amaze me about...
about these little freaks out there.
See, that's... These are the people that I'm worried about.
The lame ducks of the universe.
Well, not the universe, but of this planet.
Those who, um...
walk around on one foreskin and believe that, uh...
they're gonna do something by throwing a monkey wrench in.
They're throwing it in the wrong places.
Why throw it at you?
Why throw it at the show?
I don't know. I'm sorry.
Maybe because I annoy them.
Because you know them personally?
Because I annoy them.
Which is part of the goal of this program.
I am in this to annoy listeners.
I don't have to worry about ratings.
I've gotten to do this for, uh...
you know, long enough that...
you know, that...
if... if I got kicked off the air tomorrow,
and I'd probably have to mess something up pretty bad
in order for that to happen, but if it happened tomorrow,
I think I've had a pretty good run.
And, uh... you know what?
That guy who called in to insult me
has probably not had such a good time over the last five years.
That's right. This is the ism and the asm of all of it,
is that you placed a hair shirt on his shoulders
that he can't get off.
And we're...
Well, he could just change the channel.
That seems to escape a lot of these people, but...
Yeah. He could change his M.O. too.
I think that's rather, um...
Huh?
I hang out with Bobheads these days sometimes.
Bobheads?
Bobheads have to go over to whatever it is, uh...
You mean like Bobbleheads?
No, the Bob's Donuts place.
Oh, wait.
They're going to a different place.
You know two of those Bobheads.
Yes, I do.
They go at all hours and run over at 2-3...
around this time, if you're at Bob's right now,
they crank out different kinds of...
They make a donut this big, just for fun.
Where's this?
In the city of, uh...
Bob's Donuts, man. Bob's Donuts.
And is it like a regular glazed donut that big?
Oh, it's...
It's just a giant donut this high, this big around.
It's the biggest donut you've ever shot.
And these two Bobheads were over there the other night,
and they said about 2-3,
they crank out like one kind of series, like the...
the different kinds.
Moonrocks?
Eight or... Moonrocks.
Yeah, they do Moonrocks.
They do all those and...
Like Michael Jackson?
Oh, Moonrocks.
Oh, baby.
Tons of fresh, greasy, sugary crap.
And all the sugar heads are in there.
Every time I go by, it's hilarious.
Bring it.
Yeah, exactly. It's like...
Bring it on.
Nature's perfect food.
...of sugar dough heads out the door.
Nature's perfect food.
And I guess they're 24...
Well, maybe they close out, but...
How much is the big donut?
I don't know, man.
I meant to ask, and then I was mesmerized by the chocolate.
More than that, who?
Ah, at the...
Who?
Who is the big donut?

It's just Bob.
It's what it is.
It's just...
It's literally Bob.
But we don't care,
because there will be some donut that we will find acceptable.
Some...
Yeah, that will pass under the door of the history of donuts.
I wish we had a donut now...
That's a Finland.
...so we could just, like, telescope what life is going to be like...
Donut forsake me, oh my goodness.
We could probably actually have law enforcement deliver,
because they could pick up now...
Why don't we have them bring one over?
...drive to their house, and then they could drive here.
I'm sure they would...
Why don't you guys...
It's a lot of driving they have to do.
...would you do that for us?
Come back over?
They're doing it anyway.
They're just driving around, you know.
They're just driving around.
There isn't even a lawn here.
They don't take care of us like that.
Why would they be into lawns, of course?
We're just protecting and serving.
This is the part where we're talking about we don't need any protection,
we need some service.
Yeah, exactly.
Service and quality.
And also, we're all on the same team here, you know.
We are all on the same team, you know.
They're protecting the streets, we're protecting the airwaves.
Yeah, and government...
The congressmen take our money to pay you guys.
And we make sure that you don't listen to anything else.
They take our personal property, and they give it to you.
Okay, I'm way in the back of your mind now.
They'll protect us.
Don't that tell a story.
And serve us.
Yep.
Uh-huh.
The Redded League by Conan Carthusel.
The Redded League.
I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
and found him obese, pompous, and slow, with fiery red hair.
With an apology for my intrusion, Holmes closed the door behind me.
Sherlock Holmes puffed out his chest with an appearance
of some little pride, and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper
from the inside pocket of his greatcoat, as was his habit when in high spirits.
The fish that you have above your right wrist is quite peculiar,
said Holmes, with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column.
I can deduce nothing else.
He was doing something in the cellar, something which took many hours a day
for months on end. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see.
I ejaculated twice.
I exclaimed,
Here it is.
Very good,
said Sherlock Holmes.
You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,
he said in unfeigned admiration.
Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his custom when in judicial moods.
But we also, uh, the church,
I did not actually expect this to happen back in 1980 when I first took on the job
as sacred scribe, but it turned into kind of a social club.
With cliques, you know, there's the inside circle and the outside,
and people get to stay in the big house, and people have to sleep in muddy tents
and brushwood dirt.
Which is actually a lot more fun than staying in the trailer, I can tell you that.
But people, I've been asked, now come on,
do people really get laid at X-Day?
Uh, X-Day is an event we have every July, just before Starwood,
where we await the prophesied flying saucers that are going to come
and give all the dues-paying subgeniuses everything they ever wanted
and kill everyone we ever didn't like.
We're not going to have to do it.
We're going to let the aliens do it.
We're not that kind of kooks.
But, um, but we really do get together every year.
We only do it once a year because, by definition, subgeniuses can't get along with each other for very long.
Because they're really weird.
They get on each other's nerves.
But they really do, there really have been matings at subgenius events.
Uh, marriages have resulted many, many times.
Babies, even.
Even one-night stands have happened.
Uh, and agonizing, horrible divorces and so forth.
I remember quite a few of those.
Um, people who have not been laid in ten years can possibly get laid at an ex-day subgenius event.
Even if they don't want to.
In fact, I'm now thinking of a case in which a person who did not really want to get laid was sort of getting...
And it was a guy!
You know, you see some strange things.
Uh...
And those aren't the videos I'll be showing.
Um...
Well, I'm actually, I didn't meet my wife at a subgenius event.
I met her at an ace event.
Starwood.
Sometimes subgeniuses marry pagans.
It's, uh, funny.
Then they have these weird little mutated children.
Um, I'll admit, the chances of a weirdo getting laid are better at Starwood than they are at ex-day.
Uh, just because there's more people.
If we have two gay cross-dressers at ex-day, there's twenty at Starwood!
Okay?
It's more like a small company, um, picnic.
You might say.
There are plenty of pretty girls and so forth, and half of them are married.
And there are more boys than girls.
But that's true of any gathering except sewing circles.
Uh, so there's no guarantee.
But miracles have happened every year, and the laidless get laid.
Don't let your spouse go to Starwood alone.
That is a really important message.
You do not, no matter how bored you are with all that pagan crap, do not let your new age spouse go alone.
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
Hey, just wait a minute.
You sit right down where you are.
Um, what do you think I am, some kind of an organ grinder's monkey?
You put on some music a lady can move to.

Involving the eye, the ear, the nose and throat.
In other words, just from wondering whether the wedding is on a rule,
A person can develop a cold.
You can feed her all day with the vitamin A and the bromophiz,
But the medicine never gets anywhere near where the trouble is.
If she's getting a kind of a name for herself and the name ain't his,
A person can develop a cold.
And faith and more, just installing, installing, installing the wedding trip,
A person can develop blood grip.
When they get on the train for Niagara,
And she can hear church bells chime,
The compartment is air conditioned,
And the mood sublime.
Then they get off at church,
And it's Saratoga for the fourteenth time.
A person can develop blood grip,
Blood grip,
Blood post nasal drip,
With the wheezes,
And the sneezes,
And a sinus that's really a pip,
From a lack of community property,
And a feeling she's getting too old.
A person can develop a burn,
A burning cold.
That one goes out to Mr. Sistar and Son.
That song, Adelaide's Lament,
is from the 1950 stage show of Guys and Dolls,
which is a great musical about sin and religion and fun,
from the olden days.
My mother used to play that album all the time when I was a little kid,
and I didn't understand that song at all.
But now, an important Lemurian public service announcement.
Whether you drive a shiny new 1952 model or a pre-war jalopy,
remember that death is the biggest killer on the highways.
This year, 500 lives can be saved,
and 15,000 killed,
and 500,000 injured.
It'll be curtains for you.
Now they will never know.
If you can't pick up the signal, check all the wire connections are correct,
and make good contact.
Make sure the copper wire on the coil and the end of the connection block are sanded well.
This copper wire is coated in plastic and needs to be sanded.
It will allow a contact to be made.
The diode may be the wrong way around.
Remove it and replace the other way.
Check the earth connection is to something metal which is already earth.
Check and move the aerial if necessary.
Extend the aerial with more wire.
The signal in your area may be very weak.
Remember, experiment with the aerial and have fun.
Open and enter another channel to see what happened in this channel.
Next part, it will be interesting.

What a magnificent vista.
The entire era, the age of radio.
Stretching all the way back.
The moment Heinrich HertzAf ready for a taste.
He had discovered the presence of radio waves.
and demonstrated it conclusively in 1886,
the year of that great scientific demonstration.
And when they referred to radio ever after,
they said, it really hurts,
named after Mr. Heinrich Hertz.
Then they invented the coherer in 1890.
Before true coherence was achieved,
nothing had been coherent,
but after the coherer,
all was congruent and coherent.
Then, in 1901, wireless telegraphy came in,
used by Guglielmo Marconi
to transmit a Morse message across the Atlantic.
Well, you know, repetitio est mater studiorum.
But you're right.
Why repeat?
If you weren't listening before,
that was your final make-up class.
There's not going to be any more help from the office.
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Howell.
We were indeed listening.
There was some radio history there from the show,
Puzzling Evidence Show,
from KPFA Berkeley,
kpfa.org,
which,
which,

Puzzling Evidence also has a YouTube channel now,
Puzzling Evidence TV,
and the show is archived,
and there are links to that
at Philo Drummond's amazing site,

And now, back to the subgenius devival live recording
from the Association for Consciousness Exploration's
festival called Winter Star.
It is Valentine's Day,
and I am,
and it is getting kind of late, actually.
I'm going to have to,
I want to show this movie with sound.
But first, you know,
now, let me explain.
I'm,
into hate.
I know that most people are, you know,
especially if you come to Winter Star,
you're kind of new agey and so forth.
Your love is good.
That's, that's as it should be.
But subgenius hate is a type of hate
that is so all encompassing,
because our dysfunctional relationship
with the rest of society,
I guess, or whatever, I don't know.
You know, it's what makes you a subgenius.
It's so gigantic,
that you've reached this stage that we call hate squared,
where it's like the only thing you have left to hate is hate itself.
Now that's a good spot to reach.
I have to admit that for a long time I was preaching slack,
but I wasn't getting slack.
I was an angry young man, and our hate was sincere,
but oddly enough, some of that bullshit turned out to be true.
I did get slack, and I have to fake my hate now.
So have sympathy.
But let's do a mass marriage.
What do you think?
Now listen, it's not what you're thinking.
You may be here alone or whatnot,
and we're not saying you have to marry someone of the opposite sex
or even of the desired sex or even another person.
You can marry, and I would really suggest this,
things.
I'm thinking ahead for later on tonight.
You can marry your car keys, your cell phone, your glasses.
You're going to be glad you did later, about 3 o'clock this morning.
And I'm not going to ask you all to stand up either,
because that's slackful.
But if you are next to somebody,
you do get to make out at the end of the ceremony.
Oh, yes, by the way,
I haven't done one of these mass marriages here in like 10 years.
And some of you,
you may go, oh, God, I've heard this thing a million times.
But it really has been that long since I've done the old subgenius mass marriage.
We also do real ones, and those are binding.
So be careful.
Yes, beloved friends, voyeurs, jealous associates, and any hidden cameras,
do you, insert name here, swear to tell the truth, all truth, and nothing but the truth, say yes!
Yes!
You know, we can name any time, any amount of time,
because these are short-duration marriages,
just as Bob is a short-duration savior.
I don't expect you to remain saved by Bob
for more than about five minutes after you leave here,
unless you buy one of our videos or books.
But these kind of marriages,
usually we make them last for about 24 hours,
which means you can get away with anything for the next 24 hours.
It's a nice place to get away with anything.
So it'll be 24 hours.
Dearly beloveds, we're gathered here today in the presence,
in the presence of J.R. Bob Dobbs, whatever form he may choose to take,
and, insert other deity names here,
probably about as many of those as there are people in this room,
to join this man, insert name here, and this woman, insert name here,
or this whatever and this whatever,
in a temporary but no less virtuous bondage of holy matrimony,
for better or for worse, but praise Bob, not for long.
Do you feel the spirit?
Everybody say praise Bob!
I love hearing that.
And now this is the time you can start putting your hands on each other,
if you feel so inclined.
Now this is a bond of holy wedlock,
so no matter what physical position these beloveds may take in the next 24 hours,
their moral standing shall remain upright.
If there are any jealous losers here who feel that these creatures should not be joined temporarily,
not even for a mere 24 hours,
just hold your peace,
because we don't want to hear about it.
Before we...
Oh, uh, has the preacher been paid?
We'll worry about that later.
Do you, insert name here, take this thing, insert name here,
to be your lawfully wedded whatever,
in short duration subgenius matrimony,
to have and to hold,
in fact to do just damn near about anything you can think of with,
that that he or she or it agrees to do,
that's the important part,
for richer or poorer,
in sickness and in kinkiness,
uh, through any hardship or disaster that may befall that thing in the next 24 hours,
for whatever sick and twisted,
but no less blessed reasons for the next 24 hours,
say, I do!
I do!
Now shake on it,
and say, it's a deal.
It's a deal!
Every year there's all these people who do like that.
I meant shake hands.
Shake hands.
Okay, um, if you don't have a ring,
we all have the famous temple of Devo.
This is your, your temple of Devo,
and, uh, it's, um,
we take that ring as a symbol of the holy estate of marriage,
and of the shackles,
the veritable handcuffs of wedlock,
as well as the pole going deep into the hole repeatedly,
and, um,
uh, by the authority invested in me by J.R. Bob Dobson,
in defiance of the law,
laws of the state,
and of nature,
I now pronounce all of you
man, wife, and thing, or whatever,
for the next 24 hours,
you must now
kiss and grope and make out with each other.
You are now duly authorized
and excused for sexual couplings,
sexual couplings, I repeat,
of any perverse, unspeakable kind,
for a period of 24 hours starting right now.
Uh, 10 till 5.
And, uh, friends,
if you don't,
you're making a mockery of the holy institution of marriage.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, it is done,
amen, and sir, and a women, and a bunch of yetis praise Bob.
And hail Connie!
Her way is spreading.
That's a new slogan.
Hail Connie, her way is spreading.
So, uh, we're not sexist.
We appreciate all the abominatrixes
and ovary men and uberfems
and nun snakes.
Oh, as Connie said,
I'll show you everything except mercy.
She also, Connie also said,
pull yourself up by your own bra straps!
Ah, howdy, how's it going?
How's it going?
The loungers.
The lounger.
Nowhere in the pages of history can one find the lounger.
Answer!
Is this man who is called the lounger the only one?
No.
Yes, the lounger, who is in Crippled Creek.
You mean...
I mean Crippled Creek, in a final attempt to get the lounger.
In this attempt, Anna, I shall fail.
In the meantime, the lounger had been captured in attempts to steal his guns.
I can understand a man who is low enough to turn against a Texan.
What about it?
Because, as I said, I want to get on top.

Oh, I'm gonna try a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?
No, I get by with a little help from my friends.
Get high with a little help from my friends.
Oh, I'm gonna try a little help from my friends.
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love.
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain.
That it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends.
Get high with a little help from my friends.
Oh, I'm gonna try a little help from my friends.
Do you need anybody?
I just need somebody.
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love.

I don't trust that masked man.
I don't either, darling.
Where are you going?
Let's go.
Did you find the wagon?
Come in.
Now, perhaps you'll trust me.
Secretly.
Yes.
Don't tell anyone.
No offense intended, mister, but I haven't known you long enough.
Well, have it your own way.
Adios.
But, John.
John.
Then, we must share things.
The good along with the bad.
Give me a cigarette.
Yeah, you dumb hasty.
Give me a cigarette.
But I don't understand.
Don't try to understand anything.
Just give me a cigarette.
The masked man.
I wouldn't count on that.
John, take care of her.
Oh, John.
Nice going, John.
Now, tie them up.
Well, Tyler's right, Chose.
That's the important thing.
Well, you outsmarted yourself, Leela.
It was easy to make a fool out of him.

You've actually been across to England fairly recently, haven't you?
Yeah, yeah.
I was thinking about it the other day.
I've probably spent more time in London than I have in New York City.
Oh, yeah.
Just, we've had a few little tours.
I've been to London.





London's got, some polite gigantic Vadostown there.
D'you know the Valdem flaw?
Ah...
Mammy Bl Lie.
Mammy Bl Lie?

They had those bigишь old sam crashers like you know the O'Galls.
I mean you, I think you, I'm thinking they have them produced by Okay Cass.
It doesn't, it doesn't work.
I think the C eyewitness would say, yeah.
some things. And they ran for office, didn't
they?
They ran a political party of some sort. That's right,
yeah, they even got Bob Dobbs
elected, the Free Party
they called it. Yeah, I remember seeing that.
If you Google Bob Dobbs
and Free Party, the whole story of the
Brighton Clench
is on there. They pulled off some
amazing stunts.
And they promised me that
they were writing a book about it, but I'm
you know, they're
into slack like the rest of us.
Yeah. I'm not holding my breath for
that. I had a
great time. I'd never seen anything like
that place. Their laboratory
was more bobbed up than
mine is.
They give out stickers. I'm
about to move to Brighton. My girlfriend lives there.
There's still always Bob stickers all
over Brighton. Yeah, I started
hearing about these huge raves
there and I was going, wait a minute, aren't we supposed to
get a piece of that?
But I just wish
I could have been there to some of those.
Oh, the Foundry. That's the name
of the club in London that we've
done two or three shows at.
Yeah. I think that's where
Jonathan runs the Foundry.
I think that's where most of the London Revivals are, aren't they?
Yeah. Most of them have been
there.
Yes, friends, the Foundry. That was
