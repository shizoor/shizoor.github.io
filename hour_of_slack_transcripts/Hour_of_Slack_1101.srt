1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,200
The hour has come, Karis.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,320
The moment for which you have waited so long.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,500
Ragab has seen your bride, Princess Ananka, taken away.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,720
Now, you shall go to take her.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,660
You know your destination.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,120
Drink.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,400
Drink from the brew of the nine Tana leaves.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,820
And any who would stand in your way,

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,020
kill.

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,820
Kill!

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,700
And now, menacing all mankind and every creature on Earth,

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,280
comes the...

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,060
...Soul Genius, Power of Swarm!

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,440
No one would have believed in the middle of the 20th century

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,780
that Uranus is surrounded by an unbreathable atmosphere

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,180
eloquent of fertility.

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,340
The power of the Sun.

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,900
What you got in here, fella? Tickin' like a bomb?

19
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,580
Goin' crazy.

20
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,800
Everything all right?

21
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,940
Twelve o'clock and all is well.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,500
It's just a matter of time before the sun sets.

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,080
The stars look far away.

24
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,860
They are far away.

25
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,560
But the one we want, it's not so far.

26
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,380
See it there?

27
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,620
It's the shiny one.

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,620
The bright one over on the right.

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,000
It's hard to believe there are people there.

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,580
People like us.

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,600
People like us.

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:56,800
People like us.

33
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,040
It's the third planet from the Sun.

34
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,740
It's called...

35
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,540
...Earth.

36
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,560
And we could talk about sex, friends.

37
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,160
Some people seem to be interested in that for some reason.

38
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,140
I actually have to wonder...

39
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,480
We were gonna do a workshop, a sex workshop, called Bragging.

40
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,380
Is it really more important than the sex?

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,960
I've sure heard a lot more bragging than I've heard sex around here.

42
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,240
As Bob said, just because it happened to you, that doesn't make it interesting.

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,220
And, however, let me brag.

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:51,300
I've noticed that whereas some people can hurt other people's feelings by bragging about who they have done,

45
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,180
there are others who...

46
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:01,120
The only way they can hurt people's feelings is to brag about who they declined to do.

47
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,200
So, I'm not going to get myself into trouble anywhere that way.

48
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,080
But, yeah, they go, what?

49
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,400
Sex in the Church of the Subgenius?

50
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,120
How can this be?

51
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,060
I thought it was all a bunch of nerdy boys.

52
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,420
And it was!

53
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,380
It was!

54
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:22,020
For the entire duration of the 1980s, the Church of the Subgenius did indeed look like a GWAR concert.

55
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,160
And then...

56
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,180
That has changed.

57
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,400
Oh, you were the one girl at the GWAR concert, weren't you?

58
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,660
A focus of many energies.

59
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,720
Friends, we discovered that it's true.

60
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,440
In more ways than one.

61
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,800
If you build it, they will come.

62
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,780
And we lied.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,840
We said that the Church of the Subgenius was not just a UFO crazy Bob cult, but it was a sex cult.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,240
And after about ten years, it came true!

65
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,340
Praise Bob and hail Connie!

66
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,060
Praise Bob!

67
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:59,800
Friends, we don't stand on the shoulders of giants like some cult leaders do.

68
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,120
We hump furiously at the backs of the necks of giants!

69
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,920
We are piggybacking on those giants and raping their neck back at the same time.

70
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,360
We maul to the beauty of the toward foe!

71
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,780
TOUT enfrentung der nichts!

72
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:47,960
He97

73
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:47,960


74
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,440
Mass imagen

75
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,460
Possividade

76
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:49,740
Pacie

77
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,600
I got an infection and it spread to my dick

78
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,860
It swelled up to the size of a human head

79
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,700
And then a mouth opened on it and this is what it said

80
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,340
Kill the pink boys, quit your job

81
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,960
Mock the world and praise Bob Dobbs

82
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,260
We'll build a ship and take a trip

83
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,460
Go on, go get a pen, write the coordinates

84
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,320
Three and a half months in my garage

85
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,040
Tearing parts off of old used cars

86
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,560
My groin at this point was unusually large

87
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,220
And went occasionally home while smoking cigars

88
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,720
The project was finished, the ship would hold twenty

89
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,280
The power source was anything the crew would think was funny

90
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,320
We didn't need the slackless, they're hapless

91
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,900
Our mouth proved its worth in escaping the stark fist

92
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,120
On our way to Planet X for sex that wrecks necks

93
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,680
A prairie squid and every pot of money shot a coney twang

94
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,580
It's an all-hoss hour of bonanza

95
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,140
It's like a world without Tony Danza

96
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,420
Or Fanzo, the pink shit that hits the charts

97
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,960
In a world of dead art, simultaneous lobotomy and sodomy

98
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,060
We take a moment and we pause to reflect

99
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,200
On the pinks that we killed and the plants that we killed

100
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,440
Planet that they wrecked, and we laugh like banshees

101
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,480
And howl like Comanches, do a victory dance

102
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,940
In our underoos and panties, our fantasy is a reality

103
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,340
Earth's tarnished in dust, is Planet X a bust for us?

104
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,700
Bob's pipe is lit, space and time shift

105
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,600
A temporal disturbance that causes a slack rift

106
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,680
A withdraw then a hit, a dimensional split

107
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,460
Severs forever, subgeni from pink shit

108
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,960
Bob walked in a circle and steadily exhaled

109
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,400
In the smoke, I can see why the pink boys failed

110
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,880
To pay a naze has caused destruction

111
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,980
Sick and whole

112
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,540
Of slackless suction

113
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,060
Paper view alien abduction

114
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,620
Functioning on soulless slack

115
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,940
The money should be painted black

116
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,540
The mate from space that stole your balls

117
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,000
Will soon come back and take it all

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,660
Return to slack, return to Bob

119
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,280
Repent slack off and quit your job

120
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,100
Or slurp the beastly knob

121
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,880
Connery!

122
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,480
Lick the throbbing vein of slavery

123
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,060
Now you're sleeping like a baby

124
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,620
But Bob woke me up and said

125
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,420
Get out of Dodge

126
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,700
There's a guy who's dick and top

127
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,040
With a UFO in his garage

128
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,580
I ate some bad ham and I got really sick

129
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,980
And in a puddle of my puke

130
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,180
Where the puke was most thick

131
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,620
A mouse did appear and it beckoned me near

132
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,180
And it whispered the following words into my ear

133
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,960
It said, kill the pink boys, quit your job

134
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,480
Mock the world and praise Bob Dobbs

135
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,780
You'll build a ship and take a trip

136
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,020
Go on, go get a pen, write the coordinates

137
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,920
Six and a half months, hold up alone

138
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,420
Circuit boards, duct tape and turkey bones

139
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,400
The ship appeared more than designed to be a ship

140
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:17,980
It was disaster prone

141
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,700
But the vomit assured me that far weirder ships had flown

142
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,300
The project was finished, the ship would hold twenty

143
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,840
The power source was anything the crew would think was funny

144
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
We didn't need the slack list or hapless

145
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,440
Our mirth proved its worth in escaping this dark fist

146
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,660
On our way to Planet X for sex that wrecks necks

147
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,180
A prairie squid and every pot of money shot a coney twang

148
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,140
It's an all-hoss hour of bonanza

149
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,720
It's like a world without Tony Danza

150
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,960
All fans of the pink shit that hits the charts

151
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,460
In a world of dead art, simultaneous lobotomy and sodomy

152
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,380
We take a moment to remember the world without Tony Danza

153
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:47,380


154
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:47,380


155
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:47,380


156
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,620
We tool up any moment and we pause to reflect

157
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,360
On the pinks that we killed and the planet that they wrecked

158
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,920
Then we laugh like banshees and howl like Comanches

159
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,680
Do a victory dance in our underoos and panties

160
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,380
Our fantasy is a reality

161
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,100
Earth turns to dust

162
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,580
It's Planet X or Bustros

163
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:16,540
Oh, yes dear friends, such a religious, religious song

164
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,480
by the El Queso All-Stars,

165
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,500
our brothers in slack

166
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,260
from out there in the desert lands.

167
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,700
Uh, yes.

168
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,340
The El Queso All-Stars.

169
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:38,760
And friends, we are in an X-Day spirit here,

170
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,960
waiting for that day,

171
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,780
that day that Bob foretold

172
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,940
when the dues-paying subgeniuses will be saved

173
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,900
by the X-ists,

174
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,460
the alien sex goddesses

175
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,340
who will lift us up

176
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,580
onto their saucers of escape

177
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,240
in that great event that we call the Rupture,

178
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,860
when Bob will give us the slack we paid for

179
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,700
and make us overmen and uberfemmes

180
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,980
and give us our own escape planets of our own design.

181
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,100
We can be whatever we want

182
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,920
and we can do whatever we want.

183
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,120
We can do whatever we want

184
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,360
to those pinky-winkies down below on Earth.

185
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,640
You know, the disbelievers,

186
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,960
those who did not love Bob enough.

187
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,920
Anyway, friends, thanks to

188
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,860
Fernanda Nande-Lemur for the title sequence,

189
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,340
Mr. Sister for the clips after that,

190
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,780
and Ace of Cleveland,

191
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,320
and Starwood2006 for the ranting platform.

192
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,360
We have more of that.

193
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,540
And thanks to Brushwood for allowing Starwood and X-Day,

194
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,180
Drills, to happen there.

195
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,000
We've got an X-Day Drill coming up there in New York

196
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,800
at Brushwood this July 5th.

197
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,620
This'll be our 10th X-Day.

198
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,880
Friends, this background music by the,

199
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,360
the Kirkendall Void is great,

200
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,040
but it has some genius-y,

201
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,960
it's actually, it's my CD player, it's not them.

202
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,620
Anyway, as I was saying, friends,

203
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,540
yes, we've got X-Day Drill coming up.

204
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,460
It'll be our 10th X-Day Drill.

205
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,180
Last year we had X-Day Drill number nine,

206
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,580
where we recorded the great Dr. Howell

207
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,220
premiering a new song,

208
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,680
an X-Day song that he composed on the way there.

209
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,800
Well, I've got the one I did,

210
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,720
so I could do that one.

211
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,140
Oh, your song?

212
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:40,720
Yeah.

213
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,240
Whip it out.

214
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,400
All right.

215
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,540
I'm going to...

216
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,220
Not that, the song!

217
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,060
Too late.

218
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,080
The X-Day song that I wrote in the airport.

219
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,020
I had to circle around and around forever,

220
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,340
thinking I would actually never get here.

221
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,020
X-Day is here,

222
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,540
the mountains fall,

223
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,600
I cringe and hide my head.

224
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,820
I never send in,

225
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,180
my 30 bucks,

226
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,800
my soul is filled with dread.

227
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,020
Oh, Bob just let me live,

228
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,380
And all that is mine,

229
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,760
I most surely will give.

230
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,840
Oh, lift me away

231
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,060
on your bright saucer ship.

232
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,500
To my sub-genius home,

233
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,580
Oh, bear me away

234
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,760
on your bright shining ship.

235
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,800
to my sub-genius home, Oh, bear me away on your bright shining ship.

236
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:43,800


237
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,200
my subgenius home.

238
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,480
I laughed at Bob,

239
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,580
ah woe is me,

240
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,040
I thirst for slack in vain.

241
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,740
Now he still grins

242
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,080
and smokes his pipe,

243
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,260
I must have been insane.

244
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,680
Oh Bob, just let me live,

245
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,060
and all that is mine

246
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,440
I most surely will give.

247
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,460
Oh lift me away

248
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,660
on your bright saucer ship

249
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,080
to my subgenius home.

250
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,260
Oh bear me away

251
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,500
on your bright shining ship

252
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,900
to my subgenius home.

253
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,500
I saw the pinks and normals flee,

254
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,040
the dreadful harvest from the sky.

255
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,580
They perished like the melting snow,

256
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,080
yet not a one knows why.

257
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,980
Oh Bob, just let me live,

258
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,180
and all that is mine

259
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,540
I most surely will give.

260
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,620
Oh lift me away

261
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,860
on your bright saucer ship

262
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,240
to my subgenius home.

263
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,280
Oh bear me away

264
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,920
on your bright shining ship

265
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:10,920


266
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,020
on your bright shining ship.

267
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,800
to my subgenius home.

268
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,960
The towers of the proud did fall,

269
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,500
there was no shelter from that storm.

270
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,640
While far above,

271
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,060
subgeniuses watched

272
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,480
in comfort safe and warm.

273
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,400
It was a dream,

274
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,480
but then I woke,

275
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,780
the rupture still can be mine,

276
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,720
and I was in the dark.

277
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,140
I wrote out a check to Ivan Stang,

278
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,640
now Bob's grin seems benign.

279
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,980
Oh Bob, just let me live,

280
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,140
and all that is mine

281
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,500
I most surely will give.

282
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,420
Oh lift me away

283
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,620
on your bright saucer ship

284
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,980
to my subgenius home.

285
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,900
Oh bear me away

286
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,020
on your bright shining ship

287
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:17,140
to my subgenius home.

288
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,280
Oh that's so beautiful.

289
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,300
There, there.

290
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,120
It's all right.

291
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,040
My grandpa used to sing that to me

292
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,780
back long years before you even wrote that song.

293
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,680
Yes I know.

294
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,320
Well you see,

295
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,500
in the bosom of the people,

296
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,520
the simple-minded faith in Bob persists.

297
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,340
The gap-toothed credulity,

298
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,520
which supports Bob and all his works,

299
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,740
it comes from the horny-handed sons of the soil,

300
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,400
the salt of the earth,

301
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,340
the pepper who've been mustered

302
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,500
in the ranks and legions on the great day.

303
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,480
Hallelujah gobble.

304
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,800
You sure got a pretty mouth, Dr. Howell.

305
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,060
I'm not sure I like to hear that kind of language

306
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,400
in this here rural setting.

307
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,780
But we have much to explain

308
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,340
and explicate of the many wonderful

309
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,020
and notable works and wonders of Bob.

310
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,640
I think you did your job.

311
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,840
Rob McClendon's

312
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:08,840


313
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,080
So while since I stayed, I guess I should believe

314
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,420
Maybe next year will be better than the last

315
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,620
I still remember the last thing that Bob said

316
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,160
As he was leaving, how the drills go by so fast

317
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:40,080
And it's one more day up in the saucer

318
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,140
And it's one more night in Rushwood

319
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,220
If a Friday Jones could be my pilot

320
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,160
I wish she would

321
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:03,180
Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na

322
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,140
Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na

323
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,680
Na na na na, yeah

324
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,220
The smell of the boys and of normals

325
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,000
And the feeling that they all can't help

326
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,800
But sit in my face

327
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,800
With my third eye I look across the mill

328
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,700
The way to see he exists

329
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,100
On their way to burn this place

330
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,200
And it's one more day up in the saucer

331
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:46,200
And it's one more night in Rushwood

332
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,540
If saucer dreams alone could bring me Susie

333
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,180
Maybe I could

334
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,800
Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na

335
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,760
Na na na na, na na na na, yeah

336
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:16,020
Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na

337
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,060
Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na

338
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,180
Na na na na, yeah

339
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:29,320
I cruised the Slattern Mansion some time after 2am

340
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,780
And talked a little while about the way I was feeling

341
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,700
About the church

342
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:42,340
But the conspiracy makes you move a little slower

343
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:48,880
Makes you talk a little lower about the day that we take over

344
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:55,460
It's been a while since next day and I guess I will believe

345
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,720
Maybe next year will be better than the last

346
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:09,740
I can't remember all the times I played the hour of slack

347
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,460
And wish my wish would make it come to pass

348
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,700
So it's 6.59 on board the saucer

349
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,700
But it's 7.01 in Rushwood

350
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,040
I have never made it to an X day

351
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,540
I guess I should

352
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,680
Na na na na

353
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,000
Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na

354
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,220
Na na na na, yeah

355
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,860
Na na na, na na ,na na na, na na na

356
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,120
Na na na, na na na, na na na, la na na

357
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,540
Na na na, na na, la na na, la la, la la, lá la, la la, la la, la la, la la, la la, la la.

358
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,760
Na na na, na na, na na, la na na, na na na, la la, la la, la la.

359
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,760
Yeah.

360
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,000
Yeah.

361
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,020
And please don't forget to wear all the special equipment we've given you

362
00:20:54,020 --> 00:21:00,180
and quote as many of the silly science fiction phrases like proton pack, nuclear device,

363
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:06,380
a weekend whacker, and all of the other things that we've been telling you as you board the ships.

364
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,620
If it makes you feel better.

365
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:14,740
Also remember, after boarding the ships, there's a brief moment of unconsciousness called the swoon,

366
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,620
followed by some indigenous music played by aborigines.

367
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,160
On a didgeridoo.

368
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:27,080
And there's the smell of acrid fires burning as the Temple of Truth goes up all poo-poo.

369
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,920
A friendly reminder again.

370
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,160
See?

371
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:36,080
Sack after sack of delicious coffee beans will be ground for your delectation and enjoyment.

372
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,780
And for some of you, your bodies will be ground and made part of that sample sumptuous ritual.

373
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,300
Yes, there will be that communication of communion.

374
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,780
We call it the mingling.

375
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,080
Oh, by the way, speaking of which, Scotty is in space finally.

376
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,600
Yeah, isn't that great?

377
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,700
For those of you who haven't heard...

378
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,160
That is fantastic. I thought that was great.

379
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,900
James Doolin.

380
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,140
Thank you.

381
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,120
He was the actor who played...

382
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,940
They also found a new planet.

383
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,400
Yes, well, they don't really know what this planet's like yet.

384
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,840
They say they think it might be rocky or it might have water.

385
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,540
Or the water might have burned off.

386
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,120
They haven't even looked at it directly.

387
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,500
Oh, yeah.

388
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,840
The new planet, that's like we would all weigh five times as much as we do now.

389
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,300
Right.

390
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:18,740
Exactly.

391
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,200
So breathing would be quite a bit of work.

392
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,300
Live on that planet.

393
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,740
Oh, those would be some big people.

394
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,120
Well, they could come in all sizes.

395
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,000
They'll just be...

396
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,840
They could be a little squat.

397
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,520
We don't even know if they would be people or not.

398
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,320
You know, the funny thing about life is that, you know, life on Earth has certain conventions.

399
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,360
You know, you expect to see certain types of organs on terrestrial life.

400
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:48,400
But that's only because these conventions came about earlier on in the evolution of life.

401
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,920
They were very practical ones because they were the ones that worked over such a very long period of time.

402
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,860
But there are millions...

403
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,800
So you can expect them to show up on a world that's like this world.

404
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,280
Right.

405
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,460
Right.

406
00:22:59,480 --> 00:22:59,980
Well, there are...

407
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,520
The sun is a slightly different...

408
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,140
So that alone would make it different.

409
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,760
What I'm saying is there are millions and millions of other combinations of parts and functions

410
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,600
that could contribute to the viability of a species.

411
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:18,360
And any one of those could have evolved instead of the ones that evolved in terrestrial life.

412
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,060
So in that case, you might...

413
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,400
And it's because of that so cool that now we have to actually start thinking about stuff like that.

414
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,920
It's life, Jim, but not as we know it.

415
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,840
Isn't that the planet...

416
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,340
Isn't that the...

417
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,100
The solar system or planet that we said is like 2 trillion miles away?

418
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:32,520
Yeah.

419
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,740
It's actually relatively close.

420
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,140
It's like 20.5 light years away.

421
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,680
20 light years.

422
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,360
If we achieve light speed...

423
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:37,840
Sure, man.

424
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,440
Oh, yeah.

425
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,460
At a half light speed, it would only take 40 years to get there.

426
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,800
It actually would take us closer to like 20,000 years to get there at our...

427
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,660
Well, at our current speeds now, but I...

428
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,740
I said at half light speed.

429
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,100
They know of...

430
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:57,680
There are already ideas for, you know, for almost light speed travel that...

431
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,100
That they're working on now.

432
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:00,640
Would be fantastic.

433
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,420
This...

434
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,780
You know, there's...

435
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,780
And everybody get together and work on this problem because that could very...

436
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:15,300
You know, this discovery alone could change the way that humans think about the universe.

437
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,240
Oh, we're not using...

438
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,400
There's two-thirds of this planet that we're...

439
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,140
We haven't even begun to put apartment buildings on.

440
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,080
To despoil, yeah.

441
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,180
It would be a lot easier to deal with than some other places.

442
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,520
We...

443
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:27,660
We...

444
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:27,660


445
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,060
In a Walmart.

446
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,000
You know, and also, there's...

447
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,920
Nobody's been able to make a biosphere yet that works.

448
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,040
There's no...

449
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:44,140
Every attempt to make a self-sustaining environment that several people could live in that didn't require refreshment from outside hasn't been...

450
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,780
You know, nobody's been able to do that.

451
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,660
Another funny...

452
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:52,440
There was that biosphere experiment in the desert that went on for several years, and they just...

453
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,780
It was a miserable failure.

454
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,720
Because of bacteria.

455
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,860
I mean, they learned a lot, but...

456
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,660
Because of bacteria.

457
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,400
They learned how difficult.

458
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,820
That's what happens when you let potheads in there and let them have parties.

459
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,900
That's not what happened, you fool.

460
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,940
Anyway, the...

461
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,360
Another funny thing about, you know, possible extraterrestrial life is it...

462
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,480
It wouldn't even necessarily...

463
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,720
Not only does it not necessarily have to have the same kinds of parts and functions that terrestrial life has,

464
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,140
there's also the possibility it's not even necessarily made of proteins as we know them.

465
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,840
There are other possibilities for self-replicating molecules other than the ones we have.

466
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,660
It could be gas.

467
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:27,860
It could be ashes.

468
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,220
It could be liquid.

469
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,780
Well, the...

470
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,040
They could be cloudlets.

471
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:33,540
Or foglets.

472
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:38,660
What I don't like about the hydrogen-based life forms is they're rude, and they smell awful.

473
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,540
I mean, I'm still talking carbon-based.

474
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,140
You know, they won't let you smoke around them.

475
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,900
They're just awful.

476
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,480
They're...

477
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,800
Well, and they're all on...

478
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,400
They're all on DHMO.

479
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,660
Oh.

480
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,140
They're tripping on DHMO.

481
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,520
That's the worst, man.

482
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:54,980
Yeah.

483
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,660
You know, they hang out with...

484
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,320
They're not a bad crowd.

485
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,640
They hang out with that racing crowd.

486
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,620
Oh, a bunch of gas bags.

487
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:03,540
Yeah.

488
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,300
They call us water bags.

489
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,760
Ugly bags of water, they call us.

490
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,140
Ha-ha.

491
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,080
Yeah.

492
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,380
I tell you, boys, the Galactic Federation ain't what it's cracked at today.

493
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,100
Okay.

494
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,460
You know what I think...

495
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,080
You can take it from me.

496
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,080
You can take it from me.

497
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,060
I'm from another time.

498
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:27,560
I don't know whether it's the future or the past, but it's really not that different.

499
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,780
It's different from the way things are right here on Earth.

500
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,060
Just that it's smellier.

501
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,160
Right now, I will give you all my money.

502
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,140
All for me.

503
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,160
Bob's of X-Day, friends.

504
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,460
Recorded at X-Day 9 by Reverend Rosna, who came there all the way from Germany.

505
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,000
But now I think he's in Scotchman land.

506
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,280
That was just part one.

507
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,100
Part two is too dirty.

508
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,560
That was all the subgeniuses saying, Bob.

509
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Like froggies, like little froggies.

510
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:22,200
And before that, we heard some radio synesthesia from WCSB Cleveland with Dr. Sinister and his guests.

511
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:27,560
And this that you're listening to is the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

512
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,940
I can't get no.

513
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,420
That is sanctioned.

514
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,580
I can't get no.

515
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,160
That is sanctioned.

516
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,940
Because I try.

517
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,960
And I try.

518
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,740
And I try.

519
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,340
And I try.

520
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,640
I can't get no.

521
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,020
I can't get no.

522
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,760
When I'm driving in my car.

523
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,660
And that man comes on the radio.

524
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:26,020
He's telling me more and more about the useless information supposed to fire my imagination.

525
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,640
The subgenius.

526
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,020
The power of Slack.

527
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,040
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

528
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,800
That's what I say.

529
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,160
Space.

530
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:50,980
Yes.

531
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,180
Now, let me see.

532
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,840
I heard something.

533
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,520
What was that?

534
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,480
I don't know.

535
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,360
What is it?

536
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,480
It's just a Joshua tree.

537
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,220
From outer space.

538
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,680
No, no, that's not what I mean.

539
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,020
Well, what do you mean?

540
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:13,920
I'm not sure.

541
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,540
What?

542
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,300
I don't know.

543
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,020
Something.

544
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Oh, brother.

545
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,220
That figures.

546
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,740
Hey, what's going on?

547
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,620
I don't know.

548
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,280
Let's get out of here.

549
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,540
Ah!

550
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,400
Oh, the slime comes.

551
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,060
It comes.

552
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,840
In the doctrinally correct Church of the Subgenius,

553
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,340
we don't have many rules or many goals.

554
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,580
There's only one rule, and that is, pardon my language,

555
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,060
but fuck them if they can't take a joke.

556
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,860
Believe it or not, that is a philosophy you can live by,

557
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,140
and I'm dead serious.

558
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,740
You really can.

559
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,240
In fact, you have to.

560
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,080
Otherwise, you end up letting them tell you how to live your life, you know.

561
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,860
There's only one rule.

562
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:04,980


563
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:04,980


564
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,760
There's only one real purpose and meaning to life,

565
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,380
besides getting slack for yourself and 30 bucks for Bob.

566
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,460
And that's the ooze squirt, friends.

567
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,140
That time that comes at the end of the sex,

568
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,820
the meaning of life is not to procreate.

569
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,620
It's just the fun part of it.

570
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,340
That's all.

571
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,580
In other words, gluttony is okay.

572
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,200
Sex, just for fun, is not only okay.

573
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:34,960
It's okay.

574
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:34,980
It's okay.

575
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:34,980


576
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:34,980


577
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:34,980


578
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,860
You have to do it.

579
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,940
As I said, even if it involves somebody else.

580
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,820
Two huge interlocking circles, markings on the desert soil

581
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,260
that cannot be seen from the ground, but can be seen from the heavens.

582
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,460
I think they're not designed to be seen by human beings, but by alien beings.

583
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,160
Michael Pattinson says he was a member of the Church of Scientology for 23 years.

584
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,380
Now he's a disgruntled ex-member who says the circles are signposts

585
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,300
for reincarnated Scientologists who come from outer space.

586
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,140
There are markings to show the location of one of the vaults

587
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:18,780
which Scientology has prepared to safeguard the technology of L. Ron Hubbard.

588
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,680
See, I don't think that Nostradamus really has made all these predictions.

589
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,500
I think that there's actually been a cabal that, you know,

590
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,280
okay, Nostradamus was a fun guy.

591
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,260
Yeah, he could tell you, you know, what kind of underwear you were wearing at a party and stuff.

592
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,980
Only because he...

593
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,960
He, you know, snuck a peek.

594
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,520
Right.

595
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,240
Yeah, because he snuck a peek.

596
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,960
He was waiting in your dressing room.

597
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,300
But people understood that, you know, people falsely misunderstood that he could see into the future,

598
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,700
so they decided to start exploiting him.

599
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,160
No, I don't think so, because you ever heard a story what freaks me out

600
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,320
is when he went by that kid and he knew he was going to be the pope in the future?

601
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,580
Yeah, you know what that is?

602
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,700
That's a story.

603
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,320
I don't know about a story.

604
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,580
Yeah, I heard it was documented.

605
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,860
I heard he did a few things in front of a few people.

606
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,580
What kind of document?

607
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,820
It moved out.

608
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,700
Who was that dude who was famous?

609
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,800
Casey, what was his name?

610
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,420
Casey something?

611
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,440
Casey, I don't think Casey Jones, because he was driving his train.

612
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
But who was that dude?

613
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,180
Casey, somebody who would...

614
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:13,720
Edgar Cayce.

615
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,740
Edgar Cayce.

616
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,020
Who was it?

617
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,100
That's right, Edgar Cayce, the sleeping prophet.

618
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,000
Yeah.

619
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:19,660
Of Kentucky.

620
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,080
Think of a tape on him.

621
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,860
Have you ever heard of that one?

622
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,160
You're right.

623
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,600
You're in Edgar Cayce territory.

624
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:25,480
That's right.

625
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,660
I knew people who knew people who knew people that worked with Edgar Cayce.

626
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:34,280
Doctors that were real impressed by his trance diagnoses.

627
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:42,960
He would go into a self-hypnotic trance and be able to diagnose illnesses of people far away

628
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:50,860
and prescribe mysterious unwholesome ointments and packs that you put on them.

629
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,520
They wouldn't even know that they had cancer.

630
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,900
But yeah, Edgar Cayce, yeah.

631
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,600
He also spouted an entire alternate history of the Earth that included Atlantis.

632
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,620
And in fact, that was...

633
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:09,160
That was the material that George Powell made his movie Atlantis, The Lost Continent from,

634
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,280
which in turn, both of those inspired a whole lot of the New Age crystal head Atlantis stuff.

635
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:23,600
A lot of that comes from good old Edgar Cayce, a small town country studio photographer.

636
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,340
Edgar Cayce said that the world would end in 1998.

637
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:29,720
Yes, he did.

638
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,180
Yes, he certainly did.

639
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,520
And Nostradamus said that the world would end on...

640
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,820
July 5th, 1999.

641
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,120
And Bob said the world would end on July 5th, 1998.

642
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:49,120
So we know that that date has not come yet, and all of our calendars are severely out of whack.

643
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,260
They're saying at least 14 years.

644
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,600
Oh, at least, yeah.

645
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,000
Which is...

646
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,180
For all we know, it could be a thousand years.

647
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,520
I heard 19 years once.

648
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,560
Because in 2003, George W. Bush said, war is peace.

649
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,080
Right.

650
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,460
And that meant...

651
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:04,600
That meant...

652
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:04,600


653
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,320
That was 1984.

654
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,120
Yeah.

655
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:06,500
Right.

656
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,140
He said the goal of this war is peace.

657
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,840
That was the real 1984.

658
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,280
Yeah, 2003.

659
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,020
It was 2003.

660
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:31,940
Abby.

661
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,180
Abby.

662
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:33,960
Abby.

663
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:34,280


664
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,060
He-He-Heavy!

665
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:35,980
Heavy!

666
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,960
Heavy!

667
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:37,740
Heavy!

668
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,300
Heavy!

669
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,720
Heavy!

670
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,820
Heavy!

671
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,760
Heavy!

672
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,760
Heavy!

673
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,440
Heavy!

674
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,320
Heavy!

675
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,080
Heavy!

676
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,560
Heavy!

677
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,040
Heavy!

678
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,180
Heavy!

679
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,320


680
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:13,880
Heavy!

681
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,360
Pokokaka, go get out!

682
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,240
Wonder, wonder what you are!

683
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,100
Pick a girl, castle blue!

684
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,260
Don't you step off!

685
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:34,920
Melvin, shoot!

686
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,100
Nike said, just do it!

687
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,880
Do it, do it, get down to it!

688
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,500
Turn the top and rock steady!

689
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,440
Yabba dabba doo!

690
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,340
Rinse the way!

691
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,520
Tickle on, tickle out!

692
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,360
Stumble, tingle up!

693
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,140
Best to go boom, boom, then shake your rope!

694
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,020
Bow wow wow!

695
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,100
I want candy!

696
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,920
I shot the sheriff and shot Andy!

697
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,680
Fret not dreadlock, rolls on fire!

698
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,880
Pokokaka, kick the clock!

699
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,580
Born to rock!

700
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,440
Biddy, biddy, biddy, I was born to run!

701
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,200
Suck it to me, suck it to me, suck it to me, suck!

702
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,540
Poo-goo, god damn it!

Ho-chi-men!

00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,880

Pitcher, Prawn, Arnhub Dunk

00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,560
Ping-kong, Anathong

712
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,420
Babylon, Marathon

Tick it to her

721
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,620
Topper it over her

722
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:28,820
Stop her

723
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,260
She's a hippa

724
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:29,660
and a hobbub

725
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,160
and a bad boy

726
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,220
Like mama, tick tak toe!

727
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,460
Tongue and cheeky羅

728
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:32,640
Ee始

729
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,220
He's so geeky, he's so geeky, ready or not, hide and seeky, he won't find a street too freaky,

730
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,160
Bubba Bubba Babs is a Bubba Bubba Bubba, DJ Ozy and the microphone,

731
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,840
Rocked up to Bob, Bubba's got a rubber on his bitches and a cap on his supersized robot,

732
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,160
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that thing, Bob knows everyone's wish was to shake that thing,

733
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,820
Rubber baby, Bubba Bubba Gabby's in the fire, he's got a big cap on his rubber hammer,

734
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,760
On the top of a rubber hammer, mm-hmm good!

735
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,140
Keep Manhattan, gimme that, gimme that, keep Manhattan, gimme that, gimme that,

736
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:06,920
Give me that electric slide!

737
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:21,900
Yeah!

738
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,620
Give me that electric slide!

739
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,100
Yeah!

740
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
Yeah!

741
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:51,660
packaged up nosy music

742
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,540
We'll be right back.

743
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,960
We'll be right back.

744
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:03,980
We'll be right back.

745
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,520
We'll be right back.

746
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,780
Happy birthday, Mr. President.

747
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,480
Yeah.

748
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:23,940
Yeah.

749
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,880
My, yes, it was.

750
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:30,040
I don't know if I've explained the church of the subgenius,

751
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:34,060
but as I said, it would kind of be a mistake to do so.

752
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,720
I mean, anything I said would be limiting it.

753
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,820
Our whole point is most subgeniuses learn this sooner or later.

754
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,140
Even your own little homemade, made-up religion,

755
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,840
it's really just something that you felt comfortable with

756
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,740
that you could hang ideas on

757
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,640
and test them out and see how they work.

758
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,300
Bob is not going to tell you what slack is.

759
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,400
In fact, if you start trying to,

760
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,060
we get this every now and then.

761
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,580
Reverend Stang, I sent in my 30 bucks

762
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,120
and I got a great package of stuff

763
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,140
and a little card and everything,

764
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,980
but I didn't get no slack, man.

765
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,500
Give me my slack or give me,

766
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,740
but our slogan is eternal salvation

767
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,180
or triple your money back.

768
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,660
So they want their 90 bucks.

769
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,600
Sorry, Bob.

770
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,660
Eternal salvation.

771
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,420
It hasn't.

772
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,420
It hasn't come around yet.

773
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,820
You know, we don't know yet.

774
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,820
You have to die first, at least.

775
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,320
And then eternity has to come around

776
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,260
before you can prove you didn't get the salvation.

777
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,580
Bob is not the answer and neither is anything else.

778
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,560
That is Bob's point.

779
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,100
You know, you must learn to think for yourself.

780
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,040
Only Bob can show you how.

781
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,260
You really should buy the DVDs over there,

782
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,840
the Arise DVD, which is our classic,

783
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,580
which has been revised.

784
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,320
By the way, if you have the old version,

785
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,420
that's got it hasn't had anything removed,

786
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,960
yet it has twice as much in it.

787
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,660
How did we do it?

788
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,100
You'll have to buy it to see.

789
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,500
And it changes with each showing.

790
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,140
Same with our books.

791
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,660
When you have to, when you leave here,

792
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,260
you should have enough books of the subgenius

793
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,340
to put them in every hotel room

794
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,920
that you stay in on the way home.

795
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,320
That's a lot of books, friends.

796
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,780
And we will sign those and so forth.

797
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,420
I don't want you to do that until I get off.

798
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:20,640
Stay.

799
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:20,940
I'm going to go to the next page, though,

800
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,920
because I don't think anybody else knows the prices.

801
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,000
And poor Princess Wee can't speak.

802
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,800
I was making the old joke,

803
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,200
oh, my wife can't talk, the perfect wife.

804
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:35,320
She wrote down, no, the perfect wife is mute

805
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,600
and owns a bar.

806
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,680
An old, old joke.

807
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,660
Now, let's see, at this point,

808
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,900
I could marry everybody to each other

809
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,160
so that you could, you know, copulate friends-edly

810
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,560
without fear of being sinning.

811
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,720
But I don't think any of you really had that connection.

812
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,500
Did you?

813
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,360
Somehow I get the feeling this isn't the crowd

814
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,560
that's really worried about getting their sins forgiven.

815
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,620
And in fact, my friends,

816
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,620
J.R. Bob Dobbs is not going to forgive your sins

817
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,340
because he did not come to forgive your sins.

818
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,800
He doesn't care about your pathetic little sins.

819
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,480
No, not even that one.

820
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,440
Because Bob came here,

821
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,300
he's not well enough connected to forgive your sins.

822
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,980
He came here to justify your sins,

823
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,100
to rationalize your sins.

824
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,200
He does not bring forgiveness, friends.

825
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,220
He brings something far more important.

826
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,160
He brings an excuse.

827
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,940
And there actually is a wall-sized certificate of excuse

828
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,200
for every possible sin

829
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,880
that comes with the Subgenius membership pack,

830
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,300
suitable for framing.

831
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,840
Yes, dear friends,

832
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,940
we will frame you for Bob's sins.

833
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,440
But first, we go to KPFA in Berkeley

834
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,540
with puzzling evidence.

835
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,040
Dr. Hal Philodruman and this time,

836
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,800
callers, Reverend Modemak and Reverend Phineas Narco.

837
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,340
And I'll let that tape end the show

838
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,940
because it just gets weirder and weirder and weirder.

839
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,480
And I heard either just today or the other day

840
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,880
a no-late-breaking flash of information

841
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,980
about X-Day, mainly and chiefly,

842
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,460
that Roknar will not be attending.

843
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:22,980
Wow.

844
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,100
Oh, my God.

845
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:25,540
Oh, no.

846
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,040
Yes.

847
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,460
Why?

848
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,680
Does he have to work that weekend?

849
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,100
Every time he goes, his tent explodes

850
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,220
and he gets sucked, I mean...

851
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,220
They shave his head,

852
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,920
they put strange objects on top of his head.

853
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:40,620
He gets sucked in the rain and soaked by rain.

854
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,980
He's tired of seeing X-Day commercials by Microsoft.

855
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,660
You know, seeing X-Day mentioned in Microsoft commercials.

856
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,120
Yeah.

857
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,860
He's just tired of it all.

858
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,880
He's getting the anti-royalties

859
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,860
where they actually send you a debit check.

860
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,180
You have to pay money because you're on TV.

861
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,460
What happens is if you don't watch the commercial,

862
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,880
they debit you.

863
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,040
I can only say that he'll be missed

864
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,700
and I guess this means we're going to have to find somebody else

865
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,280
to wreak havoc on this year.

866
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,180
And that kid's got better watch my back.

867
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:11,860
Yes.

868
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,600
In fact, I think there's a target growing on your back

869
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,120
even as we speak.

870
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,280
Oh, here's a guy that might go to Doc's, Doc.

871
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,240
By the time we got to stop Doc,

872
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,640
we were half-living.

873
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:21,940
It's me.

874
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,660
It is you.

875
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,100
It's you.

876
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,960
What do you think about this new business?

877
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,520
What did you want to do with the book signing?

878
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,160
Did you have something you were going to do

879
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,300
when you showed up or...

880
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,860
Well, I was going to sing a song,

881
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,220
but I just, I didn't know.

882
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,560
I didn't, I got there late, so...

883
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,440
Sing a simple song.

884
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,100
Yeah, it was funny.

885
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:36,660
You got there right as the...

886
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,060
Sing a song of six pence?

887
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,880
You got there right as the energy was sort of...

888
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,420
A pocket full of rye.

889
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:40,960
...deflating.

890
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,160
Yeah, I...

891
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,060
So it wasn't, it would have been real hard to kind of go,

892
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,220
okay, everybody, I'm going to be Jane here.

893
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,180
Yeah.

894
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,920
But it was too bad,

895
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,380
because I was kind of hoping you'd do that

896
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,460
in the middle of this confused audience

897
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,520
walking around trying to get the book signed now,

898
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,600
and here's a guy singing a song.

899
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,540
That's a good song.

900
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,060
You would have been a better finish

901
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,280
than my dear friend who talked about her burning man book,

902
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,560
which really didn't...

903
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:03,720
Yeah.

904
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,400
Didn't really quite fit the deal.

905
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,080
Yeah, nobody could figure that part out.

906
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,240
Hey, well, how does this, what does this mean?

907
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,400
Oh, I don't know.

908
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,140
It's a...

909
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,540
Because a lot of people would think there was a serious overlap

910
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,500
in the two contingencies while...

911
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:16,660
And there is none.

912
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,920
Except that they're cults.

913
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:18,800
There is none.

914
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,540
There are both evil cults that enslave people's lives.

915
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,640
And as the years go by, there is even less.

916
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,680
...a plan to continue to go on.

917
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:25,800
Well, I could have said...

918
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,680
Because we've kept the conspiracy in our crosshairs

919
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,940
from the beginning, and as a result...

920
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,640
Well, of course there's an evil cult.

921
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:35,560
I'm sure you'd rather just wad up the conspiracy...

922
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:35,800
...this evil cult...

923
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,920
...and stuff it in the old crotch of a tree.

924
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:38,720
What?

925
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:39,840
But here in today's...

926
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,520
Put it in the fulcrum tree, you say?

927
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,140
...today's...

928
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,040
...future...

929
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,780
The Poochum tree.

930
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,920
...we have to realize these things are not done all in one flash.

931
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,520
An augenblick, as the Germans might put it.

932
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:55,840
We're still out in the park at St. Stupid's Day.

933
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,500
Did you hear about the chocolate Jesus?

934
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,220
Did you hear about the gathering?

935
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,360
The gathering of revolutionary forces?

936
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,720
They built this artist in New York.

937
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,100
He made a six-foot tall, anatomically correct chocolate Jesus

938
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,140
just in time for Christmas.

939
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,600
That's just sick.

940
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:14,900
That is just sick.

941
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:15,960
Why is it sick?

942
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:17,180
What's wrong with that?

943
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,660
Well, that's just sick.

944
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,820
I was talking about the expression of the little chocolate Jesus.

945
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,020
It looks like he's going to throw up.

946
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,300
That's just sick.

947
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,200
Well, they were upset about one...

948
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,360
A couple of things.

949
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,880
One was that it was made out of chocolate, and it was Jesus.

950
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,340
Why is that?

951
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:28,660
Why?

952
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,580
What is wrong with that?

953
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,960
Well, they simply suspect that...

954
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,200
Everybody knows Jesus didn't like chocolate.

955
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,860
...it would be in bad taste, although, of course, it would taste very good.

956
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:42,140
And secondly, what really cheesed them off was that this Jesus was not a good man.

957
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:42,140


958
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:42,140


959
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:42,140


960
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:42,140


961
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:42,140


962
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:48,740
It was nice, but it also had the wordlaughs in it, a kind of업

963
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,280
.

964
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:56,340
Jesus fell to mess with someone.

965
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:56,460
One has to accept that you may need to quit difficult matters, and,

966
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:56,460


967
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,660
Man lacking excitement ceases to want to do it, and he opens the...

968
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:00,660


969
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,540
In the Kombucha case?

970
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:08,960
In the Mobil spirits case, Jesus was the starter of people speaking bad language.

971
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,220
Uh-huh.

972
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,620
Disbelief.

973
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,860
Disbelief, yes.

974
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,120
Every era, the separation between God and the At forgot God hasn't been happy with

975
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:12,120


976
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:12,120


977
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:24,700
There were guys who were hired during the Renaissance to buy the clergy to paint their underwear and hands on the naked figures, including those in Michelangelo's The Last of Us.

978
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,920
Because Christians are pacifists, generally.

979
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,920
They won't defend themselves, so you can abuse their deity as much as you want,

980
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:40,180
whereas if you abuse the deity of the religion of peace, you would then be subject to immediate death dispatch.

981
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:45,620
Looks like Salman Rushdie did when he wrote his book, The Satanic Verses,

982
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:55,280
which I believe the Ayatollah still has a death fatwa against Salman Rushdie.

983
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:00,580
Or has that been... has the Ayatollah let him off the hook on that?

984
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:06,080
The problem is, you'll never know until he gets the end of his life and hasn't been killed.

985
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,640
Like, 300 bucks for that stuff.

986
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:09,120
Yeah.

987
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,060
I'll make like a...

988
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:10,920
I'll make a thick bed of it.

989
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:16,960
I wonder if they actually had a real person underneath that chocolate and it was simply a toad.

990
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:20,200
Well, that would be the Roger Corman movie version.

991
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,620
Or House of Wax.

992
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:26,360
Yeah, how does that guy... I mean, he has to have straws in his nose or something to live.

993
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,520
Or maybe they just used a dead body.

994
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,100
But maybe they did it like where they hijacked a guy off the highway like they did in House of Wax.

995
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,340
The new version, you know?

996
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,780
Now that I didn't see.

997
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,520
And then they...

998
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,040
I saw the version with Fay Wray.

999
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,380
They're trading down with wax instead of chocolate.

1000
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,020
1934 classic.

1001
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,340
Or chocolate instead of wax.

1002
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,400
I think it was like a Roger Corman movie.

1003
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:55,020
Bucket of Blood where they had a statue.

1004
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,380
Yes, in Bucket of Blood, the Roger Corman exploitation picture,

1005
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:08,680
Dick Miller of Dim-Witted Busboy developed a technique of covering his murdered victims with plaster.

1006
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:09,980
And presented...

1007
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:16,680
They were painting them as sculptures for which he is hailed as a genius by the beatnik inhabitants of a swingin' cafe.

1008
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:27,240
But things go wrong when the statues crack and the hideous ichor of death oozes through impugnifying the chest.

1009
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,580
I admit those movies.

1010
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,040
See now, that's your youthful...

1011
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,660
There was dead air right there and you...

1012
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,840
I draw inspiration from dead air.

1013
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,820
...of movies.

1014
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,960
When I was a kid.

1015
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,040
Growing up in the...

1016
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:47,520
Dobstown area, this was in the 1960s, every summer my mom would take me, my sister, and

1017
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,260
each of our best friends to Ichiku Park on the north side of the city.

1018
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,360
That explains it.

1019
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,300
We spent one glorious afternoon.

1020
00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:00,560
My mother had grown up with Ichiku, and she most wisely determined that so would we.

1021
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:06,860
By the time I got there, the grand old amusement park's heyday, well, hey, it was long gone.

1022
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:13,420
In fact, it was in its death throes, in its death rattle as it grotesquely inspired, soon

1023
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:19,780
to be torn down and superseded by a new kind of amusement park located in this suburb.

1024
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,980
Not that I noticed that there was anything wrong.

1025
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:28,960
I waited all year to go to Ichiku Park, and then when we finally got there, my joy was

1026
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,840
uncontainable.

1027
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:30,860
Did you go nuts?

1028
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,160
Oh, you bet.

1029
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,540
I did something that made all the other kids' hair stand on end.

1030
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:37,740
What did you do?

1031
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,260
Their two eyes nearly started...

1032
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,880
Well, I was playing in the water, and I got water on my pants.

1033
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:47,060
Were you humiliated and mortified by the location of said water?

1034
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:53,840
No, because it splashed evenly over my pants, so there was no localized discoloration.

1035
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:54,760
They were simply slightly darker.

1036
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,100
So it didn't appear that you had urinated on yourself.

1037
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:04,480
But then I went with my buds into the Ichiku Park fun house, which was a huge structure,

1038
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,420
and one part of it was a giant...

1039
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:12,020
record player turntable, which the kids would sit on, and as it went faster and faster,

1040
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:15,820
they'd be flung off by the centrifugal force.

1041
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:21,200
But I had wet pants, which made me stick to the giant record player.

1042
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:27,500
And all the other kids were thrown off, though struggling and trying to hold on, but I simply

1043
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:33,120
sat there with my arms folded, and because of my wet pants, did not fly off, exciting

1044
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,880
the admiration of all who viewed me.

1045
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,460
Turn table.

1046
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:42,080
And that was the only time in my life that I've ever had so much respect of the audience.

1047
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:48,880
As his body was slung outward to an extreme degree, his pants stuck like glue.

1048
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:53,900
What I didn't realize was that there was another factor to dislodge kids from the spinning

1049
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:58,480
disc, and that is that the operator who was viewing the whole thing from a booth and seeing

1050
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,600
it could also apply electrical jolts through little contacts, and soon he did, and then

1051
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,420
my wet pants didn't help me at all.

1052
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,420
In fact, it was the opposite.

1053
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,760
They fried you.

1054
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:14,060
I was hoping to get off that thing because it was so disgusting.

1055
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,100
Can you believe they could get away with that stuff?

1056
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,260
Yeah, they should get it.

1057
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,440
I got sued on that stuff.

1058
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:18,800
Man.

1059
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,640
No, it was a great amusement park.

1060
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,680
They had all kinds of things like that in it.

1061
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,480
They had barrels.

1062
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,140
They'd build up women's skirts.

1063
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:29,080
They'd just crawl through these turning barrels, and you'd fall and scrape and get blood on

1064
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:29,400
your...

1065
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:29,900
Yeah.

1066
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,180
I mean, all the kids would.

1067
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,220
Oh, man.

1068
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:35,380
Those were back in the days of, like, did they have the Fun House?

1069
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,460
Remember the Fun House?

1070
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,180
They just let you in there.

1071
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,560
What about the Fun House with the mirrors and the spinning discs?

1072
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,120
I'm talking about the Fun House.

1073
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,380
The Fun House in Hitchcock Park.

1074
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:48,380
And the floor that goes up and down, and the air that sprays up, the walls that are crooked.

1075
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:51,700
Hey, I want to talk about Salman Rushdie for a second, and his movie, I mean, his book.

1076
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,120
Yeah.

1077
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:59,440
I think people should take the cause of freedom and expression and make it the Titanic versus

1078
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,060
the movie.

1079
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,340
A simple song.

1080
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,680
Yeah, but that would be like asking the Ayatollah to come and shoot you.

1081
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,940
Well, you could.

1082
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:07,820
You're just a scaredy cat.

1083
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:08,560
We are.

1084
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,460
We're a country of cowards.

1085
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,460
We are a country of cowards.

1086
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,100
You're going to let them say, well, we don't like you.

1087
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,800
Hey, we may be cowards, but we're good cowards.

1088
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:22,380
Don't you think that if a movie like that were made, I don't know how hard it would

1089
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,580
be to get the rights.

1090
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,860
How hard that would be?

1091
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,200
I've tried to wash that yellow stripe off my back, but it's just there.

1092
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,780
I think I'm a lot like the rest of America.

1093
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,140
What a triumph it would be to have that in theaters.

1094
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:40,260
And people could go see that and see for themselves a story that they tried to suppress.

1095
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:41,260
That's it.

1096
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,300
If only the public could see the truth.

1097
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:43,820
Yes.

1098
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,500
Now the story can be told.

1099
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,980
Maybe you could go straight to DVD.

1100
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,660
Have the public gather in front of the station in 15 minutes.

1101
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,100
Salman Rusty's not scared.

1102
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,080
He's out there, man.

1103
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:53,740
He knows.

1104
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,560
He's saying, Kaya, Tolok, come on, bring your fatwa.

1105
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,240
That's all those things you're on.

1106
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,760
I'm still holding over the head of the world, and we're tolerating that.

1107
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,740
All of the listeners gather outside.

1108
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:06,100
Yeah, we'll tolerate that until they make us not tolerate it.

1109
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:06,120
The internet's dead.

1110
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,220
Have you tolerated it?

1111
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:09,240
Have you tolerated it?

1112
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:09,240


1113
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:09,240


1114
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,880
We're tolerating it because we deserve to tolerate it.

1115
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,620
There might be a...

1116
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,580
Because we're the evil.

1117
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,480
Buddha's hell for jaywalkers.

1118
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,800
We are some evil.

1119
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,980
We live to life the truth.

1120
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,960
We live to life the earth's resources.

1121
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,060
Eat you and we have the greatest glass.

1122
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:28,520
The hosiery in this place died while we were so, so, so, so.

1123
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,760
We eat the beautiful creatures for their pelt.

1124
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,660
And self-absorbed.

1125
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,020
By a variety of cells.

1126
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,800
Our senseless killing and these animals.

1127
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,660
Our extreme needs for the earth's most amazing show.

1128
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,720
We had a waste infinity key.

1129
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,680
But then again.

1130
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:43,920
Help stop the slaughter.

1131
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,120
We eat the resources before someone else can.

1132
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:49,860
Simply so that we can.

1133
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,920
And learn the secret of the engineer's needs.

1134
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,380
Hey, wait!

1135
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,160
You can't deny the existence and heart.

1136
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,460
And the existence and heart.

1137
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,600
And the existence and heart.

1138
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,380
Do I look like I'm made of money?

1139
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,420
That want to buy from the evil?

1140
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,900
Besides, I do buy.

1141
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:09,220
Satan!

1142
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:13,020
I buy small chunks of the earth's resources every time I buy anything.

1143
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:21,420
Controlled electrically, the mechanical monsters swing their heads, roll their eyes...

1144
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,480
I hate to be harsh about it.

1145
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:25,560
Breathe, snarl, roar, and grunt in real...

1146
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,040
I hope you don't think I'm being arbitrary.

1147
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,120
I don't know if we should fool around with those monsters.

1148
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:29,380
I don't think any of you would like it.

1149
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,980
A complicated mass of cogs, wheels...

1150
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:32,380
I like it.

1151
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,860
...bellows, and silent...

1152
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,700
But how will the Europeans and the Muslims think about us?

1153
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,660
...the lifelike sounds and motion of the brontosaurus...

1154
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,140
How will they?

1155
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:46,980
Isn't it important to us to believe that they want to think of us as something that can be admired instead of...

1156
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:47,760
...burn our eyes out with their thoughts?

1157
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,380
I don't think we need to worry about...

1158
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:50,600
They are.

1159
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,440
They're killing us with their thoughts right now.

1160
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,380
Let's just dance.

1161
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,080
I feel the pain.

1162
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,680
Yes, we can counteract the pain through dance.

1163
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,300
Let's just rock like it was the 80s in Prince.

1164
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,620
Of course we can't really play Prince.

1165
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,820
Hey, quit stepping on my feet.

1166
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:14,560
...expert operators and explorers will make these huge creatures swing their heads from side to side...

1167
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:20,420
...roll their eyes, lash their tails, and open and close their mighty jaws.

1168
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:29,980
Hidden where they can see the crowds, these radar-activated robots will frequently give spectators an added thrill...

1169
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,920
...by having the most fun.

1170
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,920
These are electronic pills...

1171
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,080
...swing suddenly toward them...

1172
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,300
...containing a certain virus that we will use...

1173
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,220
...to infiltrate...

1174
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:40,580
...the robots...

1175
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,880
...in one horrifying instant...

1176
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,160
...cognitive mechanisms.

1177
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,160
...on the outside signing books...

1178
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,880
...that's Phineas Narcole...

1179
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,400
Hey, will you sign some books for me?

1180
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,300
Please, in the new...

1181
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,480
Will you sign my name on some of those books to me?

1182
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:53,960
Sure.

1183
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:58,500
Why, uh, we all signed them. Let's, uh, not, uh, deny it.

1184
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,500
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

1185
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,180
Set up auto-deny. We're gonna have to go in and deny it.

1186
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,040
But I signed them with your name.

1187
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:03,780
All because you said deny.

1188
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:04,860
Well, now...

1189
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,000
You say deny, we gotta deny now.

1190
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,420
Get into the...

1191
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,960
Just auto... set it on auto-deny.

1192
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,100
Here we go. Yeah, it'll just be busy.

1193
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,780
Okay, leave your message, callers.

1194
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,100
It's 420.

1195
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:25,120
It was 420 on the Puzzling Evidence Show, but it is now the hour of slack.

1196
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:26,220
And...

1197
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:29,500

00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,280

1201
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,860
Uh, friends, uh, we've been listening to, uh, in the background music here...

1202
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:57,220
...Annihilation Earth from the Kirkendall Boyd's new album Stung, Praise God.

1203
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,200
We took heaps with forge and saw a great Obelisk!

1204
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,180
Such big as now, brother...

1205
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:09,600
Yet those sequence for collapsing, baccala, בר есть entré,

1206
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:14,280
But I think that this is not a new, this is a story that we are still venture.
