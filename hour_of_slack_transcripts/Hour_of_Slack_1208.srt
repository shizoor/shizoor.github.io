00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,700
Dear Mob, I'm standing outside of Mob, waiting for Mob to come out of the talkeria where he's buying a red Mob, because we're going to do a four hour Mob on radio with John Mob, and radio is located above Mob.

2
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,860
That's where the radio station is, above the auto.

3
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:36,020
And I guess we're going to go over there and do a long, long show, which will be this episode of Hour of...

4
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,860
Let me tell you something right now. You keep talking, you're going to talk your way right into jail.

5
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,520
That's illegal. I just keep on talking.

6
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,520
Talk yourself right into jail. The jails are full of guys that don't know when to keep their mouths shut.

7
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:04,060
I'm driving to a sanitarium, 25 Colorado Mass, older than I, to go out and get some booze, you know?

8
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,000
And I'm getting tired of the whole situation.

9
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,760
The ultimate piercing. They call it the Frankenstein.

10
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,880
Your basic bolt through the neck.

11
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:30,040
It miraculously manages to avoid the nerves, all those arteries, and veins, and even the spine itself.

12
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,180
At least while you face forward, that's the case.

13
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,080
Turn your head abruptly to the right and look up, and all control of your lower body cuts out for 30 seconds or so.

14
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,820
A lot like the Vulcan neck pinch, but smellier.

15
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,860
The Vulcan Neck Pinch

16
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,700
Come in, come in.

17
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,060
Be with you in a minute, I'm on the phone.

18
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,360
Oh, mm-hmm.

19
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,100
You should know that, you of all people.

20
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,740
Oh, mm-hmm, oh, mm-hmm.

21
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,200
Okay.

22
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,420
Okay.

23
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,500
Hello?

24
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,220
Yes?

25
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,660
This is Philip Marlowe.

26
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,400
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

27
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,820
Oh, no. No, I can't believe it.

28
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,980
What?

29
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,280
Men.

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,680
This is a bad life.

31
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,440
That's it. Get lost, loser.

32
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,840
Jeez, from now on, I'm gonna forget about romance and just get lost in my work.

33
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,900
In 1953, a man with a pipe had a vision.

34
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,420
You shall please propose I not.

35
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,980
Crazy! Make them listen to me before it's too late!

36
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,860
Listen to me. Please listen.

37
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,620
If you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand,

38
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,720
then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!

39
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,020
At the edge of space, an alien armada awaits his signal.

40
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,380
...wound in the light years of space unleashed to take over the planet.

41
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,800
In two months, the world will end.

42
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,820
Now it's a race against time.

43
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,640
And thirty dollars could mean the difference between salvation and destruction.

44
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,580
X-Day.

45
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:36,440
Soon, the other side of the administration shall be on the escape vessels of the sexology.

46
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,640
Can your brain withstand the shock and mind-blowing terror?

47
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,600
Seek, avoiding mutant yetis engaged in strange, preternatural mating rituals.

48
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,680
Experience the strangely erotic, otherworldly creatures from Planet X.

49
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:50,680


50
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:50,680


51
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:50,680


52
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:57,380
On July 5th, the greatest business deal in the history of the universe will take place.

53
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,660
Starring J.R. Bob Dobbs.

54
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,060
Allow me to build a giant supersonic wave oscillator.

55
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,780
Connie Dobbs.

56
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,900
I'm a woman and a woman is obviously different from a man.

57
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,880
And a cast of millions.

58
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,660
X-Day.

59
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,640
The forces of nature unleashed in all their terrifying force.

60
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,980
Tremendous cradle waves smashing New York City.

61
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,860
The molten fires of the bounds of the earth cashing out to consume our world.

62
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,600
Will you make it to the punchline?

63
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,600
Visit www.subgenius.com.

64
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,860
Ah, yes, dear friends.

65
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,040
Ha ha ha ha ha.

66
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,940
Stand and inhale

67
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,700
When the trumpet calls X-Day

68
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,120
In a brother and sister band

69
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,520
When they blow the world away

70
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,300
That will talk постоянно

71
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:50,300


72
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,460
We shall have paradise

73
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,140
Subgenie of the world unite

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,280
Alien sex every night

75
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,200
Subgenie of the world

76
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,880
Subgenie of the world

77
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,180
Subgenie of the world unite

78
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:19,960
Sub genie of the world unite

79
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,360
When the trumpet call makes sound

80
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,400
Brother and sister band

81
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,260
While we blow the world away

82
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,060
We shall have paradise

83
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,100
The king of the world tonight

84
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,680
Alien sucks everybody

85
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,760
The king of the world

86
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,220
The king of the world

87
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,240
The king of the world tonight

88
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,520
Yes, yes, bop, yes.

89
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,980
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

90
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,240
The subgenius anthem,

91
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,380
probably the very worst version of that

92
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,340
ever created in the ear of man.

93
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,300
Yes, and I'm fixing the ear of this man,

94
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,180
Reverend Stang.

95
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,140
It's not a very good ear.

96
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,460
It's a good station.

97
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,800
It's a good microphone.

98
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,000
It's a good playback machine.

99
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,700
It's just my ear is not very good.

100
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,840
But thanks to the ears,

101
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,940
of these contributors

102
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,620
that we've been listening to,

103
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,200
that was Lonesome Cowboy Dave's

104
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,480
subgenius anthem

105
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,260
played at some devival or X-Day

106
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,420
a long time ago.

107
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,180
I think we have better versions,

108
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,080
but hey, X-Day's coming up.

109
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,180
And that was the one on hand.

110
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,220
I am here alone, friends,

111
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,980
at the station.

112
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,120
It's the first time I've done this

113
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,760
since the old days in Dallas, practically.

114
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,960
Princess Wee's working on Starwood

115
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,260
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave is working

116
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:49,840
and...

117
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,020
may call in.

118
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,840
I'm going to read to you tonight.

119
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,660
But first, the credits.

120
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,400
That X-Day trailer was by

121
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,080
Reverend Sweetness McGee,

122
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,880
that little ad.

123
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,660
It had a reversed part

124
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,260
that had the price in it.

125
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,560
I wouldn't want to tell you

126
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,400
anything about that.

127
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,120
The, uh...

128
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,540
Just John.

129
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,000
Reverend Just John

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,040
did the nice bolt neck fashion cut.

131
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,120
And we hopefully will be playing

132
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,540
some more Just John music

133
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,860
along the way.

134
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,360
Uh, and, uh, and of course,

135
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,480
the great Mr. Fernandinande Leamer,

136
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,620
uh, did the, uh, the main title

137
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,180
and the defective, uh,

138
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,160
on the phone business.

139
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,940
And, uh, I think our opening

140
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,660
was chopped up by the large.

141
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,900
He is large and I am small.

142
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,900
He is large and I am small.

143
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,860
He is larger and I am small.

144
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,440
Friends, as I said,

145
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,680
I'm going to, uh,

146
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,980
because I'm alone for now

147
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,920
for this few brief,

148
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,040
uh, minutes,

149
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,400
um, I'm going to read to you

150
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,360
about one race,

151
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,960
the human race.

152
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,920
But, um,

153
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,040
the funny thing is

154
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,000
at one time

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,320
there wasn't just one

156
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,860
human race.

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,080
There were more than one

158
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,680
bipedal tool

159
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,320
using upright primate

160
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,040
species

161
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,800
by various names.

162
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,740
And I'm going to read here,

163
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,300
uh, something from

164
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,760
Stephen Baxter's, uh,

165
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,620
novel called Evolution.

166
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,120
And, uh, our story, uh,

167
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,100
picks up where

168
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,900
among some, uh, pre-humans,

169
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,520
I don't want to say

170
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,880
Australopithecines,

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,880
we're not really sure

172
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,380
who or what they are.

173
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,440
We can call them the walking folk.

174
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,680
This young female who's wandered

175
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,780
from her tribe was decimated

176
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,320
or her living group was,

177
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,500
was, uh, decimated.

178
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,620
And she's wandered it, uh,

179
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,620
been taken in by some other people

180
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,920
who are strangers to her.

181
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,500
They're a little bit more

182
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,640
technologically advanced

183
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,860
because their stone axes are better.

184
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,340
Her name is Far,

185
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,060
and she's watching a young man

186
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,080
who she thinks of by the name of Axe

187
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,880
because he has picked up a, uh, rock

188
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,720
and started displaying his strength

189
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,900
and, uh, making flakes and sheet of it,

190
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,540
sheets of it fall away.

191
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,060
And, uh, very quickly,

192
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,400
thanks to his skill and strength,

193
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,440
a crude hand,

194
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,400
a hand axe teardrop shape emerged.

195
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,200
Now he started to use a succession

196
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,140
of smaller stones to shape

197
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,960
the two lenticular surfaces

198
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,360
and finish the edge to a fine blade.

199
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,320
The walking folk,

200
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,120
here, I need to move this mic over

201
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,140
to where I can see the phone line

202
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,620
and my book at the same time.

203
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,680
The walking folk had already been making tools

204
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,460
more or less like this for 200,000 years.

205
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,320
Over such an immense span of time,

206
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,920
the axes had become more than mere tools,

207
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,060
more than functional.

208
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,500
To Axe, this feat of tool making

209
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,260
was a kind of courtship.

210
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,400
He was displaying his fitness as a mate to Far.

211
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,000
By making the tool,

212
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,880
he was showing her in one clear demonstration

213
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,380
the strength of his body,

214
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,620
the precision of his working,

215
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,900
the clarity of his mind,

216
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,060
his ability to conceive and see through a design,

217
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,440
his skill for locating wrong places,

218
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,840
his skill for drawing materials,

219
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,860
his coordination of hand and eye,

220
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,600
his spatial skills,

221
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,380
his understanding of the environment around him.

222
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,100
All of these were traits he expected she would want

223
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,000
to pass on to her offspring.

224
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,740
And that was why such displays had acquired

225
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,000
a logic of their own,

226
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,240
divorced from the utility of the hand axes.

227
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,420
Driven by lust and longing,

228
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,800
boys, I think you'll recognize those feelings,

229
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,540
men and boys would make dozens of axes over and over.

230
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,200
They'd labor for hours over a single axe,

231
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,540
seeking perfect symmetry.

232
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,700
They would make tiny axes the size of their thumbnails,

233
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,940
or they would make huge, unwieldy affairs

234
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,400
that had to be held in two hands like an open book.

235
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,540
They would, as Axe had,

236
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,000
seek out particularly difficult raw materials

237
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and go ahead and carve out axes anyhow.

238
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,440
Sometimes they'd even throw away their axes deliberately

239
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,380
to show how rich they were in strength and skill.

240
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,920
It was even worth trying to cheat,

241
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,380
as Scarface had done.

242
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,920
It didn't work very often.

243
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,240
Women quickly learned they had to see

244
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,840
the most impressive axe being made before them.

245
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,760
But occasionally it paid off,

246
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,320
and the liar got a chance to pass on his genes

247
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,440
at very low cost.

248
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,940
I've heard they have low-cost genes over at Walmart.

249
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,580
This mixing up of tool-making with sexual courtship

250
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,040
would have a profound effect on the future,

251
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,440
as no male could afford not to make axes

252
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,900
just as his forefathers did.

253
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,060
It was a recipe for stultifying conservatism.

254
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:56,240
These people would make the same tool to the same plan

255
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,880
over and over across several continents

256
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:06,060
despite several glacial cycles for a million years.

257
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,820
Even different species who followed them

258
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,100
would continue with the same technology.

259
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,940
It was a continuity and a consistency

260
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,880
that never changed.

261
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,400
No institution, no religion would ever match.

262
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,560
Until now.

263
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,180
Only sex had a strong enough hold on the human mind

264
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,940
to have achieved such a vast freezing.

265
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,380
Yes, friends, for a million years,

266
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,580
our ancestors did that same thing.

267
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:44,720
Repetitive motion with skill, little assembly line,

268
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,660
to impress the chicks and get laid.

269
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,380
Now let's jump ahead, still watching the phone for Dave's call,

270
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:59,200
to China around the 13th to 15th centuries.

271
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,600
This is from a book called,

272
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,080
this is a really interesting book, friends,

273
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,800
called Sex in History.

274
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,180
Not history of sex, sex in history.

275
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,900
Think of history as the female and sex as the male,

276
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,940
and you'll remember it.

277
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,700
But, you know, sex is the male, and you'll remember it.

278
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,680
This is by Ray Tannahill, author of Food in History.

279
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,020
China, before Confucius and Confucianism,

280
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,800
was a much looser place than most of us can imagine.

281
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,300
Polygamy was, there were more girls than guys in that time

282
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,860
because of wars constantly happening.

283
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,680
And so, a husband might have a friend,

284
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,160
but not his first, second, and third lady,

285
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,920
aside from their wife, their primary wife.

286
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,060
They lived like Bob, in other words, friends.

287
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,440
As it says here, the Chinese gentleman,

288
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,940
practical in all things,

289
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,320
took care not to cause emotional crises

290
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,540
in the women's quarters when he introduced a new concubine.

291
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,020
There was a correct way to do this,

292
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,820
as there was for everything else.

293
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,000
In about 1550, a wealthy landowner, or merchant,

294
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,660
left to his sons a piece of silk,

295
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:20,240
sound advice on how to deal with the situation. Situation of bringing in a new concubine.

296
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:28,100
The right method, he said, is for the man to control his desire, and for the time being not

297
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:34,840
to approach the newcomer, but to concentrate his attention on the others. Every time he has sexual

298
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:40,560
intercourse with his other women, he should make the newcomer stand at attention by the side of the

299
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,860
ivory couch. Then, after four or five nights of this, he may have intercourse with the newcomer,

300
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:54,060
but only with his principal wife and the other concubines present. This is the fundamental

301
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:03,460
principle of harmony and happiness in one's women's quarters. I guess a well-to-do feller

302
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:10,300
back then, a merchant class such as myself, selling slack,

303
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:17,900
would probably have more than one wife. And, you know, it does get a little tricky, I suppose. Now,

304
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,900
you know, the Mormons are trying to pick up on that. And, of course, in subgenius land,

305
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:31,860
I can't even remember what the rules are. But the Chinese at one point did have a lot of rules.

306
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,200
It makes an interesting, it's interesting to consider the Chinese penitential in relation

307
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,480
to that of the early Christians.

308
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:48,460
In the early days of Mongol ascendancy during the last years of the 13th century,

309
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,840
the Chinese became sensitive about the safety of their womenfolk, which was not surprising

310
00:15:52,840 --> 00:16:01,860
since they had Mongol soldiery billeted in their homes. New prudishness had began to develop,

311
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:09,180
and one of its expressions was the table of merits and demerits, listing good deeds versus sins and

312
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,540
evaluating each on a moral level. And, of course, the Chinese were not so good at this. They were not

313
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:16,900
able to observe moral basis. Murdering someone rated a thousand demerits, saving a life 500 merits.

314
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,960
By consulting such a list, the conscientious Chinese could work out for himself whether

315
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:29,260
his morality was on the debit or credit side of the ledger. The first and most detailed of these

316
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:38,340
moral calorie counts was the Shi Che Kung Kuo Lu, which was divided into 10 sections. The third,

317
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,520
which is, of course, the only one we're interested in,

318
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:46,980
deals with debauchery, and only demerits are listed. You don't get any merits for debauchery,

319
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,460
but for the rape of a married woman, it was 500 demerits. If the woman was the wife of a servant,

320
00:16:53,660 --> 00:17:02,580
only 200 demerits. But if you raped a widow or a virgin, it was 1,000 demerits. Although if it

321
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:09,240
was a servant's widow or a servant's maid, the servant of a servant, then it was only 500 demerits.

322
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:16,960
Uh, like that, like raping a married woman. Of a nun, the rape of a nun demerits too numerous to

323
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:24,060
count. Of a prostitute, only 50 demerits. Then they break it down into, uh, similar things for

324
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:30,760
spur-of-the-moment passion, 200 demerits for a married woman, 100 for a servant's wife. Uh,

325
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:37,860
premeditated illicit intercourse, premeditated, my friend, with a married woman would cost you

326
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,860
100 demerits.

327
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:45,280
Uh, as Gary Gabrog, friend, said one time, gosh, 10 more demerits and I can get that baseball glove.

328
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:54,780
Um, boasting about these sins had demerits, 50 demerits if the partner was a married woman,

329
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:02,400
and 100 demerits if it was a virgin or a widow, 200 demerits if it's a nun, but only 5 demerits

330
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,740
for boasting about a prostitute. However, if you boasted untruthfully about a prostitute,

331
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,120
it was 10 demerits.

332
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,900
And the demerits were doubled for boasting untruthfully in most cases.

333
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,400
Uh, the demerits are, the distinctions are interesting, particularly in the case of married

334
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,600
women and widows. Um, but, uh, when you're talking about widows, then you're close to insulting,

335
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:34,800
uh, the relic of an ancestor. So that's a little different. There are a great many other items on

336
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,040
the list, all of them illuminating. Uh, keeping an,

337
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,880
an indecently large number of wives and concubines was 50 demerits. It's like bragging.

338
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:52,000
Showing favoritism to one woman is 10 demerits and 20 if it encourages her to be rude to the

339
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,700
other women in your stable. Comparing the charms of one's women folk was only one demerit as was

340
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:06,280
gloating over them and lewd dreams, but that would turn into 5 demerits if the lewd dreams

341
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,700
resulted in lewd actions.

342
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:16,900
So keep it in your britches, boys. Uh, singing frivolous songs is only two demerits, but studying

343
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:22,820
such songs is 20 demerits. And that's where I think many of us are in trouble, friends.

344
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:32,120
Uh, keeping erotic pictures on the shelves, 10 demerits per picture. So if we counted every CD

345
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:39,020
and DVD porno JPEG on your hard drive, you would have 10 demerits.

346
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:45,360
Okay. How many demerits per picture would that be? Okay. Apparently touching the hands of one's

347
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:52,220
women folk was a bad thing to do back in those days because it would get you a demerit, especially

348
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,940
if you did it with lustful intent. Then it was 10 demerits. Unless you touch their hand, helping

349
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:06,360
them in an emergency, then it's only, uh, well, there's no, there's no demerits for that. But if

350
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,020
such help arouses lust, it bumps into something else. So it's only two demerits. And somebody

351
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,020


352
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,020


353
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,020


354
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,520
back up to 10 demerits.

355
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,460
Having lewd thoughts about a woman on the street,

356
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,360
associating with friends who go whoring and gambling.

357
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,140
This is all starting to sound awfully familiar.

358
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,460
Going to the theater was one demerit.

359
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,820
Actually being in a play, 50 demerits.

360
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,520
Once again, you subgeniuses.

361
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,960
Praising the virtues of one's women,

362
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,460
there's no demerits in that,

363
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,520
but praising their wisdom and generosity

364
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,080
would get you demerits.

365
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,640
That's five demerits.

366
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,320
And telling one's women dirty stories

367
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,620
is 20 demerits unless they were told

368
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,520
to excite the woman's sense of shame,

369
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,440
in which case there were none.

370
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,880
In the last analysis,

371
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,760
the Chinese seem to have had a more interesting

372
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,460
and varied list of sins,

373
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,820
and however eccentric,

374
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,660
a better sense of balance than their contemporaries

375
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,100
in the agonized Christian West.

376
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,040
It was only when Neo-Confucianism,

377
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,580
a composite philosophy

378
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,880
incorporating the theories of the sage,

379
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,500
with fragments of Taoism and shreds of Buddhism,

380
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,600
began to take a vice-like hold on Chinese society

381
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,720
in mid-medieval times,

382
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,660
that what had been one of the most sophisticated

383
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,200
and civilized cultures in the world

384
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,980
began its long slide into moral Victorianism.

385
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,900
Now, friends, you know, when you get to be my age,

386
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,560
some of that moral Victorianism starts at 70,

387
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,400
and that sounds almost like a good idea.

388
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,760
But that's...

389
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,760
Well, it's...

390
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,040
I don't know if I need to go there.

391
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,320
I'm going to hit that.

392
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,760
This one.

393
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,380
Oh, my God.

394
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,000
, this one.

395
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,140
This one.

396
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,140


397
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,320
This one.

398
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,040
This one.

399
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,580
This one.

400
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:14,600
This one.

401
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:14,600


402
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:14,600


403
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:14,600


404
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:14,600


405
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:14,600


406
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,680
Friends, that is actually Mark Mothersball playing that,

407
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,320
and I recorded it.

408
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,420
I think that's his voice saying,

409
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,160
Bob, we did some with my voice.

410
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,360
Let's see what happens if I hit these little buttons here.

411
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,960
Well, one of them has to do with dairy fats.

412
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,780
Ah, that was the button that did with the dairy fats.

413
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,600
You did it, Dave!

414
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,240
You did it!

415
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
But you can't...

416
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:45,160
You've got to stay away from the button right next to it, because that erases all subgenius-related material from the entire...

417
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,720
What, the shiny candy-like button?

418
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah, the one that's...

419
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,080
The glowing button.

420
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,900
It looks like a naked lady, and she's dancing and singing,

421
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,780
Come on over, sang and played with...

422
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,040
Something like that, like a David Lynch thing, you know?

423
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,040
Boy, it's beautiful.

424
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,240
It is.

425
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,420
And you can't get away from it.

426
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,720
You're walking...

427
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,920
No, no, you must get away from it.

428
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,560
You must get away from it, because you don't want to be erased.

429
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,320
The history erase button is what that thing is labeled.

430
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,740
And it's a good thing in a lot of ways, but...

431
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,880
It's good to have it around.

432
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,880
There's been times when I've been tempted to use it, Dave.

433
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,020
There's times when it has been used, and we don't know, because we've got to shift it over so far.

434
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,760
There you go.

435
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,840
There you go.

436
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,820
Like that hoax that they call World War II that was just used as a cover-up,

437
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,820
so we wouldn't notice during the night when they switched...

438
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,760
all of civilization from Mars to Earth.

439
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,700
Or actually, from Earth to Mars, but we now think of Mars as Earth.

440
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,340
Yeah, so old-timers would say,

441
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,000
smooth move, ex-lax.

442
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:53,360
You know, having to do with a cathartic anemonic that people used to take to make them go poop and stuff.

443
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,880
But that was pretty quick, the way it happened.

444
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,540
I've said that many a time.

445
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,960
It's almost incomprehensible that they could move that many, quote, people, unquote,

446
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,640
to so far...

447
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,120
so quickly.

448
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,440
Well, they have science they haven't told us about yet.

449
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:17,540
You know, the Manhattan Project didn't really mean the atomic bomb.

450
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,380
Thomas Edison invented the atomic bomb.

451
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,760
What they were really working on was teleportation devices and so forth.

452
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:31,920
But they still, for so long, had the problem of the atoms kind of, like, going in different directions, and so...

453
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,680
Well, they got rid of that in the 30s, though, didn't they?

454
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,620
Well, in the 30s...

455
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,460
In the 30s, they found out that all atoms were related to each other,

456
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,920
if no further apart than distant cousins.

457
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,900
But even an atom in another...

458
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,540
As long as they were related, which they all are,

459
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,880
if one thing happens to one atom, the same thing would happen to the other atom

460
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,040
in another world or dimension or miles away and so forth.

461
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:56,780
But...

462
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,520
But...

463
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,380
And you know how that doesn't make any sense?

464
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,800
That's probably because it's not true.

465
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,320
No, it's because...

466
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:13,000
In an isolated system, this would occur, but since there is no such thing as an isolated system, and then by...

467
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,480
Right, because the minute you look at it, it gets bashful.

468
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,140
Yeah.

469
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,440
Or it starts showing off.

470
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:17,940
Yeah.

471
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,860
You know, the minute it knows you're looking, then it's going to act different.

472
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,480
It believes it has unique, unique, unique, unique eyebrows, so to speak.

473
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,920
You know what I'm saying?

474
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,480
I mean, not in the hypoallergenic, radioactive way.

475
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,060
Right.

476
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,000
Metaphorically.

477
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,620
Metaphorically.

478
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,200
Metaphysically.

479
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:33,660
Meta...

480
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,580
Yeah.

481
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,920
Meta-paragorically.

482
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,560
Speaking of laxatives.

483
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,280
Yeah, yeah.

484
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,200
So did you speak of the great leader, the great laxative?

485
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,680
No, I hadn't yet.

486
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,620
As I told you I was going to do, I read to them from the caveman book.

487
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,260
I did not get around to the...

488
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:55,420
There was a section about what kind of spears cavemen use to kill dinosaurs with, and I didn't get to that part.

489
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:05,720
But I did get to the sex in history, which had the rules for how to treat your various wives when you're a correct Chinese gentleman.

490
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,520
Until...

491
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,400
Until Confucius came along and screwed everything up.

492
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:09,800
But...

493
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,620
And I have a joke.

494
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,680
They were quite, quite erudite on the subject.

495
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,980
And in fact, there are volumes.

496
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:25,260
And in the basement of the Peking Library and stuff, there are still tomes concerning the correct way to wash the different wives' genitalia.

497
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,160
And this is really true, so I hope I don't get ex-rhythmed by...

498
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,780
No, no, no.

499
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,940
You're quite right.

500
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,720
There have been rules and regulations.

501
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,800
It's like...

502
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,560
It didn't start with the do-goods.

503
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,800
There have been do-gooders of today, friends.

504
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:48,900
There have been do-gooders telling everybody else how to wash their own chattels' genitalia for ten billions of years.

505
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,800
I like the sky-brogue you put on the end there.

506
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,700
I have no idea what it means, though.

507
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,520
Oh, I was trying to sound like an Indian, but it didn't work.

508
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:00,880
All right.

509
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,840
Or Peter Lorre.

510
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,620
That's what it is.

511
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,760
I shouldn't have done that one.

512
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,480
I have a joke.

513
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,420
I mean, and I don't mean to say that I am a joke or anything like that.

514
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,440
I have a joke.

515
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,040
I'm listening.

516
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,060
It's a subgenius joke.

517
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,340
A parable, actually.

518
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,240
It's not so much a joke as a parable.

519
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,220
Oh, those are sad.

520
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,000
No, I'll turn this one down.

521
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,420
Nikolai Kingsley.

522
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,340
I'm not sure if he's a reverend or not, but I know he's a customer.

523
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,240
Had posted this parable.

524
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:34,260
That's in your Painted Lady at Night job or a subgenius job?

525
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,600
Yeah, where I work in the alt.slack.com.

526
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,020
Artifactory.

527
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,440
Yeah.

528
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,320
A man lost his job and was forced to beg on the streets.

529
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,880
A Jew passed by and gave him $5.

530
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:56,020
A Satanist passed by and gave him a raw steak and a ticket to see a Slipknot cover band.

531
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,540
A Buddhist passed by, waved his hand and said,

532
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,080
All is transitory.

533
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,460
A Hindu passed by and assured the man,

534
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,880
You shall be reincarnated as a poor man begging on a better corner.

535
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,200
A Christian passed by and muttered,

536
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,320
If you were a regular at my church, you'd be eligible for a food coupon.

537
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:24,800
A subgenius passed by and gave the man an adhesive Dobbs head.

538
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,780
The man didn't know it was adhesive and licked the back.

539
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:34,460
The glue cured his trichinosis that had caused his bad breath

540
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,440
that got him fired.

541
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,440
He was fired in the first place.

542
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,060
And he went on to own every business in the city.

543
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,600
And he hired the Buddhist, the Hindu, and the Christian.

544
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,880
Then he fired them and rehired them and fired them on a daily basis.

545
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:51,620
The moral of the story is, Slipknot cover band?

546
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,520
Tell me you're kidding, please.

547
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,440
Well, yeah, that was a punchline.

548
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,260
No, that was the moral.

549
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,340
It was more of a parable.

550
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,080
It was the moral of the parable.

551
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,340
Slipknot cover band?

552
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,060
Give me a break.

553
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,840
Or maybe he said, come on.

554
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,060
Something like that.

555
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,780
Well, Dave, now you see why I don't do jokes.

556
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,820
It's a hatchet job.

557
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,800
I did a hatchet job on that joke.

558
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,780
As accused to a hand job or a nose job or a plumb bob.

559
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,080
It was elusive.

560
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,740
It was liquid.

561
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,900
It was like clear water, bro.

562
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,860
It was like broccoli Rob.

563
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,820
Rob is here.

564
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,100
Oh, I can turn Rob on.

565
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,360
Is that his etheric double or is that the actual Rob?

566
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,080
There's a real, there's a, uh, the Miserob.

567
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,880
Who is this person from you speak?

568
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,880
The Dr. Sinister has arrived along with his fellow, the Miserob.

569
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,400
We call him Rob for short.

570
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,760
And, uh, are they, uh...

571
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,340
It's his handman and his footman.

572
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,980
And is, uh, are all present wearing the correct, uh, let's just say headgear?

573
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:02,840
Uh, we don't talk about the headgear on the air.

574
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,360
Well, you were talking about Slipknot.

575
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,850
Yeah, Slipknot and, uh, different kinds of nautical.

576
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,450
That's a band.

577
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:12,070
I know, but it made me think about knots and it made me think about our headgear and then

578
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:17,170
it made me think about the fun we've had with our headgear and a couple of unfortunate incidents

579
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:22,190
and then maybe some of those people was really their time, but, and, but basically overall

580
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,930
how, you know, pretty well they work and stuff.

581
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:27,670
Yeah.

582
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,890
Yeah, well, I know you are living proof.

583
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,070
Work.

584
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:32,670
Work.

585
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,230
Work.

586
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,550
Who needs it?

587
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:41,850
Somebody said, somebody said the, uh, the subgeniuses are the Maynard G. Krebs of religion.

588
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,210
That was also erudite, elusive and, and, and quick-stinkers.

589
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,190
Fairly accurate, yeah.

590
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,830
And think about the fellow who played Maynard G. Krebs.

591
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,170
He went on to play the great subgenius Gilligan on Gilligan's Island.

592
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,110
He went on to get busted for smoking pot a bunch of times.

593
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,830
And, uh...

594
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,650
Off-Broadway Pluto grotesque where he played the, uh...

595
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:02,650


596
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,430
The, uh, the, uh, puppy eater.

597
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,710
And his name was Bob.

598
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,630
Bob Denver.

599
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:11,170
Bob Denver, named after a town somewhere that we've never been, at least today.

600
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,130
Now, here's, uh, six circuits of, uh, of, uh, contact.

601
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,350
The, near Denver is a bridge named Bob.

602
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,230
And that's the name of the bridge.

603
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,790
It was the townsfolk voted to name the bridge.

604
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,350
Bob.

605
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:32,630
Well, that's so much more synchronistic than Dobstown being built near the Blood River.

606
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:32,630


607
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,730
The river in the Amazons.

608
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:34,770
Amazon.

609
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,490
Well, you're talking about Dobstown 3.

610
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,970
How many Amazons are there?

611
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,690
Well, there's been only one Amazon.

612
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,330
There have been a bunch of Dobstowns.

613
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,630
There was the first one was in Malaysia.

614
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,970
And the next one was in Bolivia.

615
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,450
And then there was one in Ararauama, Brazil.

616
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,190
That's the one I'm referring to.

617
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:50,730
Number 3.

618
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,650
Yeah, that was the one I've been...

619
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:51,990
The one in Trish.

620
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,610
That's the only one I've been to in any...

621
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,430
That I can...

622
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,530
Am allowed to remember.

623
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,270
It's sweltering.

624
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,310
Winter, summer, spring.

625
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,130
Yes.

626
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,150
Any fall in between.

627
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:02,610
And then, uh...

628
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,490
It's, uh, unbearable.

629
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,650
It's, uh...

630
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,930
I can hear them calling us now.

631
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:07,710
Yes.

632
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,110
I hear the bells.

633
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,990
I hear the bells of Dobstown.

634
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,790
It's Vespas time.

635
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,450
Are you one of the spirit of Bob?

636
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,790
Are you a man?

637
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:23,310
Are you a snake?

638
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:26,510
Are you a turtle?

639
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:32,590
Are you aware of the different messages being given at one time?

640
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,590


641
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,590


642
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,590


643
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,590


644
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,590


645
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,590


646
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,590


647
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,590


648
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,590


649
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,590


650
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,590


651
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,590


652
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,590


653
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,590


654
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,830
Can you absorb them all at once?

655
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:41,990
I think we're getting some kind of little Morse code message buried in the, uh, crappy

656
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,110
music mix.

657
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,290
The music, by the way, in the background is by me.

658
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,650
If you want to call it music, yes.

659
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:49,910
If you wanted to call it me.

660
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,790
It's actually just a bunch of loops.

661
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,610
Stolen and, uh, reorganized.

662
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:55,810
Oh.

663
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:56,930
That's called theft.

664
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:57,510
Yeah.

665
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:57,770
No.

666
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,350
No, no.

667
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,330
Well, yes and no.

668
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,590
Now, here's something I've been wondering about.

669
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,610
The word DJ.

670
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:09,910
Over the last 10 years, I noticed that DJs were starting to be treated as artists or

671
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:13,710
else were treating themselves as if they were some kind of artiste.

672
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,090
They're presumptuous.

673
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,930
And I thought, well, I guess they're talking about these people like Moby that take, they

674
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,270
steal loops from one song and loops from another song.

675
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:26,070
The kleptones, which we've played a lot lately and girl talk and so forth.

676
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:30,910
But it turns out, no, most of these DJs are just guys that play somebody else's music.

677
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,310
In their own order.

678
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,570
They make up a new order to play a bunch of other people's and that's all.

679
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:42,150
Like radio DJ of the old timey days back when, when people actually picked the songs rather

680
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:47,610
than, uh, computers and, uh, statistics, uh, processing machines.

681
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:52,630
There were also these huge, large Bauhaus looking, uh, tape grills.

682
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,830
Some of them were like six inches thick and you had to argue with each one.

683
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:00,530
You usually hired a slight gentleman from Romania.

684
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:00,890
Yeah.

685
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:06,110
Uh, but who actually was very, very muscular when the time came and he would have to grab

686
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:11,510
one of these huge discs and pull them off these Bauhaus looking, uh, like cathedral

687
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:16,910
of audio science things, you know, with the weird script writing across them and he'd

688
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:21,430
rip them off and he'd run over to the other machine and he'd slap one on and there'd be

689
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:27,110
like a seven second delay and there'd be a live time where the DJ, which stands for disconnected,

690
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,250
I don't want to say the word.

691
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:29,970
Um.

692
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:31,350
Oh yeah.

693
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:31,830
No, no.

694
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:32,610
Dipstick.

695
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,470
Disconnected dipstick.

696
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:39,110
I was going to talk about the excretion that comes from our bodies when we're delighted.

697
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,710
I wasn't going to talk about that.

698
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,170
Slobber drool.

699
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,810
How about dumb jizz head?

700
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:47,950
Can you say that on the air?

701
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,330
Oh no.

702
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,730
Uh, you can see now.

703
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,110
Whatever.

704
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,390
I didn't think you could.

705
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,770
That's why I listed.

706
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,910
But anyway, that was, don't you remember those days?

707
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:00,870
I mean, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was,

708
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:00,970
it was.

709
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,430
Yeah, but, that's not a dream.

710
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,670
I'm sure it was a dream.

711
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:03,110
Well, yeah.

712
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,870
But, things haven't changed.

713
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:09,270
It's just that instead of big reels now and having to run back and forth across the radio

714
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:14,450
factory or drive back and forth with the giant reels, now you just push buttons.

715
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:20,250
And then what had been on big reels is on a few tiny little bits of a chip somewhere.

716
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,090
Or a disc.

717
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:26,290
You can get one of those monkeys with a bell hop hat on a bicycle to pull the treadmill

718
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,690
endlessly and stuff and deliver things for you while you sit in some sort of fake room

719
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:30,690


720
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:36,290
you know what, Mark, easy chair meant for the patio.

721
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,050
Well, things have changed.

722
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:43,510
Their evolution of some kind has happened in one direction or another.

723
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:47,830
The only time will tell which way it's really going now.

724
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:52,650
But, you know, one thing that has always been here,

725
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,970
one constant has been the church of the subgenius.

726
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:00,390
And you may say, but Reverend Stang, wasn't the church founded in 1954?

727
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,050
By J.R. Bob Dobbs?

728
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,550
How can you say it's always been around?

729
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,790
And, well, there have always been bobs.

730
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:13,770
And I have this history book that proves that the czar of Russia, Peter the Great,

731
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:20,490
was, in some ways, if not a bob, well, he was definitely not a bob,

732
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,590
but he was a true subgenius.

733
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,250
Now, the music you're playing in the background,

734
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,450
which you put together yourself and which is your music.

735
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,610
Yes, this hasn't been.

736
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:35,230
It's perfect for your segue into a delightful afternoon

737
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,010
talking to the czar of all the Russias,

738
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,010
which even at that time was quite large of an area,

739
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,770
sitting in somewhere in his dacha.

740
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:45,910
Well, they...

741
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:46,830
By the back porch.

742
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:47,490
And drinking.

743
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,250
Drinking samovars of hot tea and vodka.

744
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,830
Here, let me read this little section here.

745
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,170
Although much of the Alka...

746
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:00,510
This is a section talking about how drunk every level of Russian...

747
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,770
Society always was back then.

748
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,150
And seems to still be.

749
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:04,910
Although...

750
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,730
Well, look who's talking.

751
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,070
Americans.

752
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,530
Okay, although much of the alcohol consumed at their revels

753
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,590
was in a milder form of beer or kvass,

754
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,370
the intake was vast and continuous.

755
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,570
G. Gordon Gordon, in his diary,

756
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,410
speaks often of the amount Peter has drunk

757
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,950
and of the difficulties that he, a middle-aged man, had in keeping up.

758
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:30,170
But it was Lefkort who taught Peter to drink...

759
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:31,530
really heavily.

760
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:32,790
Although...

761
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,030
And Lefkort said...

762
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:50,430
Eventually, this drinking took its toll

763
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:53,410
and Lefkort died a relatively young man of 43.

764
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,950
But here's the good part, okay?

765
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,690
This is the part where Sterno...

766
00:37:59,330 --> 00:37:59,330


767
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,570
Pope Sterno...

768
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:00,670
Pope Sterno...

769
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,610
Dox of Arkansas...

770
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:05,030
handed me this paperback book I'm looking at now

771
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,750
and pointed to this paragraph I'm about to read.

772
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,590
And when he did that,

773
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:12,390
I ended up reading a lot more about Russia

774
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,790
and Russian history.

775
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:18,030
But Peter the Great was made czar when he was only 17 or so, right?

776
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,530
He was mad, too.

777
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,730
He was quite mad.

778
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,750
Well, yes and no.

779
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,270
You maybe think...

780
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,190
There have been some pretty crazy czars,

781
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,330
and Peter had his...

782
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,350
I'm thinking of his excesses.

783
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:29,910
I know he...

784
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,730
Created Russia in many senses.

785
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,290
Yes.

786
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:36,030
And he built the nation and made it a, quote,

787
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,530
Western, whatever that means.

788
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:43,050
He dragged it crapping and urinating into the 16th century.

789
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,530
But Peter...

790
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,430
He got away with murder

791
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,330
because he would...

792
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:55,130
Once he was made the emperor of the entire known world of the Russias,

793
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:59,490
he started hanging out with all his buddies who were foreigners

794
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,650
and people friendly.

795
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,150
And he was a very good man.

796
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:01,270
And he was a very good man.

797
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,850
But Peter's parody of temporal power was mild

798
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:08,530
compared to the bizarre mockery he and his comrades

799
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,730
appeared to make of the church.

800
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:13,050
His friends, the Jolly Company,

801
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,750
was organized into, quote, get this,

802
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:22,910
the all-joking, all-drunken synod of fools and jesters.

803
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,090
Might as well call it Church of the Subgenius.

804
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,070
With a mock prince-pope,

805
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,630
a college of cardinals,

806
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,650
and a suite of bigots,

807
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:30,650


808
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:30,970
bishops,

809
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,230
archimandrites,

810
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:32,710
priests,

811
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:33,570
and deacons.

812
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:34,690
Peter himself,

813
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,350
although only a deacon,

814
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,870
notice I'm only a reverend,

815
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,130
took charge of drawing up the rules and instructions

816
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,910
for this strange assembly.

817
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,750
With the same enthusiasm with which he was later to draw up laws

818
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,910
for the Russian Empire,

819
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,990
he carefully defined the rituals and ceremonies

820
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,030
of the drunken synod.

821
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,730
The first commandment was that, quote,

822
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,390
Bacchus be worshipped with strong and honorable drinking

823
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,630
and receive his...

824
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,450
his just dues.

825
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:04,050
In practical terms, this meant that, quote,

826
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,850
all goblets were to be emptied promptly

827
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:10,030
and that members were to get drunk every day

828
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,410
and never go to bed sober.

829
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,070
At these riotous, quote, services,

830
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,970
the prince-pope, who was Peter's old tutor, Nikita Zotov,

831
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,050
drank everyone's health and then blessed the kneeling congregation

832
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,670
by making the sign of the cross over them

833
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,630
with two long Dutch pipes.

834
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:36,010
It goes on to talk about how they would have marriages

835
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:40,330
that were sometimes as many as 200 incredibly drunk people

836
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:46,310
at their head, riding in a sleigh drawn by 12 bald men,

837
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,450
rode the mock prince-pope.

838
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,210
His costume was sewn with playing cards.

839
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:54,370
He wore a tin hat and he was perched atop a barrel.

840
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:57,610
Now, this all sounds just like an ex-day drill so far.

841
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,630
Choosing the richer noblemen and mercenaries,

842
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,670
the more they were able to get their merchants to honor with their caroling,

843
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,610
they swarmed into their houses expecting food and drink

844
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,170
as thanks for their uninvited songs.

845
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:12,650
During the first week of Lent, this time of penitence,

846
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:17,050
followed the prince-pope through the city.

847
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,890
The company, wearing outlandish costumes inside out,

848
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,730
rode on the backs of donkeys and bullocks

849
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:28,770
or sat in sleighs pulled by goats, pigs, or even bears.

850
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,910
They were so people that they would have been

851
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,010
more than happy to have those horses for a feast.

852
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,650
They had a marriage ceremony that was so wild

853
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:41,190
that when the party was over, the bridegroom died.

854
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:43,230
What did he die of?

855
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,370
Alcohol poisoning.

856
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:48,350
The drunken synod, created when Peter was 18,

857
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:52,290
continued its tipsy existence until the end of the tsar's reign

858
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,830
with the mature man who had become emperor

859
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:59,610
continuing to engage in the same coarse buffoonery

860
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,850
begun by the unbridled adolescent.

861
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:07,610
This behavior, which foreign diplomats found vulgar and scandalous,

862
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:11,030
seemed blasphemous to many of Peter's subjects

863
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,810
and added to the belief that he was himself the Antichrist,

864
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:19,350
and they eagerly awaited the bolt from heaven which would strike down the blasphemer.

865
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,570
And, of course, he just got more and more out of hand.

866
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:28,630
And the parody of the church hierarchy not only gave vent to his own resentment,

867
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:32,190
but as the years went by, reflected his continuing impatience

868
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,710
with the whole institution of the church in Russia.

869
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:42,050
And, in fact, later on, he declared that all Russian men had to cut their beards off or pay a tax,

870
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:48,370
which in the Russian Orthodox Church at that time meant pretty much that Peter the Great was the Antichrist.

871
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,110
Because up until that moment...

872
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,530
He was telling all the priests to cut their beards.

873
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,190
Right. Up until then, shaving was not allowed.

874
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,050
That was immoral. It was against God.

875
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:04,430
And suddenly, Peter, having traveled around Europe, which he was the first czar to do that,

876
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:09,430
had looked around and realized, oh my God, everybody else is wearing these nice pointy shoes

877
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:14,350
and giant triangular hats and pretty white wigs, and they shaved their beards.

878
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,710
He was a Francophile and a Brito-phile.

879
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:23,950
Well, actually, he was a Dutchophile more than anything, because the Dutch had a navy, you see, and Russia didn't.

880
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,790
And Russia wanted one so they could watch the Swedes.

881
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,290
In other states, the Swedes were kicking the Russians' butts.

882
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:31,690
Can you imagine that?

883
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:41,430
A King Charles of Sweden managed to beat the Russians, but they would just go over there and do whatever they wanted to with them.

884
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,310
Do you know what I mean?

885
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,770
Yep. And they still do to this day.

886
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:49,290
But now it's like drunken guys in cars that go over the border where they, you know,

887
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:54,030
it's like going to Canada where nobody is and you just show up in town and get drunk and drink Labatt's 50 or something

888
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,690
and then go back to your home and...

889
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:57,710
In America.

890
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:06,150
I've heard that's what y'all Yankees do, because, see, in Texas, Canada was just too far to go for a whorehouse.

891
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:13,290
Well, they used to have boats that went over to Canada, and you could get these things that were called fish and chips and stuff like that.

892
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:16,870
But it was just like, well, actually, it was better than America in a lot of ways.

893
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:20,930
Their hamburgers were real big and fat, and the beer actually tasted like beer.

894
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:26,470
But how did you guys go to get to Juarez or Ciudad Acuna?

895
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:37,250
I got to Juarez personally via an old movie, an old film noir, and I was sitting on a couch, actually, and it was in Cleveland.

896
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:41,090
At the time, I just closed my eyes and I appeared in Juarez.

897
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:47,130
They called me a warista, and they tried to send me home, but I told them I was a vagrant.

898
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:51,950
And so they had to put me in the pickling stuff, that compound, that fluid.

899
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:54,790
That's where I'm at right now.

900
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,610
I still have to lick my wounds.

901
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:07,110
I picked up the Spanish translation of the novel Treasure of Sierra Madre recently.

902
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:18,030
I was trying to brush up on my Spanish because my family is now partially Hispanic, or more Hispanic than it used to be.

903
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,470
And I thought, well, I need to brush my high school Spanish.

904
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:23,730
I picked it up, and the first paragraph basically says,

905
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:24,430
Yeah.

906
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,070
Yeah.

907
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,730
Yeah.

908
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:26,310
Yeah.

909
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:26,490
Yeah.

910
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:26,990


911
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:27,010


912
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:27,010


913
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:27,030
Yeah.

914
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,030


915
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,030


916
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,030


917
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,030


918
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,030


919
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,030


920
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,030


921
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,030


922
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,030


923
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:32,150
White bench with no money in his pocket, watching the shoeshine boys running around and thinking,

924
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:36,990
with their little box of gear and wax and cloth, thinking to himself,

925
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,610
compared to me, these guys are capitalists.

926
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:46,910
I wish I could say it all in Spanish, but most of our radio audience wouldn't understand it,

927
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:52,370
and neither would the Spanish-speaking ones, because my pronunciation would be so high school.

928
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:56,690
Dr. Sinister would have to run over the microphone and explain,

929
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:00,750
fully in Espanol, what you had hablado.

930
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,910
Dogs estaban sentando en el...

931
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,110
No sé la palabra para bench.

932
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:08,930
Nos vemos en su casa.

933
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,310
No, we won't.

934
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,550
Yeah, no, let's not try.

935
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,410
It's been too long.

936
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:17,490
But I'm getting to where I can sort of read Spanish,

937
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,990
sort of, just enough to get in trouble,

938
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:23,250
just enough to walk into the wrong kind of coffee shop

939
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,630
and ask for the wrong kind of drink.

940
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:29,290
Well, it will just, like, you know, in time contraction,

941
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:32,070
I mean, time distension and length contraction

942
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:34,070
as you approach the speed of light,

943
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:37,430
it will make your organs heavy and droop down to the floor.

944
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:39,170
I'm not talking about your...

945
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:41,110
Oh, good, because I was thinking...

946
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:44,190
Yeah, I'm talking about your heart and your liver and stuff starts drooping

947
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:47,570
because it's becoming so dense as you approach the speed of light.

948
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,130
But you haven't approached it yet, so I guess we don't have to worry.

949
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,950
Hey, I have a question that Dr. Sinister might be able to answer.

950
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:58,630
The speed of sound isn't...

951
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:00,590
Now, the speed of light is not relative,

952
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:04,990
but the speed of sound, isn't that relative to where the sound is traveling?

953
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:05,770
Yes, it is.

954
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:10,190
It varies based on the medium through which it's traveling.

955
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:10,590
Right.

956
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,610
Traveling, the speed of sound in the atmosphere is a different speed

957
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:18,010
than the speed of sound in the ocean, say, or on Mars,

958
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,530
which has a very thin atmosphere.

959
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:19,890
Yes.

960
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:22,810
So your Martian sonic moon...

961
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:24,630
It's relative because of the atmosphere.

962
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:25,350
They have found out.

963
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:26,410
The acoustics, yep.

964
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:30,550
But light isn't slowed down by things like...

965
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,050
They have slowed light down.

966
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:33,190
They have?

967
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:33,770
Yeah.

968
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,450
But no one longer becomes light if it's slowed down

969
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:40,110
because the speed of light is not relative.

970
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:41,270
Oh.

971
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:43,070
You know, you can't...

972
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,170
Not in the general world, but it just is, you know?

973
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,710
There was a wonderful science fiction story,

974
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,030
I forget the name of the author,

975
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:53,610
about a material called slow glass,

976
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:57,470
which would slow light down so much that, say,

977
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:59,890
say you left this window of slow glass

978
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:03,090
in front of San Francisco Bay Harbor for 10 years,

979
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:06,030
you could then sell it to somebody in Arizona,

980
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,850
and when they put that in their window,

981
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,510
they'd be looking at the bay in San Francisco

982
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,810
for the next 10 years.

983
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:13,690
Wow.

984
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:17,930
Then finally the light from Arizona would start coming through,

985
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:21,070
and you'd sell the glass to somebody else.

986
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:23,250
That's interesting.

987
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:23,590
That's interesting.

988
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:23,590


989
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:23,850
That's amazing.

990
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:25,550
Well, it was a cool idea.

991
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,850
It was, you know, it was a great idea for a short story.

992
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:30,350
Well, look, radio waves...

993
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:32,110
It's not in Walmart yet.

994
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:33,850
Well, it will be soon.

995
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,530
You can count on that

996
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:37,450
because now they just don't even have publishers.

997
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:40,150
Walmart just buys books that have been rejected and stuff,

998
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:42,610
and they put them in those racks and stuff

999
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,890
for 25 cents or whatever it is.

1000
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,850
But radio waves are the longest,

1001
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:48,250
and they take the longest...

1002
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,250
They're the longest.

1003
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:52,090
Well, that's why the aliens are just now

1004
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,470
starting to hear Hitler's speech.

1005
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:55,210
I thought it was so weird.

1006
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:59,070
The sound and radio waves are both light waves.

1007
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:03,430
All waves on the spectrum are like...

1008
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:04,390
Isn't that weird?

1009
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:06,650
You've been back in college again, haven't you, boy?

1010
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:09,170
No, I've just been smelling under the wrong things.

1011
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:10,170
You know, it's like...

1012
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:11,910
You know where the word milly whiffer...

1013
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:12,950
You know the word milly whiffer?

1014
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,290
You know where that comes from?

1015
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:14,610
No.

1016
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,110
Because on the girls' bike,

1017
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:17,790
it was traditional in France,

1018
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:20,510
it would be like madame, monsieur, and mademoiselle,

1019
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:23,650
and mademoiselle would be abbreviated M-L-L-E.

1020
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,010
And so the damn...

1021
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:25,650
Or the darn...

1022
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:27,470
The English guys, you know,

1023
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:31,470
they see the milly in the kind of youngest girl's bike seat,

1024
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,770
and that meant...

1025
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:41,290
One race, the human race,

1026
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:45,090
has been sniffing bicycle seats

1027
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:47,610
since bicycles were invented.

1028
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:49,470
And before bicycles,

1029
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:49,930
they...

1030
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:51,550
They were sniffing benches

1031
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,890
and rocks and things.

1032
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,350
What if Adolf Hitler would have run on that platform?

1033
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:59,330
Would he have become chancellor much earlier or much later?

1034
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,690
What if Adolf Hitler had sold more paintings?

1035
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,930
Would history have been different?

1036
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,670
You know, there's a coffee table book on your table,

1037
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,650
and there's Der Fuhrer next to this really abstract-looking piece,

1038
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,510
and he's the king of the bohemian guys,

1039
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:13,570
you know,

1040
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:14,530
instead of...

1041
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,290
his world, you know?

1042
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:19,730
Did I already explain...

1043
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:20,630
My movie idea?

1044
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:23,090
Because I did explain it,

1045
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,630
it's probably in production by now,

1046
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:27,870
but it was Harold and Maude and Kumar

1047
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:29,730
go to Nazi Germany.

1048
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:32,110
Only it's not Nazi Germany yet.

1049
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:35,010
They meet Hitler when he's still an art student,

1050
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:36,870
and their idea...

1051
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,290
Their goal is to buy his art

1052
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,850
and go back to the future to sell it,

1053
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,110
because it'd be worth a lot, right?

1054
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:44,290
His little landscape paintings and stuff.

1055
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:45,990
So they go back in time,

1056
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,310
and they meet him,

1057
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:49,050
and they buy some of his art,

1058
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:49,750
and he's so...

1059
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:50,690
pleased by that,

1060
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:51,930
and they hang out with him,

1061
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:52,610
and, you know,

1062
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:54,070
teach him how to pick up girls,

1063
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,830
and, you know,

1064
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,730
smoke pot in Amsterdam and stuff,

1065
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:58,110
and he...

1066
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,490
and he decides not to get into politics,

1067
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:05,150
because he sticks with his art career.

1068
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,670
So all this art they bought from him

1069
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,570
back in the 20th century,

1070
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,590
21st century,

1071
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:10,810
is no longer worth anything.

1072
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:13,410
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

1073
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,070
So then that would mean that...

1074
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:19,490
What's his name on Gilligan's Island?

1075
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,110
Bob Denver.

1076
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,770
He would have been elected president by now.

1077
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:24,650
Ruth Gordon would be the first lady,

1078
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,970
because she played Maude

1079
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:29,470
in Harold and Kumar and Maude.

1080
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:30,830
G. Gordon Gordon did?

1081
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:31,750
No.

1082
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:34,490
G. Gordon Gordon is so old

1083
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:38,070
that he was one of Peter the Great's advisors.

1084
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:39,550
Oh, I thought he was...

1085
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:40,750
He was an Englishman.

1086
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:43,870
He was an Englishman hired by Peter the Great

1087
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:47,990
to teach the Russians how to have a navy

1088
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:49,470
and fight like...

1089
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:49,910
Like Europeans.

1090
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:52,590
And kill them damn Swedes.

1091
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:52,930
Right.

1092
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:53,570
But you had...

1093
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:54,850
And Turks.

1094
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:55,210
And Turks.

1095
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:56,990
Turks were a big problem then.

1096
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:58,570
Yeah, Turks and Swedes.

1097
00:51:58,830 --> 00:51:59,910
In those days,

1098
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:02,910
Turkey was kicking Russia's booty.

1099
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,390
Sweden...

1100
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:05,470
Yeah, Russia was...

1101
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,090
They were in von Munchhausen

1102
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,630
and had to fight back the bloody Turks.

1103
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:11,550
There were so many all over the places of Europe.

1104
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,370
They had almost took over Europe.

1105
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,870
There was a place somewhere that we...

1106
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:16,250
I don't know.

1107
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:17,410
There's...

1108
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:17,650
There's...

1109
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:19,210
There's...

1110
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:19,270
There's...

1111
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:19,430
There's...

1112
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:19,450
There's...

1113
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:19,450


1114
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:19,450


1115
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:19,450


1116
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:19,450


1117
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:19,450


1118
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:19,450


1119
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:19,450


1120
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:19,450


1121
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:19,450


1122
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:19,450


1123
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:20,050
There's...

1124
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:20,050


1125
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:20,050


1126
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:20,050


1127
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:20,050


1128
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,910
I understand is a fun read.

1129
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:26,390
They were debauchers like Henry XII?

1130
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,950
According to my friend Sterno,

1131
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:32,170
who somehow has time to read a lot of history.

1132
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,450
I guess he doesn't read so much sci-fi and pornography.

1133
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,170
He said that there were sultans

1134
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,190
who went insane from pleasure.

1135
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:40,870
Pleasure.

1136
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:43,470
Such was their pleasure

1137
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:46,350
that they went completely insane.

1138
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:48,350
Turkish delight.

1139
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:49,030
Turkish delight.

1140
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,370
You can only imagine the scene somewhere

1141
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,650
in the steamy Istanbul cafe

1142
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,230
as some of these elite meet

1143
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:59,010
wearing funny clothes,

1144
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:01,730
looking like the average person on the street.

1145
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,330
Like beggars, even.

1146
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,290
They sit together,

1147
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:06,770
dream up,

1148
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,410
hatch what they'll do tonight.

1149
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,350
Much like little old Alex

1150
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:13,250
at the Korova milk bar someplace somewhere.

1151
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:14,790
Yeah, yeah.

1152
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:16,730
I was thinking on my way over here,

1153
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,310
I'm all on my Adi Naki.

1154
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:20,430
I'm a big boy now.

1155
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:23,190
I drove here all by myself without Princess Wee.

1156
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:27,350
And I got into the studio all by myself.

1157
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,270
I did almost the whole show.

1158
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:31,550
Now, do you have gallows leg?

1159
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:35,710
That telltale drizzle of urine down your leg,

1160
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:37,190
which means that...

1161
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:38,010
Well, I did earlier.

1162
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:38,750
I got over it.

1163
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:43,010
Well, the people in the room got over it too, I suppose.

1164
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,930
Well, actually, Dr. Sinister left.

1165
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,430
He sat in...

1166
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:50,230
He sat in here for a while.

1167
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:52,910
And then he...

1168
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:57,110
He had a cloth over his nose and he left.

1169
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:00,090
Well, he was going to Juarez

1170
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:02,290
and then down to Dodgetown 3,

1171
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:03,830
just like all the rest of us.

1172
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:05,850
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1173
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,530
Can't repress the muse.

1174
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:10,150
Well, Dave, the time is coming near to an end.

1175
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:13,350
I'm going to put on some music

1176
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,150
to let this all go away eventually.

1177
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:19,350
I know, since your conversion,

1178
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:22,030
you have to put that weird foreskin-shaped thing

1179
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:22,970
on your head now

1180
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:26,030
and say your prayers three times or whatever it is.

1181
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:27,770
Well, I've been under pressure, man.

1182
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,030
Well, I guess that's no reason just to jump ship

1183
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:31,950
and start to get into another religion

1184
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:33,590
while you're the E-popped of one.

1185
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:34,630
No, that's...

1186
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,230
Pop is the E-pop.

1187
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:38,490
J.R. Bob Dobbs is...

1188
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:40,890
I mean, the head scriber or whatever.

1189
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:41,830
Yeah, sacred scribe, sacred scribe.

1190
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:45,990
The sacred head scribe, the sacred scribe.

1191
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,550
And when I die, there'll be another one,

1192
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,430
and he'll be sacred scribe.

1193
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:50,830
I'm number 274,

1194
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:54,530
but he'll also be named Reverend Ivan Stang.

1195
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:59,910
So there will always be a Stang of some kind

1196
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:03,130
to, you know, to be Bob's little whipping boy,

1197
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:04,850
to be the flat catcher.

1198
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:06,310
Everybody in the hood knows

1199
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,390
there's always going to be some Stang going on

1200
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:09,710
somewhere sometime, sometime.

1201
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:10,170
That's right.

1202
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:11,930
You got to make a Stang.

1203
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,110
I looked in the...

1204
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:16,890
One of the urban dictionaries I read

1205
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,970
didn't even have that phrase as a...

1206
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:21,210
as a slang term.

1207
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:22,410
Well, I think you're reading

1208
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,590
the herbal dictionary upside down

1209
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:25,530
is what you were doing.

1210
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:26,490
Oh, yeah, it could be.

1211
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:27,910
Probably is,

1212
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:30,670
at least when you take the bus recently

1213
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:33,070
since the car is in the car shop.

1214
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,650
Now, in old England and old Europe,

1215
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,410
there was a custom called riding the Stang,

1216
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:40,910
which is what they would make you do

1217
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:43,850
if you were dumb enough to get caught adulterizing

1218
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,810
and bragging about it,

1219
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:48,590
where they would put you on a sort of a wooden log

1220
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:49,330
that was...

1221
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:50,710
Just represented a horse.

1222
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,530
A fool killer, so to speak.

1223
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:53,070
Yeah, exactly.

1224
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,170
But it was actually called the Stang.

1225
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,510
It was called riding the Stang.

1226
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:58,410
If you were a fool who got caught

1227
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:03,310
for messing around with somebody else's property,

1228
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:05,130
or wife, I mean.

1229
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:06,470
Caught with your pants down.

1230
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,790
Yeah, caught with your pants down,

1231
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:09,590
and you had to put on the funny hat

1232
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:10,650
and ride the Stang,

1233
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,310
and everybody would look at you

1234
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:14,170
and throw funny things at you,

1235
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,830
and that's how I got my name.

1236
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:18,170
Well, that is a good way to get it.

1237
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,210
But I was...

1238
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:20,390
I thought it was so much better

1239
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:22,570
if you were caught performing adulterous acts

1240
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:25,530
that you wore the stuff or not,

1241
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:26,650
if you didn't get caught,

1242
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:29,050
and then you got to wear the hat and everything anyway.

1243
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:30,430
Now, see, I thought it was funnier

1244
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,210
if you got caught doing adulterous acts.

1245
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,510
But really, now,

1246
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:37,850
was there anything else we had to cover?

1247
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,810
X Day is coming July 5th.

1248
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:43,310
That's one reason I came in to do...

1249
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:44,590
bothered to come in and do a show.

1250
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,690
I have to crank out a bunch of shows ahead of time.

1251
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:48,990
Yeah, I did, actually, at the beginning.

1252
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:50,770
In fact, I played your song,

1253
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:53,910
the subgenius anthem.

1254
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,910
And, in fact, I played the very worst version of it

1255
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:57,450
that we have.

1256
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:59,790
Oh, then you always do this to hurt me so.

1257
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:00,950
Yeah, and we played...

1258
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,730
And I sang along with it just like I did.

1259
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:04,450
That's what made it the worst version.

1260
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:04,850


1261
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:07,670
Yeah, so I, like, doubled it up extra bad.

1262
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:11,390
But we even had a little X Day ad

1263
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:15,770
that I had to flip the price in

1264
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:18,970
so that it didn't appear to be urging it.

1265
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:19,710
I didn't want anyone to do anything.

1266
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:23,510
Actually, we urged non-subgeniuses to avoid X Day.

1267
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:26,370
You're not even allowed in unless you're a dues-paying member.

1268
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,150
So you have to buy a membership just to get in.

1269
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:29,690
Yep.

1270
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:33,170
And then you have to pay the entrance fee.

1271
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:34,230
Which is...

1272
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,510
Yeah, and then you have to take the initiation.

1273
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:38,850
Then you have to take the cure.

1274
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:41,890
And then you have to take the refestation.

1275
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,910
And then you have to get your prescriptions refilled

1276
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,830
because of all the infections you got.

1277
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:48,370
Then you have to be relocated

1278
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:48,970
because the infections...

1279
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:50,350
The infections won't really go away.

1280
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,110
They'll just be abated by the prescriptions.

1281
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:56,690
And on that note, that note from the doctor,

1282
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:59,990
we must cut to this music,

1283
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,590
which is by Bleepo.

1284
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:03,550
Bleepo.

1285
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:03,970
Bleepo.

1286
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:06,310
Bleepo.

1287
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:07,530
Okay, okay.

1288
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:08,010
I'm going to cut.

1289
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:08,570
Turn that off.

1290
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,290
Dave, thank you.

1291
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:11,030
You certainly know how to cut.

1292
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:11,550
All right.

1293
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:12,370
Thank you.

1294
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:12,990
Okay.

1295
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:15,070
I'm going to fade you out slowly now.

1296
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:17,530
Okay, well, I just hope that everything goes well.

1297
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:18,510
On the way home.

1298
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:19,390
Good to see you.

1299
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:19,790
Thanks a lot.

1300
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:20,590
Have a good weekend.

1301
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:24,750
On and off the road to Bob

1302
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:30,750
We are marching forward blind

1303
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:36,650
He has gouged out both our eyes

1304
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:41,890
And he's laughing close behind

1305
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:48,030
He will sell us back our eyes

1306
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:53,890
When we join his noble plan

1307
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:57,730
For just 1995

1308
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:05,610
And a take of our one grand

1309
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:13,950
On and off the road with Bob

1310
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:18,510
He has headed us

1311
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:19,830
The wheel

1312
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:25,470
And he cuddles up with Bob

1313
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:31,590
As he calls himself a beetle

1314
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:37,310
Our eyes are on the road

1315
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:42,870
But Bob forgot to say

1316
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:48,570
That the steering wheel went by

1317
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:50,050
And he's lost

1318
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:54,570
The road carries us away

1319
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,270
Thank you, Bleepo.

1320
00:59:59,470 --> 00:59:59,930
And now...

1321
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,750
On and off the road for Bob

1322
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:09,010
We forgot why we came here

1323
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:14,650
We have quit all of our jobs

1324
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:17,990
Like a headlight

1325
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:18,970
Like a headlight

1326
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,350
Like a keyboards

1327
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:48,450
So quiet

1328
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:48,970


1329
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:48,970


1330
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,290
That hurt, Bob.

1331
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,530
Bob, where are you?

1332
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:54,450
Stop it, Bob.

1333
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:54,990
Please.
