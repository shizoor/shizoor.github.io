1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Oh, that was a laid-back show.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,360
Oh, it's not laid-back anymore!

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,680
Look out!

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:08,660
Whoa!

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,880
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,160
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,020
which reaches from the inner mind to...

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,240
The Subgenius Hour of Swag!

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,180
Welcome, potential initiates,

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,140
and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,960
Oh, yes, dear friends, this is your host and prayer partner,

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,280
Reverend Ivan Stang,

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,460
and tomorrow will be my 60th birthday.

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:59,540
And I don't feel like editing hours of X-Day Slack.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,660
Today.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,260
So, in order to slack off, I'm going to play a golden oldie.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,720
In this case, it's Hour of Slack number 61,

18
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,320
which would make it from around the middle of...

19
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,540
or late 1986, this would be.

20
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,740
Yeah, believe it or not, 1986.

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,620
And this old cassette has a star on it,

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,900
meaning that I consider...

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,680
I considered it to be a good show back in the day.

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,940
So, let's listen and see how things have or have not improved.

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,120
Praise Bob.

26
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:48,760
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,420
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

28
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,640
The Subgenius Hour of Slack

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,980
that you are about to...

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,460
to listen to

31
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,060
is specially designed

32
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,780
only to be played

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,460
on radio station...

34
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,000
and only in the city of...

35
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:09,580


36
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,180
...

37
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,440
...

38
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,220
...

39
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,180
...

40
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,720
Welcome, dear friends,

41
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,000
to the Subgenius...

42
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:29,900
...

43
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:29,980
...

44
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


45
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


46
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


47
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


48
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


49
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


50
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


51
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


52
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


53
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


54
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


55
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


56
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


57
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,820
...Hour of Slack.

59
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,320
...Hour of Slack.

60
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,220
...Hour of Slack.

61
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,220


62
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,960
Back up to the grassy knoll again

63
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,480
and started hitting back down.

64
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,840
I left that group of wacky xenos

65
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,000
and the gazebo

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,420
and the sodbusters museum

67
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,920
and that wing-ding nut-blanger

68
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,620
on the accordion.

69
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,600
Well, I just didn't know what to think, you know.

70
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,080
Coming up here,

71
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,600
hanging around with the grass and the trees,

72
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,720
it's just natural.

73
00:02:59,740 --> 00:02:59,980
It's just natural.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,400
But these people were talking different

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,460
and I don't know.

76
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,520
I'm just interested in sitting around

77
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,720
and picking my nose

78
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,620
and spitting and stuff like that.

79
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,960
Well, it just made me think an awful lot.

80
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,120
Golly, my head got big

81
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,880
and, well, I never knew I had so many ideas.

82
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,680
I began to think about writing them down

83
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,920
or taking some pictures

84
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,400
or...

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,060
getting a tape recorder

86
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,640
or something and them things,

87
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,580
but I know I didn't want to mess with them.

88
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,880
I just wanted to be natural, you know,

89
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,620
sitting out here with the old rocks

90
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,320
and watching the clouds roll by.

91
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,360
But that...

92
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,160
that old stranger with the accordion,

93
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,040
why, he made me feel a little different.

94
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,620
I...

95
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,820
I kind of got excited

96
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,380
and...

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,500
well, I liked it a little bit.

98
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,220
It never happened like that before.

99
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,560
Suddenly, I began to reflect on my whole life,

100
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,280
why it was like a rock

101
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,000
or...

102
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,840
or a polka.

103
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,300
No, my life wasn't like a polka,

104
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,160
but here it was again

105
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,620
and, God Almighty,

106
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,340
hiya, mister!

107
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,760
How are you, little fella?

108
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,980
Well, I'm a miserable man.

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,180
Ah!

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,760
I'm a miserable man!

111
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,540
I'm a miserable man!

112
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,740
Uh, the only cult they want to talk about

113
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,140
is the Subgenius Foundation,

114
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,180
the Church of the Subgenius,

115
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,800
and...

116
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,740
Dad, Doug Smith says we're different.

117
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,460
Doug's right, Virgil.

118
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,200
We are different,

119
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,540
thanks to Jesus,

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,120
the Genetic Engineering Corporation of American States.

121
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,200
Mommy, too?

122
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,940
Yep, the whole family.

123
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,780
Is everybody like us?

124
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,160
No, son, but we're working on it.

125
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,980
Round the clock!

126
00:04:59,980 --> 00:04:59,980


127
00:04:59,980 --> 00:04:59,980


128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:29,960
Round the clock!

129
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,660
Let me slobber on your neck.

130
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,700
Let me drool down your chest.

131
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,780
I'm not prejudiced.

132
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't care if he's a Jew, a black, Italian, Chinese.

133
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,780
If he messes with me, I'll shoot him.

134
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,780
He's got complete equality as he drops to the ground.

135
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,660
The helicopter which plucked the reentry capsule out of the water.

136
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:07,680
It moved up, took off at fantastic speed at the at least 45 degrees angle

137
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,580
and they just disappeared between the stars.

138
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:16,480
During the debriefing, which we always said after each combat mission,

139
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,900
the officer who was receiving this made a joke of it, how many beer I had.

140
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,300
How many beer he had, dear friends.

141
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,460
Ah, yes.

142
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,500
Quiet down, you little creatures of the night.

143
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,840
We've got a show to do.

144
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,140
Hey, Zaphod.

145
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,380
Our theory about Reverend Ann Leonard was just shot to hell the other night.

146
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,900
Friends, I feel sorry for those of you who couldn't make it

147
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,640
to the end of the show.

148
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,280
I'm sorry for the subgenius meeting and for the people who didn't dare to come

149
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,300
and see the reflection of themselves.

150
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,180
But it was very interesting the way that turned out.

151
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,240
You know, we announced last week that there was going to be a meeting for people

152
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,780
who wanted to volunteer to help with KNON and the Church of the Subgenius specifically.

153
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,580
And we got like 30 people called Reverend Cecilia and asked directions

154
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,620
and said they were going to come.

155
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,120
And so forth.

156
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,940
But only half showed up.

157
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,420
And the mighty Reverend Cecilia, who now, dear friends, is Popess,

158
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,080
the Pope or Popestress of Dallas, Popess Cecilia,

159
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,160
bowed down to her, ye unworthy, unclean ones.

160
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,100
For she is truly worthy.

161
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,800
She allowed us to have this meeting at her house,

162
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,660
a meeting of subgeniuses who had never, in many cases,

163
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,480
had never laid eyes on another admitted, quote,

164
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,060
subgenius, unquote, before in their lives.

165
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,480
But it turned out quite interesting.

166
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,020
There was no real bobbies.

167
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,820
It was real nice.

168
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,420
It was all folks that I think could give us a real hand.

169
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,760
And I haven't managed to sit down and plot it all out on the big computer yet.

170
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,200
But, oh, yes, we'll have places for you all in Dobbs Town, dear friends.

171
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,680
Don't worry about that.

172
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,640
All of ye chosen who showed up.

173
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,180
It was just, the meeting was just what you'd expect.

174
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,120
It was at a seedy,

175
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,120
S&M bar in Oak Cliff full of demon worshippers.

176
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,540
And, see, you missed out on it.

177
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,160
Missed out on it.

178
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,560
Oh, and there was one young subgenius there,

179
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,520
gave me a Christmas, a wonderful Christmas present,

180
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,860
a sign, professionally made sign that said,

181
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,120
Bulldada Time Control Laboratories is subsidiary of the Church of the Subgenius,

182
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,460
the Subgenius Foundation, Incorporated.

183
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,400
And that was wonderful.

184
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,020
But, you know,

185
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,500
when I put,

186
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,320
that sign up,

187
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,320
they'll know where the subgenius castle is on Swiss Avenue.

188
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,940
That guy, now, see, that guy, he was obviously CIA.

189
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,660
You can't fool Reverend Stan.

190
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,720
That was CIA.

191
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,320
But he was also a subgenius.

192
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,860
So, it's okay if the CIA knows where we are.

193
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,900
But there's many of you out there who are thinking,

194
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,940
what's he doing in the jungle?

195
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,760
I thought this was a church.

196
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,700
And on top of that, how come,

197
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,540
how come he's talking about this church and the subgenius?

198
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,980
What is that?

199
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,960
They say,

200
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,120
what are you?

201
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,240
What are you?

202
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,340
They chant, wanting to know just what it is we're talking about.

203
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:39,180
And every 10 or 12 shows, I play this lovely tape.

204
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,260
Three, two, and one.

205
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,460
Now to continue with the tape recording.

206
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,000
Superior mutants, repent.

207
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,800
Quit your job.

208
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,500
Slack.

209
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,500
Off.

210
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,300
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

211
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,660
Well, no, probably not.

212
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,620
But whatever you do, just keep listening.

213
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,300
Are we controlled by secret forces?

214
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,820
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

215
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,360
Do people think you're strange?

216
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:18,900
Do you?

217
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,680
Then you may be on the right track.

218
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,360
Are you?

219
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,480
You're abnormal.

220
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,660
Then you are probably better than most people.

221
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,820
Yes, your kind shall triumph.

222
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,460
Now at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

223
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,660
This is it.

224
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,500
The only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

225
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,220
Having all the guilt, but none of the sex.

226
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,880
Having intercourse with a beautiful live girl,

227
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,700
or damn near it.

228
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,080
Anything else.

229
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,660
But you tried everything.

230
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,760
You ain't seen nothing yet.

231
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,580
Learn to think big.

232
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,780
Develop the tricks of length extension.

233
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:11,040
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

234
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,140
Stand erect for your own abnormality.

235
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,780
Mom is a way of life to millions.

236
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,420
Yet half of them don't even know it.

237
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,960
He's the one true living Slack.

238
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:30,780
Slack Master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

239
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,720
He is the one real shortcut to Slack.

240
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,680
Now, see another dimension on your TV.

241
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,300
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

242
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,260
Become physically attractive overnight.

243
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,240
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blood.

244
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,080
And growing up.

245
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,080
Ah.

246
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,400
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

247
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,740
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

248
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,680
And coming right back.

249
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,980
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

250
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:20,400
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

251
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,480
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.

252
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,040
And channel them into an illusion of creativity.

253
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,020
That will fool normals and get you sex.

254
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,120
I don't believe you, J.R.

255
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,720
Well, I did benefit from it, of course.

256
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,860
But so did a whole bunch of old Dallas boys.

257
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,860
In other words, you want to know, you want the government to know that you're in there to make money.

258
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,920
And to pay taxes.

259
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,640
Well, we're already treading a pretty thin line, Bill.

260
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,460
And I'm sure there's plenty of other things they'd love to get us for.

261
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,900
Just be, you know, well, I don't know whether we want to talk about the conspiracy on the air, but...

262
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,780
Oh, yeah, go right ahead.

263
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,680
This is the conspiracy, the one, the conspiracy behind the conspiracy.

264
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,420
Ah, the conspiracy to end all conspiracies, maybe.

265
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:15,660
Right.

266
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,840
Well, part of the church's goal is to wake people up to the fact that, you know,

267
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:26,220
that our lives are being controlled by forces that most people are completely ignorant of.

268
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,680
Well, okay, this light, as we were looking at it, both of us were watching the light,

269
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,640
and we found anything just in, you know, in a split second.

270
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:42,360
It was suddenly this two-story, I'd say the diameter around thing, the height of this room.

271
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,640
Wow.

272
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,520
You mean it was like a little bobbing?

273
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,660
Well, it wasn't bobbing as steady as this table if it were carried on a caterpillar.

274
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,540
It was that steady.

275
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,360
And walking speed.

276
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,660
And with that, the speed never changed.

277
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,680
It just suddenly got that...

278
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,740
It just suddenly was huge.

279
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,040
Yeah.

280
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:06,620
It gets really complex when you get into conspiracies, and we believe...

281
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,620
.

282
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,260
.

283
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,260


284
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,540
.

285
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:09,860
.

286
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,240
.

287
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:11,860
.

288
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,780
.

289
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,380
.

290
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:15,500
.

291
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:15,860
.

292
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,180


293
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,200
.

294
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,600
.

295
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:18,620
.

296
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,740
.

297
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:30,600
Ah, yes dear friends, ha-ha, have you two not gotten enough slack on the ropes of life?

298
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:39,160
This is Doctor Philodrumon speaking to you from on the road way out there.

299
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,840
Well, did I get anything, they just saw me?

300
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:39,840


301
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,180
Somewhere where you nor your friends can even perceive.

302
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,560
Ha ha! Yes, dear friends.

303
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,840
We're out here, you're out there, and we're thinking about you out there.

304
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,440
And about all the wonderful things that can be found when you find Bob.

305
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,060
I'm talking to you tonight about the Holy God!

306
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,520
The one and only Bob!

307
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,660
The one and only Bob!

308
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,160
The church of the subgenius!

309
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,600
The subgenius!

310
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,820
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

311
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,200
Can I get a witness?

312
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,340
Can I get a witness?

313
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,500
Can I get a praise Bob?

314
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,800
Can I get a praise Bob?

315
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,020
Can I get an amen?

316
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,320
Can I get an amen?

317
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,200
Thank you children, thank you!

318
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,320
Thank you children, thank you!

319
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,320
Some of you may not be familiar with the church of the subgenius.

320
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,460
Some of you may not know the ha Gore of the church of the subgenius.

321
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,560
No, you may not know the purpose of the church.

322
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,660
The purpose of the church.

323
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,920
The purpose of the church.

324
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,040
The purpose of the church.

325
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,580
What is the purpose of the church?

326
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,680
What is the purpose of the church?

327
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,800
The purpose of the church is to have what?

328
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,020
Slack!

329
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,520
Can I hear that again?

330
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,060
I need more slack!

331
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,460
Can I get some slack?

332
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,780
Can I get some slack?

333
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,660
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

334
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,480
World Without Slack, Chapter 3.

335
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,120
By Lies.

336
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,640
The fightin' Jesus looked out over the bridge of the Exist Battle Saucer, Blood of Christ.

337
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,460
He looked and laughed.

338
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,580
He laughed and looked.

339
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,520
He looked and looked.

340
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,740
He laughed and laughed.

341
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:30,840
He was finally going to have his revenge on the natives of Dust Moat 89 AB.

342
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,560
Aboard Jesus' flagship, dozens of killer theologians, the shock priests,

343
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,580
were busy at their work.

344
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,140
They were in the weapons terminals.

345
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,320
On the power decks, the proper orgone cycles were being timed by mass fornications between

346
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,080
the ritual crew and the cancer beings from Theta Z.

347
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,720
An invasion-ready state existed in the ship and the 900 others floating over the doomed

348
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,680
planet, Earth.

349
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,100
Jesus was in a psychopathically elated state.

350
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,680
His face resembled many of the perverse icons the humanoids of the Dust Moat painted of

351
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:04,860
him.

352
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,460
They prayed to these for the salvation of their souls.

353
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:08,580
They prayed to these for the salvation of their souls.

354
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,620
As if they had any souls to save.

355
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,640
As if anyone would want to save them, which they didn't.

356
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,940
A whole disgusting religion now centered around his murder.

357
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,260
They had to gall to nail him up like a common criminal and then paint pictures of him enjoying

358
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,600
it.

359
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,320
And they thought he loved them for it, that he was forgiving.

360
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,500
Oh, the anticipation.

361
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,040
He was sick to his stomach with glee.

362
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,400
He would show them the true face of pain and sin.

363
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,560
It had taken him two thousand miles to get to the bottom of the abyss.

364
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:38,560


365
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:38,560


366
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:38,560


367
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:38,560


368
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:38,560


369
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:38,560


370
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:38,560


371
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:38,560


372
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,720
It had taken him long years to return here, and now he would pay them back for the scars

373
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,600
he still carried in his hands.

374
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,500
Sweet stigmata.

375
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,920
Even the slightest thought of the scars made them glow red through his fists, through the

376
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,800
boxing gloves.

377
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,300
The hold of the spacecraft was manned with angels of light personally lent by Jehovah

378
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:02,680
One.

379
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,900
They supervised the demon teams operating on all tangible destruction.

380
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,540
So, the whole of the spacecraft was manned with angels of light personally lent by Jehovah One. They supervised the demon teams operating on all tangible destruction.

381
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,820
So, the whole of the spacecraft was manned with angels of light personally lent by Jehovah One.

382
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:09,820


383
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,700
They were all in attack mode.

384
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,800
Nagas, Orzuma, Shiva, Horus, Aeons, the dark bodies.

385
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,640
And at, at time and a half too.

386
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,060
It was expensive to ravage a planet.

387
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,220
No matter.

388
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,200
The host of judgement.

389
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,880
That which comes had finally arrived.

390
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,660
And on Jesus' birthday.

391
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,540
The Lord of the Rings.

392
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,100
What do you think, Dad?

393
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,860
His second in command, Jim Jones, stood by with the final attack coordinate, Codices.

394
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,360
A holographic map of Earth rotated slowly next to Jones in midair.

395
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,860
On its surface, grids of the natives' planetary defenses were lit up in green.

396
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,480
Ones, some depicting their pathetic communication structures in violet.

397
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,920
All in scale.

398
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,960
Quite pretty, actually.

399
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,840
A colorful net surrounded the sphere.

400
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,160
It would soon enough be dark.

401
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,660
These children wait for us below, Jesus.

402
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,640
We will walk among them and we will smile.

403
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,100
At your moment of choice, of course.

404
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:25,540
Jesus studied Jones' puffy, tired face in the pink glow of the neuron banks that ran around the walls of the mighty dreadnought and shuddered.

405
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,320
He was no stranger to resurrection of the undead.

406
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,840
But whoever had brought Jones around again had slipped up.

407
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,540
Something was missing.

408
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,700
Something else was added.

409
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,800
Something.

410
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,520
Jones had been waiting.

411
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:44,160
Something had been forced on him by the Djinn bankers who had financed this angelic war fleet.

412
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:44,920
Damn them.

413
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,280
He never forgot the price they had demanded for this mercenary raiding fleet.

414
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,620
He heard them.

415
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,840
Jones' constant reminders of their influence and expectations irritated Jesus no end.

416
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,840
Not to mention the annoying habit Jones had copied from Dobbs.

417
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:07,560
The twisted creature insisted on smoking a pipe, even here near the sensitive nerve relays.

418
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,920
Jones might have been left dead a little too long.

419
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,320
He moved with a constant jerk and always poked at his throat.

420
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:22,700
He never removed his sunglasses and he still took massive injections of methamphetamines even though they no longer had any effect on his regenerated shell.

421
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,660
You know, Jimbo, said Jesus, the best part is that they think there's an afterlife.

422
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,080
That's why they strung me up the first time.

423
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,640
They think like bugs down there.

424
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,540
I'm well aware of that, Commander.

425
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:46,560
It bothered Jones to be back on Earth so soon after his failure with the social programming research post he had been running there.

426
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,280
It wasn't really his fault.

427
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,600
The administration change at Central merely cut off the funding for it.

428
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,500
He was forced to abort the experiment.

429
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,280
There is a great deal of speculation about what is going to happen next.

430
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,040
Are you ready now?

431
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,760
The lights have gone down just slightly.

432
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,860
The Mr. Science Lecture Series.

433
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,620
Volume 1, Number 1.

434
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,140
The Mutron.

435
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,260
Delivered by the Reverend Seth Deitch, First Church of Mr. Science, Boston.

436
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,640
The Mutron.

437
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,400
The Mutron.

438
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,620
Outside the realm of conspiracy science and in the clear movement of the world,

439
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:35,620


440
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,380
in light of the so-called forbidden sciences,

441
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,340
we will find we have a far greater chance of understanding the true nature of the universe.

442
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:49,980
What the conspiracy feeds us under the guise of the most advanced system of natural philosophy

443
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,340
is nothing but a complex sham,

444
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,280
a decoy to hide from us the true fact of how much bigger and more complex

445
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,940
and nut-wrenchingly frightening a place the universe really is.

446
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,600
We are told about matter and energy and space and time,

447
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,320
as being either consistent realities governed by laws,

448
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,440
or as foggy abstracts that have no particular being outside of that of being

449
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,680
convenient linguistic aids to make the whole thing easier to swallow.

450
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,780
We at the Temporal Management Research Facility of the Church of Mr. Science of the Subgenius

451
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:30,280
have through rigorous probing through mountains of existing and well-known works on the subject of time

452
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,620
and its methods of control,

453
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,580
have discovered the key for blowing the whistle on the whole fraudulent world.

454
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:35,580


455
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,180
The fraudulent twaddle that is modern science.

456
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,160
This key is the Mutron.

457
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,400
The truth must now be told.

458
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,280
How it was covered up for so long would make a story intriguing enough for a separate book,

459
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,480
but it's too involved to be told here.

460
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,060
The actual issue at hand is the Mutron and its pivotal role in the management of the true cosmos.

461
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,460
In order to properly understand the following,

462
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,380
it must first be made clear what actually constitutes an elementary particle.

463
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,560
The first of these basics is the fact that the Mutron is a particle.

464
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,840
The first of these basic particles is the electron,

465
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,980
which has no mass but possesses a charge that is commonly described as possibly infinite,

466
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,680
thus making it the fundamental unit of energy.

467
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,900
It and other related particles, i.e. positrons, photons, gravitons, etc.,

468
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,140
acting in concert make up the Iacotismic field,

469
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,380
which is responsible for holding everything that is anything together.

470
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,700
The second is the much rarer infinite mass particle,

471
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,600
commonly called a black hole.

472
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,420
These particles, like the electrons, occupy no space,

473
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,620
but the influence of a single particle can be felt at a much greater distance.

474
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,060
They often have event horizons many miles wide,

475
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,440
beyond which not even light can escape.

476
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,960
The third fundamental particle is the Mutron.

477
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,800
The Mutron carries with it an infinite temporal capacity

478
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,060
that makes it alter the rate and intensity and general quality

479
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,160
of the passage through time of anything it touches.

480
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,220
The Mutron is very likely the rarest particle in this universe.

481
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,860
As far as we know, there might well be only one of them,

482
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,840
though there could be as many as a few dozen

483
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,240
without generating a dangerous concentration of Mutron phenomena.

484
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,100
The first segment of this report will deal with the general implications of the Mutron

485
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,240
in regards to existing ideas on the workings of the universe.

486
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,880
The second will concern the incredible potentialities

487
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,460
of using the potent forces of the Mutron in time control research

488
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,300
and in practical time control.

489
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
Section A.

490
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,340
Just how fucking big everything really is.

491
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,160
What we know as the universe can be envisioned as a giant atom

492
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,260
with the black hole acting as the nucleus

493
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,700
and the Mutron or Mutrons acting as the electron cloud,

494
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,900
with the electrons providing the energy for the Mutron

495
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,580
to drive us forward through time.

496
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,640
Just about everything else in the universe is just so much debris,

497
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,340
cluttering up the works of things.

498
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,700
The fact that there is one such atom

499
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,140
more than suggests the existence of others.

500
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,020
The Mutron has a corresponding antiparticle known as the tachyon,

501
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,840
which travels through time in a direction which we perceive as backwards,

502
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,340
so that to someone who is not in the know

503
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,300
it will appear to exceed the speed of light.

504
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,380
The simple fact of the matter is that tachyons are extra-universal mutrons

505
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,300
impinging on our universe at a different temporal angle.

506
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:35,260
These are the mutrons of atom universes that ours is in compound with.

507
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,080
After this the atomic metaphor breaks down.

508
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,520
A six million year cycle will end in 1998.

509
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,440
Dobbs sees the world entering a new aeon

510
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,280
which in a few years

511
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,260
will bring more wondrous and miraculous change

512
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,800
and carnage, insanity and destruction

513
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,320
than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.

514
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,020
Bob brings a new destiny for America.

515
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,240
A time of cataclysmic economic change

516
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,740
that will offer untold riches and power to those in the know,

517
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:25,240
while billions of deserving conspiracy dupes

518
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,980
fry in hell on earth.

519
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,660
Controlled thinking, controlled by Bob,

520
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,920
will usher in a spiritual rebirth

521
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,320
and a cascade of astounding mysteries,

522
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,660
supernatural bridges,

523
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,460
and a restoration of lost psychic abilities

524
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:51,160
to totally transform the lives of those who dare to seek them and pay for them.

525
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,880
That's right, you're lucky to live in the end time.

526
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,460
Here's my money, Bob!

527
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,800
Wise up!

528
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,760
That's right, dear friends, wise up.

529
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,980
And I must apologize there for the choice of language used at one point

530
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,480
by Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger there with the Church of Mr. Science.

531
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:24,960
I'm sorry.

532
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,560
He cut in on our normal broadcasting spectrum wavelength here

533
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,300
and inserted that into our show,

534
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,280
that it was not an official part of the Subgenius show.

535
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,040
You did not hear that.

536
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:45,600
It does not exist technically as part of the tapes that I chose to play.

537
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,380
I just want you to know that, dear friends.

538
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,580
That's pretty important around here.

539
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,960
And I'll probably...

540
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,160
get in loads of serious trouble.

541
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,060
Uh...

542
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,180
What have...

543
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,760
Whoa!

544
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,620
Thanks to St. Byron Werner for that incredible piece of music.

545
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,460
Yeah, and thanks to Reverend Bleepo Abernathy for recording

546
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,420
the barrage that we were hearing for a...

547
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,140
a lot of the stuff that we've heard tonight, actually.

548
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,520
Yeah!

549
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,300
And thanks to the people who have been with us for the last...

550
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,300


551
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,300


552
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,300


553
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,300


554
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,300


555
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,300


556
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,300


557
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:26,720
to get you...

558
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,920
the difference from being silenced by a global conspiracy.

559
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,800
Weird men arise!

560
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,960
Find out who they are and how to smash them.

561
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,520
You probably already knew that the U.S. Government is a sham,

562
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,220
something propped up there for you to blame.

563
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,460
But did you know that the real powers that be are not even people?

564
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,840
That they are actually shambling?

565
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,760
Unbelievable, unmentionable, un-

566
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:54,940
What are you talking about?

567
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:54,940


568
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:54,940


569
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,120
Unthinkable things?

570
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:57,980
Yes!

571
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,940
Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet!

572
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,280
Defy the sinister star forces which mock us all.

573
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,740
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity for thousands of years.

574
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,760
God has been misquoted all this time.

575
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,300
His actual words may disturb you,

576
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,920
but Bob Dobbs is a bulwark.

577
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:24,920


578
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:24,920


579
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:29,420
Against the unbearable fear and anxiety tormenting mankind.

580
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,260
There's no prob with Bob.

581
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,340
I don't know who he's with or what the deal is,

582
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,860
but I know that if I stay close to Bob,

583
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,320
I'll be safe in those Gleaguers in Arkansas.

584
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,600
I know those creatures can't get a hold of me if I just

585
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,680
hang around the Foundation.

586
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,560
And do what they say and, you know,

587
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,720
clean up after them a little bit.

588
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,420
I don't mind doing that kind of work if it's for a good cause.

589
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,740
I know that Bob,

590
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,840
I know that Bob is a good cause.

591
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,600
Bob took me inside his heart.

592
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,580
And I accepted him into my life.

593
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,300
And I'm here to testify, friends,

594
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,840
what that man has done for me,

595
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,960
if you can really call him a man.

596
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,900
Many people say he's almost like a god.

597
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,020
I don't think so.

598
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,540
Of course, I don't know Bob,

599
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,780
but I do know Bob in certain ways.

600
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,420
And I think you understand what I'm talking about.

601
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:51,100
Yes, Bob, he filled me with the sort of the spirit I never knew I had.

602
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,700
And I knew it wasn't coming from him.

603
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,780
It was coming from inside me.

604
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,620
Bob was giving it to me.

605
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,220
He was laying hands on me from afar.

606
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,360
He might have been up in that great big jet plane,

607
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,920
or he might have been down on Skid Row

608
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,720
giving some bum a haircut.

609
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,620
But all I know is it was Bob.

610
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,180
It was Bob.

611
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,640
Bob.

612
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,700
Yeah, he's smiling.

613
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,000
You never see Bob frown.

614
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,780
You know that behind that amazing smile

615
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,840
there lies a mind like a steel trap.

616
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,320
I'm sure he makes mistakes like

617
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,080
what he did with those young women that time.

618
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,200
But I think the newspapers exaggerated that.

619
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,100
I know that Bob will do all of us fine

620
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,140
in the long run.

621
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,740
In fact, I think I know that we really need Bob

622
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,140
in our lives.

623
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,140
In our lives.

624
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,600
In 1981.

625
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,840
And in 1984.

626
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,800
Hi, little brother.

627
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,280
And in 1991.

628
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,340
And in 1995.

629
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,960
When they bring the conspiracy to its heels.

630
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,420
And in that wondrous year that we know

631
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,900
is going to come all too soon upon us.

632
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,040
And we'll leave our earthly things behind

633
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,200
and we'll go and join the exes

634
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,440
from God only knows what strange planet

635
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,760
they come from, if they really even come

636
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,420
from a planet at all and not some energy star

637
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,640
beaming away in the darkness.

638
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,740
Lighten our lives with the technology

639
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,460
and the spirituality and the mentality

640
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,680
of Planet X.

641
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,200
Planet X coming down to take care of us subgeniuses

642
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,960
and see that there's a place for us in the world

643
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,300
and give us our rightful seat at the right hand of Bob

644
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,960
or the left hand of Bob, depending on whether we're

645
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,840
rewardians or mediocrities.

646
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,660
But I don't want to get lost in the dogma.

647
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,760
I want to tell you something that blesses my heart.

648
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,700
And it's Bob.

649
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,160
Bob.

650
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,020
Bob.

651
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,400
Bob.

652
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,180
Yeah, I can hear him.

653
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,480
I can hear him talking off there in the distance

654
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,720
saying, come to me Tommy.

655
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,720
Come to me and lay down your material things

656
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,940
because you know they are going to mean much to you

657
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,540
after that divine year.

658
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:43,980
And after I lay my hand on you and lead you up the steps

659
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,920
of that magnificent craft.

660
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,040
And we'll board it and go to the stars.

661
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,200
That's right Tommy.

662
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,940
We'll go to the stars.

663
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,820
You and me.

664
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,200
That's what Bob said.

665
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,620
Bob said that to me.

666
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,060
Tighten these cranial sutures down.

667
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,060
See the patient suffered from a...

668
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:22,040
Subdural hematoma which had suffused the dura and pia matter of the brain.

669
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,180
You see now this is in a dark discolored elongate mass which...

670
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,140
Uh oh.

671
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,320
He's crumpling...

672
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,780
He sent those body parts in from Oklahoma soon.

673
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,700
Running out of fingers.

674
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,320
Yes, well we tried to mail them but the mail was disgruntled that day.

675
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,200
Grunt.

676
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,640
Yes.

677
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,860
What a sickening operation this is.

678
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,780
It's strange.

679
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,180
This is what the Indians can do to a guy.

680
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:53,480
The Indians did this to puzzling evidence because he violated their sacred burial space.

681
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,040
It was thus reawakened to the...

682
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,080
You know it's terrible what they do when they...

683
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,760
Look at this.

684
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,400
This is the body of someone who's been out in the hot sun and...

685
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,060
Well from these...

686
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,860
From this evidence you can imagine what's been done.

687
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,220
It's certainly not a pretty sight now.

688
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,800
Now we're going to open.

689
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,660
Here we go.

690
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,780
Well let's...

691
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:16,940
Household...

692
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,300
Yes.

693
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,740
All right and look at the surface.

694
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:19,880
It's...

695
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,880
Splattered me in the face there.

696
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,560
Ah what a joker.

697
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,400
No harm done.

698
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,260
Now we're going to break the vinyl rib at the top.

699
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,160
Ah geez.

700
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,680
He seemed to be...

701
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,040
He registered that a little bit.

702
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,660
Maybe he felt it.

703
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,320
Nurse can we have the...

704
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,140
We have some...

705
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,640
Can we have someone please try to help us restore the breathing of this patient?

706
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,860
Suction please.

707
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,640
Ah thank you.

708
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,500
I didn't expect us to put this back together yet.

709
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,080
All right now let's remove the book lungs.

710
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,040
You see it's just like a book right here.

711
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:05,720
And if we can take the giggly saw and you'll stop laughing in that unseemly fashion we

712
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,660
can penetrate through the inner bony carapace to the epigastrium.

713
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,860
All right here we are.

714
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,140
Note the whitish viscous surface.

715
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,460
Face to face.

716
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,980
Notice that this passage appears to be blocked with some sort of mucilaginous roughage.

717
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,700
We call it the roughage of knowledge here on the show.

718
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,100
Now notice...

719
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,340
Oh the sucking chest wound.

720
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,340
Oh!

721
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,660
Oh.

722

Oh.

00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,100
Oh.

00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:40,260

00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:40,360
Oh.

00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:40,440

Oh the fumimose.

733
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:48,160
This is a repugnant sight but one which those versed in medical knowledge are often familiar

734
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,400
with.

735
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:54,940
Now I'm going to peel back the thin fatty layer beneath the adipose tissue which connects

736
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,020
to the mesentery...

737
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,800
Oh you're going too far.

00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,620

00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,140
that rock and roll music with lyrics.

796
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,480
You can hear the devil talking backwards.

797
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:43,200
And he depends on the satellite-beamed-in cable TV movies

798
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,520
with Burt Reynolds and car crashes and women.

799
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,520
Oh, aren't they lost, dear friends?

800
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,160
But they do.

801
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,300
These pinks out there do have that foot gland,

802
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,980
that one remnant of their soul,

803
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,840
that rectangular gland that's connected to their monies.

804
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:02,680
My friends, they can be freed by parting with that which hath enslaved them.

805
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,860
Can you hand them that pamphlet?

806
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,120
Oh, friends, the scales fall from their eyes.

807
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,660
But you know, when those pink boys discover Bob,

808
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,240
it's either truth or death.

809
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,260
For the love of Bob can kill normals, friends, yes?

810
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,320
Yes, but Bob's men are moving on this planet.

811
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,560
Oh, that planetary alignment that came up,

812
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:24,900
the Jupiter effect, oh, I'm now sure that may have caused earthquakes and volcanoes

813
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,260
and the Earth to tilt on its axis.

814
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,300
And men will, in the end times to come,

815
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,140
men will gnash their brains

816
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,280
and think backwards.

817
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,540
Dead Christians will come up from their graves,

818
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,160
shambling and rotting like not of the living dead,

819
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,820
but through it all, helping to profit from it all

820
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,540
is that one mighty link between heaven and earth, that Bob.

821
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,680
Oh, yeah, I can see it now.

822
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,740
The miracle of the Bob world is unfolding.

823
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,100
They're wading up to their knees in blood, dear friends,

824
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:57,160
but it's the blood of the baptism of the mighty fist face of Bob,

825
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,780
that face that can pile through eight foot thick,

826
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:07,240
titanium steel conspiracy fork-knock stores with that mighty pipe.

827
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,300
Oh, he ain't from another planet.

828
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,300
He ain't something we have to bow down and kiss to.

829
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:12,980
He's a man.

830
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:17,400
Oh, well, you can pull Bob's leg and he'll laugh right along with you

831
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,320
because Bob, he's been a fool just like you and me.

832
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,880
Bob's been a pathetic fool, and I tell you what,

833
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,980
that J.R. Bob Dobbs will be a fool again.

834
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,040
He's a fool today, he's a fool tomorrow,

835
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,860
because he's the same Bob.

836
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,000
He's always the same Bob, and he's working for you and me.

837
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:38,760
But it's that foolishness that has kept man from being satisfied with his lot,

838
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,880
that has kept man building his great gas-powered automobile engines,

839
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,580
his nuclear reactors that made him want to master the earth

840
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,660
no matter how nice it might have been before.

841
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,720
And it gives us, friends, it gives us that mighty hate,

842
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,080
the hate that makes us want to smite our brothers,

843
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,620
the hate that makes us get up in the morning,

844
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,580
and friends, without that foolishness,

845
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:03,680
and that mighty hate, why, we'd be no different from those normals,

846
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,660
because we'd have nothing to gripe about.

847
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,400
And it's the mighty gripe power and the hate that gives us something for nothing.

848
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,460
Oh, in the long run, we may be poor and broke,

849
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,120
we may be drunk and neurotic,

850
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,420
but we've got Bob, and they hate!

851
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,360
And for that, we can hate him!

852
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,360
Hate him! Hate him!

853
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,040
And that's the power that we have, and they don't have.

854
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,680
Oh, they got plenty of that diddly kind of hate.

855
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,340
Oh, I hate President Reagan.

856
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,280
Oh, I hate my job.

857
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,620
I hate myself.

858
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,100
That's the sick hate, friends.

859
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,520
That ain't no kind of hate at all.

860
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,740
We got that all-inclusive kind of hate, that hate essence.

861
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,800
And it's the love of the hate that allows us to put up with just about anything,

862
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,300
so we can do something about it,

863
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,960
because the Bob hate is indistinguishable from the Bob love.

864
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,380
It's what keeps him on his toes.

865
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,920
Bob is the aware man, the natural man.

866
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,540
He can be walking along, humming to himself, playing pocket pool,

867
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,280
but the inner Bob is aware.

868
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,320
He can hear the inner Bob.

869
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,020
He can hear a fly sniff on a mountain far away,

870
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,880
and he can go up to that fly and look that fly in the eye and say,

871
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,520
Son, I'd like to sell you a big old mound of waste byproducts from physical organisms.

872
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,320
And that fly will give his wings to Bob.

873
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,920
Bob is aware, and that's how he can sell to these inferior creatures.

874
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,940
And that fly, he's going to be a better fly for it.

875
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,260
All those other flies, they're flitting from pile to pile.

876
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,500
They see him just sitting there without any wings on that big old mound of Bob.

877
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,320
And they may laugh now, but what they're going to do is,

878
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,360
as winter goes by, summer goes by, all those other flies starve.

879
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,560
But that little Bob fly, he's still sitting there on that pile,

880
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,300
a munching away and a munching away.

881
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,260
And that pile does not change because Bob, my friends, does not change.

882
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,500
Oh, he changes his mind.

883
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,320
He might suddenly change all the doctrine in the whole church

884
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,500
right in the middle of a ritual to teach us all an important lesson.

885
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,320
But, oh, my friend, Bob Doggs does not change.

886
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,060
Hold that name on the tip of your tongue.

887
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,600
Bob. There's a B on either side, opposite poles.

888
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,720
That's the lesson right there.

889
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,200
Flip it over on your tongue.

890
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,960
Say it front way. Say it backwards. Say it upside down.

891
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,020
And what does it say? It says Bob.

892
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,180
Because Bob does not change.

893
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,840
His promise rings true.

894
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,040
But if you ain't been sprinkled in the blood of the head,

895
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,300
if you ain't been washed in the waste byproducts of Bob,

896
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,120
how are you going to get saved?

897
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:20,600
You can go to that party Saturday night, but you've got to be wearing Bob's shadow.

898
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,880
You can drink beer. You've just got to get Bob drunk, too.

899
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,200
And what about Wanda?

900
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,400
Oh, you're just going to have to give Wanda over to Bob.

901
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,200
That shouldn't be any problem, because Wanda, she found out from Bob how to get to heaven.

902
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,140
Sit down, boy.

903
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,320
Because, friends, if you're wondering, Bob can love.

904
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,000
Bob can love.

905
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,660
Radio job.

906
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,640
I didn't set foot in a church for three years.

907
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,640
I was just fed up to here with it.

908
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,640
After working as an announcer at stations in several cities, I finally got to Hollywood.

909
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,540
I was offered four jobs, and I took one with a major network.

910
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:14,280
In 1947, I made a business trip to Cincinnati.

911
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:21,860
And it was just about then that the Kenneth Arnold sighting of the so-called flying saucers hit the headlines.

912
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,120
And it caused a lot of conversation.

913
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,160
I, uh...

914
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:28,380
I, uh...

915
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,740
I noticed you keep looking out the window.

916
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,600
You wouldn't be looking for these, these, uh, flying saucers, would you?

917
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,380
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.

918
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,360
You don't think it's just some kind of a publicity stunt, then, huh?

919
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:39,920
No.

920
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,980
It's reasonable to suppose that there's life on other planets.

921
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,640
Maybe I, I ought to start looking for flying saucers, too.

922
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,380
If they do come from another planet, how will we know?

923
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,680
Listen, when the occupants condescend to tell us, that's when.

924
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,680
Just start looking for them, all right?

925
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:03,680


926
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:03,800
We got this.

927
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:03,800


928
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,000
We got this.

929
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:05,660
Good job.

930
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,880
Good job.

931
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:07,980
Good job.

932
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:08,880
Good job.

933
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,080
Good job.

934
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,300
Good job.

935
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:11,460
Good job.

936
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:11,720
Good job!

937
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,160
You know, Bob, you're getting to be a pretty big fella.

938
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,380
Yes, sir.

939
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,320
Maybe this is a good idea.

940
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,800
A chance for us to have a little talk.

941
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:20,680
Why, sure, Dad.

942
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,220
What's cooking?

943
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,200
Uh, remember the last time we talked about this, old body of ours...

944
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:28,360
It's fine, folks.

945
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:28,360


946
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,260
Yeah, I remember, Dad.

947
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:30,660
No.

948
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,700
Oh, here's a match. Your pipe's gone out again.

949
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:34,540
Well, thanks.

950
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,700
But when a doctor speaks of the male organ, he...

951
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,120
Well, he calls it a...

952
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,380
When a man and a woman are married, Bob,

953
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,920
they love each other very much.

954
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,760
And in showing their love,

955
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,360
their instinct is to embrace each other as if...

956
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,700
Well, as if to try to become the one person God intended them to be.

957
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,100
The sperm, as the doctors call it.

958
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,760
Is that the seed that helps make a new baby?

959
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,040
No, no, Bob.

960
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:10,160
Well, what I'm talking about now is the fluid

961
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,140
that contains the...

962
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,620
formed in two little sacks beneath the penis,

963
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,860
which we call the...

964
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,340
Oh, but, Dad, why do fellows get these...

965
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,500
these feelings before they get married?

966
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,760
That's a good question, Bob.

967
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,140
Why do you ask?

968
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,380
Well, there were some drawings in Bob's textbook.

969
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,040
I didn't mean to look at them honest, and...

970
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,180
Well, then some of the older girls...

971
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:32,860
Well...

972
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,140
You mean they talk about things sometimes?

973
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,180
Well, yes.

974
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,320
Bob!

975
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,480
Bob?

976
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:40,980
Yes, Bob.

977
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,980
Who's Bob?

978
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:44,400
Bob!

979
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,780
I know Bob, Bob, Dave.

980
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,780
Bob, that's Bob, that's...

981
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,660
Bob, that's the Bob.

982
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,000
Bob.

983
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,120
Bob, Bob.

984
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:55,120


985
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:55,120


986
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:55,120


987
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,780
To solidly commemorate the martyrdom

988
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,920
of the prophet herald of our faith,

989
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,740
called Bob.

990
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,080
And in today's program,

991
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,200
we're going to deal with the story

992
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,960
of the Bob's martyrdom

993
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,340
and the events surrounding it.

994
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:12,800
Wow!

995
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,100
On that blistering July summer day,

996
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:20,840
there were the barrels of 750 rifles

997
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,680
awaiting the command to fire.

998
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,860
And take Bob's life.

999
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,460
He seemed so young to die,

1000
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,760
barely 30.

1001
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,400
He was a handsome, gentle,

1002
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,760
and confident man.

1003
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,080
Could I possibly be guilty

1004
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,620
of the shocking crime

1005
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,960
of which he was accused?

1006
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,360
Would you get off your knees?

1007
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,400
Somewhat unorthodox, wouldn't you say?

1008
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,380
Reverend Scott, but realistic.

1009
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,600
You deliver sermons like this,

1010
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,360
as if one of you are still an ordained minister.

1011
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,660
Or are you?

1012
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,380
The best kind.

1013
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,340
Angry, rebellious,

1014
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,700
critical, a renegade.

1015
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,620
Stripped of most of my so-called clerical powers.

1016
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,520
But I'm still in business.

1017
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,400
Well, you seem to be enjoying the punishment.

1018
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,120
Punishment?

1019
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:05,900
Ha-ha!

1020
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,160
The church has blessed me.

1021
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:07,780
That's what it's done.

1022
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,220
Vanished to some new country in Africa?

1023
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,720
Hell, I had to look it up on the map

1024
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,840
to find out where I was going.

1025
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,860
Oh, my bishop doesn't know it,

1026
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,820
but he has given me exactly what I wanted.

1027
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:20,680
Elbow room.

1028
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:21,780
Clear!

1029
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,000
Clear!

1030
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,420
Real freedom!

1031
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,020
Freedom to dump all the rules or all the trappings.

1032
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,420
And freedom to discover God in my own way.

1033
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:40,840
But the hour for Christ's return was at hand.

1034
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:45,840
The years between 1843 and 1847

1035
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,000
were generally accepted as the time for the return of Christ.

1036
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,200
A young man there,

1037
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,040
declared that he was the one foretold

1038
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,500
in all the holy books of the past.

1039
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,900
He said he had come to usher in a new era,

1040
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,180
a new springtime in the hearts of men.

1041
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,920
He was called the Bob.

1042
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,800
His name means the door or the gate.

1043
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,520
And his teaching was to be the gateway

1044
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,260
to the new age of unity.

1045
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,640
The world is one country,

1046
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,760
and mankind its citizens.

1047
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,180
There is only one religion,

1048
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,840
and all the prophets,

1049
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,840
have taught it.

1050
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:26,620
Hellfire!

1051
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,020
All right!

1052
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,960
Okay, there's something else too.

1053
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,220
Now I noticed last Sunday

1054
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:37,080
that one of you put a quarter

1055
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,980
in the offering plate, see?

1056
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,740
Yeah, Raymond Welch.

1057
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,500
You're the one, you put a quarter in there.

1058
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,780
You tight son of a...

1059
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,460
I'd see all that, see?

1060
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,360
I'm up here where I can see it.

1061
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:53,900
Y'all don't...

1062
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,120
even look or nothing.

1063
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,720
I can see it.

1064
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,180
I know whatever one of you is giving.

1065
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,360
All right.

1066
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,200
I'm gonna maybe go to another church.

1067
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,080
I don't know.

1068
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,240
I don't give a...

1069
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,460
Because I just about come to the end of the road.

1070
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,780
Here, I've just about lost patience with you people.

1071
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,200
You know we need a Sunday school space out there.

1072
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,460
And as Jesus had spoken to Peter, the fisherman,

1073
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,540
the Babs spoke to a Persian student named Mullah Hussein.

1074
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,260
Mullah Hussein described in his own words

1075
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,300
what his experience was like.

1076
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,620
I sat spellbound by his utterance,

1077
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,440
oblivious of time.

1078
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,360
His revelation so suddenly

1079
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,960
and impetuously thrust upon me

1080
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,900
came as a thunderbolt,

1081
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:53,800
which for a time seemed to have benumbed

1082
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,800
my faculties.

1083
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,080
God is pretty busy.

1084
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,780
He's got a long-term plan for humanity

1085
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,020
that stretches far beyond our comprehension.

1086
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,100
So it's not reasonable to expect him to concern himself with the individual.

1087
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,740
The individual is important

1088
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,220
only to the extent of providing a creative link

1089
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,460
between the past and the future.

1090
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,160
In his children,

1091
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,820
or in his grandchildren,

1092
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,780
or in the contribution he makes

1093
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,260
to humanity.

1094
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,420
Therefore,

1095
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,640
don't pray to God to solve your problems.

1096
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,640
Pray to that part of God within you.

1097
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,900
Have the guts

1098
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,400
to fight for yourself.

1099
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,520
God wants brave souls.

1100
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:44,740
He wants winners,

1101
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:46,620
not quitters.

1102
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,860
If you can't win, at least try to win.

1103
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,460
God loves triers.

1104
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:53,800


1105
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:55,920
Is that right, Robin?

1106
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:56,960
Right.

1107
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,740
We're dealing with something totally alien.

1108
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,240
Those hypnotic eyes.

1109
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,400
Alien, totally alien.

1110
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,100
Something that must be incredibly, unbelievably,

1111
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,280
something totally alien.

1112
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,600
Looks like it's growing.

1113
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,080
The End

1114
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,520
It's like I told Hitler that time.

1115
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:29,820
Back when we were just a couple of running buddies.

1116
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,180
One man's bummer is another man's beautiful thing.

1117
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,520
And he always believed in that.

1118
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,540
I think these guys in this van

1119
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,920
are a bunch of stupid, loco, loony birds.

1120
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:46,820
Well, Ben, this is a pretty cool place, though.

1121
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,120
Even if I run my head.

1122
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:49,920
The End

1123
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,120
Robber.

1124
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:53,920
Robber.

1125
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:54,740
Robber.

1126
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,160
Robber.

1127
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,520
You've got to be a robber.

1128
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:57,880
Robber.

1129
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,200
Robber.

1130
00:55:59,200 --> 00:55:59,420
Robber.

1131
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:00,760
You've got to be a robber

1132
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,900
when you're singing this song.

1133
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,340
Yeah, you've got to be a robber.

1134
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,200
Robber all night long.

1135
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,960
Well, you've got to be a robber.

1136
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:13,980
Oh yeah.

1137
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,620
Robber when you're singing this song.

1138
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:19,560
You've got to be a robber.

1139
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,700
Robber.

1140
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:20,700


1141
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:20,700


1142
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,540
Oh, when you're singing this song.

1143
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:25,880
You've got to be a robber.

1144
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,120
Robber all night long.

1145
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,500
Woo!

1146
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:32,620
Robber.

1147
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,580
Well, when you're singing this song.

1148
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:43,760
Sifting a measured quantity of tanned flakes down into curved paper,

1149
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,580
spreading the flakes

1150
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,660
so that they lay equal at the ends,

1151
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,940
with a slight depression in the middle,

1152
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:54,640
thumbs rolling the paper's inner edge down and up

1153
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,100
under the outer edge,

1154
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,540
as forefingers pressed it over,

1155
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,900
thumbs and fingers sliding to the paper's cylinder ends

1156
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,380
to hold it even,

1157
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,580
while tongue licked the flap,

1158
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,840
left forefinger and thumb pinching their end,

1159
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:13,920
while right forefinger and thumb smoothed the damp seam,

1160
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,560
right forefinger and thumb smoothed the damp seam,

1161
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,320
left forefinger and thumb twisting their end.

1162
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:20,880
Robber.

1163
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,500
You've got to stop robber.

1164
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:28,200
Before you wreck your lungs.

1165
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,900
You've got to stop robber.

1166
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,220
Wreck your lungs.

1167
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,100
If you don't stop robber.

1168
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,860
You won't be green robber no more.

1169
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,040
You've got to stop robber.

1170
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,380
You've got black lung or something there.

1171
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,240
Huh.

1172
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:52,920
Ahhhhh.

1173
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,820
You guys have been fronting for about four or five hours in a row now.

1174
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,740
I'm going to lose you.

1175
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,160
We're going to have to call stop to it.

1176
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,460
Because you well know,

1177
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,080
viewing lung is something that can't take that type of torment, anguish, pain,

1178
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,720
or that long, stigmatary time.

1179
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,700
So will you stop fronting now son, or?

1180
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,400
You've got to stop robber.

1181
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,100
Well, that's just, that's it.

1182
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,280
Huh.

1183
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,680
But you know what happens when you stop robbing.

1184
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,460
Well then pretty soon you're going to come down.

1185
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,500
So after then you know what's going to happen then.

1186
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:33,220
You know what's going to happen when you come down.

1187
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,040
You've got to stop robber.

1188
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,720
Oh, for fuck sake.

1189
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,560
Oh, friends, that's the swinging love corpses.

1190
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,960
The uncharacteristic song,

1191
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,320
You Got to Stop Froppin'.

1192
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,360
Say, mama, come back now.

1193
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,360
I'll tell you right now.

1194
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:58,920
You got to stop froppin'.

1195
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,480
Froppin', froppin', froppin'.

1196
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,720
You got to stop froppin'.

1197
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,740
Yes, that's Dr. Philo Drummond singing.

1198
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,340
The Bob's Right Brain Man,

1199
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,620
and the co-founder of the Church of the Subgenius,

1200
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:14,260
now an obscure garage band bass player.

1201
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,180
You ain't proud of me.

1202
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:21,280
But you're going to be whacking me, pal.

1203
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:33,800
You can write to Bob at P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118, www.subgenius.com.

1204
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,680
Oh, my tooth.

1205
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,700
Sire, there is no more money.

1206
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,180
We got to get some money.

1207
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:47,540
That dirty, purgish, hard-to-packed flat we bought myself.

1208
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,080
Oh, my tooth.

1209
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,020
Oh, my tooth.

1210
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:50,360
Oh, my tooth.

1211
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,400
Oh, my tooth.

1212
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:55,120
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1213
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:00,100
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1214
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:04,100
Not just this show, but Subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1215
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,940
But if you truly love Bob,

1216
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:08,200
and want some of that slack,

1217
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,780
back to rebound to you,

1218
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,000
you should go to Subgenius.com front page,

1219
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:14,200
or especially the radio page,

1220
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,780
or the catalog store pages,

1221
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,420
and help out financially as best you can.

1222
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,920
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1223
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,880
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1224
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,200
But some of you still have jobs.

1225
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,880
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1226
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,720
even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1227
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,640
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1228
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,280
All we're saying is that,

1229
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,040
blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs,

1230
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:41,680
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1231
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:46,040
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1232
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:56,020
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1233
01:00:56,380 --> 01:01:00,220
Thanks for anything you can do to help Let There Be Slack.

1234
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:02,480
Yes!

1235
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,100

1236

Yes!

1238

Money!

1239
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:06,660

1240
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,260
Yes!

1241

1242
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:07,260


1243

1244

1245

Money!

1246
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:09,500
Bob!

1247
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:10,480
Free pills!

1248
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:11,320
