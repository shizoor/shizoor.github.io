1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
Bob, get Carrington up here.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,400
Doctor!

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,680
We're almost 50 miles out, Doctor.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,600
With your compass deviation, how are you navigating, Captain?

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,860
That peak ahead is practically...

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,960
Our...

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,380
Swag.

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,040
Go to bed at night with the seven subgenius principles

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,740
nestled firmly against your sternum.

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,020
With subgenius thought guiding your every action,

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,360
Marionette-like, you can't go wrong.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,620
And you'll be ready for the new world

13
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,680
that will surely come when the pleasure saucers

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,340
of the sex goddesses arrive on X-Day

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,760
to lift off all believing subgeniuses

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,780
who have sent their $30 to our headquarters.

17
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,360
Oh, I thought it was...

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,680
You can still get on if you've got a pamphlet.

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,880
Oh, careful.

20
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,720
If you have pamphlet number one...

21
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,780
If you have pamphlet number one, you can get on.

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,320
It's like the secret way to get on without $30.

23
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,460
Yeah, the saucers will come looking for you.

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,220
You won't have to go to the landing area.

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,100
But they're going to put you in the bilge tanks.

26
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,660
You get to ride over there like in the bilge tanks.

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,500
Well, now who's spreading fear?

28
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,400
Who's spreading fearfulness now?

29
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,440
Talking about insufficient accommodations on the saucers.

30
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,500
I've got my state room...

31
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,200
Hey, it's only a dollar.

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,420
It was only a dollar.

33
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,040
It's a good deal.

34
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,480
You know, you don't always have to do things through channels.

35
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,180
They will provide for you.

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,500
Don't worry about it.

37
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,020
That's not going to be your chief worry.

38
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,920
Just don't worry.

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,520
Please don't worry.

40
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,180
Let us...

41
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,440
Let others worry.

42
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,880
We know that our path is made smooth.

43
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,640
You can't worry all the time.

44
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,100
You've got to have fear in your heart.

45
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,060
You've got too much worry in there.

46
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,460
You have to have fear in your heart.

47
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,040
How's the fear going to fit?

48
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:50,060
For us, we have a feeling of ease, relaxation, and fatuous contentment.

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,700
Yes, Dr. Howell and Philo, we have slack.

50
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,380
Whether on the Puzzling Evidence Show, as just heard,

51
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,660
or on the hour of Slack number 1,283, which is now being heard.

52
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,060
What they were talking about is the Church of the Subgenius Prophecy of X Day.

53
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:16,580
Our prophet, J.R. Bob Dobbs, saw a spirit vision from Jehovah One

54
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,360
that the men from Planet X would come to destroy Earth but save the subgeniuses,

55
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,040
and that this would happen at 7 a.m. on July 5, 19...

56
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:28,800
1998.

57
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:37,060
We know now, from more than a dozen X Day drills, that the year 1998 obviously has not arrived yet.

58
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:44,280
Nonetheless, we hold these drills every July, frolicking at a nudist-friendly campground,

59
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:52,060
as heard on the rest of this show, and preparing for the end the way you would expect, eating manwiches.

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,080
What difference does it make?

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,600
When that desphere gets to Earth, we'll all be blown to manwich meat!

62
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,240
Meow!

63
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,720
Well, I guess it's time to indulge in some end-of-the-world debauchery.

64
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,160
Who's up for an orgy?

65
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:03,720
Ooh!

66
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,520
Yes!

67
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,340
No, no, no!

68
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:05,660
Quit!

69
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,340
Nah!

70
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,560
I've identified the Death Sphere!

71
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,200
This is a top-secret military satellite launched by the Air Force in 1998.

72
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:24,560
And this is a top-secret FCC satellite launched that same year to censor indecent TV programs.

73
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,080
Like the Pimpsons and Asarama?

74
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,260
Precisely!

75
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:36,020
Okay, uh, also, we have to report on many interesting changes which have occurred in the world of the subgenius,

76
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,620
and, uh, keep happening as we evolve toward the fruition of perfection.

77
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,840
So this is gonna be 1998 this year?

78
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,100
Yes. Finally, it will arrive, and the prophecy will be fulfilled.

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,860
Cause Bob wouldn't lie or fuck up.

80
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,500
Is that the one we're gonna go with, or are we gonna go with the one where it's...

81
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,440
8... 89-91. I kinda like that one. It bought a lot more time.

82
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,480
Well, it's...

83
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,320
It bought a lot more...

84
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,020
89-91, because...

85
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,800
86-61.

86
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,640
86-61, because the... the pi...

87
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,580
Now that's like the...

88
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,500
The thing in Bob's handwriting...

89
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,720
If you need to buy a lot of time, that gets you the most.

90
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,300
...that says the world will end in 1998.

91
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:21,600
The year 1998 has been torn off, and the piece of paper has been re-adhered with tape, but upside down.

92
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,300
It looks like 1998.

93
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,480
And maybe because it was attached that way...

94
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,660
Maybe it is supposed to be 1998.

95
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,380
Right, that's... yeah.

96
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,920
But according to the original paper, it's that other date.

97
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,600
That's... but I kinda like the other theory, though. The... the hundred years theory.

98
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,280
Hmm. Well, it...

99
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,580
Hundred years theory.

100
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,260
It takes a long time for a fine vintage to...

101
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,760
It was just off by a hundred years.

102
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,520
...to come to its full...

103
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,240
Because it's a round, even bouquet.

104
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,280
That's another... that's just something that sounds crazy.

105
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,740
It's not looking for slogans that sound good. We're not looking for slogans that sound good. We're looking for the truth. No, wait.

106
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,440
Oh, yeah, yeah.

107
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,420
No, we are looking for slogans that sound good.

108
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:03,860
True slogans.

109
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,620
That's all we need.

110
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,540
That sound good.

111
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,520
It just has to sound good.

112
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,040
Want some fire water, Philo?

113
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,260
Try living by too much is always better than not enough.

114
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:18,540
Yes, right. We all know our catechism. I think this is not an elementary subgenius Sunday school session.

115
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,820
Have you really lived by too much is better than not enough? Then you're probably dead by now.

116
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,980
And not even realized it.

117
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,240
What is this thing?

118
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:35,280
You have exceeded your life line and are now living as a zombie on borrowed time.

119
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,400
You're like that poor old Dr. Jack Shepard on Lost. He's dead and he didn't even know it.

120
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,300
That's the fire water.

121
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,820
Tender, Shepard.

122
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,180
Make it close?

123
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,500
Guide your little lamb this night.

124
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,220
Oh, my God.

125
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,800
Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly.

126
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:52,800


127
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,240
Did you?

128
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:53,980
Uh-huh.

129
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:04,580
Now, one of the alternatives, just in the event that this last treatment is not successful,

130
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:14,560
this is simply to allow you to move into a special area in which people of your kind have been congregated.

131
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,160
People of my kind?

132
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,580
Congregated.

133
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,460
Oh, you mean segregated.

134
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:36,000
You ain't in prison, don't you, Doctor? You're talking about a ghetto, aren't you? A ghetto designed for freaks.

135
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,640
Miss Tyler.

136
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,760
7 a.m.

137
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,080
July 5th.

138
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,460
I knew I was going to be hanging out with...

139
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,820
It must be some subgeniuses.

140
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,800
It must be some subgeniuses.

141
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:00,400
Like you! You're a subgenius. And you! You're a subgenius.

142
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:14,080
Folks, there are five minutes until the swag shack closes its iron doors forever.

143
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,900
Until X-Day. 15 hours until X-Day, too. Something like that.

144
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,920
15 hours until X-Moment.

145
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,780
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?

146
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,280
X marks the spot in time.

147
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,200
Yes.

148
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,320
The fulcrum of all reality.

149
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,080
Oh, it is a nexus in time as well as in space.

150
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,460
We can still save Earth.

151
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,720
People are sure to clean up their act when presented with cold hard facts by rational folks like us.

152
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,320
The end is near. Repent thy sins.

153
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,840
I'll think it over while I engage this five dollar hooker.

154
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,600
I'll want to get off with you.

155
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,380
I'm going to get off.

156
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,180
But I'm not sure we're doing our duty to spread and otherwise promulgate subgenius doctrine.

157
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,180
Oh, that's right! That's what this show should be about, right?

158
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:08,500
Let's try to keep forgetting.

159
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,740
So, Reverend Stang, we're getting off this year, right?

160
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,520
Yes, we're getting off. Finally.

161
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,500
I want to hear more. Getting off what?

162
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,840
Getting off what?

163
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,100
At 7 a.m.

164
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,060
What are we getting off?

165
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,520
1998.

166
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,260
What?

167
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,360
The real 1990.

168
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,500
The endless wheel of having to discuss the significance of the various dot groups in Bob's face.

169
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,680
Why won't you answer?

170
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,260
Yeah, it'd be so great.

171
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,760
Reverend Stang, you don't have doubts.

172
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,580
Lower left quadrant, near the pipe and the tube.

173
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,440
Finally getting the cash to check.

174
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:46,300
Which have very interesting dot phenomena, dot-related phenomena, where they impinge, where they create lines, where there's a suggestion of moiré that is never found in the classic Dobbs hit.

175
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,660
It only hints at what is going to be...

176
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,300
The needle in the nail.

177
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,800
...what you're going to go through.

178
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,100
And not endure, but actually derive pleasure from the pleasure saucers when you get there.

179
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:05,280
Start with that. You will derive pleasure, but you then have to consider questions of aesthetics and taste and so on.

180
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:15,560
The pleasure will be there, but whether or not it's a pleasure which you would enjoy experiencing if you contemplated it in your current state cannot be determined.

181
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,680
Don't worry about picking stuff up when you go. You know, just leave your stuff there.

182
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,480
Your computers, you're going to leave your computer. You don't even have to turn it off, you know.

183
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,040
I mean, just leave the internet, leave your comic book collection.

184
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,540
Easy to say.

185
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,360
Because you're going to have a better comic book collection on the ship waiting for you when you get there.

186
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,960
With your name on it. I know I will.

187
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,760
I've been waiting for that, you know, some of those really hard to find issues.

188
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,660
I mean, what's the kick knocking off a bank if everybody knows about it? Huh?

189
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:54,880
And the dames. I never thought I would get bored with beautiful dames, but...

190
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,980
Look, look.

191
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:05,860
I wouldn't expect an angel to understand this, see, but being a big guy with a chip, it don't mean anything if it's all set up in advance.

192
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,440
And I mean, everything is great here, you see, really great. It's just the way I always imagine it, except that...

193
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,400
Just between you and me, Fats, I don't think I belong here. I don't think I fit in.

194
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,500
Oh, nonsense.

195
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,720
Of course you do.

196
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,740
Oh, no, I mean it. I mean it. It's just somebody must have goofed. If I gotta stay here another day, I'm gonna go nuts.

197
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,460
Look, look. I don't belong in heaven, see? I wanna go to the other place.

198
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:31,900
Heaven?

199
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:38,440
Whatever gave you the idea you were in heaven, Mr. Valentine? This is the other place.

200
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,220
No.

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,600
MUSIC

202
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:51,600


203
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:06,600
A scared, angry little man who never got a break. Now he has everything he's ever wanted, and he's going to have to live with it for eternity.

204
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,020
THE SUBGENIUS POWER OF SWAG

205
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:17,800
A lot of subgeniuses will actually be lifted into the pleasure sausage in the hammock.

206
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,820
They'll be in the hammock, and they'll be already stretched out,

207
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,380
feeling good about things.

208
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,340
They pay a little bit extra for that, but it's okay.

209
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,820
It's just for the hammock.

210
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,580
It's genuine K-POP.

211
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,840
It's all organic.

212
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,240
Escape the pull of Earth's gravity.

213
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,920
What if Bob lied to us?

214
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,620
What if the escape vessels come, and instead of being planet or Texas-sized,

215
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:48,640
they're just kind of rinky-dink Roswell-type wobbly silvery discs.

216
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,240
It's a little late to be worrying about that.

217
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:56,720
With crappy air conditioning inside, and not even FM radio, just AM.

218
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,380
And then when you get your sex goddess,

219
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,700
it's this old seedy rattled mattress back hooker from Tijuana,

220
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,700
and the best she'll do is give you a hand job.

221
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,860
You're complaining about the decor.

222
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,360
What if Bob?

223
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,700
I'm exaggerating the nature.

224
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,300
I don't doubt X-Day.

225
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,180
Understand this.

226
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,140
I don't doubt Bob.

227
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,600
I don't doubt X-Day.

228
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,640
But I know the way publicity, advertising works.

229
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,280
What if everything instead of...

230
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,160
What if it's...

231
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,040
What if it's like it's supposed to be, though, Reverend Stang?

232
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,600
Well, if you're complaining about your accommodations,

233
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,900
you haven't even been assigned your stateroom.

234
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,500
Everything is like it's supposed to be, but the saucers are only this big.

235
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,220
And we will have to undergo radical compression to fit.

236
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,640
My sex goddess is a little bit...

237
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,420
We'll have to increase our density.

238
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,840
It may be our destiny.

239
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,620
Yeah, actually, people were looking for squashed little saucers on the ground

240
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,740
back in Conspiracy 1998.

241
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,800
But I'm just...

242
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,140
Friends, look, I'm not saying that your escape vessel won't be everything promised in...

243
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,560
Although it's a little bit different promise in Book of the Subgenius

244
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,260
than it is in Revelation X.

245
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,960
And then by the time you get to the Bobliagraphon,

246
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,020
they sound almost like I do now.

247
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,600
If you're eating a...

248
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,400
Take a bowl of Quisp.

249
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,260
I mean, it has to...

250
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,300
Make sure there's no little tiny flying saucers as you're eating it.

251
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,120
You know?

252
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,060
But you could go back in time to the 1970s and bring Dr. Shrinker to the future

253
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,560
and shrink us all down so we fit in those saucers.

254
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,580
Well, of course, then...

255
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,200
But say what?

256
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,400
If you go back to the 1970s, you make some mistake, you step on a butterfly,

257
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,420
and when you come back, Book of the Subgenius never got published.

258
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,320
Next day, it's happening.

259
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,520
Do you trust a man who is smiling with a pipe in his mouth?

260
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,380
Do you?

261
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,060
Well, you must be a subgenius.

262
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,860
Do you trust that aliens will come from the sky and scorch the ground?

263
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,560
Do you?

264
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,300
You must be a subgenius.

265
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,220
There are people who don't believe, you know.

266
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:05,900
Hate? Hate?

267
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,140
They think we're like Heaven's Gate and we're all gonna kill ourselves.

268
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,580
They hate crazy people who think there are going to be

269
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,360
be saved or who might kill themselves. So they want to kill us to teach us a lesson.

270
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:26,500
That's the way the crazy person thinks. Of course, none of us here are like that. Nobody

271
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:35,400
around here is weird or crazy looking or in any way sort of eccentric.

272
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,320
They want to kill us to stop us from killing ourselves?

273
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,140
They want to kill us to stop us from killing ourselves?

274
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:49,420
Well, that's the, some of the overzealous subgeniuses, the ones that are into the, I

275
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,320
must save you or kill you.

276
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,420
Or I must save you, I must kill you to save you.

277
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,880
Right, I must kill you in order to save you.

278
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,700
I must kill you.

279
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,400
Answer.

280
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,120
Except for a few.

281
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,360
And they're totally screwed.

282
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,680
You're not drinking, are you, Beechcroft?

283
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,600
I don't drink, Mr. Rogers.

284
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,980
Well then, if you don't drink and you don't stay out late at night, are you watching your diet?

285
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:34,960
If you'd really like to know, Mr. Rogers, if you'd really like to know precisely why I am so dead tired,

286
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,880
you ought to try coming to work on the subway at 7.30 every morning.

287
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,040
Then jamming into an elevator like part of a herd of cattle.

288
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,800
Then working in that, in that cacophonous dim that you call an office.

289
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:55,120
Always get jostled, always get shoved, always get pushed around.

290
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,860
Why, take hold of yourself, Beechcroft.

291
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,480
Oh goodness sakes, man, take hold.

292
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,680
I'll take hold, Mr. Rogers.

293
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:08,640
I'll take hold when I can achieve that millennium, that absolute perfection that comes with solitude.

294
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,180
You read me, Mr. Rogers?

295
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,180
People, people, people.

296
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,700
If I had my way, here's how I'd fix the universe.

297
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,640
I'd eliminate the people.

298
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:24,020
I mean cross them off, get rid of them, destroy them, decimate them.

299
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,560
And there'd only be one man left, me.

300
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,580
You are quite mad, Beechcroft, do you know that?

301
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,360
People.

302
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,460
Very well, then.

303
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,340
Three other paths are open to you.

304
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,440
Three cunning plans to cure thy ailment.

305
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,380
Oh, good.

306
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,580
The first is simple.

307
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,880
Kill Bob.

308
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,700
Never.

309
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,640
Then try the second.

310
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Kill yourself.

311
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,100
And the third?

312
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,100
The third is to ensure that no one else ever knows.

313
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,120
Ah, that sounds more like it.

314
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:01,640
How?

315
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,080
Kill everybody in the whole world.

316
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,080
I've lost my chance at being the world's spelling bee champion.

317
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,280
No.

318
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:21,220
Because God damn Mrs. Darden, who is the first one to die tomorrow morning at 7.15.

319
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,020
Mrs. Darden, my fifth grade teacher, was the one reading out the spelling bee words.

320
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,680
But Mrs. Darden was from West Texas or someplace.

321
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,940
The word I was given to spell, she said, spell, servful.

322
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,940
Wow, that's complicated.

323
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,460
Okay, S-E-R-V-I-L-E, servful.

324
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,020
And she goes, she knew I was a good student back then.

325
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,860
She goes, try one more time.

326
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,660
Servful.

327
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,560
S-E-R-V-I-L-E.

328
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,420
So the next kid comes up.

329
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,360
Servful.

330
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,700
S-A-V-E-R-A-L.

331
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:02,860
Servful.

332
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,560
Servful.

333
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,720
I have servful pictures of you on my wall.

334
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:06,920
Oh, yeah.

335
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,480
Servful.

336
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:09,780
Servful of you.

337
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,200
You have terrible pronunciation problems.

338
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,120
Fucking bitch.

339
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,360
She's dead now for sure.

340
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,860
Tomorrow at 7.15.

341
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,120
You're going to dig up her skeleton.

342
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,340
I'm going to dig up her skeleton.

343
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,320
I'm going to bring her back to life in her morbidly obese form.

344
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,300
And then kill her again.

345
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,080
Have you ever heard of a man being flayed alive?

346
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,920
I'm going to reenact the end of the world.

347
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,640
The book happens.

348
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,380
The book happens.

349
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah, that's right.

350
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,460
I just saw that movie for the first time ever the other week.

351
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,180
The Terrible Fate He Inflicts on Hjalmar Belsig.

352
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,900
Man, that's a great-looking movie.

353
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,560
Yeah, it is.

354
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,500
Directed by Edgar Ulmer.

355
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,080
Ulmer, a wonderful director who, if he had even the tiniest budget, could make a movie look great,

356
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,880
and if he had no budget, could at least make it look interesting.

357
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,200
thing like that book i was recommending to you flicker is loosely based on him the man from

358
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,820
planet x is that edgar ulmer masterpiece where they have nothing you know everything is is made

359
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:23,580
out of out of cardboard and so on but what uh uh atmosphere he gets they had a fog man from planet

360
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,540
x well they have a fog machine which is good because it covers up the fact that there's

361
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:33,560
not much there the scene where a car drives somewhere it drives four feet onto their tiny set

362
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:42,380
that's movie making the subgenius way that was dr howell with dr philo drummond reverend suzy

363
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:48,840
the floozy pope blackhead yours truly reverend stang on stage at 13x day which is where most of

364
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:55,320
this show was recorded including the music by six-fisted tales of connie heard in the background

365
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,960
with pisces on vocals

366
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:03,800
collages came from the large yours truly with much thanks to the old twilight zone and the

367
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:10,460
young futurama with some black adder thrown in next up the final dog and pony show from our

368
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:17,360
friend reverend dj shaver recorded at the entrance to the hollow earth at 13x day

369
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,520
the earth will fry as quickly as a wink

370
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,620
so

371
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:35,120
enjoy yourself enjoy yourself it's later than you think that's right ladies and gentlemen it is

372
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:43,020
later than you think this is the last time we'll be here at x day ladies and gentlemen and right

373
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:55,200
now i have a very very special presentation as you know this was quote-unquote the farewell

374
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,940
performance of dj starr and i'm very excited to be here with you and we're going to be talking about

375
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:56,940


376
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:05,380
Shaver's Dog and Pony Show. But that, of course, is because I firmly believe that after 13 times,

377
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,400
this is the one, ladies and gentlemen. We will not be here next year. But

378
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,860
if for some Bob-forsaken reason we find ourselves here back here next year,

379
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,680
I'm going to borrow a line from Stephen Colbert. Ladies and gentlemen,

380
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:31,840
I am DJ Shaver's Dog and Pony Show, and you can too. I want you to come up with a musical act,

381
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:38,140
perform it on this stage, and we're going to have like a subgenius idol. You guys are going to be

382
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,300
judged and graded, and there will be a prize, ladies and gentlemen.

383
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,920
But of course, that will not happen because we're going to Planet X this year.

384
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,360
Yeah!

385
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,660
I'd like to leave you with a little bit of a surprise.

386
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,180
I'd like to leave you all with a little inspirational song.

387
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,420
Let's kill all the beautiful people.

388
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,000
Let's string them up by their beautiful hair.

389
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,400
Let's kill all the beautiful people.

390
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,980
Have the world to ourselves.

391
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,640
Let's kill all the shiny and the shiny.

392
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,180
Let's kill all the beautiful and the gifted.

393
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,340
The clever ones who make me feel small.

394
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,360
The strong, the brave, the self-assured ones.

395
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,660
Let's kill them all.

396
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,800
Sing along, children!

397
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,940
Let's kill all the beautiful people.

398
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,540
String them up by their beautiful hair.

399
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,780
Let's kill all the beautiful people.

400
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,540
Have the world to ourselves.

401
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,640
Let's kill all the beautiful people.

402
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:53,640


403
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,920
Let's kill all the happy, secure ones.

404
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,400
The ones who think that we've got other skills.

405
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,520
The ones who say you're beautiful inside.

406
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,500
Let's give them pills.

407
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,400
Let's kill all the beautiful people.

408
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,040
String them up by their beautiful hair.

409
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,260
Let's kill all the beautiful people.

410
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,940
Have the world to ourselves.

411
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,280
Kill and maim and gaily garrot them.

412
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,040
The ever so humble, the faultless, the thin.

413
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,300
The ones who want to watch over and help us.

414
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,740
Let's do them in.

415
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,320
Everybody sing!

416
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,880
Let's kill all the beautiful people.

417
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,780
The men of Arleigh.

418
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,540
The Women's Institute.

419
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,220
Come on!

420
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,660
The beautiful people.

421
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:50,880
All.

422
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,340
Have the world to ourselves.

423
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,860
People of France.

424
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,560
Dancing in the land of gold.

425
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,220
Yeah, I don't know French either.

426
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,300
Let's kill the French.

427
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,560
Kill them all.

428
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,060
Alice Comston, wherever he is.

429
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,420
There he is.

430
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,460
All together now.

431
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,380
Let's kill all the beautiful people.

432
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,020
String them up by their beautiful hair.

433
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,080
Let's find a whole world

434
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,920
How to run to ourselves

435
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,180
That's such a beautiful sentimental song.

436
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,240
Where's Bob?

437
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,480
DJ Shaver!

438
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,380
Nigel is from the prestigious Tap House, Cabell.

439
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,220
And good evening.

440
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,920
I've been told I've been up here before, but I don't remember it.

441
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:59,320
So, apparently I need to come up here when I remember it, you remember it, Bob remembers it, the exes remember it.

442
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,440
And everybody can agree on one thing.

443
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,300
July 5th, 7 a.m., we're getting off this rock.

444
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,880
Can I get a praise, Bob?

445
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,960
That's what I wanted to hear.

446
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:22,980
Now, I have done a few things over the years to try and bring about what I consider to be the end times.

447
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,580
And I hope every single one of you have done your bit as well.

448
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,420
But if you have not, I understand.

449
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,160
It can be taxing.

450
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,960
There can be a weight upon your shoulders.

451
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:42,140
You feel as though you're carrying the entire weight of this church upon your very shoulders.

452
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,700
But what do you do?

453
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,480
Little bits.

454
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,260
Up on the hill, what do we do?

455
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,700
We bribed everybody.

456
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,280
We bribed you to come up there.

457
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,280
But what do we want from you?

458
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,820
We wanted your hate.

459
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,440
We wanted you to come up and give us your hate.

460
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,660
We'll give it back.

461
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
We're not going to keep it.

462
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:11,500
But we needed to borrow it just long enough to send that signal up into the sky to the exes.

463
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,800
Who?

464
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:12,940
Who?

465
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:12,940


466
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,680
You have been given every single thing that could be possibly given.

467
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,480
They have been given money.

468
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,820
They have been given sex.

469
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,800
They have been given every single possible thing.

470
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,820
So what did we give them?

471
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,740
We gave them your hate.

472
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,820
Now, we don't know how that's going to work out.

473
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,000
But you can come up on that hill.

474
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,900
Those of you who showed up today.

475
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,780
Actually, those of you who didn't show up today, come up early.

476
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,900
And I'll work something out for you.

477
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,920
I've got a deal.

478
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,360
I've got a deal for you.

479
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:52,800
But 9 p.m. tomorrow night, we are going to send the one thing the exes understand up into space.

480
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,140
And that is your hate.

481
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,560
Can I hear your hate?

482
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,340
Hate!

483
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,320
Hate!

484
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,700
Hate!

485
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,500
Hate!

486
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:01,660
Hate!

487
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,140
Hate!

488
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:02,240
Hate!

489
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,300
Hate!

490
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:02,340
Hate!

491
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,680
Remember this moment.

492
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,460
Bring it up on that hill.

493
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,680
And we're going to send it into space.

494
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:07,960
Space.

495
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,380
Space.

496
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:08,860
Space.

497
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,360
Space.

498
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:09,820
Space.

499
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:09,960
Space.

500
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,400
Space.

501
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:10,480
Space.

502
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,400
Space.

503
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,640
Space.

504
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,840
Space.

505
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:31,840


506
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,480
Space.

507
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:34,740
Space.

508
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,020
Space.

509
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,120
Space.

510
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,220
Space.

511
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:36,640


512
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:36,700
Space.

513
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:36,900
Space.

514
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:36,980
Space.

515
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,540
Space.

516
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:37,820
Space.

517
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:38,800
Space.

518
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,620
Space.

519
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,320
Space.

520
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,460
Space.

521
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,440
We're a real church.

522
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,640
Well, I went, no, no, no.

523
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,480
I'm hosting this thing.

524
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,200
I've got to be polite.

525
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:52,240
I ran down here just in time to see the coolest thing that happened this whole next day.

526
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,540
The rising of those balloons full of hate.

527
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,280
That was at sunset.

528
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,920
To praise Reverend Nigel there, I guess it was his idea.

529
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,140
That was so poignant.

530
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,880
That really was one of the most.

531
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,640
I didn't even get to see what most of the hate was about.

532
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,000
But I saw one lifting up.

533
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,480
It said, I hate my dad on it.

534
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,920
It's good to get that kind of crap out of you before you get ruptured, you know.

535
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,700
Now, some of you subgeniuses, you're going to get transformed right at that moment.

536
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,280
If you happen to be daydreaming about Lindsay Lohan when that happens.

537
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,620
Now, for some of you, that may be great.

538
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,400
Oh, boy, I look like Lindsay Lohan.

539
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,460
Others will be going, where's my pecker?

540
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,500
So.

541
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:45,200
I hope you all have given proper thought to the seriousness of that moment of rupture.

542
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,580
You know, I had thought about when I'm ruptured and can do anything.

543
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,520
Ruptured, sorry.

544
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,240
I've been reading my scriptures.

545
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,340
Anyway, when I get my superpowers for $30 day after tomorrow,

546
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,740
I had thought about giving myself superpowers,

547
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,140
but I had not thought about keeping myself normal.

548
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,920
But creating a planet that was unusually weak,

549
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,500
which would then make me feel super.

550
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,300
Oh.

551
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,080
See.

552
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,920
If you remember Bedford and Kavor and their adventures on the moon,

553
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,960
where you hit a moon man and he just splashes into liquid

554
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:33,060
because he's six times less integrated and dense than you are.

555
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,660
And subgeniuses can be pretty damn dense, friends.

556
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,680
I mean, why do you think they call it?

557
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,520
Density of pure neutronium.

558
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,840
I'm living proof of that.

559
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,380
Yep.

560
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:52,440
The conspiracy people, you can tell them by their flabby softness.

561
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,840
The subgenius is firm, round, and fully packed.

562
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,700
Well, I've seen, I don't know about the firm part.

563
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,680
I've seen the round and fully packed.

564
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,580
Fairly firm.

565
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,320
Saw a lot of it at the baptism.

566
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,620
Jackie, I just can't get over that.

567
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:14,560
How can anybody miss such a wonderful ritual that brings us together?

568
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,720
Well, some would rather eat fried grits with a bunch of hillbillies in town

569
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,680
than pay attention to our sacred ceremonies and rituals.

570
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,240
I had pointed out that I've seen...

571
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,320
I'm sorry I missed it.

572
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,520
I'll be naked for everyone later privately.

573
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,580
Will that help?

574
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,980
Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby is only ten minutes away.

575
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,640
Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby is only ten minutes away.

576
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,640
Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby is only ten minutes away.

577
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,460
Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby is only ten minutes away.

578
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:54,280
B Meet the Three!!

579
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,680
Smoked Don!

580
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:15,260
I can tell this is going to be a hot day, so I hope that, I really hope this is it.

581
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,120
That's funny.

582
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
You're all dressed in black, Susie.

583
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,820
Well, the world is going to fucking die.

584
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,080
Well, what are you mourning?

585
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,380
No, these are my party threads.

586
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:29,980
Oh, okay.

587
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,600
I love a good death of something I hate, and this planet is number one.

588
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,220
Now I have photographic records of what you all looked like before you got your new bodies.

589
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,420
That's going to be quite a psychological test, you know.

590
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:52,500
I asked Ratnar, Governor Ratnar, once what kind of new body he would get, and he said,

591
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,700
I think I'm going to keep my old one.

592
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,660
I thought that was kind of touching.

593
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,540
I wouldn't want to touch him.

594
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,960
I must say.

595
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,160
I've got a bunch of...

596
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:13,840
Every year, we get more people at this 7 a.m., and I want to thank you folks for having the faith

597
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,340
to get off your asses at this ungodly time.

598
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,340
Now, I know some of you have to do it five, six days a week.

599
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,480
I only have to do it this one day a year, but don't feel bad.

600
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,360
Oh, who stayed up all night?

601
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,100
Oh, I did.

602
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,340
So some people actually do that, huh?

603
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,400
Oh, I did.

604
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:35,820
Oh.

605
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,620
What about the narcolepsy stayed up all night?

606
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:42,840
I, we went to bed at a nice, sane time, 1 o'clock.

607
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,420
At 2 o'clock, we started trying to go to sleep.

608
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:51,240
At 5 o'clock, I woke up, bolt upright, despite the sleeping pill.

609
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,100
And then we discovered that we had left the alarm clock in the other room.

610
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,740
It's only a matter of hours now until the rupture.

611
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,440
Hours could seem like minutes.

612
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,160
Minutes could seem like seconds.

613
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,580
Minutes.

614
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:04,580


615
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,160
Friends, have you put your dibs in on earth products that you want to preserve?

616
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:09,980
Do we have to go?

617
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,000
I've got the Grand Canyon and the Smithsonian.

618
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,060
You always have to mention that.

619
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,220
Dr. Hal has his dibs on what?

620
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,280
The dinosaur mu...

621
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,380
The plastic dinosaur warehouse outside Las Vegas, Nevada.

622
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,980
Not many people would appreciate it,

623
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,400
but that's why I've got a secure bid on it and its entire contents.

624
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,420
That's not all they have, but they certainly got a rare treasure.

625
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:34,980
Whoop.

626
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,840
Better put some more stones there.

627
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,660
Oh, that big vinyl Dobbshead banner that's sort of blowing around here.

628
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,140
The Vinyl Frontier.

629
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,120
That is this year's doodle pad.

630
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,660
Or the vinyl solution.

631
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,540
I think we have some markers and things around there,

632
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,460
and that is for you.

633
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,040
Feel free to doodle upon.

634
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,900
I started, but there'll be more.

635
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,500
Yeah.

636
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,800
More scratching and a scribbling.

637
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,400
You'll notice we've left other boards from previous X Days.

638
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,820
Nailed up where people have put in their smart-alecky,

639
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,900
disrespectful comments about J.R. Bob Dobbs and his called ministers.

640
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,480
Weight it down with stones.

641
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,300
You better believe we take names.

642
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,260
We take notice of all that.

643
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,720
Mm-hmm.

644
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:24,640
You can earn a lot of demerits by bad-mouthing subgenius preachers.

645
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,180
A man taking names.

646
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,540
That was Susie, who said she's still fighting the conspiracy.

647
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,300
Apparently, there is a number of...

648
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,220
Actors holding her within the bowels of Atlanta.

649
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,840
There's a holdup in the Bronx.

650
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,520
Brooklyn's broken out in fights.

651
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,080
There's a traffic jam in Harlem that's backed up to Brooklyn Heights.

652
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,060
There's a scout troop short a child.

653
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,920
Crew chefs do it idle-wild.

654
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,460
And still, she will be here.

655
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,080
And Whitey's on the moon.

656
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:03,860
Now, in about an hour or so, you should be feeling the communion, Bob.

657
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,320
It'll last 12 to 16 hours.

658
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,640
I think I'm going to do something.

659
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,500
My friend Alexander Shulgin made these little communion wifers.

660
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,940
Last time, we got together at the Bohemian Grove and traded recipes.

661
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:17,980
It's going to spill out.

662
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,240
Look, it's so...

663
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,380
They're full of eggs.

664
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,120
Eh?

665
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,060
It's an egg sack.

666
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,640
I don't want your disgusting used communion wafer, Philo.

667
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,840
If you don't eat them, you can eat them.

668
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,780
You can use them as tiny little bit of toilet paper, I suppose.

669
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,440
I wouldn't be able to.

670
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,960
Did everyone get their Kool-Aid?

671
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,520
I hate having to say that.

672
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,640
Gee, I wonder what the Euro subgeniuses are doing right now on Euro X Day in Amsterdam.

673
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,460
Haven't they already been ruptured by now?

674
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,360
Shouldn't they be...

675
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,340
If something was happening, wouldn't we know?

676
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,660
Oh, no, they're only about six hours ahead, right?

677
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:58,840
Yeah.

678
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,940
So, at about 1 o'clock this morning...

679
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,080
They will be ruptured.

680
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,940
If they answer their phones, then we're up shit creek.

681
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,280
Would you roll that, Doctor?

682
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:15,800
Yeah, if we call Amsterdam at 1 this morning and anybody answers their cell phone, that's not a good sign.

683
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,100
But what you'll hear is a shrilling noise.

684
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:18,820
Oh.

685
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,000
You think it's going to happen there first instead of here first?

686
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,220
Well, on the other side of the international date line, if they made an international date, I don't know why not.

687
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,060
Yeah, right now, so...

688
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,460
Like, wouldn't toilet...

689
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,780
Reverend Toilet Pepper...

690
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,140
Wouldn't toilet in the Philippines be...

691
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,960
What time is it there?

692
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,560
Well, the toilets will all start to swirl the other way.

693
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:44,720
We need to have one of those clocks on a giant screen that shows, you know, the time in different places.

694
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,460
And they would...

695
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,380
As it hits 7 o'clock and...

696
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,640
First place at 7 a.m. is Samoa.

697
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,940
The first big area.

698
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,260
And that would go blank.

699
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,700
You know, it's like the clock would just go out.

700
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,280
And as it moved to Australia, we'd be on the phone to a chain smoker.

701
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,720
Trying to understand his dialect.

702
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,240
While he tried to, you know, seduce us over the phone.

703
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,780
Cyber or something.

704
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,020
And then at 7 o'clock in Australia...

705
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,940
He'd be gone, right?

706
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,640
One less Austrian.

707
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,640
Like the ball dropping in Times Square on New Year's.

708
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,180
Except the ball is sad old planet Earth.

709
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:27,940
A familiar face.

710
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,260
A familiar face.

711
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:32,260


712
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:32,620
And then we're seen.

713
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,260
Once again.

714
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,240
It's July 5th.

715
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:42,500
And everyone is staring at me.

716
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,900
And the swamp.

717
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,480
Yeah, and the swamp.

718
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,300
As if I was Bob.

719
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,080
Or maybe I'm really, you know...

720
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,840
Man.

721
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,560
Please.

722
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,500
You know.

723
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,660
We need to focus outwards.

724
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,260
Actually, come to think of it, we need to be outdoors.

725
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,040
Because in a few minutes we'll be lifted up.

726
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,160
And there's...

727
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,700
That's a hard ceiling.

728
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,180
I hate to be left behind.

729
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,220
Thanks. Right.

730
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,360
We don't want to be left behind because...

731
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,840
Bumping against the ceiling.

732
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,420
You see.

733
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,880
That's another thing we've realized over the years.

734
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,400
If we'd be bumping, we'd be strained through it.

735
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,440
The what?

736
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,940
We wouldn't be bumping.

737
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,720
We'd be strained.

738
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:37,960
You're right.

739
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,240
We'd be strained through the roof.

740
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,880
Before we got to the escape vessels.

741
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,840
It might be hard to re-corporate.

742
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And I believe there is Kool-Aid over there.

743
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,340
Actual Kool-Aid over by the table.

744
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,560
Some brave person should go ahead and grab that.

745
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,020
If I know who y'all subgenius is,

746
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,820
somebody will come along here at 7-0-1

747
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:06,680
and find all these untouched cups of subgenius Kool-Aid.

748
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,000
Don't eat the brown ass.

749
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,720
And is there any hope left?

750
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,420
Indeed.

751
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,700
We're here on Earth's last unspoiled acre

752
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,420
to show the Death Sphere there's still purity in the world.

753
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,380
Begin transmitting.

754
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,840
Commence purity chant.

755
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:23,920
Ooh.

756
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,460
Ooh.

757
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,620
Ah, quiet you riot.

758
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,460
What's the worst that could happen?

759
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,580
No.

760
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,860
No.

761
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,220
Earth is gone.

762
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,860
Three minutes.

763
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,040
Just think of that.

764
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,420
Breathe this polluted air for one last time.

765
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,900
Muse upon the...

766
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,020
pesticide-laden ground.

767
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,020
As we fly away, we can probably watch that oil volcano

768
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,660
start lapping up onto the shores of...

769
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,500
the edges of skyscrapers and cities.

770
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,960
Dr. Drummond, it's been a long trip, hasn't it?

771
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,780
Been a long trip.

772
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,800
A long, long trip since...

773
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,860
It's taking so long to get here.

774
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,760
I'm so glad.

775
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,920
Since that first trans...

776
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,880
transmission we heard from the Exist saying,

777
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,380
shut up, pink boy.

778
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,800
Shut up, pink boy.

779
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,100
That was our first...

780
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,060
Shut up, pink boy.

781
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,420
Wait, maybe that's what they were...

782
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,980
Maybe they really meant it.

783
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,700
I said, shut up, pink boy.

784
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,400
All right, let's not think about that, friends.

785
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,460
We've got only a couple of minutes left to go.

786
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:35,940
Music playing.

787
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,220
Music playing.

788
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,680
Music playing.

789
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,240
Music playing.

790
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:44,760
Music playing.

791
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,300
Music playing.

792
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,420
Music playing.

793
00:40:59,420 --> 00:40:59,580
Music playing.

794
00:40:59,600 --> 00:40:59,640
Music playing.

795
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,840
Music playing.

796
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,760
Music playing.

797
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,680
Music playing.

798
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
Music playing.

799
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,500
Music playing.

800
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,580
So here's the last thing that I have to give

801
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,600
Space to fill

802
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,080
One final look at your face

803
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,540
I'll see it in my mind in another place

804
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,580
I blink my eyes, my mouth feels dry

805
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,540
There's not an answer to the question why

806
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,580
This is the last night that I'll ever live

807
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,580
I can't control this, now I never will

808
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,580
So here's the last thing that I have to give

809
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,580
Space to fill

810
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,640
One thing was for sure

811
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,600
As I left the stage

812
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:18,140
I had more than one kind of reservation

813
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:22,600
I don't want to say I knew

814
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,600
But I knew

815
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,780
All I could think about was you

816
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,540
This is the last night that I'll ever live

817
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,520
I can't control this, now I never will

818
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,580
So here's the last thing that I have to give

819
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:40,680
Space to fill

820
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:40,680


821
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:40,680


822
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:40,680


823
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,600
So here's the last thing that I have to give

824
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,500
Space to fill

825
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:54,520
Here goes the last story that I'm gonna tell

826
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,640
It's not the kind that ends so well

827
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,660
I think, maybe, goddamn, I am

828
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,700
Soon to be ashes of what we built

829
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,560
This is the last night that I'll ever live

830
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,520
I can't control this, now I never will

831
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,640
So here's the last thing that I have to give

832
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,700
Space to fill

833
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,480
Space to fill

834
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,880
Space to fill

835
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,560
Space to fill

836
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,020
Space to fill

837
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,300
Space to fill

838
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,300
Space to fill

839
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:39,700
Space to fill

840
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,500
bres

841
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,900
Blue

842
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,980
Blue

843
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:57,040
Blue

844
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,120
Blue

845
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,300
Green

846
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:07,540
things. Anyway, back now to 13X Day, 6.59 a.m. on July 5th morning, as we hear via my lapel mic,

847
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,580
the final moments before 7 a.m. and the X moment.

848
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,140
Look around. It's so beautiful.

849
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,160
Where are we staying?

850
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:33,340
This is the place that we all made together so that we could find each other.

851
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:40,080
The most important times of your lives were spent with these people.

852
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:50,720
We all needed each other. You needed all of us and we needed all of you. Why do we need to be

853
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,180
together? Well, friends,

854
00:44:53,180 --> 00:45:06,560
to remember and to let go. Bob said we were leaving, friends. Leaving, no. Just moving on.

855
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:12,800
Where? Let's go find out.

856
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:22,280
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3,

857
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,440
2, 1.

858
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,280
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

859
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,820
I see them, Rub and Stang. They're in their moon-shaped vehicle this year.

860
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,360
Ugh.

861
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,940
It's the moon-shaped vehicle.

862
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,200
They're showing us the moon once again.

863
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,540
There's the moon in the middle.

864
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,260
Now, we could...

865
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,000
No, let's not do that.

866
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,160
It's the moon-shaped vehicle. Let's come and get it.

867
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,260
I can see you're my floaters, Stang. What's up?

868
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,820
Tell me about it. I see you're floaters, too.

869
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,720
You're a floater. You brought it.

870
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:08,420
Well, I suppose we could stall, do another countdown.

871
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,980
I could wake up this morning and get myself a beer.

872
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:20,280
The future's uncertain and the end is always near.

873
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,520
Bullshit.

874
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,140
Well, uh...

875
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,360
Oh, okay. She called me up on...

876
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,320
She called me on that.

877
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,740
Uh, maybe.

878
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,160
Dr. Drummond, uh, it was...

879
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:36,380
Weren't you the one that found the memo that said it was 7 a.m.?

880
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,440
Or was I the one that found the memo that said it was 8661?

881
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,260
Oh, well.

882
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,080
Remember, it's been so many years.

883
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,300
Well, turn this corny shit off.

884
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:47,880
Thank you.

885
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,200
Yay!

886
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,140
I guess not that many of you saw the last episode.

887
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,040
You're sort of lost, huh?

888
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,420
It seems like it was so poignant a second ago, though.

889
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:57,700
Lost? What's that?

890
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,880
Yeah, a second ago, it was poignant.

891
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,500
Well, fuck it! God damn it! I'm bitter! I'm now...

892
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,700
Once again, every goddamn...

893
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,200
This is the 15th time!

894
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,220
I have been here every goddamn July 5th at 7 o'clock in the morning.

895
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,220
So is Dr. Dark.

896
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,380
This guy here is the only other...

897
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,780
God fucking damn it!

898
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,400
Oh, look, he's got a little parasitic twin hanging out of his butt.

899
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,100
Let me see what happened.

900
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:21,980
Well...

901
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:23,540
Where's Bob?

902
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,240
I don't know.

903
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,620
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

904
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,880
He said something about food.

905
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,480
Maybe the alligator's got him.

906
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,580
Hey, man, don't say that.

907
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,140
We could starve to death out here.

908
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,600
Ah, man.

909
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,640
This swamp can't go on forever.

910
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,160
We'll find something.

911
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,060
We'll find something.

912
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,500
We'll find something.

913
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,420
Sリe's still octopus.

914
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,100
There'll be no price.

915
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:06,080
You wouldn't get nice octopus out of there.

916
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:10,200
I thought we could all eat one at the same time.

917
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:10,200


918
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,360
But we've already done this one.

919
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,440
We've already become humans.

920
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,060
Not aliens!

921
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,320
We've invented the pirulits.

922
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:17,320


923
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:17,920
Slyde has some Mandarin to talk about.

924
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:17,920


925
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:17,920


926
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:17,920


927
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:17,920


928
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:17,920


929
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,040


930
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,480
You get a little pleasey today about a tree in your eye.

931
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:19,820
Yeah.

932
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,240
And I hear I have a card he currently gave to youay princess Delt complete a big man return

933
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:21,660
friend from the sea.

934
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,300
You bet, Murk.

935
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:32,420
best friend. But just give it time. There was one poor fellow here. He was really frustrated

936
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:36,980
because he hadn't gotten laid. And I know just how that guy feels because when I was his age,

937
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:45,600
I hadn't either. And all I can say is I'm living proof. Don't kill yourself. Wait for X day.

938
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:53,600
You're a subgenius. You're not a professional at suicide. There are hardly any of those around.

939
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:02,400
And why rush things? Bob or God, they're going to do the job anyway. They're good at it. They've

940
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:10,600
done it a million times. Let them kill you. No matter how tough things get or how hopeless. I

941
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,540
know that now the X's haven't come. Some of you just want to go die. It's like, oh God, I can't

942
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,580
make it. I sold my house. I sold my house. I sold my house. I sold my house. I sold my house. I sold

943
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:20,660
my house. I cashed out my credit cards. I can't bear to go home to face the embarrassment

944
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:29,460
of all those discordians laughing at me. I know how it is. Every X day, the discordians,

945
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,280
they act like Baptists who just learned that the Methodist church burned down.

946
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:40,780
Oh, and now I don't want to go into the flying spaghetti monster. Spare me.

947
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,260
Oh, you're talking about lunch right there. Yeah, that's right.

948
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:49,520
They're lunch for the subgenius. Well, they're just a joke. They don't really believe. Are they?

949
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,600
Okay. Flying spaghetti monster had a convention. I can see that they might get a lot of people.

950
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:01,360
It would be in a Howard Johnson's motel. It would be like a little, little sci-fi convention.

951
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,820
They'd be sitting around sucking their thumbs, looking at cartoons of the flying spaghetti

952
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:13,200
monster. They would not be standing in a campground in the middle of bizarre Amish country that they

953
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,840
may become.

954
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:20,180
All the way across the continent to be at. No, not at seven in the morning because they're not

955
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,240
subgeniuses. Oh, well, maybe I shouldn't have brought that up. But the faith is the important

956
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,560
thing. Now, ain't it, Dr. Drummond? It's so true. We've kept that faith for so long. When was it

957
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:37,500
that you showed me that Bob face? It was 1978. 78. And when was it you said I'd have to get up

958
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,200
in the morning at seven o'clock? It was 1978. That was somebody else that said that then.

959
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,240
That's what every... All of us.

960
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,560
I was going to say seven. Yes, little boy.

961
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,940
I think it was a mix-up memo.

962
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:56,380
It's funny, though. Every X day, there are actually, well, there were like 400 people

963
00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:03,040
waiting for the saucers at 7 a.m. in 1998. Then it dropped off to about a dozen the next

964
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:09,680
year. But it has gradually built back up. I'd say there were at least 40 or 50 people

965
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,260
standing around staring at us at seven in the morning.

966
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:13,940
Absolutely. I agree with that. Yep.

967
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,040
40 or 50.

968
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,320
And it's more, it's like every year there's a few more.

969
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,900
It's like they have more faith every year instead of less faith.

970
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:29,420
As the numbers fewened. See, now, I told you once when I took me a communications class,

971
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:35,180
one of the first things in them studies on communications and sociology and kind of the

972
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:39,800
arcane psychology of the whole thing is they had a bunch of people believing on this woman

973
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,940
who said the aliens was going to come. And she was going to be director.

974
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,200
Right.

975
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:44,240


976
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:44,240


977
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:44,780
And she was going to be director.

978
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,420
Oh, right. Yeah. The study of the cult.

979
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:52,980
And although many were disappointed the first time, many, many showed up. It got fewer and

980
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:57,500
fewer until it dwindled off to nothing. But those few were more and more rabid.

981
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:05,140
Right. Yeah. Well, because there have been differently-samed people who admitted this

982
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:10,840
to their therapists. It's like, if I stop believing this now, it'll be like I've wasted

983
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,480
years out of my life.

984
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,660
That's a tough thought.

985
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,240
So much.

986
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,540
It might not be true.

987
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:27,300
I like to think that every year more and more people simply get it. And they end up having

988
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:36,080
a really good time at a party that's not too big and not too small. I could stand it to

989
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,080
be a little bigger.

990
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:43,140
I say for an Epicurean standpoint, it certainly is a wonderful, wonderful way to spend a week.

991
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:48,960
There's plenty and plenty of delicious, delightful food there. I mean, I know this is very mundane

992
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,580
stuff, but it is delicious.

993
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:59,320
Well, and then the after effect is being hyperproductive, you know, because you've learned that the world

994
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,540
could end any moment.

995
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,420
Right. Again, we're talking about, you know, methane expressions and explosions from crack.

996
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:05,880
Yeah.

997
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:13,780
Now I have the faith. I have it in my heart, but I don't have the $30.

998
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,240
And I know Bob only cares about money.

999
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,960
Well, you got to know that's not true. Bob is very rich. He doesn't need the money. He

1000
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,360
needs the proof that you have the fact somehow sell myself to Bob.

1001
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:34,780
Yes. Yes, you can. You can go to the convenience store that has a help wanted sign and sell

1002
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:41,760
your soul by getting that job, earning up that $30 and sending it to a post office box.

1003
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,200
181-417-CLEVELAND.

1004
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,660
Heights, Ohio 44118subgenius.com.

1005
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,260
But you know, he can work his way up at the 7-Eleven.

1006
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:58,700
That's right. You can work your way up just like Bob did. You murder the boss, become

1007
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:05,100
the manager, poison, fuck the district manager's wife until he commits suicide.

1008
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:09,300
Don't forget, you have to kill all of your customers too. It's a hard job.

1009
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,200
Oh, I'm poisoning the sleuthy.

1010
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,200
You poison the customers with Chinese.

1011
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,880
Chemicals and toys.

1012
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,800
The melamine and the Slurpees.

1013
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:25,180
Because believe you me, I have been coming here since 1998. I'm not an early adopter,

1014
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:32,080
but I'm somewhere along that line. And I have seen the progression over the years. And I

1015
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:40,540
know that every single year, we almost get it right. And some little thing spins off

1016
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:43,780
to the left or over to the right. It's not our fault.

1017
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:48,800
They didn't tell us how to end the world. We have to figure it out for ourselves.

1018
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:59,400
Every single one of you has the power within yourself to end this world and bring the subgenius

1019
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,060
high.

1020
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,580
Will you do this?

1021
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,420
Will you end the world?

1022
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,140
Can I get a praise Bob Helena Kearney?

1023
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:12,300
And I'll come back here to you, Kunal.

1024
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:12,880
Very good.

1025
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:12,900
I'll come back to you.

1026
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:13,040
Thank you, Ken.

1027
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:13,280


1028
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:13,280


1029
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:13,400


1030
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:13,400


1031
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,760
Thank you.

1032
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:13,760


1033
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,740
It's very simple.

1034
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,740
All you have to hold within your heart

1035
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:20,400
is the love of yourself

1036
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,380
and the people you care about

1037
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,800
and to ever live in hate

1038
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,220
for every single nods of Jesus on this planet.

1039
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:32,640
Hail Connie.

1040
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:33,600
Praise Bob.

1041
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,220
Let's end it this year.

1042
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,540
Now you see,

1043
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,420
that's a fucking hot brain.

1044
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,340
She knows it too.

1045
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:48,860
Look at that.

1046
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,440
Let's go home, everybody.

1047
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,720
At least the world wasn't destroyed.

1048
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,380
Yet.

1049
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,300
Consummate your union

1050
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,300
or I shall destroy Earth.

1051
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:08,400
Earth.

1052
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,600
Well,

1053
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,400
if it's to save Earth,

1054
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,320
commence intercourse.

1055
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,280
Ahem.

1056
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:16,560
No!

1057
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,600
That was that nice Mr. Hilliard.

1058
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,860
He said the school board

1059
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,980
accepted our ideas enthusiastically.

1060
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:29,760
Really?

1061
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,720
Well, now, Mr. Hilliard may be right.

1062
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,060
We may have saved the world.

1063
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,700
Do you think we did the right thing?

1064
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,260
Well, I think it's time to say goodbye.

1065
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:44,460
This is the end.

1066
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,760
We'll be back next week, right?

1067
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,400
You said a mouth-busting evidence show.

1068
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,400
Yeah.

1069
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,540
It's there.

1070
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,440
It's there.

1071
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:52,840
Anyone?

1072
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:53,220
Yeah.

1073
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,860
Before and then,

1074
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,740
it's gonna be anyone.

1075
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,820
You thought we were gone.

1076
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,060
You thought we were out of here.

1077
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,200
We're still here.

1078
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:03,880
We're still here.

1079
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,140
The microphone's still on.

1080
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:05,760
It's still on.

1081
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:06,080
Yippee!

1082
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,620
It never backtraced.

1083
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,180
See, we scared the, oh yeah.

1084
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,540
You thought we were gone?

1085
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:11,920
He was done.

1086
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:12,440
We were gone.

1087
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,380
Oh, it's me. I'm twisting in the wind.

1088
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,400
Oh, no, they left me.

1089
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,180
Hanging here like a ghost on a hangman's noose.

1090
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,680
Hanging by the telephone cord.

1091
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,680
Just fizzling out.

1092
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:40,220
I want to get up with you.

1093
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:40,300
Yeah.

1094
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,780
Cause every day hurts a little more.

1095
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,080
And every day hurts a little more.

1096
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,580
I want to get up.

1097
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,340
I want to get up with you.

1098
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,680
Next time, I'm going to get off.

1099
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,040
I'm going to get off.

1100
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:14,000
I'm going to get off.

1101
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,000


1102
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:19,780
Yes, friends, next time we will all get off.

1103
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:24,560
14X Day will be from June 29th to July 5th, 2011

1104
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,540
at Wisteria Campground in Southern Ohio.

1105
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,800
Wisteria.org.

1106
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:34,120
And now that the show has gone over an hour

1107
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,200
for our internet listeners only,

1108
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,480
because this stuff is just too subgenius.

1109
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,380
For broadcast, we present some extras from X Day,

1110
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,760
which will include a ripping jam

1111
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,800
by Six-Fisted Tales of Connie

1112
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,940
and a rant and song from the band we call

1113
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,940
Monkey Hive.

1114
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,660
Praise Bob.

1115
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:03,120
Priestess Pisces, we've weathered another one.

1116
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,380
Where's Modemac?

1117
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,480
What are you guys lurking about?

1118
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,960
Oh, he's texting Bob.

1119
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:14,520
Modemac and Pisces gave a lot of slack for this thing.

1120
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,700
I mean, a lot of people did.

1121
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,740
One person who didn't was Dr. Philo Drummond,

1122
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:24,460
because he is closer to Bob than any other person.

1123
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:28,380
And you'll notice that you did not see this man working, toiling.

1124
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,580
Thank you for that.

1125
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,220
So anyway, friends, the ultimate rewardian,

1126
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,140
if you are a rewardian and want to succeed

1127
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:40,200
and wallow in slack while watching everybody else,

1128
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,320
learn to be like Dr. Drummond.

1129
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,300
If you are an emergentile and actually get off

1130
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,920
on driving yourself to a frenzy,

1131
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,660
then be like me.

1132
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,320
I notice you're the one that got up later all those years

1133
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,140
than I was the one that got up closer to seven.

1134
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,500
Actually, Dr. Drummond infiltrated the conspiracy

1135
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,280
to a much deeper level than I did.

1136
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,260
I'm still, you know, somebody's got to be there

1137
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:10,180
on the inside of the conspiracy.

1138
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:10,180


1139
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:10,180


1140
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:10,360
And he's got to be there on the outside,

1141
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,740
so we know who the moles are.

1142
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,120
We gotta keep up with all those moles.

1143
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,600
Well, you just recently retired from running

1144
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,800
the entire phone company of the world, right?

1145
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:23,800
Pretty much.

1146
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,980
Well, I'm almost out.

1147
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:28,020
I'm still, they still got their hooks in me a little bit.

1148
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,260
But I'm working on that.

1149
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:33,560
Well, so see, maybe I am the slack master.

1150
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,500
I only have to get up at seven once a year.

1151
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:40,040
But I'm tired of even that!

1152
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,380
I don't even want to get up at seven again one more year!

1153
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:47,860
But we'll probably be back here waiting again next year.

1154
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,900
Never let it be said that the subgeniuses were quitters

1155
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,040
like Sarah Palin. No, sir.

1156
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,820
We never quit.

1157
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,480
Even when we know better.

1158
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,380
Even when you've whacked out that last load

1159
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:04,560
and you know there's not another drop of fluid in your body,

1160
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,200
you still won't quit wanking.

1161
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,660
You still got an arm, don't you?

1162
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,600
That's right.

1163
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:09,980
You still got an arm.

1164
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,100
If you have an arm, borrow one.

1165
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,540
We're like that old limp dick.

1166
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,640
It can't be beat.

1167
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:19,000
That's the church of the subgenius, friends.

1168
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:23,260
It's like a pet you can fuck.

1169
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:24,540


1170
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:27,940
Onan said that.

1171
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,480
He said the church of the subgenius.

1172
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,880
It's like having a pet you can fuck.

1173
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,560
Although right now it kind of feels like

1174
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,860
it's like the other way around right now, it seems.

1175
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:44,340
It's having a pet that you don't mind if it fucks you.

1176
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,140
Right. Yeah, that's better.

1177
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,140
The church of the subgenius.

1178
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,400
It's like having a pet that you don't mind if it fucks you.

1179
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:54,080
That's a little more accurate, actually.

1180
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:17,220
I guess they've got these two gro ethical.

1181
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,560
I don't think any of you should be

1182
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:20,640
seeing him now.

1183
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,940
Don't expect Jack.

1184
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:21,940


1185
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:21,940


1186
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:22,740
and all these baby-ish하

1187
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:23,400
put together to be one of the only

1188
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:23,400


1189
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,120
But if it's осв자기N

1190
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,840
and a little concerned about

1191
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:26,840


1192
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:38,860
anrad chantgo

1193
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:43,700
Screwed in the end

1194
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,820
Bob fucked us again

1195
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,500
Every single year

1196
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:57,720
I get older and I shed some more tears

1197
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,480
But

1198
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:01,060
Screwed in the end

1199
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,340
Bob fucked us again

1200
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,960
Screwed in the end

1201
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,100
Bob fucked us again

1202
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,340
I was promised something

1203
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,300
And I think that you were too

1204
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,600
And I'm starting to notice something

1205
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,260
It hasn't happened to either of us

1206
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,880
And I gotta tell you something

1207
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,100
I'm getting mighty, mighty impatient with this

1208
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:31,580
Bob

1209
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,320
Screwed in the end

1210
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:40,000
Bob fucked us again

1211
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,260
Screwed in the end

1212
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,880
Really, Bob? I mean, really?

1213
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:53,540
It's just some saucers from the sky

1214
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,640
I mean, you're a human of this

1215
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,100
Omnipotent kind of guy

1216
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,320
And it really should be just so

1217
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:03,240
So easy for you to

1218
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,320
Make them come out of the sky

1219
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,200
The sky is so blue, but

1220
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:09,880
Screwed in the end

1221
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,880
Bob fucked us again

1222
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:18,440
Screwed in the end

1223
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,260
He fucked us again

1224
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:43,960
Screwed in the end

1225
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,960
Bob fucked us again

1226
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:47,960


1227
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:47,960


1228
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:47,960


1229
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:47,960


1230
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,720
Screwed in the end

1231
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,740
Screwed in the end

1232
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:50,740


1233
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:53,140
I don't know about you, but really?

1234
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,240
Bob, you're kind of an elite shoe sloob

1235
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,260
But your name's Bob

1236
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:08,260


1237
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,200
I am

1238
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,180
Just a silly站 Tin

1239
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:12,420
Hey, wait!

1240
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:12,420


1241
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:16,040
Now I'm trying tofriend you

1242
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,860
They're still young

1243
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:19,100
They never watch the movie

1244
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,120
Everything is fucking footage

1245
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:26,080
What was the end of it sound like?

1246
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,360
President Movies

1247
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,680
I read them Mlik

1248
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,340
Intellectual evangelicals.

1249
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,180
Yeah, thank you.

1250
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,360
Hoping to save the human race from extinction

1251
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,480
by enslaving them for menial labor experimentation.

1252
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,680
Human sacrifice and sexual exploitation.

1253
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,860
The militant holocaustals.

1254
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,200
Striving to completely snuff out the moronic masses of pink pestilence.

1255
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,760
And virtually every other clenching schism

1256
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:52,240
branching haphazardly off the backs and carcasses of Bob's conquest.

1257
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:02,640
See, this pit has become so wide and so full

1258
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,340
that nobody can seem to see the other side of it.

1259
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:08,620
Friends!

1260
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,120
We stand here

1261
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:16,480
before you, having stared into the abyss of our twisted souls.

1262
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,100
And we have seen the true face of terror.

1263
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:23,820
Who is that face?

1264
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,840
Who is that face?

1265
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,040
Who is that face?

1266
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:33,220
That's right, friends.

1267
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:34,780
It is Bob.

1268
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,480
Yes, it's Bob!

1269
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:38,680
Hey, Bob!

1270
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:41,560
Friends, I must tell you I wouldn't give two shits

1271
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:44,060
for what happens to this planet or the pink masses.

1272
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,680
As a founding member of the AOTFC,

1273
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,760
I am here to remind you that we are all gathered at these sacred grounds

1274
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,520
for the same damn reason.

1275
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,400
No matter what opinions we hold,

1276
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:56,480
the divine pronouncement of Dobbs proclaims

1277
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,420
we will be on the exorcist ships getting our eternal freak on

1278
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:02,160
with the evil sex goddesses on their journey to hell and ice.

1279
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:05,360
So long as we have our senses about us, what is it?

1280
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,660
I know you know them, let's hear it!

1281
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:10,580
Common sense, sense of humor, and dollars and cents!

1282
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,480
Bob's seen my green, so I got nothing to worry about.

1283
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:15,340
I'm in his...

1284
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:17,480
He's in my corner, because I'm in his pocket.

1285
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:21,500
Why should I care about the infighting, rivalry, and fumes?

1286
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:21,500


1287
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,580
I'm in the middle of a meeting with him in the church.

1288
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,140
Fuck the pinks!

1289
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:27,920
Leave them alone, or kill them all!

1290
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:30,820
It just doesn't matter!

1291
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,820
At this point, we're all nothing more than performing monkeys here

1292
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:38,720
to tickle the twisted funny bone of the creatures of the carbon cosmos.

1293
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:44,860
Bob sold it, we smoked it, and that settles it.

1294
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:49,400
As you see,

1295
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,120
we're so busy fighting over whose vision sounds better,

1296
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,400
y'all seem to forget the best part in all this.

1297
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,900
Sex with aliens.

1298
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:04,800
Oh yeah, baby!

1299
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,700
See, we're gonna be living it up,

1300
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,340
way up in the motherfucking motherships,

1301
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:15,720
getting our fancies tickled by the most exotic extraterrestrial intersexuals this galaxy has ever known.

1302
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,060
So y'all keep your opinions.

1303
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:21,480
Y'all keep your hate.

1304
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:25,000
I know where I'm gonna be come the morning of the fifth.

1305
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,520
Oh, it's gonna be one hell of a sight, folks.

1306
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:31,560
Don't you see what I see?

1307
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:38,380
From our world beyond our dreams

1308
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:45,180
Visitors from some distant shore

1309
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,400
Sleep and run.

1310
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:53,400
And the vision

1311
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:56,060
Day and night

1312
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:57,260
Burn

1313
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:00,720
And scream

1314
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,920
Oh, I'll get it

1315
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,560
Build the pizza away

1316
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,320
Reach the trees and darken

1317
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:18,920
The lines of smoke

1318
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:19,040
And the lights of smoke

1319
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,900
Soaring high

1320
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:27,640
No where for them to run to anymore

1321
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:34,300
Watch the group build annihilation

1322
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:40,000
We'll be hell to pay

1323
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:46,260
Maybe Red Horizon

1324
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,560
we'll be Illumina

1325
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:50,920
Our

1326
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,460
parents

1327
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:54,180
they shall travel

1328
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:54,620
Not to Come

1329
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:58,900
find us

1330
01:09:58,900 --> 01:09:59,180
We'll stay

1331
01:09:59,180 --> 01:09:59,660
here

1332
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:00,040
no matter

1333
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:00,300
our

1334
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:00,300


1335
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:00,300


1336
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:06,560
Thank you.

1337
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:35,780
Thank you.

1338
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:09,020
Thank you.

1339
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,360
Thank you.

1340
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,320
Thank you.

1341
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,200
Goodbye.

1342
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:34,620
See ya.

1343
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:36,960
Wouldn't wanna be ya.

1344
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:37,980
Alright.

1345
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:40,460
Enough of this silly shit.

1346
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,720
Kill the fucking shit.

1347
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:46,980
Stop.
